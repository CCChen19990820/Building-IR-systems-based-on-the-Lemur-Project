<Title>Grade 1 "Being a Scientist" lesson</Title>
<H1>What Is Liquid?</H1>

<H2>Thematic Emphasis:</H2>
STABILITY<BR>
Sub-Theme:  Scale and Structure<P><P>

<H2>Science Concepts:</H2>
Everything in our world is made of matter.<BR>
Matter may be in the form of a solid, liquid or gas.<BR>
Liquids change their shape by flowing.<BR>
We can measure the volume of a liquid.<BR>
Water, which is necessary for life, is the most plentiful 
   liquid on earth.<P><P>


<H2>Scientific Thinking Processes:</H2>
Observing   Comparing   Communicating   Inferring   Relating<P><P>




    <H2>Vocabulary:</H2>  
flow   volume   cup   pint   quart   more   less<P><P>




<H2>Key Question:</H2>
WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIQUIDS?<P><P>


<H2>Management Suggestions:</H2>
Working with liquids invites spills.  Taking the children outdoors for the measuring procedures is less stressful for the teacher and allows the children to explore the materials more freely.  If you are having the children work outdoors, set up the work areas close together so that the children will be able to hear your directions and respond easily to the "stop" signal.  If inclement weather makes outdoor activity impossible, covering the children's work areas with several layers of newspapers will prevent most problems.  Large plastic dishpans are better for indoor exploration as they are a bit more stable than buckets.  Large containers of water are heavy and awkward.  Put the empty buckets or dishpans in place and then have the children fill them.  A hose works well outdoors if there is a faucet nearby.<P><P>


<H2>Time Allotment:</H2>
When spreading the exploration out over several days, review and update the chart at the beginning of each session to focus the group.  Singing the song provides a good closure activity.<P>
Reviewing and accessing background information:  10 minutes<BR>
Introducing the second verse of  the song, Matter Matters:  20 minutes<BR>
Introducing cups, pints and quarts:  20 minutes<BR>
Free exploration of liquid measures:  30 minutes<BR>
Directed exploration of liquid measures:  30 minutes<BR>
Recording in SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK:  20 minutes<BR>
Discussion:  10 minutes<BR>
Reading the student text:  10 minutes<P><P>


<H2>Procedure:</H2>
<H3>1.  REVIEWING AND ACCESSING BACKGROUND INFORMATION</H3>
Have the children seated on the rug wearing their HAND LENSES.  Briefly review the <B>Matter</B> chart and the <B>Learning About Matter</B> bulletin board developed during the introductory activities for this unit.  Remind the children that <B>matter</B> is the name scientists give to everything on earth and that matter can be found in the form of a <B>solid</B>, a <B>liquid</B> or a <B>gas</B>.  Write the word <B>Liquids</B> at the top of the large piece of chart paper.  Read the word aloud and point out that it is the same word that is on the <B>Matter</B> chart and the bulletin board.  Divide the chart into three sections.  In the first section write, <B>Liquid Things</B>.  Write <B>We Know...</B> in the second section, and <B>We Wonder...</B> in the third section.  Read the headings on the chart aloud and say, <B><I>"In this exploration we are going to be working with liquids.  What do you already know about liquids?"</I></B>  Record the children's responses in the appropriate sections of the chart.  When someone mentions that liquids can be poured, introduce the word <B>flow</B>.  If the children are only mentioning examples of liquids, extend the discussion by asking, <B><I>"What do we do with liquids?  How are they different from solids?"</I></B><P><P>
<H3>2.  INTRODUCING THE SECOND VERSE OF THE SONG,  MATTER  MATTERS</H3>
Use the sentence strips and pictures in the pocket chart to review the first verse of the song.  Then use scissors to remove the word <B>solid</B> from the first two lines and replace it with the word <B>liquid.</B>  Read aloud the first four lines of the verse, calling the children's attention to the fact that the only thing that has changed is the word liquid.  Then replace the next two lines, so the verse reads as follows:<P>

<B><I>What is liquid?
What is liquid?
     Do you know?
     Do you know?
Rain that falls is liquid.
Juice I drink is liquid.
     Yes, it's so!
     Yes, it's so!</I></B><P>

Sweep your hand under the words as you say all the words aloud.  Show the children the pictures of the rain and juice, (RESOURCE MASTER #3) and place them in the chart at the appropriate lines.  Have the children repeat the words to the song one line at a time.  Then have the children sing the song several times.  (Turn the word cards and sentence strips you have removed so the blank side is toward the children and slip them into an empty place at the bottom of the chart so the first verse of the song can be reconstructed.)<P><P>

<H3>3.  INTRODUCING CUPS, PINTS AND QUARTS</H3>
Have the children seated on the rug wearing their HAND LENSES.  Show them the plastic quart-sized container.  Point out the markings on the side and introduce the words <B>cup</B>, <B>pint</B> and <B>quart</B>.  Tell the children that these are some of the tools we use to measure liquids.  Explain that since liquids <B>flow</B>, we can't measure their size or length, so we have to find a way to measure how much of the liquid is inside of whatever container we are using.  Say, <B><I>"We use the word volume to tell how much space something is taking up.  We use cups, pints and quarts to measure volume just as we use inches to measure length."</I></B>  Encourage the children to tell where they have seen these measuring tools and to share what they know about them.  Show the children the empty milk cartons, margarine tubs and other empty containers.  Point out the words pint and quart on a couple of the labels.<P><P>

<H3>4.  FREE EXPLORATION OF LIQUID MEASURES</H3>
Tell the children that they are going to work with their team to find out more about liquids.  Explain that water is the liquid we have the most of on earth, so its a good liquid for us to work with.  Say, "As you work with your team, see if you notice new things about the water.  Maybe your team will have new questions, too.  When we come back to the rug we'll talk about what we did and see if we want to make some new entries on our Liquids chart."  Briefly set standards for the exploration, i.e., staying with your own group, remembering to use scientist's behaviors, trying not to spill the water on yourself or anyone else.<P>

During the free exploration the teacher should move among the teams, observing and listening.  Some teachers wish to make notes about the way specific children are interacting.  Also notice comments that indicate depth of understanding or careful observation.  Reinforce these by calling attention to them and giving specific examples during the discussion that follows, but not now.  Resist the impulse to interrupt unnecessarily or "teach" at this time.  Allow the children to interact freely with the material and with each other.  Providing ample opportunities for free exploration whenever new materials are introduced will enable the children to focus on the instruction that occurs during directed activities.<P>

Stop the activity before the children's attention and interest begin to wane.  Gather the group back on the rug and add any new comments and questions to the chart.<P><P>

<H3>5.  DIRECTED EXPLORATION OF LIQUID MEASURES</H3>
Tell the children that they are going to work with their teams to find out more about measuring the volume of liquids.  Clarify that we can see liquids, and we can touch them, but that when we measure them we have to think about the kinds of containers they are in.  Tell the children that all the teams will use the same containers at the same time so we can talk about the exploration together.  Dismiss the children to their work areas and give the "stop signal."<P>

Remind the children to look for the numeral on their name tags and say, <B><I>"First we will measure with the cup.  If you have a #1 on your name tag, you will fill the cup carefully and put it down where everyone in your team can see it.  Everyone on the team needs to help by being sure there is a full cup of water in the container.  Now, Child #2 should take the ruler and measure how high the water comes in the cup.  Next, Child #3 will very carefully pour the water from the cup into the large container with the marks on the side and put it down where everyone in your team can see it.  Did one cup of water fill this big container?  Does the water come to the line where it says cup?  Now Child #4 should take the ruler and measure how high the water comes in this big container.  Is it the same as it was when the water was in the cup?  Did the water change its shape and size?  Did it change it's volume?"</I></B><P>

Designate another child from each team to fill a pint container and repeat the process.  Repeat it again using a quart container.  Call new numbers each time so that all the children will have opportunities to pour water and measure with the ruler.  Use the terms more and less in comparing the volume of water measured by the various containers.  Count to see how many cups it takes to make a pint and how many it takes to make a quart.<P><P>

<H3>6.  RECORDING IN THE SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK</H3>
Show the children a copy of EXPLORATION REPORT #3.  Model writing name and date, and then read the text at the top of the page aloud.  Explain that they are to make a picture that shows how their team explored measuring the volume of liquids by pouring them from one container to another.  Have a variety of writing and drawing materials available, i.e., pencils, colored pencils, marking pens, crayons, and let the children choose.<P>
When someone is finished, give the "stop" signal.  Help that child get his/her <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK</B> and model putting in the new paper.  Explain that as the children complete their work, they should put their paper in their <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS</B> and then read the <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK</B> or another book from the science lab until everyone is finished.<P><P>

<H3>7.  DISCUSSION</H3>
Shuffle four large pieces of tag board on which the numerals 1 - 4 have been written and then choose a card at random.  Direct the children from each group who have that numeral on their name tags to bring their <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS</B> to the group.  Have the other children put their <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS</B> away and come also.  Have the children who have their <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS</B> take turns sitting in the <B>Scientist's Chair</B> and sharing their completed EXPLORATION REPORT #3 with the group.  Call on one or two children to tell something they especially liked about each report.  Use this sharing period to lead into a discussion of the exploration of liquids.  Update the Liquids chart during the discussion.<P>
<B>Discussion Questions:</B><P>
Some possible content questions might be:<BR>
	<B><I>What is your favorite liquid to drink?<BR>
	How do we know liquids can change their shape?<BR>
	What are some measuring tools we use to measure the volume 
	   of liquids?<BR>
	What part of this exploration did you like best?<BR>
	What is the earth's most plentiful liquid?<BR>
	Why is water important to us?<P>
Some questions to help children assess how they worked together might be:<BR>
	How did you help your team?<BR>
	How did someone on your team help you?<BR>
	What did you learn that will help your team work better next time?<BR>
	What did you learn from the EXPLORATION REPORTS that were
	    shared?<P><P></I></B>

<H3>8.  READING THE STUDENT TEXT</H3>
Review the second verse of the song, <B>Matter Matters</B>, using the pocket chart.  Then help the children find the first verse of the song in the student text section of the <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK</B>.<P>  
Read the words aloud, having the children who wish to do so join in.  Have the children look at the words as they sing the song together.  Then turn back to the beginning of the song and sing both verses that the children have learned.  Be sure to compliment them on how well they are learning to read.<P><P>


<H2>Further Exploration:</H2>
Repeat the exploration with each group having liquid measuring containers of different shapes, i.e., an eight ounce plastic glass instead of a cup.<P>

Collect a variety of containers that hold the same amount, i.e., one pint, but which are different shapes, such as plastic bottles which originally contained shampoo, liquid detergent, etc.  Have the children repeat explorations which help them see that liquids can change their shape without changing their volume.<P><P>


<H2>Evaluation:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>  Did all the children participate in the activities?<BR>
<LI>  Were all the teams able to successfully carry out their tasks?<BR>
<LI>  Did most of the children successfully complete the EXPLORATION 
    REPORT?<BR>
<LI>  Can all of the children name several liquids?<BR>
<LI>  Can most of the children identify flowing as a characteristic of liquids?<BR>
<LI>    Can most of the children name at least one standard measure which is used
     for liquids, i.e., cup, pint, quart?<P><P>


<H2>Variations/Extensions:</H2>
If your classroom has a sink, convert it into a water exploration center where the children can use a variety of containers to measure water as an independent or small group activity.  If there is no sink area, or if  it is too high for the children to use comfortably, put several layers of newspaper in an out-of-the-way corner.  Placing a large container of water in a sand table or outdoors in a sand pile is another option.<P><P>


<H2>Home-School Activities:</H2>
Encourage the children to take their <B>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS</B> home and discuss EXPLORATION REPORT #3 with their parents.  Challenge them to find a container that is used for measuring liquid somewhere at home and make a picture of it or bring the container to school to share. Be sure to allow time in the Scientist's Chair for children to share their pictures and containers.  Have them tell where the containers were found and how they are used.  Add their pictures to the <B>Using Science Tools at Home</B> bulletin board.<P><P>

<Title>Testing Rocks - Second Grade</Title>
<H1>ROCK HOUNDS</H1>

<H2>Thematic Emphasis:</H2>
SCALE AND STRUCTURE<P><P>


<H2>Science Concepts:</H2>
Rocks have distinguishing characteristics.<BR>
Rocks vary in hardness.<P><P>


<H2>Scientific Thinking Processes:</H2>
Observing   Comparing   Communicating   Ordering<P><P>




   <H2>Vocabulary: </H2>
rock  appearance  weight (gram)  hardness 
		characteristics<P><P>


<H2>Key Question: </H2>
WHAT ARE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF ROCKS?<P><P>


<H2>Time Allotment:</H2>
<B>DAY 1</B><BR>
Introduction:  5 minutes<BR>
Creating a Graphic Organizer:  10 minutes<BR>
Sorting by Characteristics: 30 minutes<BR>
Read Aloud: 15 minutes<BR>
<B>DAY 2</B>
Circle Sharing/Pair Share:  15 minutes<BR>
Testing Our Rock Characteristics: 45 minutes<BR>
Class Discussion/STUDENT TEXT:  20 minutes<P><P>


<H2>Management Suggestions:</H2>
If you are worried that the rocks the students bring will get mixed up, mark each one with a small dot of white correction fluid. When it's dry, you can write the student's initial on the dot.<P><P>

<H2>Procedure:</H2>
<H3>1. INTRODUCTION / STUDENT TEXT</H3>
Have the students put their hand lens around their necks. Remind them that the lens is a tool and a symbol. They are now scientists.<P>
Hold up and show the students some of the rocks that you have brought in to share with them. Say, <B><I>"Most deserts have lots of rocks. Besides small rocks like these, you can find large rock formations in the desert, such as mesas and buttes. There are also tiny rock parts called sand in the desert. Rocks that have been ground down by wind and water make up the sand, and there is a lot of sand in the desert."</I></B><P>
Say, <B><I>"The crust of the Earth is made of rock. The rocks of Earth come in a variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and textures. Some rocks are as soft as chalk, and some are as hard as diamonds. Rocks can be as small as a grain of sand or as tall as a 100-story building. Let's find out more about rocks."<P>
"Turn to pages 46-47 in your STUDENT TEXT. This will tell us more about deserts and rocks."</I></B> Read the pages orally and discuss briefly with the class. Keep it short. Students will learn more from the hands-on activities. These pages can be available for reference.<P><P>


<H3>2. CREATING A GRAPHIC ORGANIZER</H3>
Make a <B>mindmap</B> for the word, ROCK. Ask the students to brainstorm all the words they can that describe rocks. Use the rocks in the baggies to trigger new words when they get stumped. Clarify some of the more difficult words and help them understand the differences between words that are close in meaning such as sparkle and shiny. Post the <B>mindmap</B> in a easily visible place. <P>
Students may need more work with vocabulary before the sorting activity. Use the rocks on hand to teach additional vocabulary. Then have the class work together, or in teams, to make a Rock Chant.<P>
<PRE><B>
ROCKS

Rocks here, rocks there,
Rocks, rocks everywhere.
(adj.)		rocks 	(ing form of a verb)
			rocks
			rocks
			rocks
Rocks  (prepositional phrase)
Rocks
Rocks
Rocks
				
Rocks here, rocks there,
Rocks, rocks everywhere!

ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS!
Authors:
</B></PRE><P><P>

<H3>3. SORTING ROCKS</H3>
Divide the students into Research Teams of 3-4 students. If you are working with multilingual student groups, group like languages together to allow discussion of concepts in the primary language.<P> 
Have them gather together in a work area and then give them a baggie with eight assorted rocks inside and a 12"X18" construction paper workmat. Have them work as a team to sort the rocks according to characteristics and place the appropriate rocks on the workmat. From the NOTE list, only use characteristics which fit the rocks the students have. Ask teams to work together to place rocks onto their workmat that are shiny. Once they have done that, pick another characteristic and have them follow the same procedure. Make it more complicated by having them place only rocks that have two characteristics, such as <B>shiny and smooth</B>, on their workmat.<P>
To finish this activity, ask each team to sort their rocks according to one of the characteristics discussed. For example: shiny -- not shiny. <B><I>Fold the workmat in half. Sort the rocks, but don't let any other team know your characteristic. Put an index card under the workmat with your words. You may refer to our mindmap and page 47 in your STUDENT TEXT for ideas</I></B>. When this is completed, have the teams try to guess the other team's sorting criteria. This is an exciting activity, as well as an assessment. It will be very clear which groups understand the vocabulary and are able to categorize.<P>
Allow time for groups to circulate and discuss (10-15 min.).<P><P>

<H3>4. READ ALOUD</H3>
Gather students close to you and read <B>Everybody Needs a Rock</B>, by Byrd Baylor. Re-read the book and, with students' help, make a chart listing her 10 Rules for choosing a rock. Have students copy the list onto writing paper. Assign each student to bring in a rock. Have them take home the checklist from the book so they can follow the rules as they pick their rock. <P><P>

<H3>5. CIRCLE SHARING / PAIR SHARE</H3>
After students bring in their rocks, they will be anxious to share them. Take a small group of volunteers (5-6). Have them sit in a circle to model the activity. On your signal, have students pass their rock to the person on their left, who examines it with his/her HAND LENS. Have students continue to pass rocks, on your signal, until everyone has their own rock back. Now that the children know what to do, put them in several small circles and repeat the procedure.<P>
Pair-Share: Take a minute for students to discuss their rocks.<P><P>
	
<H3>6. TESTING OUR ROCK CHARACTERISTICS</H3>
Have the <B>Research Teams</B> meet again in their work area. Have team members bring their rocks. Have them number off their rocks from one to four to keep them from being mixed up on the <B>Exploration Report #18, Characteristics of Our Rocks</B>. Remind them to bring use their HAND LENSES! Model Test One: Appearance for your students. Then have all the teams do Test One on their set of four rocks and record their results on the exploration report. Follow the same procedure for Test Two: Color, and so on. <P>

<B>Test One:</B><I> Appearance:</I> Have students describe, writing at least two describing words, each rock's appearance (shape, size, texture). Have them refer to <B>mindmap</B> for vocabulary words.<P>

<B>Test Two:</B> <I>Color:</I> Have students observe each rock's color when it is dry. Have them write the color on their exploration report. Then have them put one rock at a time into a small glass with enough water to cover the rock. Have them observe the wet color of each rock. Have them write the color of the wet rock on the exploration report. Ask them if they have ever found a beautiful rock in a stream or at the ocean only to take it home and have it lose some of its beautiful color. Rocks often look different when they are wet instead of dry.<P>

<B>Test Three:</B><I> Weight:</I> Have the teams weigh each rock on a kitchen scale in grams. Have students record each rock's weight. <P>

<B>Test Four:</B><I> Hardness.</I> Have students give each of their rocks a scratch test to determine its hardness. Diamonds are hard; chalk is soft. Rocks can be tested for hardness by the scratch method. Rocks that can be scratched by a fingernail are considered <B>very soft</B>. Rocks that can be scratched by a penny are considered <B>soft</B>. Rocks that can be scratched with a nail are <B>medium hard.</B> Rocks which are not scratched by the steel nail are considered <B>hard.</B> Have the team try to scratch rock number one first with their fingernail. <P>

<B><I>If your rock  can be scratched by a fingernail, write very soft in the box for rock one. If the fingernail did not scratch the rock, try the penny. If the penny makes a scratch, write soft. If there is still not a scratch mark, try the steel nail. If it leaves a scratch, record hard. If there is not a scratch, record very hard.</I></B> Since it can be confusing, write the following chart on the chalkboard for the students to use as a reference:<P>
<PRE>
HARDNESS TEST
scale                        scratched by
very soft	             fingernail
soft	                     penny
medium hard	             steel nail
hard	                     none of the above
</PRE><P>
</B>

To finish this activity, give the students an opportunity to share what they discovered about their rocks with the total group or with one of the other <B>Research Teams.</B><P><P>

	
<H2>CLASS DISCUSSION/STUDENT TEXT:</H2>
	<B><I>What are rocks? <BR>
	What are some distinguishing characteristics of  rocks?<BR>
	How did you pick your rock?<BR>
	What are the characteristics of your rock?<BR>
	Do you think you would like to be a rock hound and 
	find more rocks? </I></B><P>

A rock hound is a person who searches for and collects rocks. Reinforce this unit's concept by having students reread and discuss pps. 46 & 47 in their STUDENT TEXT.<P><P>


<H2>Further Explorations:</H2>
Have students play a game in partners, using a variety of rocks, a balance scale, and a spinner board labeled MORE and LESS. Have one child pick a rock and have the other child spin the spinner. If the spinner lands on MORE, have the student try to pick a rock he/she thinks weighs more than their partner's rock. To test the rocks, have both students put their rocks on either side of the balance scale to see if the chosen rock is lighter (LESS) or heavier (MORE). Have the students take turns.<P><P>

		
<H2>Evaluation:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Did the students bring in rocks?<BR>
<LI>Were students able to sort rocks according to categories given?<BR>
<LI>Were students able to categorize their own set of rocks?<BR>
<LI>Can the students describe at least three characteristics of their rock?<BR>
<LI>Can each student explain the hardness test as it applies to their rock?<BR>
<LI>Did the students make interactive glossary pages for vocabulary?
</UL><P><P>


<H2>Variations/Extensions:</H2>
Talk about the two ways rocks are formed and bring in examples of each of the two types of rocks to show to the students.  Tell them how each kind of rock is formed as you show it to them.  Use the information below to help you.<P>

<B><I>TYPE</I><BR>
1. IGNEOUS<BR>
2. SEDIMENTARY</B><P>

<I>HOW IT IS FORMED</I><BR>
1. It is created when the lava flowing out of a volcano cools from a liquid 
	to a solid rock.<BR>
2. It is created when layers of sand, mud, or minerals settle to the bottom 
	of oceans or lakes and are pressed together for thousands of years.<P>

<B><I>EXAMPLES</I><BR>
1. granite, quartz, obsidian<BR>
2. chalk, coal, limestone, sandstone</B><P>

A concept of rock formation standard to previous geology texts, METAMORPHIC, is actually now understood as a process. Today, METAMORPHIC is no longer called a type of rock. It is created when igneous and sedimentary rocks undergo a change due to extreme pressure or heat deep inside the earth. <P>
	Examples of the METAMORPHIC process are: slate, marble, schist<P><P>


<H2>Home-School Activity: </H2>
Have students start a rock collection. Suggest that they use an egg carton and find a different rock for each of the compartments. Have them share their collections with the class using the Scientist's Chair.<P>

<Title>Grade 3 Energy/Physical Science</Title>

<H1>FROM BREAD TO TOAST</H1>

<H2>Thematic Emphasis:</H2>
<B>ENERGY</B><P>

The following sample lesson was chosen primarily because most elementary teachers are fearful of having to teach a hands-on science involving Energy and Physical Science.<P><P>

<B><I>NOTE: </I></B><BR>
<I>This exploration is more meaningful to the students if done from beginning to end. If that is not possible, stop after observing the white bread. Collect the bread slices and refrigerate. Be sure to label each slice to get it back to the original pair; otherwise, their information is inaccurate and the exploration is invalid.</I><P><P>

<H2>Science Concepts:</H2>
<OL>

<H2>Time Allotment:</H2>
	Introduction: 5 minutes<BR>
	Identifying types of changes: 5 minutes<BR>
	Observing the white bread: 15 - 20 minutes<BR>
	Comparing weights - Bread vs. Toast: 5 minutes.<BR>
	Toasting the bread and recording changes: 20 minutes<BR>
	Compiling group data: 5 minutes<BR>
	Completing Exploration Report: 10 minutes<BR>
	Glossary pages: 5 minutes<P><P>

<H2>Management Suggestions:</H2>
Let the students know ahead  of time that white bread is not as good for them as whole grain bread. We are using it for experimental purposes. It is easier to see color changes. Also, we will be handling the slice a lot which would make it unsanitary.<P><P>
	
<H2>Procedure:</H2>
<B>1. INTRODUCTION</B>
Draw the  GENERIC MASTER #17: World of Energy on the chalkboard or show the transparency. Have students give you their ideas of what is energy. This is meant to access background information. Accept all answers and write them on the board  beside the circle. <P>

Next introduce the term <B>"initial state"</B> saying, <B><I>"The term initial state is a scientific term that means what something is like before anything happens to it. You can remember the term initial by thinking of your initials."</I></B> Put a student's initials on the board. <B><I>"The initials state for the first letter of each name. Initial state stands for what something is like first . The word state is not like the state of California. It means what something looks like. Let's look at this piece of white bread.</I></B> (Show a slice of bread)<B><I> What color is it? How big is it? How heavy is it? Answering those questions will tell us about its state. What other properties can you think of?</I></B> Hopefully, they will think of attributes like soft, length, width, thickness. List these as well for the students to use as they describe their slice of bread in procedure #3.<P><P>

<B>2. IDENTIFYING TYPES OF CHANGES</B>
Ask students how things might  change when energy is present. Tell them that they are going to toast bread. What changes will they expect to see. You should get responses such as color, texture, flexibility. Add this information:<BR>
<B><I>"These basic types of changes are some that you might see when energy is present."</I></B> As you present this information, write the key word on the board.
position: <B><I>"You might see a change of position.</I></B> (Pretend to be a car. Move from one part of the room to another.) <B><I>The car's final state looks the same as its initial state, but it has changed position."</I></B><P>
<UL>
<LI> size: <B><I>"A balloon gets larger as you blow it up. It changes size. When you let it go, what happens? That's right. It flies around and gets smaller again. It has changed both size and position."</I></B><P>

<LI> shape: <B><I>"Think of the balloon again. As it is filled with air, it gets round and large. When you let it go, it  changes its shape."</I></B><P>

<LI> weight: <B><I>"Animals, plants, people grow. They increase in size and also weight."</I></B><P>

<LI> temperature: <B><I>"You turn on the heat in your home, and the temperature goes up. Turn on the air conditioning, and the temperature goes down."</I></B><P>

<LI> texture: <B><I>"Rub sand paper or a rough surface. You produce heat and change its texture."</I></B>
</UL><P><P>

<B>3.  OBSERVING WHITE BREAD</B>
<B><I>"To understand how energy affects the white bread, we need to clearly define its initial state. We need to look at its shape, weight, color, texture, and size. You will need to be very careful with your piece of bread and treat it like a scientist.  You do not want to tear it or damage it as you observe and record your information."</I></B><P>

Give each pair a slice of bread and two sheets of graph paper. Have them label one sheet <B>INITIAL STATE - BREAD</B> and the other, <B>FINAL STATE - TOAST</B>. Using the first paper, draw around the slice of bread. Have the pair count the  squares inside the outline. Count more than half squares  as wholes. Tell them that they are finding the area. Tell them next that they will be finding the perimeter of the bread. Have the pairs trace the outside of the bread with the string. Use the ruler to measure the string (perimeter of the bread). Make observations about its initial state, recording all measurements and following the topics that you have listed.  Circulate as the students work on this task. Call attention to scientific recording. <B><I>"I noticed that Tommy and Sean said that the temperature of the bread is  cool - less than room temperature. That's a good comparison."</I></B><P><P> 

<B>4. COMPARING WEIGHT</B> 
This is written as a teacher demonstration.  It saves time and materials. Stop the students and have them assemble so they can all see. Take two pieces of bread and put them on a balance scale to be sure that the weights are equal. Have the students observe that this is true. Ask, <B><I>"After I toast one piece, do you think that it will be heavier, lighter, or the same?"</I></B> Have the students respond and make a quick tally graph. Toast one of the pieces. As it is toasting ask the students to tell you what will happen to the scale if the toast is heavier? lighter? the same?<P>

<IMG SRC="talley.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=206> <P>

When the bread is toasted, put it back on the balance scale. It should be dramatically lighter. On the <B>"final state"</B> paper, have the student enter that the toast is lighter in weight. It loses moisture in the toasting process.<P><P>


<B>5. TOASTING THE BREAD AND RECORDING THE CHANGES</B><P>
<B><I>NOTE: </I></B><BR>
<I>This is best done in small groups  with the rest of the class involved in other activities.</I><P>

Using the toaster, toast the bread and return it to each pair. Direct the pair to do the same thing with the toast as was done with the bread. Trace around the toast on a piece of graph paper. Count the number of squares to find the area, using the same procedure as with the bread. Record the observations on size, color, texture, shape. Compare the data with the information recorded  about the slice of bread. What is the difference in size, color, texture, temperature, weight, flexibility? Record this information on the final state  paper.<P><P>

<B>6.  COMPILING GROUP DATA</B><P>
<B><I>NOTE:</I></B> 
<I>Do not worry if the students have not mastered this last concept, about energy.  It is the key concept for the entire unit and will be repeated  in a variety of ways throughout the explorations.</I><P>

To teach students the value of recording precise data, it is important to compare the data that the pairs have collected. Have pairs volunteer to give you their written information on each of the changes. As they give their information to you, record it on the chalkboard. At the end of the sharing period, students should be able to graphically see  a sample of good observations. Allow pairs  time to review what they have written and make additions they feel are needed.<P>
<IMG SRC="results.gif" WIDTH=424 HEIGHT=205> <P>
<P>



<B>7. COMPLETING EXPLORATION REPORT</B>
Do this as a directed lesson. The students have not used this form before, but they will use it often during this unit. Pass out GENERIC MASTER #17 to each student. Use the transparency and work with the students to fill this out carefully. Describe the initial state of the bread.  Enter information  about size, color, texture, temperature, etc. The next section gives space for the observation of change or the agent of change. In this case, the change cannot be observed since the bread is in the toaster. Describe the change agent. The toaster heats the bread. It is connected to the electrical outlet.  For the final state,  Be sure to include information of size, shape, weight, color, texture, temperature as well as a drawing of the  toast.<P>
Add this report to your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.<P><P>

<B>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</B><BR>
	How do you know a change has occurred?<BR>
	What types of changes occurred in bread to toast?<BR>
	What  caused the change from bread to toast?<BR>
	Can you give examples of other changes in size, shape, weight,	  		    temperature, position?<BR>
	Can you give other examples of things that are changed by heat
	    energy?<BR>
	What is meant by initial state? Final state?<P><P>

<B>8. MAKE GLOSSARY PAGES:</B> initial state and final state terms<P><P>

<B>Further Explorations:</B>
	The students need to have this  exploration repeated again and again with many different materials. It seems like the same exploration to the adult, but it feels like new knowledge to the students. It needs to be done using the same generic master over and over until the students tell you, <B><I>"But we did that before. It's the same as the bread to toast."</I></B> At that point, you know that they have the concept of a change in state  means that energy is present.<P>
	Make jello in class. Watch the change from granules to liquid to solid.<P>
	Freeze water. Weigh it first, and weigh again after it has become ice.<P>
	Pop popcorn. What is its initial state? final state? How did it change? Why?<P>
	Make pancakes. Watch the batter go from a liquid to a solid. <P><P>

<B>Evaluation:</B><P>
<B><I>NOTE:</I></B>
<I>The evaluation portion of each exploration is a good place to have the students create their interactive glossaries using the vocabulary words for the exploration.</I><BR> 

For ESL - Definitions can be written in the student's primary language<P>
<OL>
<LI> Can the students understand the term initial state?<BR>
<LI> Can the students give examples of final state?<BR>
<LI> Can students identify heat as the major cause of the change from bread to
	   toast?<BR>
<LI> Can students explain the differences between bread and toast according
	   to the characteristics of change identified in #2?<BR>
<LI>Do students understand that energy is present when  there is a change of
	   state?</OL><P><P> 

<B>Extensions/Variations:</B><P>
Find examples of changes. Use the GENERIC MASTER to record the initial state; describe the change, its probable cause, and its final state. Look for things in the classroom - your crayons, pencil, teacher's chalk, eraser, teacher's bell, playground swing.<P><P>

<B>Home-School Activity:</B> 
Do an energy dinner assessment. Use the Generic Master again to describe the initial state of the various foods. For example, if spaghetti is on the menu, describe the noodles before they are cooked. Describe their final state. The noodles were hard, inflexible, room temperature, 30 cm long. After boiling in water, the noodles were hot, flexible, 34 cm long, etc. <P>	
Do this for several days. Allow opportunities for students to share their findings and reports using the Scientist's Chair. Add these reports to the student's SCIENTIST NOTEBOOKS.<P>

<H2>Management Suggestions:  </H2>
Prior to the flight test phase, building the launch boxes, and allowing the bonding materials to bond might be a good idea. It would shorten dead time. <P>
For the flight testing, try to get help from some parents or older students. This will keep things moving. Even with the designed devices to control launch force, it is unlikely that the airplanes will all fly straight, or the same distance. Doing the flight test outdoors is recommended, with some space between teams. Also, providing parallel lanes for testing for the teams will simplify both management and increase test results reporting.<P><P>

<H3>Procedure:  </H3>
<B>1. INTRODUCTION</B><BR>
Say, <B><I>A good scientist always builds on known work. We will do that this week. Remember the Flight Force Diagram from the activities before the first exploration. During our first Exploration we tested the planes for distance along the flight path. During those tests, the same planes did not perform exactly the same for all testers. What do you think might have caused the differences?</I></B> Accept all answers. <P>

<B><I>You are working as excellent scientists. You are naming possible variables. Variables are the reasons why tests are not always the same. For this Exploration, we will control the amount of </I>thrust<I> (power applied to the throw). How do you think that we can do that?</I></B> List student ideas.<P>
<B><I>The next activity will be to create one means to control the amount of thrust applied. This will make it possible to get the plane to fly the same. The tests should be </I>repeatable<I>. The method used in this exploration is NOT the only method of controlling force applied to the plane, but it is a good example of how scientists test.</I></B><P>

<B>2.  BUILDING REPEATABILITY</B><BR>
Assign teams of four. Pass out ER-1, Flight Test. <B><I>Fill in the Exploration Report, just like you did for the first exploration. It will also go in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK. A scientist always lists all of the test conditions.</I></B><P>
<DT><IMG SRC="launchbx.gif">The RM-3 Launch Box - 4K</A> <P>
Pass out RM-3 shoe boxes, rubber bands, paper clips, tape, and scissors. For Students with Disabilities, it may be advisable to do the slot cutting for them. Draw the launch box design on the board as you instruct the students on its construction. Build the boxes.<P>
<I>The launch box will can provide a consistent thrust providing you pull the rubberband powered launch clip back straight the same distance every time.</I></B><P> 

<B>3. PREPARING FOR FLIGHT</B><BR>
<B><I>This Exploration will follow the previous Exploration, with the addition of controlling the variable of </I>thrust<I> (force). For our purposes, we will define successful as fly for distance ALONG SELECTED STRAIGHT LINE PATH only. Like scientists we are extending our tests in preparation for designing our own airplanes, just as Burt Rutan did. We need just a few identical tests to see if the plane will perform the same each time. </I></B><P>

<B><I>With the exception of the use of the launch box, this exploration will be exactly like the first flight test. We will even use the same planes. This is called controlling variables. A </I>variable<I> is something that can change. Using the launch box reduces the difference in throwing style and power seen in the first exploration. By making the thrust the same every time, we</I> control<I> it. It is no longer variable. It is the same.</I></B><P>

<B><I>To discover whether a given test result has meaning, scientists perform the same test a number of times and compare the results. For this Exploration, each team member will fly the four selected planes once each using the launch box. The launch box rubber band must be pulled back the same distance each time, and released the same way. Each team member will record the distance traveled by all team members."</I></B><P>
Place the following graphic on the board as an example. Do not put in the average example data at this time.<P>


<SIZE 3><ALIGN CENTER><B>Team A <P>

Mike		 8 ft.	 	 9 ft.			 9 ft.		 	 9 ft.<BR>
Jerry		 9 ft.		 8 ft.			10 ft.			12 ft.<BR>
Mary		 9 ft.		 9 ft.		  	 9 ft.			10 ft.<P>

Average	<P>	
</B>
</PRE>
As flight time approaches, assure the students with, <B><I>We are learning how to conduct and control a test, not who can follow the plane flight path best. A test that shows why one plane performs poorly compared to another is just one step toward having an excellent test and a better plane design and construction.  Increasing understanding will add to the fun.</I></B><P>

<B>4. FLIGHT TIME</B><BR>
The activity should be modeled for the students prior to sending them to their test areas. Have one or two teams come in front of the group, lay out the measuring tool, launch a couple airplanes, and measure the results. Ensure that the students understand that, for consistent results:<BR>
1. The launch boxes must be placed at the same position relative to the ground.<BR>
2. The angle relative to the ground must be the same.<BR>
3. The length of rubberband pull must be the same.<P>

Encourage students to carefully bring all of the necessary materials with them. Let the Teams set up their testing stations and conduct the  tests. Advise only when it is obvious that the students need help. There will be a lot of excitement about this event. An extra set of hands or two is helpful, but the students should be able to manage. <P>
Divide the group. Wide spread parallel lines, test tracks, will help. Poorly constructed planes could easily fly as much as eight (8) feet to the side, even though the thrust vector is being controlled. <P>
When the testing is completed, return to the classroom for analysis and discussion.<P>

<B>5. BACK ON THE GROUND</B><BR>
<B><I>Part of research and testing is always analysis. Like your previous Exploration, your Research Teams will do analysis. After measuring all distances, make the average calculations, and enter this information on the table. Verify your results with your team mates. SCIENTISTS DO NOT ERASE. If you find that an error was made in any of the information, carefully draw a line through it and enter the corrected information. Scientists always want to know the mistakes made before, so that they will not make them again.<P>
Was one type of plane more successful? Why do you think that is true? What was the average for each plane. I will use the Numbered Heads Together approach to get your responses.</I></B><P>

<B><I>What are your results? We will start with (number). </I></B>Get results from the teams. Some of the data will be useful for charting in math using several models. (This may be a week's worth of math data!)<P>

Have the teams report their averages for broad wing and narrow wing planes. As the teams report place the numbers in columns on the board. After the teams average data is complete, ask for indications of better than average performance by Broad Wing. By Narrow Wing. <B><I>Is there a trend?</I></B>  You probably will have one. <B><I>Did the launch box make a difference in distances from your reports on Exploration #1? </I></B>Take this part of the discussion as far as you are comfortable.<P>

<B><I>Log in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK a few words and maybe a drawing about your findings and what you think could be improved for the testing control. What have you learned about scientific testing from the first two Explorations?</I></B> Give students time to write. <P>

<B>5. WHAT DO THE WORDS MEAN</B><BR>
It is time to model in depth the use of the interactive glossary. While it was suggested for the first exploration, it was not modeled.<P>
Get out Interactive Glossary (GM-21) pages for each student. Each page provides space for two words. Write the vocabulary words (<B>Variable, Repeat, Control, and Thrust</B>) on the chalkboard. <P>
Say, <B><I>You have your Glossary Pages in front of you. I want you to write each of these vocabulary words in the space provided called Glossary Term. After you enter each word, you will draw what the word meant as you used it during the exploration. For example, thrust is power applied. The picture could be of a boy throwing a ball, a rocket going up with an arrow pointing at the exhaust coming out, etc. The picture should have meaning to you. </I></B><P>
<B><I>Finally, write what the word means in your own words. This will be place in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK for reference for the rest of the year.</I></B><P>

<B>6.  STUDENT TEXT</B><BR>
Have the students turn to page 7 and read the section on Learning From Nature And Experience.  Open a discussion asking, <B><I>Does any one know how this reading relates to this Exploration? </I></B>Hopefully, the students will realize that it is talking about noticing everything happening that could impact the exploration. Refer the students to the line "Observe, observe, observe. Then learn from your observations."<P>

<B>7. DISCUSSION</B><BR>
<B><I>Did the launch box affect flight performance? How?<BR>
Were you able to control your thrust variable?<BR>
Did you begin to see how scientists get answers by controlling things that can change?<BR>
Did you work as a scientist during this unit? In what ways?</I></B> Students worked in teams, <B>cooperated</B>, communicated, actually made something and conducted tests, collected and recorded <B>data,</B> used simple "tools" (pencil, paper, chart), organized ideas (classified, categorized), inferred, shared results, and maybe developed new knowledge. In short, they demonstrated many of the <B>characteristics</B> and skills used by scientists. Plus they "thought creatively" about what might be done. Scientists need those ideas and hunches.<BR>
<B><I>What other variables did you notice?<BR>
Which ones can be controlled?  How? <BR>
What changes would you like to see?<BR>
Were changes damaged by the launch box? How could that be avoided?</I></B><P><P>


<H2>Further Exploration:</H2>
Repeating the flight tests with a change in the angle of holding the launch box or the length of rubberband pull should help for those who do not appear to understand the impact of variable control.<P><P>


<H2>Evaluation:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Did all students try to fly planes?<BR>
<LI>Were all students involved in analysis of data and discussion?<BR>
<LI>Did each student complete the Exploration Report?<BR>
<LI>Can each student define a variable? - see Interactive Glossary<BR>
<LI>Can each student explain the importance of controlling variables?</UL><P><P>


<H2>Extensions/Variations:</H2>
Increase the number of flights for the given conditions.<BR>
Use mean and median as well as average in data analysis. <BR>
Introduce the concept of deviation both along path and within the data. Deviation is obviously a vital component in arriving at conclusions of scientific accuracy. (Results that deviate greatly from the average are suspect.) While this is not necessary for fourth grade students to begin acting as scientists, your more advanced students will find the understanding exciting.<P><P>


<H2>Home-School Activity:</H2>
How do your family members make decisions on food and tools? Does your mother evaluate (test) advertising claims before she buys? How does your father test before he buys?

<IMG SRC="dicotkey.gif" >The <B>Dichotomous Key</B><P>

<B>1. QUESTIONING STRATEGIES</B><P>
Use a large box that is sealed with a natural object in it, such as a feather. Ask the students to "guess" what is in the box. Students will receive points based on how many questions they ask to guess.<B><I> This box has something in it. You may not touch the box, but you may ask questions for a minute. I will answer questions with yes or no</I></B>. Allow one minute of chaotic questioning. <B><I>Did that work? </I></B>Introduce the idea of systematic, or <B>categorical</B> questioning.  Using RM-3, begin on the top set of boxes.<B><I> Let's try questions again, but with a system</I></B> Fill in a box as the students move through a more orderly series. Off the mark questions can be placed on the fringes, without comment. Students should very quickly find the answer. (Usually fewer than 10 questions.) <B><I>How did the system help? </I></B> This method cuts the number of questions and gives direction. <B><I>Classification or categorization also works with new or previously unknown discoveries.</I></B><P><P>

<B>2. SCIENTIST EXPLORER</B><P>
Pretend you are scientists invited along on Christopher Columbus' first voyage as he searches for a passage to China. Your assignment is to chronicle the plants and animals found in these territories.<P>
<B><I>Could you bring back specimens of each new thing you discover? <BR>
How will you describe the many new species you will encounter? <BR>
How will you find and show the relationship between different species of one item, such as leaves?</I></B><P>
Distribute containers of beans to the Research Teams. <B><I>In your Research Teams, group beans by </I>likenesses<I>, or common </I>characteristics<I>. Use your HAND LENSES to examine beans that appear to be identical. Starting with the </I>category<I>, ALL BEANS, begin to </I>categorize<I>. Initially, you might use light and dark, or big and small, or another category that seems to fit. As each </I>category<I> is determined, you will glue a representative bean in place, creating a visual </I>dichotomous key.</B> Write <B>visual dichotomous key</B> on the board. Define <B>dichotomous</B> as branching into two. Demonstrate that each category branches into two categories. (See picture of key done by student on the next page.) <B><I>As the key is further divided, use your HAND LENS to examine more closely. Try to find little differences to make your key very specific.</I></B><P>
Give students time to work in their groups and construct these keys. After they are completed, use the Numbered Heads Together technique (see P-22 <A HREF="1cooplrn.htm">  for this and other cooperative learning techniques</A>) for selecting students to tell about the key their group developed. Questions to ask during the Team presentations: <B><I>What was your Team's first branching? Are the identifiers the same on both sides?</I></B> After the reports are completed, post them around room. Since these will not fit conveniently into SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK, it  would be a good idea for a written form to be done as well accompanied by drawings, done to scale. <P>
<B><I>Before tomorrow, please "tour" the visual </I>dichotomous keys<I> done by other Teams. Study them to actually see how they were different.</I></B><P><P>

<B>3. PLANT CLASSIFICATION<P>
<I>Yesterday, we categorized beans and made visual </I>dichotomous keys<I>. Were all the keys the same?</I></B> Responses will indicate much similarity, but some differences. <I>Why do you suppose that is? </I></B>Different people. Different approach at first division. <B><I>Could you use the key from another Research Team and categorize beans?</I></B> Probably. <B><I>What is the most obvious </I>characteristic<I> for </I>categorizing<I> beans?</I></B> Color will probably be noted. <B><I>Today you will begin working in pairs, then, with information in hand, you will complete your work in your Research Teams. Note taking, or drawings, will be very important<P>
With the beans, color was important, and shape was less important. Today, all of the plants are green! Different shades maybe, but green. In your pairs, observe each plant. Remember, you are explorers. You have not seen any of these specimens before and do not know if they are poisonous. Also, you may not take any leaves to make identification easier. You may use your hand lenses.<P> 
Describe on paper two characteristics so that "anyone" could know what your plant looks like from your description. Then, set up ways to categorize all ten plants. Try to find relationships. Make a visual </I>dichotomous key<I> in your Research Teams. OK? Let me write on the board what you will do</I></B>. On the board write: 1. observe 10 plants; 2. write descriptions of two; 3. find relationships, ways to categorize; 4. make key. Remind them the first three are in their pairs while the key is developed in the team.<P>
Move about as the students do their work. Support by asking questions, but avoid the temptation to tell them how to do it! Encourage them to stay on task. You might make your own observations too. Students enjoy it when you are involved.<P>
After the keys are made, say, <B><I>In five minutes you will share your keys with the group. Select a Team reporter and prepare please. </I></B><P>

	Do the reports. <BR>
<B><I>What was the most frequent initial division? What were other common trends? What did you learn that you did not know before?<BR>
Please place your notes in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK. We will use them again tomorrow.</I></B><P><P>

<B>4. USING FIELD NOTES<P>
<I>You returned from the "new world" and your notes were published. Another scientist explorer takes your notes with her/him on a voyage to the same territory. Will that scientist be able to find the plants from your description? Let's see. Give your description of two plants to a pair not from your Research Team. </I></B>Organize this so it is not chaotic. Perhaps you could match two Research Teams and share across. Have half of the researchers do the check and report which plants were described. Check for accuracy. Then do the other half. This should be fun, and illustrative of the importance of excellent notes.<P>
<B><I>What happened?</I></B> Allow discussion. <B><I>Why? Descriptions are not as easy. What directions for descriptions will you give the next team of scientist explorers? </I></B>Draw pictures. Use a ruler instead of saying "big" or "small". Count the numbers of leaves on a stem. Etc.<P>
<B><I>How would you </I>categorize<I> the animals that you found on your exploration? With the visual cues only, what problems could occur?</I></B> Grouping eels with snakes or dolphins with sharks. <B><I>Today, knowledge of internal structures in addition to external ones, and DNA comparisons make classification easier among all living things.</I></B><P><P>

<B>5. MODERN RESEARCH<P>
<I>In your pairs, read about Barbara McClintock's research with corn on page 17 of the Student Text. Talk about her Nobel prize winning discovery. How is what she did like what you did? Write/draw your answer in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.</I><P><P>


Further Exploration: </B><P>
Students who did not understand the concepts the first time through might benefit from these exercises. They are useful too for students who were absent.<P> 

Pair students and do the making a peanut butter sandwich by directions.<P>

Exercise or try making a capital letter with just verbal descriptions. <P>

Give the student a handful of beans and have him/her organize them using a chart made by another student or Research Team.<P><P>


<H2>Evaluation: </H2>
<UL> 
<LI>  Correctness of keys is obvious at first glance. Given a group of objects, students will be able to write or draw a key in their SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.<BR>
<LI>  Given an added bean, ask groups to predict where it would fit in the key.<BR>
<LI>  Ask groups to predict what kinds of beans may yet be discovered, based on openings in the key.<BR>
<LI>  Ask students to assess how their descriptions worked when another scientist tried to find the correct plant. What went well and why? What did not work and why?<P><P>


<H2>Variations/Extensions: </H2> 
Do classifying as groups, producing one key for each group of four students, but each student records key in SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.<P>

Read some diary entries that describe discoveries made by explorers. If possible, obtain examples of sketch and descriptions to show to students.<P>

Ask a field biologist to share some of his/her notes with the students.<P>

Compare classification schemes for rocks with the one for beans.<P>

Visit a zoo or wildlife preserve. Ask how the biologists know which animals are closely related. <P>

Investigate DNA use for classification.<P><P>


<H2>Home/School Connection: </H2>
Assign as a project a mini-museum made from a personal collection and mounted in a box.  Arrangement should make <B>categories</B> obvious.<P>

Look around and talk with your family members. How do they use categories? Are the nails organized by size? Are fruit trees planted in "family" groups? Is yarn stored by color? How does this make sorting easier? How is this like what scientists do?<P><P>
Sample from the Fifth Grade Materials.<P>

<Title>Grade 5 Sample Lesson on Being A Scientist</Title>
<H1>Hypothesizing Historians</H1>  

<H2>Thematic Emphasis: </H2>
PATTERNS OF CHANGE<P><P>

<H2>Science Concepts:</H2> 
Historians use scientific processes to learn about ancient cultures. <BR> 
By using scientific process, they eliminate or reduce the possibility of leaping to unfounded conclusions.<P><P>


<H2>Scientific Thinking Processes:</H2>  
	Observing   Communicating   Comparing   Inferring<P>

<H2>Vocabulary:</H2>  
	Hypothesis,   Artifact,   Characteristic <P><P>


<I>NOTE: <BR>
The purpose of this activity is to integrate social studies and science in an explanation of the way historians and anthropologists study artifacts. It introduces the concept of the hypothesis that is used throughout the year.</I><P><P>


<H2>Materials:</H2>  <BR>
<B>Per student</B><BR>
an artifact in a small envelope (a penny)<BR>
ER-2   Hypothesizing Historians<BR>
GM-14<BR>
SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK<P>

<B>Per Teacher</B><BR>
GM-14 transparency<BR>
RM-4   transparency<BR>
set of four different sized balls<P><P>

<H2>Key Question:</H2> 
HOW DO HISTORIANS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS USE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIZING TO INVESTIGATE OTHER CULTURES AND/OR HISTORICAL ERAS?<BR><BR>

  
<H2>Time Allotment:</H2>
Introducing: 45 minutes<BR>
How Do You Know: 20 minutes<BR>
Hypothesizing Historians: 60 minutes<BR>
Knowing: 25 minutes<BR>
Scientific Explorers, 2500: 1-3 periods<P><P>


<H2>Management Suggestion:</H2>  
Sometimes it is difficult for students to suspend belief long enough to pretend. Both of the exercises require some pretending. When they do, the results are excellent. For part 3, tell students that they are part of a scientific expedition in the year 2500 A.D. Their current knowledge of the symbolism on the penny must be  suspended while they attempt to <B>hypothesize</B> about their <B>artifact</B>.  <P><P>


<H2>Procedure:</H2> 
<H3>1. INTRODUCING THE HYPOTHESIZING HISTORIAN </H3>
<B><I>What are some examples of discoveries made by explorers of ancient civilizations?</I></B> Possible answers could include: the Sphinx, mummies, pyramid tombs, temples, pieces of ceramics, jewelry, arrowheads, etc. <B><I>Some of you have named artifacts, or objects made by people. </I></B><P>
<B><I>How do historians found out the true identity or use of these artifacts?</I></B> Possible answers include: comparing to other <B>artifacts</B>, written records, guessing, trying out ideas for use. <B><I>We need to define a few words here</I></B>. Write historian, archaeologist, anthropologist on the board. <B><I>What is a historian?</I></B> A person who studies history--records and analyzes the past events of peoples. <B><I>What is an archaeologist?</I></B> A person who scientifically studies historic or prehistoric peoples using artifacts and remains. <B><I>What is an anthropologist?</I></B> A person who studies the origins and developments of people including the development of language and customs. Do these three have something in common? Often the training must overlap. <B><I>Many historians are anthropologists too. Many archaeologists also are anthropologists. Many historians also are archaeologists. To find out about the past, these seekers of history use scientific methods. Classifying materials is important. Describing accurately also is important. </I></B><P>
Place four balls--a softball, a soccer ball, a four square ball, a basketball or four other distinctly different balls--on a table where all students may see them. <B><I>These four objects are important objects to the culture of Lar. Pretend you have no idea at first what they are for, but in your Pairs write a description, illustrated if you are able, of the four objects. Then list two to four questions you have about where they were found, etc.</I></B><P> 
Give students time to complete the work. Move about encouraging. <P>
As students complete this assignment, ask, <B><I>What are some of your questions? Listen intently</I></B>, write them on the overhead as general ideas come forth. <P>
<B><I>We are in luck; I just received further information from the "dig" area. They offer the following information:</I></B> Project a transparency of RM- 4 revealing the top half of the following data.<BR>
<OL>
	<LI> Generally, the size of the sphere relates to the age of the people with which found. The smaller the sphere, the older the individuals who lived in the room where the specimen was located.<BR>
	<LI> Some spheres were in great supply in certain buildings or areas, while others were found in living quarters.<BR>
	<LI> Statues of people holding what may have been the spheres were found in some homes.
<P>
<B><I>Meet back in your Pairs and consider the new information.</I></B> Project now the whole of RM-4, revealing the questions.<P> 
<B><I>In your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS, respond to these questions. Talk with your partner.</I></B><P>
[questions]
<B><I>
<UL><LI> What can you assume from the information? <P>
<LI>Do you know the use of the spheres with certainty? <P>
<LI>Can you justify any guesses (hypotheses) with the information you have?<P> 
<LI>Make an hypothesis and justify it with the data you have. <P></I></B>

You may need to discuss the idea of hypothesis a bit more now, but it is reinforced later. As students share their hypotheses, you will have an excellent idea of what they understand and you will be able to assure they "get it" in section 3.
<B><I>Let's hear some of your hypotheses.</I></B> Try to have students who seldom respond get that opportunity here. Make notes on a clear transparency or chalkboard. Later, as you have time, ask for justifications of some of the hypotheses. You want to communicate the hypothesis should be made from some evidence, for some reason, although the hypothesis is yet to be proved.
<B><I>Researchers often have difficulty separating their culture from the culture they are studying. Suppose an archaeologist from a future culture that built many temples and other large buildings as part of their religion studied the remains of our culture. What might she/he assume? </I></B>Church buildings would be found, but other large, lavish buildings might be assumed to be churches or religious buildings. Maybe even a gymnasium or hockey arena would be catalogued as a temple. Perhaps some of our finest libraries would also be considered religious buildings. <B><I>Archaeologists and anthropologists have a difficult, but exciting job. They are hypothesizing historians.</I></B><P><P>

<H3>2. HOW DO YOU KNOW? DIG</H3>
Using available technology is a good way to expand on the curriculum.<P> 
3-2-1-Classroom Contact is available through many County Offices or your regional Instructional Television Consortium. Each segment is 15 minutes of excellent material. "How Do You Know? Dig It Up" will enhance this series of lessons.<P>
You may conduct a short discussion as appropriate.<P><P>

<H3>3. HYPOTHESIZING</H3>
Reintroduce the term <B>hypothesis</B>, as a good guess, testable, and based on collected data. <B><I>You developed a hypothesis ____</I></B>(Monday or ?).<B><I> What does hypothesis mean?<P>
In your Pairs, you are going to work on examining an artifact. To do this, you will have to pretend a bit. You are part of an expedition in the year 2500 AD. You are on the Planet Earth. The people of Earth left the planet about 300 years ago, populating other areas of the universe. Your exploration group has an artifact that appeared to be common in one area of the Earth about five hundred years ago. </I></B>Distribute envelopes with pennies, and the ER- 2. Remind them they need to take the perspective of a researcher from the future and forget what they know about the object. <B><I>Examine the artifact carefully and then read the four statements on the worksheet and devise a hypothesis for each. </I></B><P> 
Regroup for discussion. Focus first on the initial worksheet questions. The responses listed are common ones, yet there are many more that could be suggested. <BR>
<OL>
<LI> <I>There is a profile of a human on one side</I>. This may be a leader. Many cultures use coins and put their leaders on them. It may be an award and the profile is of the winner or individual who represents excellence in the event.<P>
<LI> <I>There is a building on the other side</I>. This may be the place where the coin is made, or the home of the profiled human, or another important building in the culture.<P>
<LI> <I>Artifacts are identical in size and shape</I>. They may be made mechanically, rather than by hand. They may have the same value.<P>
<LI> <I>The writing is in English</I>. This may be the language of the people of this culture. <P>
</OL>
<B><I>What were your additional observations and hypotheses?</I></B> (Might include items like: the object appears to be copper and the metal may have been valuable.) Write these as appropriate. Pursue the ways they arrived at their hypotheses.<P><P>

<H3>4. KNOWING</H3>
Give each student a copy of GM-14. <P>
[GM-14 form (text portion)]<BR>
1. I have a question! ...<BR>
2. Hypothesis ...<BR>
3. Procedure ...<BR>
4. Collect/Organize Data ...<BR>
5. Analysis/Conclusions ...<P>

<IMG SRC="515scirp.gif" ><B>A Sample Student Report</B><P>
</B><I>This is the scientific method. Yesterday we developed some hypotheses. Today, in your Research Teams, design a way to test one of the hypotheses. Write your method on your Science Report. After the Team arrives at a method, work individually and make your own notes. What will it take to actually do your test?</I></B><P>
You may discuss these, or you may just have them placed in the SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOKS.<P><P>

<H3>5. SCIENTIFIC EXPLORERS, 2500</H3> (This is an optional activity linked with language arts.)<P>
Using the writing process, connect this study with your language arts curriculum and have students write a story or narrative about discovering the truth about the copper disks found in North America in 2500. Weave developing a hypothesis and using the scientific method to solve the mystery.<P><P>


<H2>Further Exploration:</H2>
Review the idea that a hypothesis is a guess with reasons. Use the list below and have the student decide which probably is a hypothesis and which probably is fact:<BR>
School will be open on Friday.<BR>
The Brewers will win the pennant. (Or which ever team is in the lead.)<BR>
	______ will get a Grammy.<BR>
Add to this list regional and local information. Selecting probably fact and probably hypothesis will give students an opportunity to understand.<P><P> 


<H2>Evaluation:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>  Write two observations, <B>hypotheses</B>, and methods of proof of your own.<P>
<LI>  Review the SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK. Each written assignment is an imbedded assessment.<P>
<LI>  Review the story (#5).<P>
<LI>  Check involvement and participation in the Pairs and Teams.<P>
<LI>  Ask, what is the value of developing hypotheses based on artifacts of other cultures?<P><P>
</UL>

<H2>Variations/Extensions:</H2>
Choose one or two artifacts from your home that are so unusual that they would be very hard for a person from another era or culture to identify.  Bring them to school and share them with the class, allowing time for further hypothesizing.  To encourage creativity in guessing, run the lesson like the old game show Liar's Club. (In "Liar's Club", three or four people refer to the same object. They tell its name and describe how it is/was used. Only one is telling the truth. The others are lying! The audience has to listen and determine who is telling the real truth.)<P>

Visit a local museum and study local artifacts.<P>

Consider how legends are similar to hypotheses. List similarities and differences.<P>

Find a local or regional dig.<P>

Invite an anthropologist or archaeologist to visit your class.<P><P>


<H2>Home/School Activity:</H2>
Many families have mementos of their culture or ancestors. Talk with your parents, grandparents or other family elders and find out what these objects mean. Write down the meanings in your personal journal so this information will not be lost.<P>

<H2>Science Concepts: </H2> 
Many ocean floor features are comparable to land surfaces and are shaped by similar forces.<BR>
Plate tectonics explains the circulation of the geological features and phenomena found on Earth.<BR>  
The geologic processes that drive the rock cycle enable us

<HR>
<H2>Management Suggestions: </H2> 
You may wish to show an example of the project done by another class or by yourself or one of your children (or a GATE student). Each will be different.<P>
Have the students look at the ocean floor diagram on page 35  in the Student Text to get ideas for material to use in making their sea floor construction.<P>
Measurement will be important in the exploration. Students will be asked to measure the "depth" of various places on the construction.<P>
Creating your <B>Tsunami</B> is a simple demonstration, but it would be good to try it a couple of times to find how to get the most dramatic effect. In an aquarium--10 gallon or larger--place two large bricks. One should be flat on the bottom while the other is diagonal, resting partially upon the first. Sand in the bottom and enough water to be 3-5 inches or 7-12 cm above the bricks is needed. Push the diagonal plate (brick) so it lurches off the resting spot and drops with force to the bottom. The water should move wildly, creating a giant wave. Sand swirls. The desired effect is dramatic. Try it a couple of times.<P><P>

<HR>
<H2>Procedure:</H2>
<OL>

<H3> <LI> THE OCEAN FLOOR INTRODUCTION</H3>
<I><B>In your Student Text, on page 34, is an article about the ocean floor. </B></I> (While the dialog here suggests working with students who are hesitant readers, please use another tactic if this does not fit. You may do Pairs and have the article read in the Pair. You may just assign the students to read it and check for understanding. Adapt this suggestion to your group.) <I><B>On page 35 is a diagram of the ocean floor. What does it look like?</B></I> Regular land--maybe the valley near mountains. <B><I>Good point. It sure does.</I></B><BR>
<B><I>Let's read this article together, and, as we read, look at the diagram. </I></B>(Stop when the article refers to forms. Use those definitions to help the students understand what the form, like a seamount is. Since they will be making a sea floor, they need this help. You might make an overhead transparency of the diagram on page 35 if that will be helpful to your group. If you have more than one language group represented, this is a good strategy. Read each paragraph and refer to the diagram.) <P>
After giving students enough time to read the article, <B><I>The diagram is drawn as if people could see the ocean floor. How do we know what is there?</I></B> Accept a few answers, then go on.<P>
<B><I>We are going to construct a three-dimensional model of the ocean floor in a shoebox. The top of the shoebox will be sea level. Tomorrow</I></B> (or next Monday, or)<B><I> please bring material for the features of the ocean floor. Let's look again at that ocean floor diagram. What are some things you have at home that you might bring to make forms like these pictured?</I></B> Encourage responses. Be prepared to add a few of your own if needed (clay, salt dough, small toys). <B><I>We need shoeboxes for everyone. If you have an extra, please bring it too. We will need lids too, although we can make something if necessary.</I></B><P><P>

<H3> <LI> UNDERSEA CONSTRUCTION!</H3>
<B><I>Please begin your constructions. Include at least six of the forms identified in your Student Text in what you make. We will spend about forty minutes on the construction. You will not need to paint the scene.</I></B> (The colors may be rather dull. It is not important to the lesson.)<P>

Move about as students are doing their constructions. Offer support and encouragement. Tell students when they have five more minutes. Some students may need additional time, but most will be finished.<P>

Place the graph paper overhead on and as the students clean up ask, <B><I>How many included one</I> seamount?</B> Graph this. Continue through the seven forms identified in the Student Text. You may extend this by using the graph as the basis for a math assignment on percentages or proportions. Encourage students to finish their cleanup. <B><I>Tomorrow we will use your construction for the next part of our exploration.</I></B><P><P>

<H3> <LI> PROBING THE DEPTHS</H3>
<B><I>Please get your boxes and lids</I></B>. If a student does not have a lid, one can be made by taping a piece of paper over the top after the slits have been made for the probe. It does not work as elegantly, but it will work. <B><I>Over several of your features, like the </I>seamount<I> or even the </I>Abyssal Plain<I>, place a slit at least 3 cm long. Make at least six slits. Close the lids</I></B><P>.

Students should pair with a student from across the room or in a situation where each has not seen the other's ocean floor construction. You will want to help develop the pairs for support and equity. </B><I>Pair as I have asked. Great. Please pay close attention so you will understand the probe of the depths. How have we found out about most of the deep ocean forms?</I></B> Probes from ships. Core samples. Depth photography. Soundings. Satellite pictures (for more on this topic see Variations/Extensions). Looking at places that once were at the bottom of the ocean. <B><I>Good responses. We are going to simulate soundings using a gentle probe. Instead of directing a sound beam to the bottom, like sonar, and waiting for the return then calculating the distance by the time it took to travel there and back, we will use a soft probe.</I></B><P> 

<B><I>Trade boxes with your pair. Using the pipe cleaner as a soft probe, do at least three measurements for depth at each slit--one at each end and one in the middle.</I></B> You may need to demonstrate how to make a probe and measure it. <B><I>Record the probes and depth measurements on the graph paper</I></B>. Show how it should be recorded in the same relative position. This is something that may be difficult for some students. You will need to key on those children gently. A clear explanation now will avoid some confusion. Check for understanding. Use the sample you have and your overhead with the graph paper transparency to demonstrate. <B><I>The graph paper represents a top view of your </I>shoebox.<I> Write in the probe depths at the correct positions.</I></B><P>

<B><I>Please begin doing the probes. Pairs may help each other, but not to the point of doing the work. Both of you have probes to do. As you do the measurements, predict what ocean floor form exists under each slit. Remember, the lid represents the surface of the ocean. Think about how it must feel to do soundings and chartings on a ship hundreds of miles out to sea.</I></B><P>

Move about, helping when necessary, encouraging, supporting. Say, <B><I>As you complete your probes, use a piece of drawing paper to try and make a drawing or chart of what the ocean floor in the box looks like, using your probe data as a basis.</I></B> It would be ideal to get this experience for every student. If possible, do.<P>

<B><I>OK. You worked hard on this. Gently take the lid off the ocean floor boxes. Compare your predictions with what you found.</I></B><P>
<B><I>Are they similar? How are they different? Think about why you were not completely accurate. </I></B>Encourage discussion and contributions. From your observations as you moved about, you may have additional questions. <B><I>Doing ocean floor charting without being able to actually see what you are charting is not easy! Please place your charts and predictions in your SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK. Think about what you did and how close you came to what was in your pair's ocean floor box.</I></B><P><P>
 
<IMG SRC="tsunami.gif" ><P>

<H3> <LI> TSUNAMI!</H3>
<B><I>When an earthquake occurs, what happens?</I></B> Movement along a fault line. Shaking. Sometimes destruction. <B><I>Do earthquakes occur in the ocean?</I></B> They must. The earth is a sphere. Things there are <B>"landforms"</B> under the ocean. Write <B>Tsunami</B> on the overhead or chalkboard. Ask, <B><I>What is a Tsunami? If students know, great. If not, press on. Using this aquarium and these two bricks, we will create a </I>Tsunami<I>. Watch the sand and the surface.</I></B><P>

Create the <B>Tsunami</B> using the method in Management Suggestions. <B><I>How is this like an earthquake?</I></B> Plates move. <B><I>What else did you observe? </I></B>Strong movement of the water. Waves. Sand was disturbed. <B><I>A </I>Tsunami<I> along the coast is often called a "killer wave" by the press. Why? </I></B>The force could be destructive. <B><I>Occasionally these waves are 100 feet or 30 meters high. Could they change an environment?</I></B> Students probably will suggest they can by wiping out a village on a coast or similar. <B><I>What about the ocean floor environment? What about even higher where the light reaches? </I></B>There may be lively discussion. Encourage the students to think about more than just coastal, above normal tide level happenings. <B><I>If a </I>Tsunami<I> of great force hit a normally peaceful 500 foot deep tropical sea area near a Pacific Island, how might the sea plants and animals be impacted?</B></I>Some plants would be wrenched out of the area. Some fish might be confused and swim to away from their traditional feeding zones. Etc. What could happen to the food chain? Various answers. <B><I>Could this force change and adaptation? What types?</I></B><P><P>

<H3> <LI> THEORIES EVOLVE</H3>
Use your overhead and a plain transparency to chart the development of the theory of Plate Tectonics. The discussion you will lead is very structured. It is designed to find the key points of an article and help students identify what is important. This study skill is valuable, plus, you will derive important information. Alternative ways of approaching this include having students work in Teams or Pairs to chart the development of the theory, then gathering the group for discussion and comparison. <P>
<B><I>Please turn to page 36 in your Student Text. Ralph, please read the title of this article. </I></B>Ralph reads. <B><I>What does it mean to have a theory evolve? </I></B>Ideas change as new information is learned. <B><I>We are going to skim through this article and list the important points in developing this theory.</I></B><P>

<IMG SRC="platther.gif" ><B>Developing a Theory</B><P>

Ask students to read ahead to get the next point, or read it to them if this is a better model for your class. Your chart will look something like this one:<P>

 
Discuss each point. <B>You may want students to take notes</B> or write the chart points down for including in their SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK. <P>
<B><I>What are facts in the things that these scientists discovered?</I></B> The matching rocks and fossils. The magnetic fields. <B><I>What is the theory?</I></B> That the continents were connected. <B><I>Why is that not fact? </I></B>We see many things that make us almost certain they were connected. More is being discovered. But we have no absolute proof. It is sort of like circumstantial evidence in a court case. <B>How do theories change or evolve?</I></B> New discoveries.<P><P>

<H3> <LI> PLATES MOVE</H3>
<B><I>We have looked at plate tectonics. The Tsunami may result from plates moving. Certainly many changes on Earth's surface have resulted from those moving plates. I was interested in how scientists worked to validate the theory of continental drift and how it became an even bigger idea! </I></B>You may discuss what a theory is.<P> 

<B><I>Please get into your Research Teams.</I></B> Give each team a sheet of newsprint. <B><I>Tear the newspaper into 15 to 20 pieces. Great. Now pass all those pieces to another table and take theirs.</I></B> When the swaps have been effected, say, <B><I>To help understand how the parts might be pieced together, you will in your teams try to put the page back together! </I></B><P>

When they have, ask <B><I>How can anyone be sure the page is correctly reconstructed?</I></B> Students will say lines match, edges match, etc. <B><I>Is this strong evidence? </I></B>Yes. Some of these pieces are divided in the middle of words. <B><I>From what you understand about </I>plate tectonics<I>, how does this relate?</I></B> Fossil beds found in two places separated by ocean. Coastline similarities on facing continents. <P>

Do the clean up. Tomorrow will be the culmination of the exploration.<P><P>

<H3> <LI> EVOLUTION IS CHANGE</H3>
<B><I>Today you will write and draw to express conclusions you have made. You may select one of two topics, or ask me about a topic you think is interesting that relates:</I></B> Write on the overhead:<P>
Describe an environment before and after a <B>Tsunami</B>. What is the impact of the great wave on the food chain and plant and animal life in the area? Must they adapt? How?<P>
OR, describe the what impact the moving plates might have had on plant and animal life, food chains, etc. as the plates separated.<P>

<B><I>You may pair and discuss your ideas about evolution in this context before writing, or you may work alone. If you pair, please make it for only five minutes. We will finish this SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK entry at _____.</I></B><P>

Move about to assure that students are on task. Working in pairs may assist some students, but will be a distraction to others. <P>

Gather the group together and listen to some of the ideas before ending the lesson.<P><P>
</OL>

<HR>
<H2>Discussion:</H2>
<B><I>What separates theory from fact? </I></B>Fact is absolute certainty. Theory can be an idea or something that is circumstantial, but not totally provable.<P>

<B><I>How can scientists chart the bottom of the ocean with such certainty? </I></B>Several types of probes. Evidence of volcanic activity. Depth testing.<P>

<B><I>How was your ocean box experience like what scientists do as they map the ocean floor? </I></B>Probes, measurements. Some knowledge before they start.<P>

<B><I>Why didn't people accept Wegener's theory of Continental Drift? </I></B>Traditional ideas did not include Continental Drift. The evidence was not widely presented. He was one person and many others disagreed.<P>

<B><I>How do movements along the plate edges change the environment? </I></B>Volcanic activity. Earthquakes. Tsunami. Changes in amounts of heat from geothermal areas.<P>

<B><I>Evolution often is described as change. What are some of the changes we have discussed and explored in this exploration?</I></B> The environmental changes along the plate edges. Change in theories. <P>

<B><I>Using that definition, has the Earth evolved? </I></B>Probably a positive response. How? Volcanoes grow, mature, erupt. The landscape is changed. Upheaval occurs and mountain ranges are created. Glaciers and rivers carve canyons.<P><P>

<HR>
<H2>Further Exploration:</H2>
	Redo the newspaper "puzzle" with fewer pieces. Use the same questions. Instead of the probes, have the student gently feel the with his/her eyes closed and describe the "ocean floor" as he/she does it.<P><P>

<H1>Being a Scientist</H1>
<B><I>Equipped with his five senses, man explores the universe around him, and calls the adventure science.</I></B><BR>
Edwin Powell Hubble<P>

	Being a scientist is an integral part of <B>Exploring Science</B>.  The goal of the program  is more than creating an interest in science on the part of students.  The goal is launching scientists!  To be sure, not all the students in your class will become professional scientists, but they will develop the skills of the scientist.  They are naturally curious.  This program will enhance that curiosity and assist them in becoming scientifically literate.  Rather than just studying the scientific method, they will apply the scientific method.  Each child will be a participant in the process rather than a receiver of neatly packaged data.<P>

	Several years ago, Herb Strongin proposed that we explore science, not just have students read chapters, answer questions, and call that science.  Herb, as director of the California Science Curriculum Training Center, traveled California with a message.  "Give kids five good hands on science lessons each year," Herb would exult, "... and that will change the attitudes toward science."  Students did not see science as exciting.  It was another read and answer the questions class in too many schools.  Herb set out to change that.  He was a person with a message and he reached many of us.  Herb suggested there were "five small steps" to developing a real science program.  Assisting students to see themselves as scientists is one of them.<P>

	Set aside science time as something special.  Students respond to physical cues.  The hand lens with the neck cord is ideal.  Wearing the lens, even if it is not part of the exploration for the day, will bring the student into the role of scientist if the stage is set.  As the teacher, you too may benefit from using the physical cue to evidence the change in approach.  If you are comfortable doing it, use a laboratory coat or smock.  As the transition to science time comes, put on your badge of the scientist as you ask the students to wear theirs.<P>

	As you set up your room for the year, include the chart <B>Being a Scientist</B>, placing it prominently in the room.  At the transition to science time during the first few sessions, refer to the chart and the qualities of a scientist.  Utilize the "badge of the scientist" to set apart the science times.   Often, students who have difficulty in other subjects blossom when this approach is used.  Science time is different.  Each child has an opportunity to be a  scientist.<P>

	 In each of the program levels from kindergarten through sixth grade, being a scientist is emphasized.  The first  unit of the year is devoted to learning the skills of the scientist.  Students learn needed skills to use various tools of a scientist.  They develop positive self concept as they discover individual contributions are needed and valued.  Additionally, they use the scientific method and that approach to knowledge becomes part of them.<P>

	Your <B>Being a Scientist</B> chart underscores the ground rules for the laboratory into which your classroom has been transformed.  First is posited that <B>scientists follow lab and safety rules</B>.  Even for intrepid investigators, safety is important.  Chemicals are not tasted or rubbed on the hands.  Animals are not poked,  prodded, or treated inhumanely.   Respect is shown to other scientists, including the teacher, even when spirited debate occurs. <P>

	<B>Scientists are curious</B>.  They wonder about why, what, and how.  Scientists develop ideas about why things are as they are (hypotheses) and seek means to validate their ideas. Thus, scientists investigate.  Using appropriate procedures, scientists check out their ideas.<P>

	As <B>scientists investigate, they collect and record precise data</B>.  Generally, these records are done in the SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.  Scientists record precisely what occurs and they are as neat as is possible.  Information is entered and dated.  It is never changed.  Even when a different result is found that seems to invalidate the initial information, data is not erased.  Errors are righted by a dated correction statement, not erasures.  Data recording may include drawings, charts, and other graphics.  Frequently drawings are to scale and the scale should be recorded too, giving further precision.  Young students will record much of their data in sketches.<P>

Many of the great discoveries of science have been collaborative efforts.  <B>Scientists cooperate</B>.  They build on the earlier work of others, giving credit for that work.  Often the great prizes awarded to scientists are given to groups of individuals who shared information and cooperated to uncover new knowledge.  Part of cooperation is communication.  <B>Scientists communicate</B> using their notebooks, reports, charts, diagrams, conversations, computers, and all of the contemporary means of communication.<P>

<B>Scientists seek answers</B> to their questions about how, why, and what.  Their curiosity propels them into a quest for understanding.  As the understanding grows, <B>scientists ask new questions</B>.<P>

Sometimes, being a scientist is frustrating.  The answers may not be easily found.  Jonas Salk once was asked about the hundreds of experiments that were failures as he sought a polio vaccine.  Salk responded that they were not failures since they demonstrated  unfruitful paths for further research and helped him to focus further.  <B>Scientists persist</B>.  <P>

<B>Exploring Science</B> is a program designed for participation and involvement.  Students are not playing at science.  This <B>hands on, minds on</B> program is designed to develop scientists.  Scientists wonder about things; scientists observe.  They can be full time professionals, or they can be engaged in other pursuits, yet still be scientists.  Recently observant hikers discovered the wreck of a ship lost over a century ago.  Most of the comets discovered have been found by amateur astronomers.<P>

Science is interesting and fun.  Science can be the most engaging part of the curriculum.  Don your lab coat or put your lens on golden cord around your neck. Similarly outfit your students, and get ready.  Wearing the badge of the scientist, the adventure begins!<P>

<H1>SCIENTIFIC THINKING PROCESSES</H1> 

Beginning each program, whether Kindergarten or grade 6, is the section BEING A SCIENTIST. The aim of <B>Exploring Science</B> is to have students become scientists! They are the investigators rather than passive children during the science period.<P>

The BEING A SCIENTIST section introduces thinking processes and tools of real science. While it serves as an orientation to the program, it also sets the student on the path to scientific inquiry. Students begin to observe, communicate, compare, order, categorize, and relate in the first few explorations. <P>



Throughout <B>Exploring Science</B>, <B><I>scientific thinking processes</I></B> are used. In BEING A SCIENTIST and other sections, the <B><I>scientific thinking processes</I></B> are identified in each exploration. <B>Exploring Science</B> encourages learning at higher levels of thinking, not merely rote. The <B><I>scientific thinking processes</I></B> are tools of science, even more than microscopes, telescopes, or computers. Since man and woman have walked on the earth, they have employed the <B><I>scientific thinking processes</I></B> to enhance their understanding of natural phenomena. In every setting, whether in a well stocked science room or in a regular classroom, teachers can work with their students and encourage the development of these most important tools. <B><I>Scientific thinking processes</I></B> are built, one upon another, for most students, while for some, the development of processes is non-linear. Each process is important in the development of a scientist.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Observing</I></B> is the basic scientific tool. Through this process, information about the environment is obtained. Children develop expectations about their environment through organizing patterns. As the process of observation is refined, more data may be secured. Perspective of the observer is important and may influence that which is observed. "What should I see, teacher?" questions will be minimized as the teacher encourages students to relate and record that which they see, feel, hear, smell as individuals. Each experience as an observer will help the student hone his/her observation tool.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Communicating</I></B> the observation to another is important. The student scientist needs to share. Scientists communicate to validate their studies and to gain insights from others. Methods of communication range from drawings and telling others to diagrams, lab reports and summaries, and graphs. Communicating information secured from observations is easily linked to Language Arts, Mathematics, and other areas of the curriculum.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Comparing</I></B> objects, animal, planets, and a wide range of other things is another basic process of science. Children who are familiar with Sesame Street have grown up singing "Some of these things are not like the others." They recognize differences early, similarities seem more complex.  Through comparing an unknown object with one that is known, discoveries are made. Children can develop this process so that it will serve them well. Precise comparisons will become more frequent as this tool is used.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Ordering</I></B> is another scientific process that relates across the curriculum. Generally there are two types of order. One is linear, describing stages through which a frog goes in his development. The other is cyclical, describing the water cycle or wave cycle. Which came first is important to developing the sequence of things, and thus, understanding the story, the cycle, or the event.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Categorizing</I></B> also brings about order to the world of a child. Similarly, it allows scientists to explain phenomena. Developing alternative models of categorizing may validate observations. Grouping and finding common characteristics is the means by which scientists are able to organize phenomena. Often groupings are initially developed on the basis of one characteristic. Later two or more characteristics may be employed to introduce further specificity. Young students may be limited to single characteristic groupings, but older students frequently find two characteristic groupings useful.<P>

<HR>
While observing, communicating, comparing, ordering, and categorizing are processes common to most children even as they enter school, <B><I>relating</I></B> is a process frequently developed in the later primary years. Interactions between and among variables, cause and effect occurrences, and dependencies are the substance of relationships. The child who observes that the roller coaster moves fast does not necessarily understand the relationship between several variables and the actual speed developed, yet he/she will develop the ability to generalize.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Inferring</I></B> explains and predicts. Children enjoy predicting. While most students do not become proficient using inference until middle school age, many students may use models and evidence combined with reasoning to understand that which they cannot test or view directly. Additionally, they use prediction in developing hypotheses which they may be able to test subsequently.<P>

<HR>
<B><I>Applying</I></B> is the final <B><I>scientific thinking process</I></B>. New knowledge is created through applying a new treatment to a problem. Application creates new knowledge or understandings. Inventions or solutions to world problems are examples of application of scientific knowledge and understanding. Children often enjoy designing inventions to do routine tasks. They also are able to use that which was learned through one exploration in another. While these are not examples of application at the highest level, such activities stimulate the children and prepare them for using application at a more sophisticated level.<P>


<HR>
Each exploration in <B>Exploring Science</B> uses the <B><I>scientific thinking processes</I></B> and assists children in spiraling upward in their development as scientists. The BEING A SCIENTIST section of each grade level launches students as scientists on a yearly basis.  The seven year program launches scientists.<P><P><P>

<Title>Hands-on</Title>
<H1>HANDS ON  -  MINDS ON</H1>

	<B><I>I HEAR, AND I FORGET<BR>
	I SEE, AND I REMEMBER<BR>
	I DO, AND I UNDERSTAND</I></B><P>

		Chinese Proverb<P><P>

The message in this proverb is clear. We learn by doing.  Other methods do not provide in-depth or long term learning. They are only superficial. We do not learn the value of a dollar by listening to our parents and teachers. We do not learn a dollar's value by reading in a text book or doing math problems. We DO learn its value by taking that dollar to the grocery store and making a purchase.<P>


SCIENCE is the perfect "learn by doing" subject. In EXPLORING SCIENCE, the doing IS the program. Unlike traditional text driven programs, the hands on - minds on activities are the core of the program. The text supports the hands on activities by providing additional information, graphic organizers, challenge activities, and suggestions for further reading.<P>


The term EXPLORING is used to further break away from the traditional mode of "experimenting." Experimenting is a narrowing activity. Students manipulate variables and generally find predetermined outcomes. The term "exploration" is used because it expands a student's thinking. Exploring reinforces the concepts of curiosity, enthusiastic investigation, and the wondering of science, as well as the scientific thinking processes. Students will go through five distinct types of explorations as they delve into this program.<P>
<OL>
<LI>FREE EXPLORATIONS
<LI>DIRECTED EXPLORATIONS
<LI>STUDENT BASED EXPLORATIONS
<LI>FURTHER EXPLORATIONS
<LI>COGNITIVE EXPLORATIONS
</OL>

<P>

<H2>FREE EXPLORATIONS</H2>
All students need the freedom to explore the natural world. This free exploration builds background information and begins to access each person's bank of information, as well as their prior experiences. A free exploration also creates a common base of understanding among all students in the classroom. Hands on experiences with actual science and manipulatives particular to a forthcoming exploration allow the students to subconsciously begin the acquisition of beginning concepts about these objects such as the properties of size, weight, shape, color, and texture. Curiosity, enthusiasm, and the awe of wondering are starting to bubble up here in each of us as scientists. The teacher's responsibility is solely to set up the experience, define the behavior standards, and insure the participation of each and every child.<P><P>



<H2>DIRECTED EXPLORATION</H2>
During directed explorations, students are engaged in specific activities that allow them to explain patterns with a set of GENERALIZATIONS. These directed explorations may or may not have only one answer. The activities directly teach specific information, content, concepts, and procedures. These BIG IDEAS form a solid science background based on the student's experience. This long-range memory bank of generalizations becomes the student's schema into which new information is later assimilated. The teacher directs discussion and questioning. All help to define, clarify, and generalize the BIG IDEAS.<P><P>



<H2>STUDENT-DIRECTED EXPLORATION</H2>
One of the key components for student success is empowerment, being in charge of their own learning. Many opportunities are written into the program that allow and encourage students to define their own explorations and set their own variables. These activities provide a higher level of thinking, independence, and creativity. The teacher then is indirectly guiding and facilitating the acquisition of content and concepts, the BIG IDEAS. Activities in which students describe and compare objects as well as events by manipulating the elements will then allow them to discover new information. Students will also work with varying conditions that will lead to the discovery of how properties, patterns, and outcomes can change. Students learn to predict, hypothesize, test predictions, analyze, and prove outcomes. The students' responses and outcomes are less predictable than those of directed explorations.
<P><P>


<H2>FURTHER EXPLORATIONS</H2>
Students need help to see the importance of exploring further to retest, redefine, and validate, or take a new turn and begin a different investigation. Scientists repeat steps, change, extend, eliminate, and enhance before a final product is produced. Therefore it is essential that the students are given many, many opportunities to explore further. There must be equal access for all students. Further explorations are not an option only for those who are "done with their work early." These further explorations help the long-range retention of science schema along with the ease of recall. As their experience base grows, students can participate more effectively in all of the science processes and explorations.<P><P>




<H2>COGNITIVE EXPLORATIONS</H2>
Still another form of student investigation is that of the COGNITIVE EXPLORATION. Students manipulate IDEAS, not "things." They discuss, brainstorm, negotiate for meaning, hypothesize, formulate, and problem solve. These COGNITIVE explorations are essential to a successful science program. COGNITIVE explorations are especially helpful when dealing with current issues and problems within our community, nation, world, and society. There are no right answers. The emphasis is on gathering all possible information, projecting into the future, and in some cases, drawing up an ACTION PLAN to provide for students' active involvement toward positive change.<P><P><P>

<Title>Notebook</Title>
<H1>SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK</H1>


<P>
In this program wondering, questioning, and using imagination are desired, encouraged, and supported.  One of the major components supporting this  is the SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK.  Since a written record is a primary tool of a scientist, each student is provided a notebook annually.  This notebook  is used to:
<UL>
<LI>  give fuller range to the imagination<BR>

<LI>  remember information and procedures<BR>

<LI>  clarify thinking<BR>

<LI>  communicate with others<BR>

<LI>  think about thinking<BR>

<LI>  keep a record of thinking and exploring from K - 6<BR><P>


<H2>GIVE FULLER RANGE TO THE IMAGINATION</H2>

<B><I>"Imagination is more important then knowledge."</I></B><BR>
               Albert Einstein, On Science<P>

Throughout the program, students are exposed to biographies and quotations from many famous scientists, inventors, and thinkers.  Primary source excerpts from the notebooks of Leonardo DaVinci are presented  from 2nd to 6th level. Students are encouraged to follow DaVinci's lead and use their notebooks for writing and drawing their own ideas.  Right brain techniques are included in various lessons to teach students to release their expressive powers.  <P>
Children begin school possessing an attitude of wonder.  All too often this is lost as they mature.  We want to nurture and nourish it. <P><P>

<H2>REMEMBER INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES</H2>
There are many times when it is necessary to duplicate a scientific exploration to test its validity.  Students will be given many opportunities to follow their notes and redo an experiment.  Did they get the same results?  Why or why not?<P>
Keeping careful records is vital to the scientific process. For primary students this may take the form of drawings and invented spelling. As the students matures, their records will become more detailed and precise. <P><P>

<H2>CLARIFY THINKING</H2>
<B><I> "Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking what no one has thought."</I></B><BR>
Albert Szent-Gyorgi<P>
Writing and drawing help to clarify thinking.  By writing down thoughts and information, the brain processes and reprocesses the material.  By drawing observations or ideas, students utilize the right side of the brain, thus integrating ideas to increase understanding.  This solidifies the learning and often provides new insights.  <P><P>

<H2>COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS</H2>
<B><I> "If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth the writing."</I></B><BR>
Ben Franklin<P>
Today's scientists seldom work in isolation.  They are usually part of a team.  An important part of their job is to communicate their ideas (cognitive transfer) with the other members of their group.  Verbal and written communication are a significant part of this process.  This program affords numerous opportunities for both.<P><P>

<H2>THINKING ABOUT THINKING</H2>
Thinking about thinking (metacognition) is another key component for science.  This is not an easy task.  Modeling this for students and encouraging them to write down their thoughts rather than simply record measurable data, supports this metacognitive process.<P>

<H2>KEEP A RECORD OF THEIR THINKING</H2>
<B><I> "The world is a laboratory to the inquiring mind."</I></B><BR>
Albert Einstein<P>
Looking back is enjoyable and insightful.  Think of the fun you have looking at childhood photos.  You can see growth, you can relive experiences, you can get back in touch with feelings and thoughts you had at the time.  Looking back at a Scientist's Notebook from prior grades can  accomplish the same thing.  At the end of the year, each student makes a cover for their  Scientist's Notebook, and takes it home.  At the beginning of the next year, the teacher asks the students to return it for a few days to share.  Thus, students are encouraged to keep their  Notebooks and reread them from time to time.<P>
An important part of the training of the future scientist is that scientists do not erase in their notebooks. Each child should be taught to make corrections, while maintaining the old information. Every scientist knows that this provides an audit trail for their thoughts AND a recovery point , in case the new information becomes a dead end.<P><P>

<H2>NOTE: ESL</H2>
For the notebook to be a meaningful tool, it is necessary that students write in their most fluent language. If students who are not yet fluent in English can be grouped with others who speak their same language, the goals are more attainable.<P><P><P>

<H1>COOPERATIVE LEARNING</H1>

<IMG SRC="cooperat.gif" ><P>

     We believe that the best way for students to learn about science is to use hands on exploration activities and share their experiences with others.  The strategy of Cooperative Learning has this sharing of experiences imbedded throughout.  Students must talk with and listen to the other members of their group to be successful.  When working with others,  students can also see different points of view and possible solutions to a problem.  Not only does Cooperative Learning provide a stronger science program; it also prepares students for future academic, professional, and personal settings.<P>  
     There are many models or approaches to cooperative learning, but all share certain basic characteristics:<BR>
<UL>
 <LI><B> POSITIVE INTERDEPENDENCE.</B>  Cooperative groups are based on positive interdependence.  The goals or tasks are structured so that the students must concern themselves with the performance of all members of the group, not just their own performance.<BR>

  <LI><B> INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACCOUNTABILITY</B>.  Each member of the cooperative group is held accountable for the performance of all.  No student can piggyback on the work of others.<BR>

<LI><B> HETEROGENEITY.</B>  Cooperative groups are heterogeneous in terms of ability, gender, ethnicity, and other personal characteristics.  Working together across cultural and gender lines creates an atmosphere of MUTUAL RESPECT.<BR>

<LI><B> LEADERSHIP.</B>  All members of the group have shared leadership responsibilities.  Each member is important.  There is no formal group leader.<BR>  

<LI><B> PRO SOCIAL BEHAVIORS.</B>  Students focus on social skills as well as the academic assignment.  They review the success of both.<BR>

<LI><B> TEACHER'S ROLE.</B>  The teacher acts as an initiator and consultant.  Problems are turned back to the group to resolve.  The teachers provides feedback to the groups on how well they are working together. The emphasis is on student to student communication rather than teacher to student.<P> 
</UL>


     According to Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec,  <I>"The concept of cooperation is simple.  But switching a classroom from an emphasis on individualistic and competitive learning to a classroom dominated by  collaboration is a complex and long-term process.  Learning how to structure learning situations cooperatively is much like peeling an onion.  The teacher learns how to structure productive cooperative learning activities layer after layer until the heart is reached.  Over a period of years.... the learning experiences become richer and richer."</I>   <P> 
     To assist the teacher to "peel the onion," we have included cooperative learning activities in many of our explorations.  We have given a suggested group size, listed materials by group, and given step by step directions for management and assessment.<P>  
     
<H2>A MYTH: </H2> 
One concern often expressed about cooperative learning is that the brighter students will not progress as quickly.  Research in the field (Johnson, Johnson, and Holubec, 1986) states that high achieving students are NOT held back.  In fact, they benefit from the interaction with other students.  High achievers use higher quality reasoning strategies when they work in heterogeneous cooperative groups.  They are more likely to develop the leadership, communication, decision-making, and conflict-management skills they need for future success in school and in their careers.<P><P>


<H2>HOW DO I STRUCTURE COOPERATIVE LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM?</H2>
The following will give you tips for managing cooperative learning in your classroom:  forming pairs and teams, assigning responsibilities, and structuring your classroom.<P><P>

<H2>FORMING RESEARCH PAIRS: </H2> 
The TEACHER should always assign the pairs keeping in mind the basic characteristics of cooperative learning.  When left to their own devices students will choose their friends.  Some students will feel anxious and left out.  Others will select their friends and socialize throughout the task.<P><P>    

<H2>FORMING RESEARCH TEAMS: </H2> 
Again, the TEACHER selects the teams.  Each team should include both boys and girls who have a variety of abilities, and, as much as possible, should represent the cultural diversity of your classroom.  Three to five students generally make a good team.  These  teams should stay together for several weeks so the team members have time to learn to work well together.  A goal is for each student to interact with every other student in the classroom by the end of the year.  With this kind of structure, your students can learn to appreciate the cultural diversity of their classroom.  Interaction fosters tolerance and  understanding,  attitudes imperative in our future society.<P><P>

<H2>ASSIGNING JOBS:</H2>  
To foster interdependence, it is often necessary to assign each member of the team a critical job.  As you read each of the explorations for your grade level, you will see specific suggestions.  Some generic jobs are:<BR>
     <UL>
<B>RECORDER:</B>  Has the responsibility of completing the team exploration sheet.  Must be sure that all team members have seen and agree with the report.<BR>  
     <B>MANAGER:</B>  Has the responsibility for picking up and returning all necessary supplies. <BR>
     <B>CHECKER:</B>  Has the responsibility of checking to see if all members of the group understand the work and agree with the findings.<BR>
     <B>ENCOURAGER:</B>  Has the responsibility for group participation.  Needs to make sure that no one is left out.<P><P>


<H2>CLASSROOM  STRUCTURE: </H2> 
It is very helpful to have the room set up with students seated in small heterogeneous groupings of four.  By using an even number, it is easy to break into RESEARCH PAIRS.  If the students can sit closely together, they can speak in   " team voices" _which can be heard by the members of the team but will not disturb others nearby.  You will need to leave enough space for you to circulate throughout the groups.  It is important that the teacher take a positive and supportive role in this process.  A teacher's presence is a powerful force.<P><P>  


<H2>USING THE "T" GRAPH:</H2> 
Using a social skills graph is an extremely helpful tool for both students and teachers. Students do not necessarily know these skills. They need to be taught as you would teach any other basic skill. Focus on one skill at a time. For example RESPECT:<BR>

What does respect look like?_____________What does respect sound like?<BR>
___________________________________________________________<BR>

Students using eye contact ______________One person talking at a time<BR>
with the speaker<BR>
___________________________________ "I like your idea." Susan<BR>
___________________________________ "What do you think, Jose?" Lee<P>

Part of the teacher's role is to record appropriate comments such as those above on the chart as the students are working. At the end of the lesson, review the academic task and the social skill. Save the social skill chart. Post it during another cooperative learning activity, review, and add to it. This strategy works well at all levels.<P><P>


<H2>COOPERATIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES</H2>

     The following strategies have been used throughout this series.  They represent only a few successful techniques.  Each has its own attributes and applications, and many variations of each strategy are possible.<P><P>


<H2>THREE STEP INTERVIEW</H2>
<B>Procedure:</B>  Students work in RESEARCH PAIRS to interview each other about an assigned topic.<BR>
<OL> 
<LI>  One student interviews the other about the topic.
<LI>  The students switch roles as interviewer and interviewee.
<LI>  Each student then shares with the group what he or she learned during the interview.
</OL><P>
<B>Uses:</B>  The three step interview can be used effectively to access background information.  Use a question such as <I>"What do you know about __________(the topic of the lesson)."</I>  Another use would be to summarize at the close of the lesson.  <I>"What was the most important thing you learned about _____?"</I> Or use for further inquiry topics.  <I>"What else would you like  to know about ______?" </I><P><P>



<H2>EXPERT GROUPS</H2>
<B>Procedure:</B>  Students work in RESEARCH TEAMS.  Each member of a team becomes an "expert" about a particular topic related to a larger topic or concept.  If a group is studying the endangered California condor, one member might become an expert on its native habitat, another its diet, another its rate of reproduction, and another on its enemies.  They report back to the group on their area of expertise.  The group then has a task which involves applying the information, such as writing an editorial how and why they should be protected. <P> 

<B>Uses:</B>  This strategy can be used to introduce new information, analyze previously learned material, address current and controversial issues.<P><P>

<H2>THINK PAIR SHARE</H2>
<B>Procedure:</B>  Usually when the teacher asks a question, the students raise their hands.  The teacher calls on one or two the answer.  In <B>THINK/ PAIR/ SHARE</B> the teacher asks a question.  The students have a brief <B>THINK</B> time, then they turn to their partner and <B>SHARE</B>.  The teacher can then have a few share with the total group.  This way all students have an opportunity to answer and participate actively.<P>

<B>Uses:</B>  Any time a teacher would normally ask a question.<P><P> 



<H2>HEADS TOGETHER & NUMBERED HEADS TOGETHER</H2>
Procedure:  This is a strategy for group discussion and responding used with <B>RESEARCH TEAMS</B>.  The teacher poses a question. " What are the most important uses of energy?"  The students are given time to discuss and come to agreement.  The teacher then calls on one representative of the TEAM to answer. <P>  
With <B>NUMBERED HEADS TOGETHER</B> each team member has a number.  The teacher calls a number and that person must respond for the team.  If the person does not know the answer, the entire team does not get credit.  This makes it imperative that students work together to insure that all team members know the desired information.<P>

<B>Uses:</B>  Excellent for group discussion summarizing, categorizing, analyzing, communicating ideas and information.<P><P>



<H2>ROUND ROBIN & ROUND TABLE:</H2>
<B>Procedure:</B>  These are two step structures used with RESEARCH TEAMS.  In step one the teacher asks a question with many possible answers.  In step two the students respond in turn listing possible answers.  In round robin the list is given orally.  In round table one piece of paper and one pencil are circulated from person to person and answers are written down.<P>

<B>Uses:</B>  These structures can be used throughout a lesson.  They can set the focus for the lesson, review information, check for understanding.<P><P>

<Title>Curriculum Connections</Title>

<H1>CURRICULUM CONNECTIONS
STARTING WITH SCIENCE</H1>
<P>
<H2>SCIENCE PROVIDES MOTIVATION</H2>

Science is the natural link for cross-cultural  adventures in learning. "Children  love science. Just ask them. Dinosaurs, whales, bees, thunder and lightening, volcanoes, space travel _ you name it and they're interested. Research studies have shown that when asked what they would prefer to study, children choose science more than half the time." <I>Instructor Magazine, March, 1991.</I>
<P>
<H2>SCIENCE PROVIDES INVOLVEMENT</H2>
Research also tells us that when students are actively involved in their own learning, that learning is more in depth and long term.  The information  becomes part of  each student's bank of experiences.  This enriched "bank" provides materials  to draw upon  when they study and work in other curricular areas.   For example, agricultural problems caused by drought conditions can be better understood if students have raised their own plants and studied, analyzed and charted the effects of water and sunlight on plant growth.  Hardships faced by the settlers moving west are more real if a student has made and eaten his or her their own jerky.<P>

<H2>SCIENCE INTEGRATION PROVIDES TIME</H2>
Time  (both students' and teachers') is the next major factor in the decision to provide an integrated program.  The  valid question asked by teachers is, "This program is exciting, but where can  I fit it in?  My teaching day is already filled!"  <P>
As we free ourselves from the traditional  concept of academic time blocks (reading  time block, math time block, science time block, etc.), we actually create time.  By integrating subjects, time does double duty in an integrated program.  Art is also science when we draw or paint a chart showing the growth of our bean plant.  It becomes math too when we use those drawings to create a pictograph. Reading /Language Arts are present when we read Jack and the Beanstalk in the unit. This integrated unit incorporates science, art, math, and language arts. Integration is powerful and reinforcing in addition to time caring.<P>

<H2>PLANNING:  THE KEY ELEMENT</H2>
Intergrafting the curriculum does take planning time.  EXPLORING SCIENCE provides an integrated program.  While each teacher adds much of himself/herself to the program taught, EXPLORING SCIENCE offers a strong base of curriculum integration. Curricular areas like reading, art, math, movement, and social sciences are embedding into every exploration.  They can be  easily identified by the linking logos.<P>

<H2>CURRICULUM CONNECTIONS</H2>
For a greater degree of integration, the teacher will use the  CURRICULUM CONNECTIONS sections located at the end of chapters 1 - 4.  There you will find  additional suggestions  in the academic areas of:<P>
<UL>
	READING/ LANGUAGE ARTS<BR>
	MATH<BR>
	VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS<BR>
	HISTORY/ SOCIAL SCIENCE<BR>
	CURRENT ISSUES AND TECHNOLOGY<BR>
</UL><P>
Through using these ideas and combining with those of your own , you will create your own unique integrated program to meet the needs of your classroom.<P>
Some grade level teams are using the organizers to help identify aspects of their school or district curriculum that support integration. This organizer is particularly helpful as teachers explain curriculum integration to parents, whether part of a traditional program, or in year round education.<P>


<H2>HOW TO USE THE GRAPHIC ORGANIZER</H2><P>
<OL>
<LI> Put the SCIENCE UNIT  THEME  in the magnifying glass.

<LI> Select from the Curriculum Connections at the end of each chapter to fill in the other curricular areas.

<LI> Add you own ideas  to as many areas as possible.  This is a brainstorming form.  Don't worry if you have too much or too little.

<LI>  Be on the look out for supplemental materials  you may need to fit your topic.

<LI> Add this planning organizer to your teacher's resource guide next to the unit organizer.  Add to it.   Highlight  ideas that were particularly successful.
</OL><P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  DO THE HANDS ON EXPLORATIONS FIRST.  THEY PROVIDE THE MOTIVATION AND  EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS TO CARRY OVER  TO THEIR OTHER ACADEMICS!<P>

<B>BLANK GENERIC PLANNING ORGANIZERS</B> are located in the Teachers' generic resource masters section.  The following page contains a sample Graphic Organizer (GM-1) for Curriculum Connections filled in for the Bug Explorations (Third Grade - "Being A Scientist")<P>

<H1>TYPES OF GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS AND THEIR USAGE</H1>

	Throughout the program there is a reliance on teacher made, student-made, and interactive charts and graphic organizers. The major reason for this is researched based. We now know that students learn best when material is presented whole to part. A visual representation gives students the big picture. According to Lawerence Lowery, graphic organizers are one of the most powerful tools for the presentation of science concepts.<P>	
	The following types of charts have been used throughout this series. They represent only a few. Each has its own attributes and applications. Many variations are possible.<P><P>

<H2>THE STUDENT INQUIRY CHART</H2> 
	This chart consists of two parts - the known and the unknown. Teachers can structure the questions to focus on the target concept. For example, if students are studying planets, the first question could be <I>"What makes a planet a planet?"</I> rather than <I>"What do you know about planets?".</I> The first question will get generally focused answers. The second query will get a wealth of information and misinformation. <P>
On the right side ask, <I>"What do we wonder about ______?"</I><BR>
<B>HINT: </B>As students tell you something that they "know" and others disagree, say, <I>"I guess we need to find out more about that. We'll put it on the I wonder side."</I><P>

<DT><A HREF="31ib.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=340>Photo of teacher using an Inquiry Chart - 187K</A> <P>

<B>Uses:</B>   As an introductory activity the inquiry chart accesses background information, motivates students with the area of study, and focuses on critical attributes.<P>
	It can be used as a tool throughout the unit to process information.  Add to and correct the "What do we know about" side. Answer the questions on the "what do we wonder about" side. Leave this chart up as the students study. Encourage them to read and discuss the information.<P>
	At the end of the unit, the chart functions as an assessment tool for the teacher.<P><P>



<H2>INPUT CHART</H2>
	This is a teaching tool  utilized during directed lessons. As it is applied in this program, it is a dramatic visual method of imparting the basic background information students need.  A Resource Master and a script are provided for the teacher. It allows you, as the teacher, to "draw" as you give basic facts. For example, if you are teaching the types of whales_toothed and baleen, before the lesson,  you would have used the resource master and the opaque or overhead projector to draw the diagram on white paper using white chalk. On the day of the lesson,  "draw" the parts of the whale as you read the script. Students will think you are an incredible artist. Your talent seems like magic to the students and rivets their attention.<P>



<DT><A HREF="22e5a.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=340>Photo of students studying an Input Chart - 171K </A><P> 


<B>Uses:</B> This type of chart is best used  as an introductory lesson or a mini lesson during the course of study.<P><P>

<H2>MIND MAP</H2>
	In its simple form mind mapping is a technique that quickly generates many ideas, thoughts, feelings, images, and associations around a central topic or area. Each response is written in a non-sequential, diagrammatic form.<P>


 <IMG SRC="whalemap.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=340> <P>





<B>Uses:</B> Generally used as an introductory activity to motivate, focus, and access background information. <P><P>


<H2>LIST, GROUP, LABEL:</H2> 
	This begins as a simple mind map. After many ideas have been listed, the students group responses into categories. The groups are then labeled  according to their critical attribute.  This is a very high level activity that can be applied across the grades. <P>
	Students generate a list. Using the list, highlight various groups with different colored markers. Once all the "blue group " has been identified, the students then decide on a name for that category.<P>

<H2>"T" GRAPH (Generic Master #22)</H2>
The social skills "T" graph is an extremely helpful tool for both students and teachers. When working with cooperative groupings. Students do not necessarily know these skills. They need to be taught  cooperative skills as you would teach any other basic skill. Focus on one skill at a time. For example RESPECT:<P>

	
<IMG SRC="respect.gif" WIDTH=540 HEIGHT=240> <P>

Part of the teacher's role is to record appropriate comments such as those above on the chart as the students are working. At the end of the lesson, review the academic task and the social skill. Save the social skill chart. Post it during another cooperative learning activity, review, and add to it. This strategy works well at all levels. For more information, see the cooperative learning section of the guide.<P>

<B>Uses:</B> To be used at the beginning of a cooperative activity to focus the students on a skill to practice. Stop during the activity to compliment groups and add positive examples to the social skill chart. Use again after the activity for students to assess how they interacted. Continue to use as you begin another cooperative activity.<P>
(Like multiplication facts, a social skill is not mastered after one presentation and practice.)<P><P>

<H2>The categorical "T" graph </H2>
	This "T" Graph is a simple tool to use. It is basically an extension of the listing concept. Students list attributes of two different items.<P> 

 
<IMG SRC="31e3b.gif" WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=340> <P>




<B>Uses:</B> This graphic organizer provides a means of recording data as students study a concept. It is a good method for focused note taking.<P><P>

<H2>The comparison "T" graph</H2>
	This type of graph is an advanced graphic organizer. It requires the students to compare and contrast two items or ideas.<P> 

 

<IMG SRC="tgraf.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=260> <P>




<B>Uses:</B> This is an outstanding tool for assessing student understanding. <P><P>

<H2>VENN DIAGRAM (Generic Master #7 and #8)</H2>
	A Venn Diagram is a useful way of comparing or contrasting two or more subjects visually.  It can  increase in difficulty by adding more and more circles. At the Primary level it can be done using roving and real objects. As students become more mature, the material can become more complex and more circles can be added to increase complexity.<P>

 
<IMG SRC="venns.gif" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=260> <P>




<B>Uses:</B> This type of charting is used to compare, contrast and analyze information. It makes a fine assessment tool.<P><P>


<H2>CHARTS AND GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS AS AN ON GOING TEACHING TOOL</H2>
	These types of charts and graphic organizers are used throughout the program. To use them effectively, they need to be left up for students to refer to often. Teachers need to "process" them often. This means that teachers need to go over the charts with the students to review, revise, and add information. It is in this way that students learn how scientists work. First scientists brainstorm their thoughts. As scientists learn, explore, communicate with others, do further research; they refine, revise, and add to their data. As they do so, they ask new questions.  By modeling this activity for the students, they learn not only information but process.<P><P><P>

<H1>ACCESS TO SCIENCE FOR THE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT STUDENT</H1>
<P>
<B><I>"In California, at any given time, one half of the class is from different ethnic groups."</I> </B>
(J. Cummins 1991).
<P>	
The number of Limited English proficient students has increased dramatically in California over the last decade.  A large portion of today's elementary students (K-8) are LEP and the numbers have doubled since 1985.  The 1980 and 1990 census show that the Hispanic population grew by more than 50% and Asian population by more than 100% (Moore and Moore 1991).  In 1991, 30% of incoming kindergarten students were non-English speaking.  Currently over 100 languages are represented in the schools.  Other states are experiencing equally dramatic changes in student population. The need for comprehensible, meaningful., cross-culturally sensitive instruction is clear.
<P>
For too long, the issue of primary language instruction has been a political issue.  For second language learners, growth in the content areas has been put on hold while learning English.  A series of recent well-controlled studies have reconfirmed the theory that strengthening the primary language also strengthens English Language Arts and Math (Peel 1991; Ramirez, U.S. Department of Education 1991; and Swain and Lapkin 1984).  It is clear that literacy in the primary language promotes not only a strong bilingual competence, but a stronger competence in the second language acquired.
<P>
<B><I>"Comprehensible input is the most important method of learning and language accumulating. ... especially in core curriculum."</I> </B>
(Dr. S. Kreshen).
<P>	

A study by Dr. Berman (Berkeley 1991, commissioned by the California Legislature) reminds us that in these years of shifting demographics we must have flexible approaches.  In areas where there is a heavy concentration of one primary language (L1), a bilingual late-exit program is clearly indicated.  However, in areas where there are multiple primary languages (L1) and insufficient concentrations of one L1, English based approaches are suggested.
<P>
<B><I>"Cooperative, hands-on science is the best method of language acquisition."</I> </B>
(Dr. Anna Chamot).
<P>	

<HR>
Regardless of the language of instruction used, the research is also clear as to what kinds of strategies are crucial elements for language acquisition.  From Vagotsky to Cummins, in research ranging from bilingual education, reading, psycholinguistics, to the brain, studies show that in order to change inert information to knowledge interactive, experiential, and critical types of instruction strategies are required.  Minds have to meet in an interactional space (in what Vagotsky calls the "zone of proximal development") to create knowledge from information.
<P>
<B>Science is a perfect vehicle for language acquisition in primary language or English.</B>  For the most effective, efficient language acquisition, it is crucial to have a science program that is kept interactive, experiential, and critical.  The following elements, found in this program, not only encourage access to core science, but they develop active, literate scientists.
<UL>
<LI> experiential, hands-on activities and experiments
<LI> teachers ensuring that information given orally or in written form is comprehensible, by use of strategies such as: graphic organizers, visuals, picture file cards, active  participation, and variation in ways repeating key information.
<LI> lots of chances to practice orally the language and concepts they have acquired what Michael Long calls "negotiating for meaning" with each other: discussion in partners/groups, co-op learning.
	- scientists confer and share hypotheses
	- builds language development
</UL>
<P>
<H2>"Cooperative Learning, Partner Discussions"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> non-assumptive teaching; accessing, focusing and building background information, accessing personal experience.
<LI> opportunities for direct experiences at the beginning of units, not the end
	- builds active involved scientists
	- builds active involved language learners
	- vocabulary and concepts are more comprehensible when developed with concrete objects
</UL>
<P>
<H2>"Hands on Explorations"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> developing the metacognitive, problem-solving processes of students.
	- use of brain compatible strategies that fostered understanding and developed hypotheses and problem solving key for scientists
	- use of brain compatible strategies; build understanding and encourage risk-taking with language and hypotheses
</UL>
<P>
<H2>"Teacher and Student Friendly; Use of Charts, graphs; Use of problem-solving hypotheses; Being a Scientist"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> a risk-free environment of low anxiety and high self esteem, where students feel free to take risks with language and concepts: modelling and encouraging , not correcting
<LI> high expectations of success
	- builds in young scientist the confidence to make decisions and hypotheses
	- builds in language learners the confidence to risk making hypotheses and decisions
</UL>
<P>
<H2>"Teacher and Student Friendly; Alternative Means of Assessment; Success for All Students"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> learning made meaningful by integration, high interest subjects and personal involvement
	- builds scientific ability to make connections across fields/experiments
	- builds language development ability to make connections and see patterns across language and
	  content
</UL>
<P>
 <H2>"Scientist, Teacher, Society, Learning Linked to Other Curriculum Areas"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> However, the single most important element in the classroom is cross-cultural respect.  If teacher respect for the language, culture, and life experiences of each child as well as student respect for each other is absent from the classroom, the result is an increasing sense of alienation from education (Cummins 1989, Cortez 1990).  Even in a field such as science, the child's language,  culture and experience can be validated with appropriate strategies.
	- builds in scientist respect for different backgrounds, ideas and hypotheses; belief that their ideas
	  matter
	- builds in language learners respect for different backgrounds, ideas and language; builds belief, 
	  security and pride in own culture
</UL>
<P>
 <H2>"Home School Activities; Student Centered Science; Scientists Notebook"</H2>
<UL>
<LI> books in many languages, logs and journals written in primary languages
<LI> opportunities to process learnings in both primary language and English, by use of cross-age, peer and trained bilingual tutors, or parent volunteers to validate, encourage, and build primary language
<LI> scientists studied from many cultures, recognition of the contributions in science from many cultures
<LI> personal reflections and sharing by children in an environment of respect cooperative learning can help build that respect if social skills are also taught.  Celebrating Cinco de Mayo is not sufficient to build respect for other cultures.  People learn respect for others by working together successfully.

<H1>ACCESS TO SCIENCE FOR THE STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES</H1>

<I>The following evaluation has been furnished courtesy of Dr. Judy K. Montgomery, Ph. D., Cognition and Language, Assistant Professor, Special Education, School of Education, Chapman University.</I><P><P>

<B><I>Access to core curriculum by Special Needs students is best done in a cooperative learning environment using hands-on science.</I></B><P><P>

Students with disabilities have frequently missed out on instruction in science in their classroom as that time was often used for reinforcement of reading and mathematics. These students are less likely to learn science material incidentally, or on their own. Finally, the vocabulary and scientific terms used in this subject can pose additional barriers for the child with special needs. Therefore, the most important concerns to be addressed in delivering instruction in science to students with disabilities are awareness and participation. Students need to be aware of the opportunities to participate in science activities and projects, and to become active learners in their classrooms. Success in science may require some modification of the extent and scope of the material to be acquired; however, expectations should remain high for these students to grasp science concepts and demonstrate understanding of processes, relationships and systemic changes in science. The standards for grades should be consistent for all students, and based upon the expectancy that all students can succeed.<P>
Students with disabilities are more likely to learn and retain science content if they have equal access to it with their peers in the classroom, can benefit from collaboration by special education support personnel, experience more than one encounter with complex concepts, have new information linked to prior knowledge, and can observe role models sharing their experiences.<P>
Educators frequently utilize pre-teach, teach, and re-teach routines to assure success for those students. The teacher's belief that all students can achieve is critically important. Discovering and nurturing a student's special interest in an aspect of science results in new knowledge and student success.<P>

<H2>IN THE CLASSROOM</H2>
<B>The special education student benefits from:<BR>
<OL>
	Routines, common unifying structure to each lesson<BR>
    	Material introduced within context of experience<BR>
	Cooperative learning<BR>
	Frequent checks for understanding<BR>
	Clearly defined objectives/purpose for learning<BR>
	Hands-on experience<BR>
	Pairing with more accomplished students<BR>
	New ideas tied to real life experiences<BR>
	Activity-oriented tasks<BR>
	Rehearsals<BR>
	Multi-sensory approach<BR>
	Small group instruction<BR>
	Opportunities to demonstrate knowledge in alternative forms<BR>
	Modeling from other students</B>
</OL><P>
The student-centered science series has been written to incorporate these strategies. Students with disabilities can take an active part in science instruction in their classrooms.<P><P>

<Title>Chapter 1</title>


<H1>
"At Risk" Can Achieve!</H1>



<B><I>"Science is like the air we breathe, it is everywhere."</I></B>  Dwight D. Eisenhower<P><P>

Each district has its own per cent definition of "At Risk"; however, all agree that the significantly underperforming student is at risk of dropping out of school. This is based on logic and factual statistics. No person likes to continue in an environment where he/she is failing. The simple reality is that failure breeds further failure for a significant portion of the population.<P>

Parents also enter the equation. The performance and attitudes of the parents are usually passed down to the children. The expectation of failure provides an atmosphere of "why try". This is an obvious stumbling block to raising the student out of the failure pit that the child finds himself/herself. A further factor becomes visible at parent conferences where parents either do not appear, or are defensive or belligerent about the <I>expected </I>negative comments concerning their child.<P>

The question is, how do we resolve these difficult problems? Clearly, we will always have students in the bottom 50%, by definition. Can we take the risk of dropping out from the equation for most of them? The answer is YES! But, only if we give them an avenue of feeling successful. US Army studies more than 50 years ago showed that this feeling of success has to be accomplished through actual achievement. It can not come from praise, "happy faces", or any of the other psychological ploys that strive to convince the students that they can achieve. So, how do we provide this success for those student who expect to fail? Hands-on, cooperative study group SCIENCE is the answer.<P><P>

<B><I>"A scientist experiences no failures, only unprofitable avenues to pursue." </I></B><BR>
Dr. Jonas Salk<P><P>
The 1995 National Science Education Standards provide a framework for providing success for these students. After all, these are the same students who will leave the classroom and shoot baskets for hours seeking the perfect "swish". The new standards hide their weaknesses:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> poor self-esteem<BR>
<LI> poor study skills<BR>
<LI> lack of discipline<BR>
<LI> lack of family support<BR>
<LI> poor reading skills<BR>
<LI> poor communication skills<P>
</UL>

and play to their strengths:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> active appreciation of hands-on<BR>
<LI> willingness to work, <I>when not threatened</I><BR>
<LI> interest in the world around them<BR>
<LI> desire to know "why"<BR>
<LI> desire for the feeling of "success"<P>
</UL><P>

Implementing the new 1995 standards provide for the Chapter 1 (At Risk) student in many ways. The fear of failure, and threats to self esteem are banished by:<P>
<UL>
<LI> Routines, common unifying structure to each lesson<BR>
<LI> Material introduced within context of experience<BR>
<LI> Cooperative learning<BR>
<LI> Frequent checks for understanding<BR>
<LI> Clearly defined objectives/purpose for learning<BR>
<LI> Hands-on experience<BR>
<LI> Pairing with more accomplished students<BR>
<LI> New ideas tied to real life experiences<BR>
<LI> Activity-oriented tasks<BR>
<LI> Rehearsals<BR>
<LI> Multi-sensory approach<BR>
<LI> Small group instruction<BR>
<LI> Opportunities to demonstrate knowledge in alternative forms<BR>
<LI> Modeling from other students<P>
</UL><P>
The impact of a program written to these requirements is indicated in one small study. A medium sized school district in central California decided to use this program in a six week summer school to the worst half of their grade 2 to 6 "at risk" students. Based on solid past experience with these students and parents, anticipated student academic growth was low, and parent involvement non-existent.<P>

The teachers received the materials on Friday and began teaching on Monday. At the completion of the six weeks, their was a wrap-up conference. To everyone's surprise, 85% of the parents appeared. The common refrain from the students was, "I am not stupid like I thought." The students returned to their regular curriculum in the fall.<P>

The following January, the parents were surveyed concerning their children's academic growth during the summer school. Eighty percent felt that it was significant. Testing in March indicated less achievement. Only 65% were at or above grade level.<P>

The logical questions are:<BR>
Why were the estimates of achievement higher than the actual growth?<BR>
Would the growth been higher is the students had continued with the summer program into the regular classrooms in the fall?<P>

It is felt, by the authors of EXPLORING SCIENCE, that the answers to both questions are the same. There was a loss of growth and achievement when these students returned to the academic environment that had produced their earlier failures. <P>

The 1995 National Science Education Standards have called for a paradigm shift in how science, and all curriculum, is taught. It has been validated in limited studies. Our goal for the coming year is to extend these studies to show how great an impact this new teaching method will have for the future. By definition, every classroom will have half of its students in the bottom half. However, it is not necessary that these students drop out of school or become non-functional members of society.<P><P><P>

<Title>Society and Current Issues</Title>
<H1>VALUES, CURRENT ISSUES, AND SOCIETY</H1>


Science cannot be taught in a vacuum. Current issues, ethics, and values are part of science and the teaching of science. <I>Children look for fairness.</I> They want their world to have the "good guys" winning and they seek answers and right in their studies. Science has answers and more questions. The questions of science are often the questions of society.<P>


In <B>EXPLORING SCIENCE</B>, controversial questions are part of the engagement. Hands-on, minds on science cannot be taught without asking hard questions. <I>"Mr. Jackson, why do developers want to build apartments where the kit fox lives?" "Mrs. Esteban, what about the toxic waste? Why do they want to dump it near our town?" "Ms. Akbar, since hydraulic mining tore up the land, why did people do it?"</I> Frequently a science program that encourages students to think also encourages questions. The questions are not for the teacher, however, to answer.<P>

Hands-on, minds-on science has students seeking out substantive data, often using the scientific method or an experimental model. Students can apply similar methods to collect information and ferret out sound data. Encouraging students to discuss the issues at home as well as at school helps too. <I>Parents want and need to be involved.</I> Children deserve opportunities to study, to understand, to reach conclusions about issues, even controversial ones. <P>



What values are legitimately taught in the science classroom? <B>Honesty</B>--report the data as you find it, not as you would like to find it. <B>Cooperation</B>--work together for a better community. Respect--honor life, whether it is human or animal or plant. <B>Curiosity</B>--be filled with wonder about the world and life and how things work. <B>Perseverance</B>--look for answers beyond just one word, simple responses. <B>Responsibility</B>--both for self and for others. <B>Resourcefulness</B>--use the talents, abilities, and resources one has to solve problems. Are not these values common to virtually all racial, ethnic, and religious groups? These values draw people together rather than separate them.<P>



Technology often is the product of science. <I>Values influence how technology will be used.</I> For example, it may be possible to provide low cost electrical power to a state through a nuclear facility which would be located on the state's major river. The facility would produce a substantial amount of nuclear waste. It would change the temperature of the water in the river for some distance downstream, ending the journey of the salmon and influencing what could live in the river. Values temper that which is technologically possible with that which is best for people and the environment. Our students will face these decisions. Science and technology operate within a society. Societies, by design or default, have values. <P>





In EXPLORING SCIENCE, values are imbedded in the program. Issues are considered. Thinking skills are honed. <B><I>Student scientists think, and wonder, and evaluate</I></B>.<P><P><P>

<H1>HOME-SCHOOL CONNECTION</H1>

Home involvement is a critical factor in student success. Dr. Stephen Glenn found in his research   on  <B><I>Developing Capable People</I></B> that parents who ask at least one question (that cannot be answered by yes or no) about school on a daily basis see marked improvement in their child's school performance.<P>

Given this powerful research,  there are home-school activities built in to every lesson in the program. These activities are non threatening and not intended to be graded. In one summer school test with Chapter 1, "At Risk", students, it was found that the parents do become involved. The expectation was that no parents would attend the wrap-up conference. In spite of past experience, 85% of the parents attended. All of those parents questioned remarked that they appreciated the excitement of their children and their chance to become involved.<P> 

 

Science is the process of discovery. Discovering something for yourself is exciting and fun. By  doing activities at home that have been either done in class or explained in class, students can share  their learning with their parents. This places the student in the role of the explainer. By involving the family, the student has more opportunities to explore and discuss a concept, which results in greater understanding.<P>


<H2>Grade Level Typical Activities:</H2>


In <B>Kindergarten</B> students bring home their Scientist's Notebooks at the end of every exploration. This allows the parents to see and discuss their child's learning.<P>  


A <B>first grader</B>, during the unit on simple machines, would be observing  parents working with tools such as the can opener, drill, screwdriver, and egg beater. Whenever appropriate, the child would bring the tool to school to share.<P>


Observing chemical changes that take place in the kitchen during dinner preparations are included in the home-school activities at <B>second grade</B><P>.


To practice the scientific thinking process of ordering, a third grade</B> student will make an energy histogram of the family to share with parents.<P>
 


<B>Fourth grade</B> families will be asked to share experiences they had during an earthquake.<P>


During <B>fifth grade</B>, a several day observation of the moon at 8 pm requests parents and other family members to observe too, sharing what they see.<P>


A <B>sixth grader</B> will need assistance in tracking the convection currents in the home. As the parent and child work together, the student gains understanding of the concept and more efficient ways to heat the house may result.<P><P><P>

<Title>Authentic Assessment</Title>
<H1>Assessment in Exploring Science</H1>

<B>Dale Carlson, Assistant Superintendent of Public Instruction in California, submits that assessment is changing and <I>". . . the term authentic assessment simply means that we want assessment to focus on authentic, worthwhile learning, and to carry out that assessment in a manner that does not violate the intent of the goal."</I>  [California Curriculum News Report, Volume 16, No. 3, pg. 1].</B><P><P>

Authentic assessment, or as it often is called, performance-based assessment, models good instruction. There is a focus on integration with other subject areas, i.e. the writing approach to tell how to identify a rock sample. Instead of one hundred questions with little depth, authentic assessments are imbedded in the instruction, or they are periods of evaluation utilizing the same instructional models and tools. Authentic assessment, like hands-on instruction, relates to the real world and real world science.<P>


Exploring Science is a hands-on, minds-on program. Assessment is ongoing, not an appendage. Making entries in the Scientist's Notebook, performing individually and in learning groups, approaching solutions to problems using a variety of strategies are part of the program and part of the assessment. Assessment options are included in each exploration.<P> 

The purpose of assessment is to improve learning, not to sort children. The focus of assessment should be on what students know and can do rather than what they do not know and cannot do. With hands-on science, assessing students must be part of the process.<P>	


Objectives for the performance-based testing done at grade 6 by the California Assessment Program have been adopted as the objectives for assessment in Exploring Science at all grade levels. Effective assessment:
<UL>
<LI> Provides opportunities for students to find connections among scientific concepts and principles.<BR>
<LI> Encourages students to discover and construct, through inquiry and investigation, the important ideas of science.<BR>
<LI> Engages students in science thinking processes embedded in content.<BR>
<LI> Enables students to move beyond the activity to apply knowledge and conceptual understanding.<BR>
<LI> Allows students to demonstrate understanding by doing, by designing and performing investigations that ask them to observe, measure, classify, sort, infer, detect patterns, formulate hypotheses, and interpret results.<BR>
</UL>
[California Curriculum News Report, Volume 16, No. 3, pg 5].<P><P>



A continuing aspect of the Exploring Science in both program and student assessment is the Scientist's Notebook. Scientists are record keepers. In this log are samples of work and the use of the scientific process. The Scientist's Notebook will demonstrate student growth as entries are made through the year. The Scientist's Notebook is a portfolio. If done as recommended in Exploring Science, it provides evidence of performance, not just recitation of facts. It reflects a strong instructional program. Through the successes and accomplishments chronicled, the student will see him/herself as a problem solver. Parents at conference time will be able to review what the student has done in science. The long term nature of learning is evident to parents, teacher, and the student. The Scientist's Notebook for each child will be different from any other, recognizing different styles of learning.<P>

To incorporate some of the flavor of the traditional portfolio, the student, particularly in grades two through six, might be encouraged to select one assignment every four weeks which he/she believes is his/her best work or most significant achievement. Have the student write on a card or small form designed for this activity why this is his/her best work or most significant achievement and staple that card to the sheet in the Scientist's Notebook. A student who is encouraged to have an active role in his/her own evaluation is more likely to reflect upon what he/she has accomplished.<P>



Within most explorations, students formulate and test hypotheses, gather and evaluate data, explain concepts and processes in their Scientist's Notebooks and in other ways as well. Students are provided opportunities to demonstrate their understanding through developing a wide range of products. Sections of the exploration include evaluation and extensions.  Often both of these suggest means to evaluate that which has been learned. This is hands-on, minds-on instruction, but it also is authentic assessment and individual student assessments may be done using these data. Teachers using Exploring Science will find performance-based assessment a natural part of the program.<P>



Activities and questions throughout the explorations are both assessment and instruction. In the evaluation section, the focus is specifically assessment at several levels ranging from performance to understanding. Typical performance assessments ask, Did the student keep a record of the Worm World observations? and Did the student share responsibly as he/she worked as a member of a team? <P>




Assessment of understanding also involves performance, but of a different nature:
<UL>
<B>Kindergarten:</B> What senses did you use to find out about the wind? What did you find out?<BR>
<B>Grade One:</B> Why are plants always at the bottom of the food chain? What would happen if all the algae in the pond were eaten and no new algae grew?<BR>
<B>Grade Two:</B> How does a whale's blubber help it survive in the ocean ecosystem? What part does the gray whale play in the ocean food chain?<BR>
<B>Grade Three:</B> Can the student explain how mold, mushrooms, and earthworms are alike? Can the student hypothesize what would happen if there were not decomposers in the forest?<BR>
<B>Grade Four:</B> Why is it important that plants have so many ways to reproduce? Respond in the SCIENTIST'S NOTEBOOK through words and/or pictures.<BR>
<B>Grade Five:</B> What are possible effects of pollution on the water cycle? Draw and write about this potential problem.<BR>
<B>Grade Six:</B> What is the same about goldfish and guppies? What is different? What seems to be common for all fish? Why?<P>
</UL><P>
Often teachers who have not used authentic assessment as the primary model in assessing student performance are concerned that such assessment is too subjective and that it lacks clarity. Rubrics, or sets of expectations for responses with scores assigned, often are part of authentic or performance-based assessment and provide benchmarks or standards. (CAP Writing is a prime example of a performance-based assessment using a rubric.) Informally, teachers have designed rubrics to assist in evaluating performances since the beginning of the teaching and learning process. Formalizing the system with a rubric is appropriate. Rubrics may be developed for other products too including demonstrations, activity projects from the text, etc.<P>




<H2>Rubrics may be simple or complex:</H2>

<B>1 point</B>-minimal description, generally inaccurate<BR>
<B>2 points</B>-limited accurate detail<BR>
<B>3 points</B>-describes and elaborates with detail and limited inference<BR>
<B>4 points</B>-describes with exquisite detail and inference.<P>

 Younger children may illustrate responses or give verbal responses to questions.  A simple rubric remains helpful.  What are the key items to consider?  Is the child's response simply restating the question or does the child use the tools he has to craft a well thought out, reasonable response?   <P> 

Writing assignments in science frequently are appropriate, particularly in grades two through six for most students, yet for some students such assignments must be modified or recast. Special education students who are mainstreamed into your class and other students who have individual educational plans need special attention. After you review the student's IEP, you may need to modify the expectations. Instead of writing, it may be necessary to have the student tell what he would do directly, or have the student tell a "scribe" so you may read his response with the others. Another approach for effectively assessing what the special needs student understands is to have the materials you would expect a student giving a competent response would refer to in his/her response on a table and ask the special student to show you how to perform the task. For either approach, it may be appropriate to ask the special education teacher to share his/her instructional paraprofessional for the hour. <P> 



Limited English Proficient children present a similar challenge. The classroom teacher should know the competency level of the student in his/her first language as well as in English. It might be appropriate for the written response to be in the first language and have the response translated.  The "show me" assessment may be better for a Limited English Proficient child and the teacher. The key to authentic assessment for students with special needs is to understand how they can best communicate and use those channels. Time should not be established as a hurdle for these students. <P>



Perhaps the last two points regarding special needs students should be generalized and used for all students.  The purpose of assessment with hands-on science is not to catch students doing something wrong. We want to see what they do know and find ways for them to communicate it, then build on that understanding. Alternative means of meeting an assignment are often needed. The following list of alternative products may prove useful, as will the assessments in each exploration throughout Exploring Science.<P>

<Title>Meeting the NEW 1995 US Science Standards - Elementary</Title>
<H1>The NEW 1995 US Standards Are Yours!</H1>

<I>The goals for school science that underlie the National Science Education Standards are to educate students who are able to:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> use scientific principals and processes appropriately in making personal decisions;<BR>
<LI> experience the richness and excitement of knowing about and understanding the natural world;<BR>
<LI> increase their economic productivity; and<BR>
<LI> engage intelligently in public discourse and debate about matters of scientific and technological concern.
</UL></I><BR>
1995 National Science Education Standards (P. 1-5, top).<P><P>

An extended synopsis of the Standards is addressed under the report of:  
<DT><A HREF="tenplus.htm">10 Critical Science Instruction Needs +2</A><P>

Basically, the report requires five things be present in the science curriculum:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Scientific process<BR>
<LI> Thematic science relationships<BR>
<LI> Hands-on<BR>
<LI> Authentic Assessment<BR>
<LI> Integrated Curriculum<P>
</UL>
One difference between graduate school and elementary school is that only best prepared can go to graduate school. The question becomes, what do we do with those unprepared even for high school graduation? Can our society continue if a significant portion of its citizens are not fully productive? The answer should be obvious. The <B>Goals 2000</B> program is an effort to address the needs of the American society in the 21st century by educating its children to be first in the world in math and science, and hopefully, other studies. The next question is, can we teach ALL of the students without good teaching and good teaching materials?<P><P>


As the 1995 Science Standards state, the seminal work done by Project 2061 provides insight into solving the teaching of relationships between science disciplines. 
< DT><A HREF="do2061.htm">Meeting the Project 2061 Benchmarks.</A> However, within the field of science education, it has fallen on the 1995 Standards to document the requirement for an integrated curriculum. <B>These new standards actually reflect what the best elementary teachers have been doing out of necessity.</B>
<DT><A HREF="1curconn.htm"> Integrating the Curriculum</A>
 <P>
The best possible indication of the impact that the new 1995 US Science Standards can have if implemented across the country is in the results achieved by a third grade class in California. This class of 33 students, 40% ESL, seven different languages, with Special Needs Inclusion students competed against gifted fifth graders across the nation. Their achievement can only be attributed to the fact that they had been taught by teachers (3of 4 were authors of EXPLORING SCIENCE) who have been practicing daily the requirements of the new Standards. The team that finished second in the US entered kindergarten with no English, speaking only Chinese, Hindi, or Farsi, their native tongues.
<DT><A HREF="1winning.htm"> Winning the NASA/NSTA Space Science Involvement Program</A><P>
The teachers decided to write this type of curriculum to solve the problems that existed in their classrooms. As mentor teachers, they also had the incentive of producing materials that could be easily and effectively transmitted to other teachers. <DT><A HREF="whydid.htm">The Why of EXPLORING SCIENCE. </A>

<H1>Science Understanding</H1>



Understanding is easier when information is developed actively with Cooperative/Collaborative Learning, hands-on explorations, AND is related to other known information. <B>Project 2061</B>, American Association for the Advancement of Science, produced <I>"Science for All Americans"</I>, a report defining the rationale for teaching thematically. <I>"Science for All Americans"</I> asked that <B>Physical, Earth, and Life Science</B> be taught at the same time linked by theme to provide true understanding. EXPLORING SCIENCE teaches thematically, but it also includes two additional themes. All grade levels, K-6, start with a theme of <B>Being a Scientist</B> to teach process, problem solving, documentation, and communication. They end with a chapter tied to <B>History/Social Science</B> to show how scientists work within a context.<P><P>

<Title>SCIENCE INSTRUCTION</Title>
<H1>10 Critical Science Instruction Needs + 2</H2>
<P>
<B>1. Success for all students:</B> Student-measurable growth increments generate a sense of accomplishment and a desire for more successes. Active learning is long term!
<P>
<B>2. Hands on explorations:</B> <I>"They cannot simply "know" that something is so; they must demonstrate it. Hands-on learning can transform science learning by engaging the student in the process of science."</I> (1)
<P>
<B>3. "Being a Scientist":</B> Emphasizing student practices that match the behavior of adult scientists in their search for knowledge provides both behavior modeling and success. <I><B>Students become empowered</B>.</I>
<P>
<B>4. "Scientist's Notebook"</B>: Scientists maintain detailed notebooks, both for review and to share with the scientific community. These notebooks involve both writing and art (integrated curriculum and portfolio assessment). <B>All subject areas</B> benefit from students following this practice.
<P>
<B>5. Cooperative learning:</B><I> "Learning is interactive and occurs in a social context. The vision is to transform the classroom into a learning community where ideas are shared, evidence is used to strengthen ideas, and there is a willingness to change ideas through exploration, dialog, and discourse."</I> (1)
<P>
<B>6. Links to other curricular areas:</B> <I>"Curricula must be changed ... to weaken or eliminate rigid subject matter boundaries ... to present the scientific endeavor as a social enterprise that strongly influences -- and is influenced by -- human thought and action ..."</I>(3)
<P>
<B>7. Home-School Connections:</B> These activities should be extensions of the hands-on class explorations. Rather than the usual homework drill, they are opportunities for positive student and parent interaction.
<P>
<B>8. Alternative means of assessment:</B> <I>"We need to avoid or reduce a fear of being "wrong," and encourage their delight at the unexpected. The teacher engages students in problem solving by asking probing questions, promoting inquiry, and guiding discussion with the use of hands-on materials. ... Children must be offered many different options for communicating what they know and understand." </I> (1)
<P>
<B>9. Teacher friendly materials:</B> <I>"Elementary school teachers do not need to be experts in every aspect of science; in fact, most scientists are experts in only a narrow specialty. But they do need a general background in science content."</I> (1)  Alternatively, the materials need to provide this background.
<P>
<B>10. Real Scientists:</B> Addressing what motivated individuals to become scientists provides positive role models for the students. Biographies of scientists should demonstrate that science is enjoyable and that barriers of culture, language, and finances can be overcome. 
<P>
<B>+1. Affordable Materials:</B> Readily available materials provide the student opportunities to repeat the activities outside the classroom, contributing to long term learning. They also save school budgets!
<P>
<B>+2. Thematic Approach:</B><I> "... The common element from research and studies is that the curriculum highlight major ideas, concepts, or themes (across disciplines), "the big ideas," so that detailed information about science becomes connected, becomes meaningful, and contributes to successful problem solving."</I>(1)

<Title>Themes</Title>

<H1>The Themes</H1>
<P><P>

A theme is a common thread of discourse that unifies, and makes clear, apparently disparate subject matters. However, to be effective, <B>any theme based program must also be strongly content based</B>. Exploring Science provides in-depth, grade level appropriate content upon which the students are able to link their understanding and questioning.
<P>
The use of themes in this program provides a framework of understanding of the <B><I>relationships </I></B>between <B>Physical, Earth, and Life</B> Sciences for the future scientist in training. The student performs physical, earth, and life science experiments (explorations), linked by theme, using the scientific thinking processes to develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts and terminology.
<P>
In the not too distant past, many thought that almost all science knowledge had been attained. We now know that this is not true. Every day new data is being developed that indicates that many widely held theories are incomplete, or even incorrect. However, this fact leads to an impossible level of difficulty for creating student  understanding in the face of excessive "data". As a result, the new model of teaching science is based on the linkage of theme. In this way, the teacher can use the neural net model of learning by liking similarities in different fields. The development of many isolated fields of scientific study can be partially attributed to inadequate understanding of how things worked by previous generations of scientists. There are scientists today that cite the forest vs. tree problem.
<P>
The breadth of meaning of the themes provides a great deal of overlap in many cases. Because of this, many of the explorations have sub themes listed. The following brief discussion is merely an introduction to themes and their development throughout the program. More detail, appropriate to grade level and specific thematic emphasis,  is provided in each chapter. 
<P><P>




<H2>Being A Scientist:</H2>
At the turn of the century, Einstein fought the doctrine that all science knowledge was known and needed to be merely regurgitated. We now know that little is truly known. Each new question needs to be approached with an open mind using the study techniques of a scientist. At the beginning of each year, the students will first be taught to apply the Scientific Thinking Processes in a series of explorations utilizing, and enhancing, the techniques of scientific research. The importance of a broad background, communication, and hands-on is also emphasized. Each of the grades will use core themes around which the concepts, theories and content of science is organized.

<B>Grade 5:</B> Scale And Structure / Systems And Interaction<BR>
<B>Grade 6:</B> Scale And Structure / Systems And Interactions<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Energy:</H2>
Energy is the central concept unifying all science. Traditionally taught, it is extremely complex. In simple terms, energy is present whenever anything has a change in state, whether that change is size, shape, location, movement, temperature, or structure. All changes, observable or not, are the result of energy in some form. <P>
Some forms of energy require an expenditure of energy to get started. If the result produces more energy, the object had potential. Nuclear power is an example. Objects moving have kinetic energy that can be transmitted to other objects.<P>
<UL>
<B>Grade 1:</B> The seasons are caused by different amounts of energy being available from the sun. Life adapts to these changes.<BR>
<B>Grade 3:</B> There are many kinds of energy. Different types of energy sources can produce the same outcome. The sun is our primary source.<BR>
<B>Grade 4:</B> Earthquakes are energy released. All life and growth are from consuming (burning) food sources. Both atomic and chemical compounding result in energy activities.<BR>
<B>Grade 6:</B> There are sources of energy all around us and beneath our feet. Energy moves the earth's crust and drives food chains.<BR>
</UL>

<P>



<H2>Evolution:</H2>
Given time, everything changes (mutates). The earth has volcanoes, earthquakes, and uplifting. Bacteria change frequently, so that drugs are no longer effective. The dinosaurs no longer exist. However, the eohippus is now the horse. Successful changes survive; the rest disappear.<P>
Changes are now known to have happened both over long periods and  virtually instantaneously in both biological and geological terms.<P>
In the early grades, certain non-evolutionary changes are used to prepare the student for later, in depth work.<P>
<UL>
<B>Grade 1:</B>  Earth and animals change overtime. Some things become extinct. Natural resources can be conserved.<BR>
<B>Grade 2:</B> Volcanoes happen, mountains rise, and rocks wear down. Adaptation takes place. The eohippus (possibly a missing link) became the horse. Fossil fuels are explored.<BR>
<B>Grade 6:</B> Genetic material influences the ability to adapt. Volcanoes and plate tectonics create both quick and gradual change.<BR>
</UL>
<P>

<H2>Patterns of Change:</H2><P>
Patterns of Change provides a framework for creating understanding when changes exist. Patterned changes fall into three general categories:<P>
<OL>
	<LI> Changes that are steady trends -> one directional, or constant acceleration.
	<LI> Changes that occur in cycles -> similar to a pendulum.
	<LI> Changes that are irregular -> no apparent pattern (chaos).
</OL><P>
The student needs to understand that constant acceleration MAY not be possible (Einstein's Theory).<BR>
The duration of investigation may make both types 2 and 3 appear to be 3. That is, doubt  exists until greater than one cycle of type 2 has been exhibited. However, recent work in the field of Chaos has cast doubt on the existence of true randomness. The student must be open to new findings from research.<P>
<UL>
<B>Grade K:</B> Weather changes. The earth has hills, valleys, rivers, and oceans.<BR> 
<B>Grade 1:</B> Soil erodes, and plants and animals grow.<BR>
<B>Grade 4:</B> Crystals grow, and sedimentary rocks form. Diverse bird forms show niche filling. Fossils show adaptation to change, or lack of adaptation.<BR>
<B>Grade 5:</B> Convection currents influence weather. Weather influences adaptations. Physical and chemical changes occur throughout nature.<BR>
</UL>


<P>


<H2>Systems And Interactions:</H2>
A system is any collection of objects that influence each other. Each part of the system is truly understandable in the context of interaction between the members of that system. Traditionally, systems have been listed as being open, that is being influenced by things outside the system, and closed. An open system is actually a subsystem which is treated as a system for simplification. For example, the human organ interactions are studied as part of the body system, even though the body cannot exist without food, air, water, et cetera. The discussion of interactions between systems actually indicates the existence of a larger system of which the discussed "systems" are actually subsystems.<P>
<UL>
<B>Grade 1:</B> Heat and light from the sun, minerals from the earth, and water build life.<BR>
<B>Grade 2:</B> The water cycle, combined with the ocean currents, move nutrients and moisture necessary for life. This subsystem greatly impacts weather patterns and life. Whale adaptations studied.<BR>
<B>Grade 3:</B> The forest ecosystem is viewed as a linkage of microbes, fungus, trees, producers, and consumers (cougars).<BR>
<B>Grade 6:</B> The human body is a magnificent machine. Organs interact. Limbs work as levers. The systems are bound together in a unit.<BR>
</UL><P>

<H2>Scale And Structure:</H2>
Scale denotes magnitude. Blowing wind varies from a baby's breath to a hurricane. Size is relative to the viewer and distance. A superficial series of introductory questions might be: How large is the sun? How large is the cat - to a man? - to a mouse?<P>
Structure describes the form of an object. An object is identifiable by its shape and components, reduced to the level where it is minimally identifiable. As in the description of a system, a structure will have substructures (atoms in a molecule). Structures are building blocks.<P>
<UL>
<B>Grade K:</B> Objects can be identified by their shape and size through our senses.<BR>
<B>Grade 2:</B>  Minerals are the building blocks of the earth. Plants and animals scale and adapt their structures to their environment. Crystals have characteristic structures.<BR>
<B>Grade 4:</B> The topography of the earth is made up of its building blocks. Organisms are built up from cells. All matter can be reduced to atomic particles.<BR>
<B>Grade 5:</B> Sampling allows estimations of great magnitude. All organisms in the ecosystem are connected and interdependent.<BR>
</UL><P>




<H2>Stability:</H2>
Stability is a relative term indicating constancy. There are three forms of total stability:<P>
<OL>
	<LI>Never change.
	<LI> Always change, at a constant rate in a constant direction.
	<LI> Equilibrium, or the ability of an object to return to its starting point, reliably, after an outside force has been applied.<P>
</OL>

<UL>
<B>Grade 1:</B> Using senses to detect alive and not alive. Identifying properties of matter.<BR>
<B>Grade 3:</B> The sun stabilizes the solar system. Rocks stabilize the ground matter. Rotation stabilizes the weather.<BR>
<B>Grade 5:</B> The water cycle is an example of constancy. Matter does not go "away". Weather changes, but the changes are within a range -- stable.<BR>
</UL>


<P>

<H2>History/Social Science:</H2>
This is a core theme through all of the grade levels, like Being A Scientist. In this age, as no previous, society's concerns are science's concerns. Every scientist must seek to understand the ramifications of the research going on and its impact on the earth's citizens. At each grade level, issues that can be understood and acted on by the student, are addressed. Potential solutions are presented to impart a sense of challenge, rather than doom.

<P><P>

<Title>The EXPLORING SCIENCE Team</Title>
<H1>Meet the Team</H1>

The <B>Exploring Science</B> team is made up of experienced award winning K-6 mentor and master teachers. Each of the teachers face daily the same problems that all elementary teachers face in large urban multi-cultural classrooms. They were brought together in 1991 because the changes called for in the California Science Framework would solve many of the problems existing in their classrooms. They did not believe that they would receive materials from the adoption process that they could teach effectively in their classrooms. As mentor and master teachers, they were also uncomfortable, based on past experience, with how they would be able to prepare other teachers in the district with what they expected.<P>

After looking at their combined teaching and writing experience, they decided to risk everything, their time AND money, to produce a K-6 integrated curriculum science program. <B>Exploring Science</B> is that program.

During the planning stages, they set specific requirements:
<OL>
<LI> Teachable by Reading/Language Arts teachers.
<LI> Good Science.
<LI> Greater than 60% hands-on done in cooperative groups.
<LI> Thematic science AND full integrated curriculum.
<LI> Low cost off the shelf consumables.
<LI> Address multi-cultural urban classes (large).
<LI> Address multi-language classrooms (becoming more common).
<LI> Prepare for Full Inclusion (court and funding dictated).
<LI> Based on extensive use of the Scientist's Notebook and conferencing.
</OL><P>

It was the requirements that these teachers recognized back in 1991 that provided the basis for meeting the new 1995 National Science Education Standards that were written as part of the Goals 2000 Program. The new standards clearly recognize the needs of the elementary classroom.<P>

<H1>The EXPLORING SCIENCE Program Organization</H1>

<B>"WHY?"</B> is a wonderful question. Every child, and every scientist, spends most of his/her day asking why. The question is pertinent to instructional material. Why was it written in the manner that it was? The presentation of known facts is vital to the process of developing knowledge and understanding. However, in an era of rapid scientific discovery, teaching science must be more than mere presenting of "facts", even when learned hands-on. The authors feel that the better way is to concentrate on the scientific process, and to teach the students to question, like Einstein, Darwin, and Leonardo da Vinci. Logical, organized problem solving, especially in groups and teams, is valuable to every person, not just those entering scientific fields. <I>This program has as its first goal the teaching of the student to be a scientific problem solver.</I><P>

<B>EXPLORING SCIENCE</B> is designed to raise a generation of functional, problem solving, and communicative adults. Grade after grade, each chapter helps the child grow in the ability to gain, organize, process, and communicate what she/he has learned, not only in science, but also in all other subjects. The first chapter teaches the students, beginning in kindergarten, how to be a scientist. Following are theme based chapters using the accepted themes of  <B>Energy, Stability, Patterns of Change, Systems and Interactions, Scale and Structure, and Evolution</B>. The final chapter is devoted to placing the student into an awareness that the scientist does not work outside of his/her society and environment, the History/Social Science tie.<P>

Through hands-on explorations, the students are shown how scientists solve problems, and why they document as they do, by doing actual work and solving interesting problems. The Student Text is never the primary teaching tool. It is used to integrate the learning into the total curriculum by the use of raps, chants, poetry, and questioning. Even the glossary is hands-on in this program. Using National Academic Excellence Award-winning techniques developed in working with non-English speaking students, the authors have created the concept of an Interactive Glossary. Subject areas integrated throughout the program:<P>
	<I>Language acquisition<BR>
	From reading readiness to reading<BR>
	From math readiness to math<BR>
	Visual and Performing Arts<BR>
	History/Social Science<BR>
	Current Issues / Technology</I><P>

The skills taught are enhanced as the students go up in the grades commensurate with their maturity. At all levels, the students are expected to explain what they have learned through cooperative learning techniques of Pair-Share, Teams, and Conferencing. Heavily used throughout is the graphic organizer. The students are expected to logically organize all of their material. They keep a Scientist's Notebook every year. This notebook is used exactly like Leonardo da Vinci used his notebook, as a reference of what has been seen, tried, and learned. The students are taught how to relate seemingly unrelated data to create new knowledge.<P>

Physical, earth, and life explorations, thematically linked, are placed in the same chapter to insure that the student does not create artificial separations in his/her mind. The purpose is to generalize the knowledge. Every day all humans are faced with problems that seem unfamiliar. Thematic understanding that helps link previous studies, provides "can do" solutions that work. The ability to unify the unfamiliar with the known provides confidence in students.<P><P><P>

<Title>Featured Scientists</Title>
<H1>The Why of Scientists</H1>

A brief biography of a scientist introduces each chapter of each book. These biographical sketches focus on the characteristics of the individual as well as his or her achievement. Students are guided by a comparison to the Being a Science Poster, teacher questioning, and discussion to identify those qualities.<P>
The next step is for each child to relate those qualities to qualities  they see in themselves. As they do, they see themselves as problem solvers and thinkers, individuals well capable of achieving in the technological society of today.<P>

<H2>Scientists:</H2>
<OL>
<LI> Follow lab and safety rules
<LI> Are curious
<LI> Investigate
<LI> Collect and record precise data
<LI> Cooperate
<LI> Communicate
<LI> Seek answers	
<LI> Ask new questions
<LI> PERSIST
</OL>
<P>
	The scientists have not lost the enthusiasm of youth!<P>

<B><I>Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of our science.</I></B>  Emerson<P>
<P>It is not what they did, but why they did it that counts.<P><P>


Great care has been taken in the selection of the featured scientists.  Their biographical sketches focus the student on the theme of the chapter. Gregor Mendel begins the second grade unit of Evolution. Leonardo Da Vinci introduces  the Kindergarten chapter on Scale and Structure, while  Marie Curie challenges fifth grade students as she serves as the introduction to Patterns of Change. Modern day scientist,  Stephen Hawking  is the inspiration for  students to study the universe  in grade three on Stability.<P>
By reading and discussing these great men and women of science, students gain  knowledge and appreciation of our scientific heritage. By reading about people, discoveries, and inventions that have impacted our lives past and present, students gain  knowledge and understanding of how science and scientists work. This background spirals and builds, supporting students on their way to scientific literacy and achievement.<P>
It is not enough that the student have scientific literacy. <B>Each student must enter adulthood as a problem solver and critical thinker.</B>

<Title>COMPUTERS AND SCHOOLS</Title>

<H1>COMPUTERS BELONG IN THE SCHOOLS; HOWEVER ...</H1>

The following is excerpted from an interview with Jeff Braun (SimCity, etc.) and published in:<BR>
MicroTimes<BR>
Volume 184<BR>
March 6. 1995<BR>
(510) 934-3700<P>

<B>What she was saying was that now productivity is essentially building-stuff; whether it is ultimately building real stuff, as with AutoCAD, or virtual stuff, as with 3D Studio, the wave of the future is essentially building stuff.<P>
That's right. Its enabling.<P>
What good is a computer if you're just going to use it as a VCR?<P><P>

<H2>Or a typewriter?</H2>
or a book? </B>Guess what, I can go to the book-store and get a book. I don't need to get a CD and make it into a book like this Voyager book thing. I like books. I don't need to read on a computer, and it makes my eyes go cross-eyed anyway.<P>
You use a computer for what it can-do that other things can't.<P>
The way I like to put it is that everybody loves to drive the car by looking in the mirror. But if you do that too much you're going to hit a wall. At some point you've got to look forward.<P>
You can't constantly say, "Well, books are successful so I'll put a book on a CD." Or "Videos are successful, so I'll make cinematic CDs." You have to say, "I'm going to do something that no one else has done because I'm going forward; I'm not running my business - because of the past."<P>

<H2>Its like having photography trying to be oil painting</H2>
Photography's very rich, and oil's very rich, but they're different.<P>
Until Cecil B. DeMille, for all the movies, they would take a camera and film the stage: They didn't move the camera. The. camera didn't pan. Because up until then, plays were how you did entertainment. So when they introduced the new technology, there was no science of moving cameras around.<P>
That's the same as what's going on here. You can't do simulation in a book. You can't do simulation with video. The only way you can do it effectively is by getting together and saying, "Let's pretend, and we'll pretend whatever we want to simulate," or you use a computer, Those are your alternatives.<P>
So I'm using the medium for what it's specifically suited for. Why would I want to take a video and put it on a CD? It's very good off a videotape. And it's cheaper. And faster. And a three-year-old could use it. So why is it that we want to use a computer for this stuff?<P>
Creative applications are uniquely suited to the computer. It's an enabling medium. You don't become interactive to be told what to do. Video is telling. Books are telling, lectures are telling. These are all linear media--they have a beginning, a middle, and an end.<P>
Who would want to go interactive and be told what to do? Most people don't like to be told what to do, not children, not adults. We love hearing stories, but we have media that are very effective for telling stories, What the computer is effective for is interacting--me and whatever's on the computer, me manipulating what's in there. That's creativity. It's me. It's my Rorschach test. I'm taking this fuzzy data and turning it into something that's personally meaningful for me.<P>
This is a medium that allows me to create, I couldn't build a city without this computer. We would have to sell an enormous amount of buildings and parts and things that would fill a huge box, to let you kind of play. And even then, there wouldn't be earthquakes or fires--that would be dangerous.<P>
So what we're doing is we're focusing on enabling technologies. We can enable people. I'm not a mayor, but I can tun a city. I'm not an artist, but with Print Artist I can create great things. I'm not a T-shirt printer, but with Gift Maker I can make these wonderful neat T-shirts, and I did it. We're just experimenting. This is my little sandbox.<P>
Everyone talks about the future of on-line. Eventually it comes down to on-line merchandising where you're going to buy things on-line--everyone talks about how the TV show will be going on and you say, "Gee, I like that sweater he's wearing," and you click' on it and it says, 'Get it from Sears, and here's how' . to order it right now." And you go and you buy it, and then you're right back In "the show. And it's delivered to your door.<P>
That's their idea of the future of home buying. Well, that's interesting, but I think what's much more interesting is Gift Maker, where I can take my own favorite images and graphics, and maybe I could surf the Net for beautiful images of Hawaii. Or I'm interested in cats, or I'm interested in sports, I can grab images that interest me, and then I put those on the T-shirt with my own
message. And it gets printed and delivered to me. Now, isn't that a lot better?<P>
	You get people involved in activities that are creationist, and the reuse goes on forever. We're very much in the non-linear- there's no beginning, no middle, no end. It creates a very rich environment for these people. <P>
	Now people don't want to create unlimited. You put someone in front of a piano, and they won't have a clue. Or, you put someone in front of 3D Studio, and say, "Make something cool", and they are going to go blank. So we provide sample cities, and sample art work, and sample things, and say, "Start with this."<P>
There's sort of a continuum we work with, where on one end it's completely open-ended and creative and you go too far, and on the other end, it's completely linear and you're being told, and there is no interaction. What we are aiming for is somewhere in the middle, where you are being helped and guided, but you are allowed to be creative; there is a little bit of guidance and a little bit of creativity.<P>

<Title>Science Writing</Title>

<H1>Why Can't We Understand?</H1>
Most materials produced in science books, especially science journals, are very difficult to understand. While working in the field, I have heard more than one scientist express the view that obscure terminology is vital. "My findings were difficult to discover. If I write them up in understandable language, they will seem trivial, and my funding will stop." This is a comment heard during those rare candid sessions in research labs.<P>

ALL humans learn naturally. Science consists, according to every dictionary I have, of gathering information, organizing it, and forming new knowledge, and then COMMUNICATING it to others.<P>

I do not believe that we as a society can allow this form of "Cold Fusion" to continue. It is time to stop funding those in science and education who can not write with clarity and content. Failure to communicate is the fault of the speaker/writer, not the recipient of the information.<P>

Perhaps a national reward system for science should be instituted based on:
<OL>
<LI> Did it solve a problem/question?
<LI> Is the communication of the solution understandable by those outside the discipline?
<LI> How complete is the solution?
</OL>
<P>
Given that the value of discoveries are not immediately apparent, rewards should be given to scientist (or family) when the value becomes apparent later.<P><P>

<Title>EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS</Title>

<H1>Educational Materials AND the Classroom</H1>

We have heard all of the excuses for the failure of education:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Lack of funding.
<LI> The parents.
<LI> The children.
<LI> TV.
<LI> The teachers.
<LI> ESL.
<LI> Special Needs.
<LI> Illegal Aliens.
<LI> "At Risk".
<LI> You name the excuse.
<P>
There is, unfortunately, little truth in any of those excuses. Humans are born learners, ALL of them. They use all of the Scientific Thinking Processes as babies, including "Inferring". If they did not, they would never learn anything, especially language. In fact, it is unlikely that any baby would become a child. The only thing that babies, and children lack is experience and a knowledge base. <P>

We need to consider how much our six year olds know and do that an aborigine adult does not, AND vice versa. It is not because either is stupid or incapable. All knowledge is a reference base upon which we build and link new learning. There is great truth in our registered trade mark, "Linked Learning Multiplies Understanding".<P><P>

<B><I>"Begin now to study the little things in your own yard, going from the known to the nearest related unknown."</I></B><BR>
George Washington Carver<P><P>

Given these thoughts, perhaps it is time to review all teaching materials, especially science and math. Do they promote growth by linking the new knowledge to the present student and teacher bases? Or, are they written to impress other educators with the fact that the author isn't "making it too easy"?<P>

Unfortunately, some curriculum materials "dummy down" to the students and teachers out of disrespect for their abilities. Both groups are extremely capable of learning. Further, they want to! Let them! Do this by insisting that the materials link the new information to what both the students and teachers have already learned.<P>

One significant problem for elementary teachers, who HAVE TO BE generalists, is that the materials demand that they be given two years training before being "qualified". This requirement ignores the fact that the teacher may not be teaching the same grade next year, and so will have to "start over". Most important, this teacher has six different curriculum areas to cover, and can't afford two years training on one. NOR, can the district.<P>

The other significant problem is the insistence on basing educational theories and materials on college testing using discipline trained specialists with teacher/student ratios of less than 1/20 when most city school teachers face 1/30+ and are reading/language arts specialists, if anything. The nation's teachers are not incompetent, the materials are inappropriate. Unfortunately, our teachers are so dedicated that they believe that the fault is all theirs.<P>

Ask a craftsman in any trade and he/she will say, "The difference between an amateur and a craftsman is the quality of their tools." A mechanic may be able to do a lot with pliers and a screwdriver, but you will never find one who will work under those conditions as a matter of practice. America's elementary teachers do every day. Worse, the teacher's pliers and screwdriver are (figuratively) made of 24 carat gold, so, while they are pretty and costly, they destruct at the first attempted use. Read inappropriate technology in this example!

<<Title>Learning Difficulties</Title>
<H1>Why Our Children Aren't Learning</H1>

There is only ONE appropriate method for use in evaluating the correctness of any educational theory, "excuse" or practice:<P>
<B><I>If it is true, would the physically helpless human race exist today?</I></B><P><P>

If children can not infer until the sixth grade, how did that 18 month old learn not to touch anything glowing red (hot)?<P>

These children learn by inferring; however, inferences are based on prior RELATED knowledge. It is possible to expose them to something so remote from their past experience that they can not infer effectively. BAD teaching materials, and text books, do that all of the time. We should be blaming the materials, not the children.<P>

<H1>BECOMING FIRST IN THE WORLD</H1>
<P>
<B><I>GOALS 2000 has demanded that US students become first in the world by the year 2000.</I> </B>

<P>	
Assumptions are used to limit and control the variables in all research. However, these same assumptions frequently skew the results of the research into improper conclusions. One thing should be clear to any observer, STANDARDS of performance can not be raised by using dummied down or poorly written materials.
<P>
<B>Edutainment:</B>
Does any dietician recommend bribing a child with dessert in order to teach good eating habits? Why do we assume that children have to be bribed with entertainment before they will learn? Perhaps what we have been giving them is BAD educational materials.
<P>

<B>Age Related Learning Skills:</B>
Children can not infer until the sixth grade. In that case, how did they learn language as babies? Certainly, language is not born in us. How do they learn not to touch glowing red objects? How do small children ...? There are an endless number of questions that make the opening statement a very bad joke. <P>
Children are very concrete, specific, and methodical in their approach to problems. So are adults when trying out something new. How did you perform during the first week with your new computer, software, ...?<P>
Children can not apply until they are 10-12 years of age. It is time to get serious. No adult can apply when presented information that is totally outside their experience. Any child has extremely limited experience, compared to an adult. They do apply at a very young age, but ONLY ON THINGS WITH WHICH THEY ARE FAMILIAR, just like adults.<P>

<B>Reading  must be simplified:</B>
The question should be by how much. Much more important is how interesting is it to the child. Most of these children who have so much trouble with "See Dick run." in school had mastered the language and reading coding of Pterodactyl, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus Rex by the time they were four. Learning to read can be hard work; however, that is what children do - when they want the results. If they want what is on the page, they will struggle to get it.<P>
The above is not to say that we can throw college texts at these children (actually most college texts, especially the poorly written Math texts, should not be thrown at adults). However, given materials that present interesting reading, based on their experience base, and mimicking the speak patterns that they are using, the transference and growth can be significant. <P>
<P>

We can never raise performance standards until we understand how much children learn in the same manner as adults, and get rid of these limiting assumptions. Color, motion, and important sounding research studies do sell, which happens to be the business of the large publishers - selling books, not teaching the young. <P>

The bottom line is that in any endeavor, some will fail, by definition. If we lower expectations, everyone loses. If we raise expectations, the slowest students will still fail. However, that failure level could possibly be close to the achievement of today's average to high students. These children want to learn! If they do not, why are all of the parents pressed with the continual, insistent, "WHY?"

<Title>OK, I AM OPINIONATED!</Title>

<H1>In My Opinion</H1>

At the NSTA National Convention in Philadelphia last week, I heard lots of statements that I agree with. However, there were a few that I consider particularly wrong - and self defeating. 

<B>Statement ----------------------- Maybe ------- Thoughts</B><BR>
Infer is too big for K-1 students--- true? --------- but they use stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex! <BR>
Children are concrete -------------- Ok! ----------- so are 50 year olds learning golf.<BR>
no inferring before grade 6-------- Hogwash ---- How did they learn a language??<P><P>

Vygovski knew what he was talking about, Piaget DIDN'T!<P><P>

You are welcome to disagree.<P><P>

	<Title>Grade 3, Chapter 1</Title>
	<H1>BIOGRAPHY OF A SCIENTIST</H1>
	<H2>Margaret Collins</H2> 

	<I>Sugar and spice and everything nice<BR>
	That's what little girls are made of.<BR>
	Snips and snails and puppy dog's tails<BR>
	That's what little boys are made of!</I><BR> 
				<B>Children's Rhyme</B><P><P>

Margaret Collins refused to let the boys have all of the fun. People in the community say that Margaret always had a turtle, snake, snail, frog, or some such critter in her pocket that she was studying or caring for. Margaret grew up in the country. She lived near West Virginia State College. Besides the college, there were only about 200 people in the small town where she lived. She feels that she was very lucky to have the opportunity to grow up in such an interesting area. The fields were open, and time was free. As a child she had a lot of "unstructured time" - time to wonder, to ask questions, seek answers, to observe. What was she observing? Everything that moved!<P>
Even as a very young child, Margaret's father told her  that answers to many questions could be found in books. Before she could read, she wondered what the words could tell her. Fortunately she had a cousin who came to stay with her. This cousin was attending the college in town. She would let little Margaret sit on her lap and follow her finger as she read and studied. This is how Margaret learned to read. Imagine, starting to read at the college level! She went on to read the books in her father's library.<P>
Her father was a temporary biology teacher. His special interest was agriculture. He had many books in his library, and Margaret read them all. They did indeed answer many of her questions, but raised more questions than they answered. <P>
From the time she was very little, Margaret was sure that she was going to become a doctor. Everyone in the community, when they would see her with her turtles, snakes, or whatever living thing grabbed her curiosity at the moment, would say, "Margaret, you are going to grow up to be a doctor." She believed the adults around her, but continued studying all of the interesting bits of information about "her" animals.<P>
She graduated from high school and headed off for Howard College. Medical school was her only thought. Being a doctor was her plan, after all, everyone said that "she was going to be a doctor". As soon as her professors learned of Margaret's wide interest in animals, they laughed and said," Margaret, you don't want to be a doctor. Doctors just work with people, not animals! What you want to be is an ecologist. An ecologist is a person who studies all  living things and the interaction between them!"<P>
We are very lucky because Margaret did go on to become an ecologist and entomologist. An entomologist is a scientist that studies insects. An ecologist/entomologist studies the ways that insects interact with each other and their environment. But, the way that we are lucky is that Dr. Margaret Collins' fascination with insects knew no bounds. She never lost the childhood enthusiasm for critters. She knew that everyone would also be fascinated, if only she could let people really see the wonders that she saw. She found a way to share her interest and knowledge with all of us. Her way is the Insect Zoo at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. As she travels all over the world to study insects, she brings back live specimens. These are placed in the Insect Zoo for all to see and study.<P>
Margaret Collins gives all of us the recipe for becoming a scientist. She says that scientists need free time as they are growing up. Children need to be free to sit and wonder, watch, think, and question. They need to ask a lot of questions. Sometimes those questions don't even have answers yet! Being the first to discover the answers to the unanswered questions is the work (fun) of science. They need to be curious and investigate.<P>
It is a little far for most of us to visit the Insect Zoo in Washington D.C., but you can create your own zoo in the classroom (or at home....with your parent's permission!). Then you can join Margaret Collins in the fascination of all living things. She would love to share your discoveries with you.

		<H1>BIOGRAPHY OF A SCIENTIST</H1>
		<H2>Dr. Miguel Rios</H2>
<I>"I don't like to lose. It's the accomplishment, achievement and contributing that drives me more than coming out on top of somebody else."</I><P><P>

	We live in a world of energy. Much of that energy comes from the fossil fuels of oil and coal which took special conditions and millions of years to form. These sources of energy are non-renewable. Once they are used up, they are gone forever.<P>
	What will happen then?<P>

	Fortunately we have scientists like Dr. Miguel Rios working to solve the problem - working to find new renewable sources of energy. Where is he looking? Here's a hint. Look up in the sky.....above the clouds.......93,000,000 miles away.......on a sunny day. Right! It's our primary energy source - the Sun!<P>
	Dr. Rios dreams of clean, abundant, low-cost solar power for the future. He sees it as his "accomplishment, achievement, and contribution." He is working with a new process that taps the Sun's energy called photovoltaics. These are cells about the size of a CD disc that receive the rays of the Sun and change them into electrical energy  that works like a battery. His work with photovoltaic cells may lead us to a new age - the Age of Solar Power. <P>
	Dr. Miguel Rios is the head of his own company now. He works with many other scientist and engineers to ask questions and seek answers for the future. But what was he like as a little boy? How did he become the scientist that he is now?<P>
	Miguel, his brother, and two sisters were raised in El Paso, Texas. In the 1940's it was not always easy being Mexican-American. He was aware of the prejudice of the people around him. He knew that his father had suffered economic, educational, and social barriers because of his heritage. His mother wanted a better life for Miguel, his brother, and his sisters. She was the one that pushed Miguel to be the best he could be. According to Miguel, "Life had been hard on her and she wanted me to make something of myself. The goals that she had for both me and my brother and sisters were very high. I inherited a certain drive from my mother and was inspired by her."<P>
	When Miguel entered Kindergarten he spoke no English. He spent two years in Kindergarten. He quickly broke the language barrier the second year when his kindergarten teacher at his religious school began tutoring him after school, and got his mother to do the same in the evenings at home. After he learned English, he enjoyed school. It was his opportunity to compete and achieve. In elementary school Miguel's favorite subject was math. He loved to have his turn at the chalkboard doing arithmetic problems. He always turned the opportunity into a race. He didn't always win, (and he hated to lose) but he enjoyed the competition and the feeling that he had done his best.<P>
	Miguel enjoyed competition in sports as well. In sixth grade he began playing baseball. By seventh and eighth grades he was a regular on the baseball, football, and basketball teams! <P>
	Even though Miguel enjoyed sports, he knew he had to get a good education to meet his goals of accomplishment and achievement. The high school he chose was difficult. It had basically a pre-college curriculum. They didn't even have a football field on the campus. To practice football the team had to get on a bus and go to a public field or another school.<P>
	In high school Miguel excelled in mathematics and literature. He thought about becoming a lawyer, a mathematician, a scientist. He couldn't decide. It was Sputnik that made his final decision. Sputnik was the first man-made satellite to orbit the Earth. It was launched by the Soviet Union on Oct. 4, 1957. It caused a uproar in the United Stated States because the U.S. did not have the technology at that time to launch its own satellite. This event determined Miguel's future. He knew that he wanted to be a scientist! To Miguel, science was the wave of the future.<P>
	Now Dr. Miguel Rios is on the crest of the wave of the future. His company is involved with research and development in the areas of solar energy, space technologies, and nuclear engineering. In the solar energy field, his company supports government research on solar power for satellites and space applications. As citizens of the future, we are lucky that Miguel Rios has the determination to "<B>accomplish, achieve, and contribute</B>."<P>

<H1>BIOGRAPHY OF A SCIENTIST</H1>
	<H2>Ruth Patrick</H2>

<I>"Industry is only partly to blame for pollution.  Human beings in general are producing about 50% of the waste.  So you and I must learn how to recycle waste-such as paper and glass-and not use so many of these things that cause trouble."</I><P><P>

Ruth Patrick is a doctor to our rivers.  Many of them are sick. In 1969 a river in Ohio had been poisoned.  Thousands of gallons of oil had been dumped into this river, and it actually caught fire.  Other rivers in our country are polluted with chemicals which wash in from spraying miles of farmland for bugs. Often factories are built near rivers, and they use the rivers to wash away factory  wastes.  People like to live near rivers and their housepaint, lawn fertilizers, and trash fill the rivers.  <P>
Dr. Patrick, the river doctor, has a big job. But like all scientists, she started with little jobs.  When she was a child, her father was a lawyer; but he had a hobby.  He liked to take  nature walks in the Kansas countryside where they lived and find things to look at through a microscope he had set up at their home.  Many years later, Ruth Patrick remembered the first time he allowed her to have a look.  She couldn't believe there was a whole world of little "animals" living in a single drop of pond water.  Actually her favorite wonder of the microscope was a plant, not an animal.  She loved looking at the diatoms, which are one-celled water plants that look like lace honeycombs.<P>  
Her father taught her to look at the way all living things are connected to each other and to the surroundings in which they live.  Years later after she had finished college, she met another scientist, Charles Hodge, and they were married. Ruth kept her last name, "Patrick," to honor her father who had shared his love for the laws of nature with her and guided her to her work as a scientist.<P>   
Ruth studied botany, the science of plant life.  She led scientists in studying the way all living things in lakes and streams fit together.  It didn't take her long to notice that when water was polluted, the living things in water were destroyed.  She got a team of science detectives together to explore the rivers of our country.
One day a farmer saw this team working; and he thought they were crazy.  Dr. Patrick, in rubber hip boots, was scraping the slime off rocks. Another, dressed in a bathing suit, was looking for bacteria.  He had a spoon, and he was taking spoonfuls of mud from the riverbed.  A third was raking through the water, picking up snails and clams.  The last one was picking small bugs off a plant with a tweezers.  He suddenly turned, took out a pistol, and shot a spray of "mustard seed" juice at a swarm of mayflies, and picked up all that fell.<P>  
These scientists were far from nuts. Dr. Patrick was leading them in measuring the health or sickness of the river.  If it were healthy, it would have certain life forms living together, each with its own work to do.  If it were polluted, the plants in it would grow too fast, become weak, and die. The dead plants would decompose, using up all the oxygen in the water.  Fish and other water creatures would die.  When Dr. Patrick's team found sick and dying rivers, they went to the businesses close to these rivers and worked with them.<P>   
Dr. Patrick decided that she needed to understand how a river starts to really understand how to keep it healthy. So, she set up a giant experiment.  She dug a river.  Now, it was a small river, but she carefully designed it to have banks, shallow places, turns and  even rapids.  She got herself a bulldozer and had the driver follow her plan.  An experimental river had to have everything that the natural rivers had because that is what the plants and animals who lived in the water needed.  <P>
What happened was that the smallest plants  and animals came first, her old friends that her dad had introduced her to under the microscope.  The bigger plants and animals came later.  She found that nature starts with the smallest and simplest first,  and that it would be possible to rebuild a poisoned stream if necessary.  It would be much better not to pollute our water  than to remake our waterways.<P>

<Title>Grade 3, Chapter 4</Title>
<H1>BIOGRAPHY OF A SCIENTIST</H1>
<H2>Stephen Hawking</H2>
<P> 
Scientists have made great progress in understanding gravity, inertia and centrifugal force.  The mystery that Stephen Hawking now works on is how these forces work together.  <P>

If you go to hear the English physicist, Stephen Hawking, speak today, you wouldn't hear him at all. You would hear a voice synthesizer, or robot voice that comes out of a speaker attached to the back of his wheelchair.  Hawking would choose his words very carefully because it is difficult for him to make the movements necessary to operate the synthesizer.  He would speak of gravity, the force that controls the movements of the planets.  He would speak of inertia and centrifugal force and how these forces affect the movements of the planets. <P>

If you do not understand the above words completely, be patient with yourself.  Stephen Hawking has spent 30 years studying  and thinking about these forces, and he is famous for simply attempting to understand them.  He and other physicists use mathematics to work out the wonder of the way our universe came to be.<P>  

When Stephen Hawking was about eight years old, he knew what he wanted to be.  He already had a knack for taking apart clocks and radios to see how they worked.  He wanted to be a scientist.  By the time he was fourteen, he told his dad that he would either be a physicist or a mathematician.  Stephen's dad was worried that his son's grades were too low for college and that he would never earn enough money being a physicist even if he <I>did</I> get the education.<P>

A few years later, Stephen took the test to see whether he would be admitted into Oxford University, a very famous university in England.  His dad did not have to worry because Stephen answered all the physics questions about matter, energy and the laws that govern motion, light, heat, sound, and electricity.  His score was close to perfect. In the required oral interview, the professors could tell that Stephen knew what he was talking about in the study of physics, too.<P>  

In 1952, Stephen Hawking started college.  He was on the rowing team.  In fact, he was the cockswain, the one who steers the boat.  He was not the best student, but he still showed unusual and quick understanding of everything about physics.  If you walked into Stephen's room at Oxford, you would probably find Stephen reading a science fiction book and listening to his favorite music which was classical...or you might not find him at all.  Stephen liked parties, and he was often out socializing.<P>

Still, after four years of school Stephen knew that he wanted to study more; and he decided on cosmology, the study of the universe.  Interestingly, he looked through a telescope just a few times.  He decided quickly that it was NOT <I>looking</I> at the stars which interested him.  <I>Thinking</I>  to understand the universe was the way that he wanted to spend his time.  He never looked through a telescope again, but he kept his mind on the stars, planets, black holes, quarks and quasars.<P>  

Now this would be a good story if all we had to tell was that Dr. Hawking went on to find out so much about the universe that people say that his ideas are the most advanced since Albert Einstein's.  It would be amazing if we added that he wrote a popular book to explain the universe people who aren't scientists.  It would be wonderful to know that he had time be to a very popular teacher and an active family man with a wife and three energetic kids.  What is unbelievable is that he has accomplished the above while seriously ill and progressively more and more paralyzed.<P>  

It would be amazing if an able-bodied man could have accomplished all that Hawking has done.  That a paralyzed person continues to do so is miraculous to us.  Stephen Hawking does not think so.  He once told an interviewer that his illness wasn't all bad. It gave him more time to think.

<Title>Grade 4, Chapter 1</Title>
<H1>BIOGRAPHY OF A SCIENTIST</H1>
<H2>Burt Rutan</H2><P><P>

Since people have watched birds soar in the sky, people have dreamed of flying. Icarus, in Greek mythology, wanted to soar. During the fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci designed, but never constructed a helicopter. The bird men of the past wanted to fly. Their designs seem fanciful and impractical as we look back, their dreams remain.<P>
Burt Rutan grew up in the small California town Dinuba. He and his older brother Dick were fortunate to have parents who encouraged their interests. Their father was a dentist, yet neither boy had sights set on a medical career. Their mother recollects that their early interests had to do with airplanes, much like the "bird men" of earlier days.<P>
Dick wanted to fly. Burt's interests were more focused on why and how planes flew. Dick bought, assembled and flew kit planes. When they would crash, Burt would take the remains out of the trash. Burt, who was over four years younger than Dick, would rebuild the planes, using his own ideas about what would fly. By the time he was ten, Burt had constructed and flown a plane of his own design.<P>
Burt and his parents went to model competitions all over the country. Burt nearly always received a trophy for something, often design, but his planes often won the races too. At a national meet near Dallas, the teenage Burt Rutan was a winner again.<P>
After Dick completed high school, he went on to enlist in the Air Force and become a test pilot. According to their mother, Mrs. Irene Rutan, "Both boys had aviation fuel for blood." Yet Burt's interests in how and why planes fly continued to motivate him. His high school science teacher was astonished by his encyclopedic knowledge of aeronautical engineering. His flight instructor told Burt that his understanding of flight was so complete that the course could be shortened to a couple of hours. Burt became a pilot at sixteen years old. Burt finished high school and went to California State Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo to major in aeronautical engineering. 
Burt Rutan was an excellent engineering student, but he was even better at applying what he knew. His first job after graduating in 1965 was as a flight test project engineer for the Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Edwards is the premier aircraft test center for the USAF. In 1974, after seven years with the Air Force and two years developing planes for a Kansas company, Burt Rutan started his own company.<P>
Much like the other aviation pioneers, Burt Rutan needed the freedom of his own company to test out his ideas. While many designers of aircraft develop one or two successful designs and spend the rest of their careers modifying their success, Rutan's successes fill pages and he continues to reach out with unique, effective designs. His designs do not look conventional. His planes often are less expensive to produce and better to fly than conventional aircraft.<P>
As a model maker, Burt learned that lighter usually was better in aircraft. Conventional planes are built with metal, adding a great deal of weight. Rutan's designs are constructed of a unique material. This material is commonly called composite. It is a synthetic material made of carbon fibers. It is light and stiff, with just enough flexibility or give to make composites useful in high tech skis, golf clubs, race cars, tennis rackets, and aircraft.<P>
In 1984, the Voyager made its first flight. Burt, his brother Dick, and Jeana Yeager followed a dream in building the Voyager. The plane was designed for one thing--a round the world flight on one tank of fuel. It was an airplane to set a world record.  Burt and Dick looked for sponsors from major corporations. When the only major offer came from a tobacco company, they decided their dream could not become a cigarette advertisement! The plane was built in Mojave, California by volunteers and paid for by contributions.<P>
Dick and Jeana flew the plane around the world just before Christmas in 1986. When it landed at Edwards Air Force Base, as planned, the plane was nearly out of fuel. The three adventurers were exhausted. Dick and Jeana slept little as they circumnavigated the world. Burt slept little as he followed the progress of their plane and their joint achievement. The Voyager hangs in the Smithsonian Air andSpace Museum, not far from the plane built by another pair of pioneering brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright.<P>
Burt is a prolific designer. He usually designs aircraft, like the Long-EZ or the ARES, that are dramatically different from the competition's planes. His dreams become reality on the computer screen, and, eventually in the fabrication shop of Scaled Composites. Rutan's designing is not limited to aircraft, however. In 1988, Sail America approached him about designing a wing sail for their America's Cup sailboat entry. The sail was made of the same composite material that he uses for his airplanes! The unconventional sail worked and the U.S.A. won the America's Cup again. Another recent project for Rutan was the gondola for a world balloon flight.<P> 
Drawing a great deal of attention at the 1992 North American International Automobile Show in Detroit during January was the Ultralite, a "concept car" designed to have a fuel efficiency of 100 miles per gallon while cruising at over 50 miles per hour. The body, of carbon fiber composite material, was developed by Burt Rutan for General Motors.<P>
Application of scientific knowledge to problems of design is Burt's specialty. From his childhood, Burt learned all he could about the principles of flight, and he still is learning. He tries many designs. He develops his own ideas, yet he listens to advice from others. He does not feel that he must follow the group in designing aircraft. He is comfortable as a pioneer, leading the aviation world into broader use of carbon fiber composite materials.<P>
Irene Rutan relects on the success of her two sons and says, "If you have an idea, keep after it. Don't put it aside."<P><P>

<H1>Burt Rutan as a Scientist:</H1>

<Title>Grade 5, Chapter 1</Title>
<H1>Biography Of Science</H1>
Science has always been about finding answers to questions. The early scientists studied everything because little was really known about why things happened. Later, the study of science was broken into disciplines and the scientists became specialists who tried to know everything about a small body of knowledge. The emerging scientist of today is returning to the past method because it is now understood how much all knowledge is interrelated. The specialist will miss simple answers to the questions because of lack of familiarity with other subjects. The two scientists, past and present, here represent this important trend.<P><P>

<H2>Copernicus</H2>
<IMG SRC="copernic.gif" ><P>

<I>"Finally we place the Sun himself at the center of the Universe...if only we face the facts, as they say with both eyes open."</I><P>

Everyone who has lived on this Earth has looked up to the stars and wondered...wondered...wondered at the mystery above. There is a long history of the wonder of the heavenly bodies. Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer, who lived in the second century A.D., examined the stars and planets and recorded the idea that the Earth was at the center of the Universe and the largest of all the planets, and he told how all other planets circled the Earth. What he could not explain was that sometimes these planets did not appear to continue moving in their regular and normal path. They seemed to wander, hence the Greek word for planet is "wanderer" based on this tendency to wander from the steady path around the Earth.<P> 
Ptolemy's beliefs were thought to be true for over one thousand years. This is what makes Copernicus so remarkable. He was born in 1473 in a town on the Prussian frontier. He grew up, a serious student, educated at home and interested in studying Greek and Latin. His education continued at the University of Cracow where he showed talent in math, natural philosophy, and draftsmanship. He graduated in medicine and astronomy but was soon back at a university, this time in Rome, teaching mathematics.<P> 
He showed great talent at math and his uncle, wanting his talented nephew near him, offered Copernicus the important job of physician at the cathedral in Frauenberg. Feeling he needed to study first, Copernicus enrolled in medical classes. When he felt confident enough to practice medicine, he settled into a routine. He spent a third of his day doctoring the poor, a third in prayer and religious duties, and a favorite third on his hobby, astronomy.<P> 
For his investigations into the stars, he had slits cut in the walls of a special room. There was no such thing as a telescope in Copernicus' day so he used the slits as points of reference from which to study the exact progression of the stars. <P>
Looking at the stars in this way, Copernicus began to question a thousand years of "fact". His observations of nature had shown it to be simple, predictable and regular. He began to doubt Ptolemy's complicated scheme for the planets. His notes pointed to a Sun-centered universe. When he looked back at ancient writings, he found some support from a Greek, Aristarchus of Samos, who proposed that the Sun was the center of the solar system in which the Earth spun like a top, making a complete rotation in an eastward direction every twenty-four hours. Next Copernicus said that the Sun, the planets, and the  stars only appeared to move from east to west. He made complicated mathematical statements about the positions of the planets. He was able to determine the length of the year to within twenty eight seconds!<P>
Copernicus felt that the Sun-centered universe was a much more likely idea to explain the "wandering" planets. Yet he said nothing of this for many years. For one thing, he was a religious man and he was loyal to the Church's teaching that man and the planet Earth were at the center of the Universe. He was a retiring man who did not like controversy. Disagreeing with the Church meant a great deal of controversy. Besides all of this, he could not prove his theory. He was right about the simplicity of the orbits, but he couldn't get past Ptolemy's idea that the planets revolved in smaller circles which in turn, revolved around a central body. In the next century a man named Kepler was finally able to discard Ptolemy's complicated system of larger and smaller circles. Kepler drew the simple ellipse that we now accept as the planetary path.<P>
Copernicus waited thirty years to publish his work. By this time he was old and frail. In fact, he died the following year. He left his writing for others to read while he was beyond disagreements with the church. It is true that he did not see the solar system with total accuracy, yet he had the courage to trust his own scientific observations and depart from a thousand years of popular belief. Copernicus started the scientific revolution which was carried on by Kepler, Galileo and Newton.<P>
Nicholas Copernicus was a shy and quiet revolutionary!<P><P>

<H2>	Dr. Eloy Rodriguez</H2>
<IMG SRC="erodrigz.gif" ><P>

<I>"Folk medicines have long been rejected as superstition. Recently, scientists have been subjecting them to scientific tests. Many pass with flying colors."</I><P>

Hildago County, Texas is a very poor area. Work is unavailable for 30% to 40% of the adult males. The families struggle to survive and education is not readily available to them. Neither of Dr. Eloy Rodriquez's parents were able to complete the seventh grade and none of his extended family had received a college degree. Luckily, young Eloy grew up in the typical Hispanic extended family sharing both love and knowledge.<P>
Eloy's early exposure to science was through the people around him solving science problems in their daily lives. His grandfather would take him out to the farm to capture tarantulas. His aunts would collect herbs to treat illnesses. Thus his interest in natural science was sparked.<P>
While he faced discrimination because of his heritage, poverty, not race, was the greater obstacle to education. Dr. Rodriguez states, "You must understand kids that are poor are grossly disadvantaged to such a degree that things we take for granted, like playing in the park, are not available." Yet, his family tradition was that the road to success was through following the path of education.<P>
Seeking the power of excellence in education, he pushed himself in high school. He found that discipline, enthusiasm, and tenacity in his studies bore rewards. A bit of humor helped along the way.<P>
Once in college, he sought to understand what his family had taught him by studying Zoology and Chemistry. While writing about his studies he started focusing more on Biology and finally began working with Plant Chemistry. He was now prepared to understand what his aunts did. But, he was using scientific methods to verify what they had learned through folk culture.<P>
During his college years, Eloy performed any work he could find to pay for school. He mounted bumpers at an auto plant and cleaned offices. While Eloy was sweeping floors, cleaning dishes, and doing general cleanup work in a plant run by a plant chemist, a fellow student who was doing lab work confessed to disliking laboratory work. Dr. Rodriguez says, "I asked if I could help. I learned to extract compounds and do other experiments. I loved it. And I discovered I was pretty good at it."<P>
Dr. Rodriguez became University of California, Irvine's first natural plants biologist in 1976. He visited deserts in Southern California and northern Mexico looking for plants. His initial goal was to find sources for natural rubber that could be grown locally. He found that many of the plants possessed natural defenses against pests.<P> 
His real tie to the past was complete in 1985 when a Harvard University anthropologist Richard Wangham came to him to solve a mystery. The story began in the late 1970s when Dr. Wangham watched a particular chimpanzee pick young leaves off a bush, roll them around in its mouth, and swallow them. This was curious because chimpanzees do not chew leaves. Later, he saw other chimpanzees eat similar leaves. In every case, they were suffering from vomiting and diarrhea. After eating the leaves, both symptoms ceased. As the years passed, he saw many more variations of this natural-medicine drama reenacted.<P>
By 1985, Dr. Rodriguez's studies of medical and pharmaceutical properties had become well known. Dr. Wrangham asked the obvious question: What medicinal substance was in the leaves that the chimpanzees savored. Back in his laboratory, Dr. Rodriguez found the answer. The apes had actually eaten from two closely related shrubs of the Sunflower family. Both were part of the folk medicine of Tanzania. They contained the therapeutic chemical thiarubrine-A. This substance was also effective against plant and animal nematodes (parasitic worms) and fungi. Dr. Rodriguez reasoned that it might also work against tumors. Research is continuing on it as a weapon against cancer.<P>
The deserts remain Dr. Rodriguez's favorite places. But, he worries about the survival of the plants there. While only 10% of the estimated 3000 different species contained there have been tested, 50% of those tested have been shown to have medicinal value. One plant that he calls the superstar, the creosote bush, has over 1,000 potential drugs.<P>
According to Dr. Rodriguez, desert plants are potential sources of oil, rubber, food, pesticides, and medicine. Plants that become extinct will not provide any of these benefits.<P>
These questions could not be answered, nor would they be raised by the previous generation of specialist scientist.<P>

<H1>Biography of a Scientist</H1>
<H2> Maria Mitchell</H2>

<IMG SRC="mmitchel.gif" ><P>

<B><I>"It is lifetime added to lifetime that leads to the discovery of the laws of science."</I></B><P><P>

Maria Mitchell spent a lot of her childhood on the roof of her house. She was born to Quaker parents in l8l8. Though many people of this time believed that sending girls to school would damage their health, the Quakers did not. Maria's dad opened his own school where he taught his children to read and write. He also taught them astronomy, the study of the stars and the planets. That is how Maria ended up on the roof. She had the patience and the interest to sit with her father for hours and hours looking up through the telescope.<P>
People on Nantucket Island, where Maria lived, studied the stars because many men on the island earned their money by going out on whaling ships. They used the position of the stars to tell what direction they were going and to find their way home.<P>   
Maria's father decided to teach all the children in his school about the position of the planets, so he built a model of the solar system in the attic of his house. The sun and planets were made of wooden balls. One Sabbath morning when young Maria was sitting in the parlor, trying her best to obey the Quaker tradition of praying and thinking for the day, she heard a terrible clatter. Her little brother and sister were playing in the attic. They had upset the whole solar system! The planets came bouncing down the stairs. Boom, boom, boom!! The big wooden sun came next  and then two guilty little children peaked around the corner. Maria happily gave up her quiet day to help her brother and sister chase the planets around the parlor and replace them in the attic.
When Maria was just sixteen, she opened up her own school. She invited all girls, rich or poor and black or white. You would have liked to be in her school. Sometimes the students had class before the sun came up. They watched the way the animals behaved at dawn. Sometimes school started after dark and students watched the stars and learned their names. <P>
All this time, and later when Maria became town librarian, she would work during the day, help around the house in the afternoon and watch the stars at night. She carefully recording their changing positions. One night her father gave a party at their house.  She left early because she never missed a night of watching the stars. If she had stayed at the party, you would never have heard her name.<P>
What she saw through her rooftop telescope that night was a fuzzy light moving across the sky just a little above the North Star. She watched its movement for a long time. She knew the sky so well that she was sure that there was no star in this position. She could only think of one explanation  but it was too exciting to be true. She ran down and got her father to leave the party. He looked through the telescope and told his daughter that he believed that her hunch was true. Maria Mitchell had discovered a comet.<P> 
The King of Denmark had offered a gold medal to the first person who found a comet by looking through a telescope. A man in Rome, Italy, had spotted Maria's comet two days after she found it, and a man in England saw it a week later. They both wanted the medal. After a year of discussion and arguments, the winner was announced. Maria Mitchell was awarded the medal. 
Now she was world famous,  People came to the library where she worked just to take a peek at the first woman astronomer. They saw a determined looking woman with a lot of black curls who really concentrated on whatever she was doing. She was quick to answer questions and she spoke in a strong voice. She scared some people but not the young people who came to the library to read. She smiled at them and helped them find their books. 
Exciting things were happening in the United States. A rich man named Matthew Vassar  was opening up a college for women. The most surprising thing of all was that he actually wanted some of the professors to be women. He invited Maria Mitchell to be part of the teaching staff. He had to fight with some of the other people in charge of the college because they did not think women could be part of the teaching staff. They thought women working outside the home would become thin and pale and sickly. 
Mr. Vassar won the argument and for the next 23 years, Maria's class was the place to be at Vassar. She lived in the same building with the girls and she would get everybody up in the middle of the night when the thermometer was at 40 degrees below zero. They all wrapped up in heavy coats and scarves to see a meteor shower. They woke up everyone else on campus shrieking with excitement each time they spotted a meteor falling from the sky. Afterward they all clustered around a big fire in Miss Mitchell's  room and drank coffee. She had parties for her students  where she set up tables around the big telescope and made a poem for each. Astronomy was not all watching and parties.  Miss Mitchell taught her young women about the universe and how to look carefully, write down exactly what they saw and make the most accurate measurements.<P>
Though she was happy with her students she disagreed with the people who ran the college. She was not paid as much as the men who were professors. She joined with other famous women of her time in working to give women the right to vote and to own property. She was elected president of a new organization designed to help women called the Women's Congress. Her knees shook as she stood up to give a speech, but she ignored her fear. She asked to give women a chance to be teachers, doctors, and enter government service. She knew women could offer our country good sense, intelligence, and hard work. Everyone who heard the speech, left with new ideas about women. <P>
Maria continued teaching at Vassar. She knew that there was so much to be learned in science that she could only learn a bit in her lifetime. Through teaching, she could hand down what she found out to her students who would continue the search for other discoveries. She also handed down to us her excitement over watching the wonders of the universe and an example of what one women can accomplish.<P>



Maria Mitchell, American 1818-1889. <BR>
In l847, she discovered a new comet.<BR>
In 1849, she became the first woman to be employed by the Nautical
	 Almanac. <BR>
In l868, was appointed professor of astronomy and director of the
	 observatory at the newly opened Vassar College.<P><P>

<Title>Grade 5, Chapter 3</Title>
<H1>Biography of a Scientist</H1>
<H2>Isaac Newton</H2>
<IMG SRC="inewton.gif" ><P>

<I>"If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</I><P>

Imagine living in Newton's England of 1665. People were dying at the rate of 800 a day of the "Black Death". They would become feverish. Spots of blood would develop under the skin and turn black. The glands in the neck, armpits and groin would swell, then become open sores. The "Black Death", or bubonic plague, was carried by rodents and spread by their fleas. An outbreak of the plague in Cambridge at Trinity College made Isaac Newton decide to return home. He had just received his Bachelor of Arts degree and he was at work on his Master's Degree, but he postponed his studies until it was safe enough at Cambridge.<P>
It was due to this ghastly turn of events that Newton, then 23, was sitting in the garden of his mother's farm. Lost deep in thought, as he frequently was, his concentration was interrupted by the thud of an apple falling from a tree and landing on the ground. He then recalled that a breeze had come up exerting a force upon the apple, strong enough to detach it. He began to compare what he saw to the work of Galileo which showed that a feather and a boulder fall at the same rate of constantly changing speed. Their relative weights make no difference.<P>
Sitting there, playing "hooky" from college and the plague, Newton was about to make a discovery which changed people's understanding of the universe forever. He had learned that the "pull' toward the earth was the same at the top of a tower, the top of a mountain, or the top of a table. Maybe the pull of the earth was the same as far away as the distance of the moon. Maybe the "pull" of the earth kept the moon forever orbiting the earth.<P>
To be accurate, Newton did not pull his reasoning out of the thin air through which the apple fell. He had studied the giants of science who went before him. His basis for thought included Copernicus's sun-centered universe, as well as Galileo's discovery of moons circling Jupiter. And, finally, he studied the work of Tyco Brahe and Kepler who computed the path and speed of the planets. Still, Newton's idea that the same force pulled the apple to the earth has ruled the regular movement of the moon was quite a leap of logic. Before this, it was thought that one group of laws governed the earth, while another set the heavens in motion. Newton called this pull toward the center of the earth "gravity".<P>
Copernicus and Galileo were persecuted during their lifetimes for daring to say that the earth was not the center of the universe. Newton's next discovery brought him so much criticism that he wrote, "... a man must either resolve to put out nothing new or [he must] become a slave to defend [his new ideas]. For this new discovery, he bought himself a prism. In a darkened room, he made a hole in his window shutter to admit a ray of sunlight. It fell upon a large piece of paper that he had placed upon the seat of his armchair. Next he held the prism across the lightbeam, and an oblong patch of rainbow colors fell on the paper. He saw blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. You may perform this experiment yourself. Newton was not the first to do the experiment; however, he was the first to try to explain what happened. 
A prism receives the light, bends it, and spreads it out so that we can see the various colors that make up white light. Some thought that the prism created the colors, but Newton proved that the colors were within the white light by placing a second prism upside down behind the first. This second prism caught the bent light, straightened it out, and turned it back into a single beam of white light. <P>
He explained that white light was made up of different particles that are either absorbed or reflected by objects in our surroundings. So, the leaf reflects green and absorbs all other colors and the apple reflects red while absorbing the rest. He began the concept that light is made of particles. Einstein, over 200 years later, named these particles photons.<P>
Though many people disagreed with Newton's ideas, his work brought him fame. In addition to the above, he designed a reflecting telescope which was superior to previous designs, and is still in use today.<P> 
Newton was invited to teach at Cambridge. Actually, he spent most of his time experimenting and thinking. Students did not understand, nor did they attend his lectures. He lectured to blank walls. He did not pay attention to clothing or brush his hair. He often forgot to eat, and when he was reminded, he took a few forkfulls standing up. He often worked all night, finally sleeping a few hours beginning at 5:00 a.m. Actually he spent most of his time in his room. One time, when he did leave, he led his horse up a hill. Deciding to mount the horse at the top of the hill, he noticed that he was holding a bridle without a horse attached. The horse had slipped out of his bridle and run away. Isaac Newton, lost in thought, never noticed.<P>
Isaac Newton was a real genius, without a doubt, for he went on to write "Principia Mathematica" which is generally considered the greatest scientific book ever written. He had not really told the world about his ideas regarding gravity yet. He wanted to be able to prove them mathematically, using geometry. With a new figure for the radius of the earth, worked out by a scientist named Picard, his calculations proved correct. Also in this great writing are the famous laws of motion, stated in part:<BR>
<I>A body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion remains in motion at constant speed as long as outside forces do not come into play.<BR>
Mass is defined as force and acceleration or inertia and gravitational pull.
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction</I>.<P>

With the publication of this book came more disagreements, arguments, and fame. The absentminded professor was sent to Parliament. His friends looked for more official positions for him because all of his brilliance had brought him little money. Finally at 53, he was made Warden of the Mint, and he made enough money  to have a home and servants. He enjoyed his new position as a man of means. Queen Anne bestowed knighthood on him.<P>
A short time before his death, he wrote "I do not know what I may have appeared to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."<P><P><P>

<H1>Biography of a Scientist</H1>
<H2>Marie Curie</H2>
<IMG SRC="mcurie.gif" ><P>

<P>
Have you heard of Marya Slodovska? Most people would say no.<P>

Marya was born in Poland in l867. She was actually born in one of the rooms of the school where her mother taught. Part of her mother's pay was that the family would live in an apartment above the school. Marya was the youngest of 5 children, all born in the same flat above the school. Both of her parents were teachers and all of the children were eager to learn. When Marie taught herself to read at four years old, she began the chain of events that would take her to France, the name Marie Curie and two Nobel Prizes. The way was not an easy one. In fact, it was marked by enough tragedy to discourage a weaker person. Marya's response to sad events was relentless determination. <P> 
As a child, Marya was fascinated by her father's glass case of physics apparatus. Yet, sadly for the Sladovska family, who loved Poland, her father was not allowed to teach physics or teach in the Polish language. <P> 
For Marya, this early fascination with science was unlikely to lead anywhere. Her family was poor. They were loyal Poles in a Russian society. Besides all this, she was a woman excluded from higher education under Russian rule.<P>  
Marya's mother contracted tuberculosis (T.B.), a highly contagious disease, when Marya was one. The family was forced to move to rooms behind their father's school. The Russian headmaster, who disliked Polish teachers, made life miserable for the family, causing the five children to stay indoors or creep around outside. Finally, he cut Professor Slodovska's salary and forced the family to move. Nearly penniless and in cheap flats, their mother became sicker. <P> 
Though her mother separated herself from her children, she learned to make shoes for her family and showed her love by saving them money with her handmade shoes. In Marya's later life she showed that she inherited her mother's resourcefulness and ability to work and contribute in spite of illness.<P>
By the time Marya was ten, her beloved sister, Sophie had died of typhoid fever and her mother had died of T.B. The family remained in mourning for years. All pretty colored dresses were put away.  Broken hearted, Marya concentrated even more on her books. She could memorize an entire poem in two readings. She and her two sisters, Bronya and Helen, attended Madame Sikorsda's school where lessons in Polish were secretly taught.<P> 
Marya, like her older siblings, graduated from high school with a gold medal.  She and her sister Bronya, wished that they could go on to the university as their brother did.  As women, they were not allowed to attend the university, so they continued their education at a secret "floating university". Marya was introduced to the idea that science could solve many problems of people on Earth.  She was to contribute greatly to the scientific body of knowledge in the next 30 years. <P> 
In the meantime, she and Bronya made a plan. Marya would find a job as a governess and earn money to send to Bronya who would study medicine at the Sorbonne in Paris.  When Bronya became a doctor, she would finance Marya's education at the Sorbonne.  Though Marya hated to leave her father, she became a live-in teacher for a family who lived in the country.  Marya taught the youngsters of the family, organized special free classes for the poor peasant children, and taught herself higher math and physics until 2:00 in the morning.<P>  
Finally, the time came for her to study in Paris.  Bronya had become a doctor and had married a doctor. Again Marya struggled with the problem of not wanting to leave her father and this time, she also dreaded leaving her country, Poland.  
When she joined her sister and  her fun-loving brother-in-law in Paris, she loved being with Bronya again but soon found that she couldn't continue to live in the social whirl of their noisy apartment and study for the difficult classes that she had to master. In the quiet of her own apartment, she studied French, reviewed beginning science, and studied for her classes. Her studying paid off. At the end of two years, she graduated first in her class in physics!<P>
Marie had promised herself that she would return to Poland, and her father, but she felt that she needed a second degree in mathematics.  She started work on it with joy at becoming a more qualified scientist and sadness for staying longer away from her father.  She was also offered her first paying job at this time, the study of how magnetic different types of steel were.  For this, she needed lab space and a friend introduced her to Pierre Curie, a young scientist, who worked at the University and had some space in his lab.  He liked her blond curls, straightforward manner, intelligent conversation and dedication to science.  He wanted to see more of her. She intended to return to Poland, which she did as soon as she got her master's degree in mathematics.  Pierre wrote her every day. He wanted her to join him for a life of science. She did return to Paris, but to study for her doctorate, not to marry. However, Pierre did not give up and Marie became Marie Curie on July 25, 1895.  Always practical and never wasteful, she made sure that her wedding dress was a dark color so that she could wear it to the lab.<P> 
For the next eleven years, Marie found plenty of use for her dark wedding-lab dress.  She was pursuing her doctorate at a time when no other French women had one. She and Pierre decided that she would identify a mysterious ray called "x" because it was unknown.  Its existence was suspected because two scientists had found it while working with uranium.  For her work, the University gave her a cold, drafty room that sometimes was 44 degrees.  Her hands were frozen but she went on.  She found out that the larger the lump of uranium, the stronger the ray.  She collected samples of all types of metals and minerals.  She looked for the existence of the ray and found none.  Finally in one element called thorium, she found it.  She named the unknown ray, "radiation"  She had found two more ores that gave off radiation and both had uranium in them.  The puzzling thing was that they had small amounts of uranium in them but gave off two to four times the radiation of pure uranium.  Marie suspected that this would be a big discovery, indeed.  She thought that the mysterious source of the extra radiation was, perhaps, a new element, one that no other scientist had discovered. <P>
Pierre became so interested that he joined her in working to isolate this new element.  Together, they started with pitchblende and treated it with chemicals that would attract or dissolve all known elements, leaving the unknown.  Marie completed the process and was left with a substance that was 150 times more active than uranium.  When Pierre heated the element, he extracted a black powder that was 330 times more active than uranium. Actually, they had found two elements!  The first Marie named polonium after her country, Poland. Next, they extracted polonium and bismuth from the black powder and found the mysterious element that remained was 900 times more radioactive than uranium. They named it radium and announced their findings to the scientific community.<P> 
They requested lab space to receive the delivery of tons of pitchblende which they would convert into tiny amounts of radium.  This time, the University gave them a shed with a dirt floor and holes in the roof. For four years, they worked in or around the shed, standing on the dirt floor or outside in below zero weather.  Through long work hours and with very little money, they filled test tubes with the new element.  What they did not realize was that they were making themselves sick due to exposure to radiation.  Pierre's joints ached.  Marie had bouts of T.B. The ends of their fingers were burned.  Still they worked and kept careful notes of every step.  Today, 91 years later, the notebooks they wrote in are locked up as they are too radioactive to handle!<P>
Marie Curie received her doctorate and together, the Curies received the greatest award, the Nobel Prize for Physics.  They were too ill to go to Sweden to receive it.<P> 
They continued to do what they dedicated the rest of their lives to, find out the possibilities of radium. They found that radium could be used for x-raying the interior of the body as well as destroying the diseased cells in tumors.  As happy as they were in their work together and with the birth of their second daughter, ill health plagued the couple. Pierre especially suffered from pains in his joints.  He was concerned about possible destructive effects of radium if used in weaponry.  Although he did not connect it with his own illness, he realized that, "In criminal hands, radium might be very dangerous." At times, Pierre seemed depressed about the ramifications of their discovery as well as his ill health. He was in pain all the time and sometimes could not move out of bed.<P>
In 1906, the inseparable couple was separated. Pierre, crossing a busy Paris street, was crushed by a horse and carriage.  Marie was left with two small girls and an empty heart. She wrote that she felt like a body without a soul after Pierre's death.  Yet, she went on to take his place and to become the first woman professor at the Sorbonne. She got a second Nobel Prize, this time for chemistry awarded for all the work she had done on the uses of radium. <P> 
Strangely she did not connect Pierre's illness, her illness or a kidney operation with the effects of radium exposure.  When workers in her lab came down with leukemia, she remarked that they should have spent more time in the open air.  Still, no amount of sadness nor illness stopped her.  She opened a laboratory in Paris and returned to Poland to open a lab there.  With the outbreak of World War I, she set up x-ray labs and trained one hundred fifty women to help military doctors treat wounded soldiers.  She even learned to drive and brought her x-ray equipment to wounded soldiers in an old fashioned horseless carriage.

<H1>Biography of a Scientist</H1>
<H2>Benjamin Banneker</H2>
<IMG SRC="banneker.gif" ><P>


<I>"The color of the skin is in no way connected with the strength  of the mind or intellectual powers."</I><P><P>

  Benjamin Banneker was a genius. He lived during the time when George Washington was President. He was the grandson of an Englishwoman and an African slave. His parents and grandparents owned land and he was born free of slavery. He was a freeman and he owned his own farm.  <P>

Benjamin's mother taught him to read, using the Bible. Later, he went to a school in Maryland, the state where he lived. He was interested in mathematics and made up math problems just for the fun of solving them.  <P>

When he was l9, a traveling salesman showed him a pocket watch.  He had never seen one before. He went right home and drew plans to make one. If you look at the inside of a windup clock, you will see many metal gears. Benjamin carved each gear out of wood. He put them together and produced the first clock ever made in America. It kept perfect time for more than 40 years.  <P>

Mr. Banneker never married but he had many friends and visitors to his farm. If you visited  him, you would find that he had an unusual schedule. At night he would wrap himself in a cloak and sit outside studying the stars until dawn. He would sleep in the day or get up, dress in his old clothes and beaver hat and work mathematical problems. With this schedule, he taught himself astronomy, the science of the stars and planets. He told everyone that there would be a solar eclipse on April l4, l789. Two great astronomers of his time disagreed with him and said publicly that there would be no eclipse. The self-taught genius was right. On that very day in April, the moon passed in front of the sun.<P>   

Four years later, Benjamin Banneker began publishing an almanac. It was a book that came out once a year and told the public about the weather, times of sunrise and sunset as well as medical information. It also had poetry and articles against slavery. Benjamin Banneker found out that Thomas Jefferson had made a big mistake. Mr. Jefferson had said that he didn't think black people could learn as well as white people. Benjamin Banneker sent an almanac and a letter to Thomas Jefferson. The letter explained that with education, black men could learn anything. Jefferson read the almanac and he knew he had been wrong. Being able to learn had nothing to do with being black or white. He  sent Banneker's almanac to France and England to show it off. He made Benjamin Banneker famous all over the world. <P>    

President George Washington had heard of Mr. Banneker. The President asked Mr. Banneker to work as assistant to Andrew Ellicott to survey and lay out the  design for the streets in the new capital of the nation, Washington, D.C. He would be the one to make the astronomical and mathematical calculations which had to be very precise. The men worked together many days to make plans that showed where streets, bridges and buildings  would be built. Then something terrible happened. The head of the project, a Frenchman had a disagreement with the city's commissioners. They thought his wide streets and many parks wasted valuable property. He stuck to his ideas about the beauty of the city. The commissioners wanted land to settle and to sell land. They complained to President Washington and Jefferson who were busy running the country and took the side of the commissioners. The French architect was asked to leave and he went home to France with all the plans Ellicott and Banneker had spent so long laying out in the new capitol-to-be.  All of their time and work would have been wasted but Ellicott and Banneker saved the day. They used their notes and Banneker's fine memory to recreate the plans. They stuck with the project to completion. If you visit Washington, D.C. today, you will drive on streets which the self-taught astronomer and surveyor, Benjamin Banneker, helped to design and construct.  <P>  

Benjamin Banneker was a genius who worked against slavery and for his country.  He wanted our president to make a Department of Peace to work for the states and other countries to solve problems without wars.  He believed in free public education for all people in the United States. Benjamin Banneker was a black man who left his mark on our country.  <P>

<Title>Grade 6, Chapter 1</Title>
<H1>Biography of a Scientist</H1>
<H2>Dr. Maria Geoppert Mayer</H2><P>

<I>"Think of a roomful of waltzers. Suppose they go round the room in circles, each circle enclosed within another. Then imagine that in each circle, you can fit twice as many dancers by having one pair go clockwise and another pair go counterclockwise. Then add one more variation; all the dancers are spinning-twirling  round and round like tops as they circle the room, each pair both twirling and circling. But only some of those that go counterclockwise are twirling counterclockwise; the others are twirling clockwise while circling counterclockwise. The same is true of those that are dancing around clockwise; some twirl clockwise, others twirl counterclockwise."<P>

"But I don't know anyone in Stockholm."</I><P><P> 

Maria Geoppert Mayer's story is a love story. She loved science and she loved a man named Joe Mayer. The two loves worked together. She met Joe while she was in her native Germany. He had come from the U.S.A. to study. She was in college learning about the atom, the tiniest particle which makes up everything in the universe. Maria married Joe Mayer and passed her tests to become a Doctor of Physics. Joe Mayer, who was also a scientist, got a job at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Maria regretfully, left her native Germany. The year was 1930, and even in the USA, women could not get jobs as scientists. So, Maria, with a doctorate in physics, was given a job at the university helping to type a professor's letters. Even though the world was not ready for women in science, Joe did not let his wife's scientific mind rest. He asked her to teach him quantum mechanics, the energy that comes from inside the atom and he taught her physical chemistry, what everything is made of and what happens when you mix things together. Next, they worked together on a book to teach people about the way molecules are put together. On trips home to Germany, Maria began to see the Nazi influence. She decided that she would apply for American citizenship so her children would have two American parents. The couple opened their home to the constant stream of scientists who escaped the Nazis.  <P> 
When Joe was asked to leave Johns Hopkins, Maria blamed herself. After all, Joe had kept asking for jobs for her. Joe was happy! He was given a new job at Colombia University with twice the pay of Johns Hopkins. Maria packed their 2 children and their furniture to settle the family in a new house. Joe told her to keep working in science. She was concerned about leaving the children but she was invited to be part of a team of scientists who were working on ideas to help the United States in World War II. Neils Bohr and Enrico Fermi, two famous names in science, had told her of the fear that Nazi German had discovered a way to release tremendous quantities of energy by bombarding uranium atoms with the nuclear particle called the neutron. When the nucleus of the uranium atom was split, an explosion of unheard-of force could by unleashed. She and Joe thought it was important to use what she knew to help the United States gain the information before Germany made use of it. The Mayers found a nanny to stay with the children. Maria came home to spend as much time as she could with her daughter and son. She kept the details of her war work secret, even from Joe, and wept with the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima. She had worked on a project that she hoped would never succeed. Its success meant so many deaths of innocent people.<P>
Finally, 16 years after Maria Mayer had earned her Doctorate, she was given a job. She was asked to teach college students along with her husband's new job at the University of  Chicago. She would have an office and her own students just like her husband. She was thrilled even though there was a big difference between her job and her husband's.  He would be paid and she would not be given a penny!<P>
Pay was not her top interest, learning new ideas in science was.  Her husband invited her to be part of his weekly science discussions with some of the greatest scientists of the day. She knew how to listen carefully and she put all the new ideas together. One of the questions explored by the group was about the origin of the elements on earth. The fact that some elements, such as  tin and lead, were so abundant was a particular mystery to the scientists. Maria noticed a pattern in the numbers of the nuclei of the abundant elements: 82 or 50 neutrons kept coming up as did 82 or 50 protons. She collected information from the men who ran the atom smasher and she added five more numbers: 2, 8,20, 28, and 126. She called these seven numbers, her "magic numbers". Soon she was so taken by the reason for and the relationship of these numbers that she was unable to give her children the time she felt they needed and she paid little attention to friends. She was developing the "shell model" for the nucleus. She saw the nucleus as being like an onion with the protons and neutrons revolving around each other in layers. This shell model was not original with her, but when she described the pattern of the circling protons and neutrons as "spin-orbiting" one pair going clockwise, the other going counter clockwise, she broke new ground. She saw the role her seven "magic numbers" played. They represented the most abundant elements because in these elements the nuclear particles were very tightly bound together, going in a clockwise-counter clockwise, clockwise-counterclockwise pattern. These tightly fitting nuclei would not change properties with any other elements and that was why these certain elements such as tin and lead were so abundant.<P>    
Her husband urged her to write an article on her discovery. The Mayer children remember the day that their father stood over their mother with a pencil and paper and said, "Write!" He knew that many were working on the same problem and that she should rightfully claim the honor of being the first to put all the separate pieces of information together. She did not seem to be concerned with getting any credit. Perhaps this came from so many years as a woman in the background of science. Joe Mayer was stern. "Write!", he repeated. Her son remembers seeing his father place a pencil in his mother's hand. She wrote. She described her new idea in two articles and later, in a book. Scientists read it. They worked with her ideas and tested them. In time her "shell model" became accepted by scientists around the world.<P>
In the l954, both Joe and Maria were offered jobs at the University of California at San Diego. They were thrilled, but their happiness was marred by Maria's illness and stroke soon after they moved. She had been a lifelong smoker and, even after the stroke and paralysis of her left side, she did not stop smoking. At 4:00 A.M., one November morning she got a long distance call from Stockholm. She was asleep when the phone rang. When the operator told her where the call came from, she said sleepily into the receiver, "I don't know anyone in Stockholm." Next the caller told her that she had been given the world's top prize for physics, the Nobel Prize.  She was only the second woman to be chosen. The first was Maria Curie.<P>  
As she sat on the stage weeks later, she looked down into the audience and saw her husband.  She recognized how his encouragement had helped her. Yet it was her curiosity, her willingness to work in science even though women did not get jobs or pay, her ability to listen and think for herself that gave her the ideas that led all of the men and women scientists of her time.<P>

<Title>Grade 6, Chapter 2</Title>
<H1>Biography Of A Scientific Theory</H1>
<H2>Evolution</H2><P>

That everything changes is obvious. But how and why is not. Science attempts to find explanations, called theories. The Theory of Evolution is actually many theories unified under one name. We are featuring two scientists, one past and one of this century who have explained some of the changes that we can see.<P><P>


<H2>Charles Darwin</H2>
Darwin described himself as <I>"... no genius, just a man with a love for science and patience to observe and collect facts."</I><P><P>

Charles Darwin was a lucky child.  His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, had been a doctor and a gifted poet.  His father was one of the busiest doctors in Shrewsbury, England and his mother was a member  of the wealthy Wedgewood family.  Even though young Charles would inherit enough money to live comfortably without work, Dr. Darwin wanted his son to be prepared to work. He wanted his son to be a doctor.<P>    
The problem was that young Charles was not happy in the classroom.  While his teachers wanted him to rewrite Greek, write on ancient history or learn Latin words, Charles wanted to stroll around the hillsides.  His grades were fair to poor, but his mind was busy.  He learned the names of the robin and the wren and compared their habits.  He read a chemistry book from cover to cover and performed experiments in the family toolshed. His teachers thought him foolish.<P>  
Charles did give medical school at Edinburgh a try, but, as usual, found class dull.  He did not like to deal with sick people.  And he described the surgery without anesthetics as a torture chamber that "haunted me for many a year".<P>
He made friends with Adam Sedgwick, a Cambridge Professor of Geology.  Professor Sedgwick knew of a ship that would leave for a voyage around the world with the main goal of mapping the southern coast of South America.  The Captain, Robert Fitzroy, wanted a young gentleman to go along as the naturalist.<P>  
Thus began the famous 4 year and 7 month trip aboard the Beagle that changed the world of scientific thought forever. Most scientific thought was that a series of geological catastrophes occurred which suddenly and completely brought changes to earth and new life forms.<P> 
After thirty years of study and research, Darwin's book, The Origin of Species, was published in 1859. He presented his conclusions on his observations and reasoning.<P>
He stated that members of every species reproduce, creating more individuals born that can possibly survive.  Not all live because food is limited and they compete against their own kind as well as other species for the same food sources. The ones who do live have special characteristics that suit them best for the environment and make them the best competitors. They are likely to produce offspring with the same characteristic as they have.  Over long periods of time, the species changes as the survivors pass on the genes for adapting. A new species emerges that is similar to the species of long ago but changed, more suited to survival.  <P>
With all Darwin's family wealth and boyhood comfort, he proved himself a tough sailor and traveler. He endured days of sailing around Cape Horn, at the tip of South America, where the seas are furious. His job as a naturalist was to collect and catalog specimens. He would leave the ship and travel across land between ports. He climbed mountains, hiked on foot through jungles, crossed desert terrain, and rafted down reptile infested waters. All the while, he collected thousands of specimens, and drew and wrote in his notebook. Darwin always arrived at the next Beagle port on schedule.<P>
His travels convinced him that our earth is always changing, and that most of the changes take millions of years. Most scientists of that time thought that a series of geological catastrophes occurred which suddenly and completely brought changes to the earth and these changes caused new life forms to develop.<P>
Darwin's ideas sparked debate. Some people thought that Darwin was evil and that his ideas challenged the Bible. Others thought that good science only strengthened the "hand of God" in creation. Still others believed science and religion did not belong in the same discussion.<P>



Charles Darwin is one of the most famous names in science.  <I>Exact observation, patience and willingness to record detail may or may not make a genius, but they do make a great scientist.</I><P><P>



<H2>Barbara McClintock </H2>

<I>"It [problem solving] was a tremendous joy, the whole process of finding that answer.  Just pure joy."</I><P><P>

Being different and being alone  are two  things most of us are so afraid of,  Barbara McClintock was not. Barbara was born in l902.  She was the third girl in the family.<P>  
In high school, she discovered science classes and threw herself into solving the problems presented in these classes.  "It was a tremendous joy, the whole process of finding that answer.  Just pure joy."  While her sisters found short careers in the arts and soon married, Barbara studied, played sports and enjoyed all life offered.<P>  
At college, she was happy from the very first lecture that she attended.  "It was zoology [the science of forms of animal life] ...I was doing just what I really wanted to do, I never lost that joy all through college."  Though she was asked  to join  a sorority, a girl's social club that accepts members by invitation only, she decided that she could not.  She said that she could never be part of a system that said yes to some girls, but no to others.  Her first year at college was the most social time of her life.  She was elected president of her class and she had many dates.  Her family was delighted with her new found sociability and popularity.<P>
Barbara found her love when she took her first course in the science of genetics, the study of heredity.  Gregor Mendel, a monk who lived 100 years before her had made careful observations of the pea plant and how such traits as tallness of smooth and shiny peas were dominant over short pea plants or wrinkled peas.  Next, a man named Thomas Hunt Morgan studied the generations of the fly and he could see how many traits were carried down.  At Cornell, however, genetics research was carried on in the cornfield  using beautiful multicolored "Indian Corn".  This was to be the way Barbara McClintock got worldwide recognition.<P> 
Since the genetics department at Cornell did not take women, Barbara studied botany, the science of plant life.   She took those ears of corn and observed the color patterns, size and shape.  She bent over the microscope and what she proved, she wrote about.  Not only did she get her doctorate, but she made nine very important discoveries.  She showed that the chromosome a tiny part of the cell, located inside of the nucleus carried the messages that gave the traits for tallness, shortness, color and that there is an exchange of genes in the early stages of reproduction when the chromosomes from the "parents" join.  This discovery was called the basis for the whole field of experimental genetics. <P>
In 1941, she was offered a job with a house and a salary to do experiments at Cold Spring Harbor, near New York.  She took it and fell into her beloved routine, planting corn, tending it, watching it come up and observing every trait of every plant.  She wrote that she "knew every plant ... intimately and that she found great pleasure in knowing them."  When she looked down into the microscope at the chromosomes that made the patterns she saw in her growing corn, she felt that she "was actually right down there and these were my friends." <P> 
What Dr. McClintock tackled next was the new discovery in 1953 called DNA. Scientists recognized it as the location where the genes were passed on, but they had no idea how it happened,  They thought that the genes were stuck in one place and that as the plant or animal developed, these stationary storytellers dictated such characteristics as its size, color, and shape.  Barbara McClintock's tireless observation of the colored corn kernels told her a different story.  She saw repeated pattern, she saw unusual patterns called mutations. She did not think that these  genetic elements of the winding chord of DNA were stuck in one place.  She noted that they jumped around.  She further figured out that the pattern they made depended upon the place the plant was in its development, a sprout, a growing plant or a mature plant.<P>
The fact that genetic material can jump around is an important piece of information.  It shows us how a whole being can come from one single cell, how a new type of plant or animal can appear, how cancer cells grow or how the body produces white blood cells to fight disease.  Then the tools of high tech caught up with the hands and eyes of Dr. McClintock.  They showed that bits of the DNA did indeed jump around.  Though Barbara had observed this in her pals, the ears of corn, the new technology showed that it is true for every type of organism.  Barbara McClintock began to be noticed.  People wanted to talk to her, they gave her awards and prize of money.   Her reaction was to return to the solitude of spending each day with her corn and her experiments. <P>
In 1983 Dr. Barbara McClintock became the first woman in history to win the Nobel Prize for medicine.  For most it would have been a thrill.  Newspapers wanted to interview her. Again, scientists gathered to hear her words.  She disliked the fuss.  Even though the Nobel prize is considered the greatest honor in the world for a scientist, Dr. McClintock merely thanked everybody and went back to the work she loved. 


As in all of science, it is unlikely that the discoveries of Dr. McClintock will be the final answer to the question of why species change. But the more we learn, the stronger her theories appear. The March 1993 issue of Scientific American contains an article starting on page 122 that points strongly to the truth of her theories.<P><P>

<H1>Biography of Science: The Joy of Discovery</H1>

<I>"Science is a great game. It is inspiring and refreshing. The playing field is the universe itself."</I><BR>
		<B>Isadore I. Rabi</B><P>

One recurring theme in most stories about  great scientists is that they enjoyed the work so much that they were willing to put forth great effort. In this they are no different from mountain climbers, great athletes, or top musicians. The two following scientists came from improbable backgrounds to achieve success through the "joy of the game".<P>

<H2>Thomas A. Edison</H2>
<I>"There is no substitute for hard work.   "Genius is one per-cent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."</I><P><P>

Thomas Edison was born into a world of the "olden times", but he died in a modern world. He was responsible for more than a little of the change.<P> 

He was the youngest of a family of four and he was a mischief maker. He was always taking things apart and one time set his father's barn afire to see what would happen. His father's reaction was to give him a public whipping in the town square. Though this had to have been a strong lesson for Tom, his experimental nature survived. He was soon observed in a neighbor's barn, sitting on a nest of eggs to see if they would hatch. Tom's mother decided to send him to the Reverend Engle's strict school. Tom did not pay attention to the lessons and Reverend Engle called him "addled". His father agreed with the Reverend, but his mother did not. She took him out of the school at the age of seven and began teaching him herself. She read him Shakespeare and Dickens as well as <I>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</I>. He was extremely interested in the books his mother found to read to him and he found others to read to himself.<P>  
In fact, Edison was interested in just about everything, though, as we know he was not a good student. He had doubts about his own intelligence. "My father thought I was stupid and I almost decided that I must be a dunce." For one thing, a bout with scarlet fever, at age seven, left him hard of hearing. A train "accident" added to his deafness. He earned money for his family by selling newspapers and snacks between stops of the local passenger train. He also used the extra space in a baggage car to set up a little lab to perform experiments in his free time. One day, a train started to pull away without him. He ran to catch up, his arms full of papers and cakes. A conductor, reaching down to pull the young boy aboard, found nothing free, but Tom's two ears. As the conductor pulled him aboard by the ears, Tom felt a "pop". This injury to his ears left Tom even more deaf than before.<P>
Still he was sharp and alert. One day, while at a train stop, he saw a train roll toward a small boy, the telegraph operator's son. Tom ran to him and whisked him away from the rolling train. In return for this dramatic rescue, the telegraph operator taught Tom to operate the telegraph. Tom learned and started work with somewhat disastrous results. He did not pay careful attention to the messages. He made an invention which produced an automatic response, leaving Tom free to nap, or, of course, experiment. Once he neglected his post and two trains almost collided. He played practical jokes on his fellow workers, like connecting an electric generator to the water trough where employees washed their hands. Cleaning up was a shock to these employees and a laugh for Tom.<P>
As if his lack of attention to his work and practical jokes weren't enough, he dressed eccentrically and didn't pay much attention to his appearance.  He was known as "The Looney" and he soon lost so many jobs that he ran out of places to work. <P>
Not one to dwell on failure, he had the ego strength to start out on a new career. He would be an inventor. He set out to solve the problem of sending two telegraph messages on one wire. A businessman lent him money to make a "duplex" telegraph, one that would send two messages. Once he had the money, however, his mind raced to other inventions. He tried an automatic voting machine for the Congress. He came up with one that worked but the senators and congressmen weren't interested. He worked on other inventions until the money ran out.<P> 
Success came to him after a time with the making of a better gold ticker, the device which told the current price of gold. With the $40,000 that he earned from it, he set up a factory. His employees liked him because he worked along side of them, putting in long hours and even sleeping right at the shop. He invented a quadruplex, a 4-way telegraphic transmitter, the phonograph, and, of course, the electric light bulb.<P> 
Before this, people were dependent on candles or gaslight. Edison found a simple and inexpensive solution that would allow the average citizen to light up his house. The Edison Effect bulb, was the forerunner of the vacuum tube which became the radio tube and t.v. tube.  Edison became a legend with his demonstrations of the light bulb, but he was already working on his idea of a big generating plant. He wanted to light up whole cities. His demonstration model for this idea was the Pearl Street Plant which lit up 200 homes with a dynamo and a wiring system that grew into today's Con Ed to which New Yorkers write their monthly electric bills today. <P>
Thomas Edison lived to be eighty-four years old. He died on October 18, l931. On October 21, in tribute to Edison, the inventor, all lights across the United States were dimmed, even the on  Statue of Liberty.<P> 

Edison left a new world of 24 hours of light and activity. This new world demanded the use of energy sources never used before. Each of the energy sources developed has created its own problems. Once of the sources is nuclear power plants which produce long term radioactive by-products that cause risk to the environment. Solutions are being sought. Leo Gomez is one of the people seeking those solutions.<P>

<H2>Leo S. Gomez</H2>
<I>"Science is fun. Studying hard is like practicing football, the more you work, the better you get, and the more fun you have."</I><P>

Dr. Leo Gomez was born in 1940 in the barrio of Barelas in Albuquerque, NM. Leo's mother used to read to him every day when he was very young.  He learned that much information about the world was available in books, especially about far away places.<P>
He attended Catholic schools for 9 years, where the nuns stressed the value of an education for both boys and girls.  Leo would go to the public library every week during the summertime.  He would check out books on any subject that interested him, and almost everything did.<P>
The teachers at Albuquerque High School (public school), where he next went, encouraged students to fulfill their educational potential.  One school counselor took it upon himself to make sure that Leo gave serious consideration to attending college.  The counselor took Leo to visit physicians and scientists in Albuquerque so that Leo could get an idea of what real scientists did in their work.<P>
Leo's parents were divorced when he was eight years old. His mother did not have the money to send him to college. Once Leo decided to attend college, he worked at various part-time jobs.  He worked every day for seven years (from the age of 14 until he graduated from college at the age of 21).  During the summer he worked at three jobs, starting at 6:30 a.m. and working until 11:00 or 12:00 at night. Among his jobs were painting houses. working in a grocery store, repairing office machines, selling vacuum cleaners, cleaning department stores, mowing lawns, delivering office supplies, loading alfalfa onto trailers, working in movie theaters, and working at any other jobs he could find.<P>
Leo received his degree in Biology from the University of New Mexico.  After working for seven years, he wanted to know more. With the help of fellowships, he was able to go back to graduate school at Colorado State University. Leo received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Radiation Biology. Since graduating Leo has worked at several nuclear research facilities seeking answers on how to prevent radiation damage caused by nuclear waste, and is presently at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. At Sandia, Leo has had the opportunity to work with some of the world's best oceanographers In studying the ecology of the deep oceans. He has also served on two committees (Marine Radioactivity and Marine Chemistry) which advise Jacques Cousteau on pollution of the Mediterranean Sea. Leo has been able to travel to many countries in Europe and South America to work with other scientists seeking answers. He has gone to sea for up to a month at a time to do his research on the potential problems related to nuclear waste disposal in the sea.<P>
Without taking advantage of educational opportunities when they presented themselves, Leo would never have been able to work with some of the best scientists in the world nor would he have been able to see so much of the world.<P>
Leo chose to work in the field of Radiation Ecology because it gives him the opportunity to use all of the science and mathematics he has learned. He gets to use Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geology and Mathematics almost every day. Another reason he loves his work is that he tries to help people all over the world live in a better environment. To do work that you love and to help people is the best job that anyone can have.<P>

<H1>Biography Of A Scientist</H1>
<H2>Charles Drew</H2>
<I>"I got banged up in football and wanted to know how the human body worked."</I><P><P>

Have you ever known someone who was good at everything? Charles Drew was just that. Born in l904, to Richard and Nora Drew, he claimed as his heritage relatives who were Native American, Scottish, and English, as well as African. Charles grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood. Charles was an energetic school boy who could be seen on the street corner selling newspapers. Before long, he and his brother had six other paper boys working for them and, in this way, contributed money to their family.<P>

A few years later, at Dunbar High, which had the reputation of excellence for its all-black student population, Charles was a stand-out. He was a star football player in the fall, a winter varsity basketball player and a spring baseball and track team member. He gathered awards for being the Best Athlete, top all-round athlete, Most Popular, and the Student Who Has Done the Most for the School.  <P>
Charles Drew was "Mr. Dunbar High", yet his high school years were clouded by his little sister's tuberculosis and her eventual death. It was this tragic event which first wakened his desire to be a doctor.<P>

An event which happened in college football increased his interest. He received a gouge of cleats in the thigh during a touchdown. The injury sent him to the hospital with an infection so serious that it could have meant the amputation of his leg. His leg recovered completely. Toward the end of his hospital stay, a doctor invited him on rounds to see the other patients. One young boy with a ruptured appendix recognized the college athletic hero. Charles Drew left the hospital more sure than ever that he wanted to be a doctor. He also had first-hand knowledge of the need for work in the storage and preservation of blood.<P>

Howard University turned him down as a medical student but asked him to be a football coach. He stuck to his decision, and he was accepted at McGill University Medical school. <P>
His was especially interested in a class called "An introduction to Bacteriology" which was taught by John Beattie. One day Dr. Beattie invited Charles to Montreal General Hospital to take part in lab work as well as assist in the hospital routine. Charles saw a group of worried looking people in a hospital waiting room. From Beattie, Charles learned that they were relatives of an elderly man who waiting for emergency surgery to have his leg amputated. His relatives were having their blood tested to see if any of them matched his blood type. One by one, they offered their arms, gave blood samples, and received disappointing news that their blood did not match that of the patient. A sister of the sick man arrived and when her blood was not the correct type, Charles decided to draw a sample of his own blood. It turned out to be a match and Drew gladly donated what was needed. He realized that if he had not happened upon the scene, the surgery might have been delayed too long and the emergency might have had a tragic end. He could see that what was needed was a way to store blood for use in emergencies.<P>
What Beattie and Drew were testing for that day was whether the man's relatives had blood typed as A, B, AB, or O. A person with O blood may give to any group. A person with AB may receive from any group. Otherwise, A's may give and receive from A's and B's may give or receive from other B's. <P>

Drew worked as a physician during these years, but he continued his research too. On one project, he added a substance called sodium citrate to blood to preserve it. Charles Drew received an invitation to take special training from New York's Colombia University. He was the first black to receive the degree of Doctor of Science from Colombia. Most importantly, he was asked to head their blood bank. <P>

At about this time he met a lovely lady named Lenore Robbins who taught home economics at Spellman College. It took Dr. Drew exactly one dinner conversation to make an important decision. Two days later, he showed up at her dorm late in the evening, and proposed marriage to her. After all, he was a very busy person. He needed to get things done! Lenore reminded him that they hardly knew each other. Charles would not leave until she said she would consider marriage. For the next six months Dr. Drew performed surgery, did research, administered the blood bank and wrote love letters. Leonore got the message and they were  married.<P>
It did not take her long to notice that her husband was busy. She had given up her job and wanted to go back to work. Her husband asked her to help him. In explaining the way the human body uses blood and what it was made of, an idea came to him. A little more than one half of the blood is made of plasma. Plasma contains nutrients, proteins, antibodies, and hormones. What is missing from plasma is the red blood cells. The red blood cells make up the part of that breaks down and causes the blood to be unusable. It is also the part that needs to be typed. If plasma could be used, it would not deteriorate in a week, and could be used in surgeries with people of all blood types.<P>

This important realization came at a time when World War II was beginning. Hitler was bombing England and blood was needed immediately. Drew's professor from McGill, John Beattie, cabled from England that Charles Drew, was the man to supervise such a shipment. Soon after, America was in the war and Drew's job was to provide blood for American wounded.<P> 
He was working on the use of the centrifuge to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. It spun at a rapid rate, throwing plasma out from a central point and collecting it separately from the red blood cells. Next, he tried to produce dried plasma which would be easier to ship, but, he was not able to produce it in large quantities. He had other problems, however. He received a directive from the U.S. War Department telling him "not to mix Caucasian blood with negro blood." There was no medical reason for this. Furthermore, black blood donors were being turned away in the south.<P>
Drew spoke out. He repeated what everybody who studied medicine knew. Blood differed by types, not by race. He later resigned from the National Blood Bank. He wanted to take a job as Chief of Surgery at Howard University. Some said he quit in anger, but he said he was ready for a change. As Lenore put it, she'd never seen him run from a fight. <P>

He got right into life at Howard, the university that turned him down as a medical student. He had a full schedule of teaching, seeing patients,working with various boards and societies, and showing a special interest in his students. To this schedule and his family of four children, he added speaking engagements. Returning from one such engagement, he fell asleep at the wheel and was killed when his car left the road.<P><P><P>

<Title>Grade 6, Chapter 5</Title>
<H1>Biography Of  A  Scientist</H1>
<H2>Dr. Betty Meggers</H2><P>

Interest in Dr. Betty Meggers' major discovery increased with the Quincentennial of Columbus. Her discovery relates to contact between Asia and Latin America, not Europe and America as with Columbus. And, her discovery is dated at over 5,000 years ago, not just 500 years ago like Columbus.<P>
Dr. Betty Meggers and her late husband and fellow archaeologist Dr. Clifford Evans found there had been trans-Pacific contact between the people of what is now Ecuador and the people of Japan. The evidence is pottery. Dr. Meggers and Dr. Evans found pieces of pottery (potsherds) in their excavations along the Ecuadorian coast.<P> 
Some pieces that were dated at 5400 years ago matched the type of pottery being made in Japan at the same time. The similarities were amazing. Japan is well known for their pottery making and the tradition is over ten thousand years old. Ecuador has no similar tradition. The logical explanation was there were contacts across the Pacific!<P>
Dr. Meggers developed this theory thirty years ago. She first had to use the evidence to convince her husband, Dr. Evans. Then the team brought the find to other archaeologists. Many were not interested. It did not agree with the commonly held ideas, so it was not accepted widely.<P>
Time, patience, careful research, and persistence brought about change in the attitudes of archaeologists who at first rejected the Meggers-Evans discovery. Dr. Meggers is a persistent person. She knew she and her husband were right. Now a few museums are displaying evidence of their find, often as part of exhibits showing the various contacts between the "worlds" of the past. <P>
Archaeology is a field of science that requires curiosity, patience, persistence, careful record keeping, and good communication skills. Dr. Betty Meggers is that type of person. As a high school student in Washington, D.C., she started volunteering at the Smithsonian Institution. She wanted to be an archaeologist, but realized the profession had some limitations, at the time, for women.<P>
She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania believing that she probably would become a museum worker. A strong prejudice existed against women doing the heavy work of archaeology. Her second degree was in archaeology also, but with an emphasis on museum work. In 1944 she began work toward her archaeology doctorate (Ph.D.) at Colombia. While at Columbia, Betty Meggers met Cliff Evans, another graduate student in archaeology.<P>
The Meggers-Evans cooperation was more than just common professional interest. They married in 1946 and began their joint career. They both wanted to do Latin American research. In some areas of archaeology there were many researchers. Latin American research was difficult and few archaeologists were involved in it. Dr. Meggers and Dr. Evans studied maps and decided to work with an area known as the Amazon Basin.<P>
Their first field work was on an island in the mouth of the Amazon River. At Marajo, they did not find whole villages or statues as archaeologists do in dry areas like Egypt. Their work concentrated on fragments left by civilizations. Weather extremes and the lack of stone for construction or creation of art made Marajo very unlike working in Yucatan or Greece.<P>
Over the years, with support from the Smithsonian Institution and other groups, Dr. Meggers and Dr. Evans developed a systematic approach to research. Most of their work was concentrated in Ecuador and Brazil. When they began their studies, there was little research already done. Dr. Meggers notes that a most rewarding part of her career was to develop a body of research in this region. She and Dr. Evans created a prehistoric sequence.<P>
Their research method is difficult, requiring both physical stamina and great patience. They would find promising areas, usually from information given by people who lived in an area. Then they would dig a one and a half meter square hole. Dirt was taken out in ten centimeter sections. It would be saved for extensive classification in their laboratory.<P>
Dr. Meggers is still doing research based on the material she and her husband collected in the Amazon Basin. She separates pottery fragments into decorated and undecorated. She checks what was added to the pottery. She counts fragments to compute how often items appear. She notes increases of one type and decreases of another. Through this complicated process, she understands village movements, changes in territories controlled by a group or tribe, and other information about the prehistoric cultures.<P>
While some archaeologists work with large pieces of evidence, Dr. Meggers looks for small changes to validate theories or develop new understandings. She and her husband began training Latin American archaeologists many years ago. Archaeology was not taught in Latin American universities as a major field, but there was some interest among history students about the prehistory of their countries. Taking advantage of that interest, Meggers and Evans sought out individuals who might study archaeology further. Dr. Meggers just returned from Ecuador where she talked at the university, encouraging and teaching Equadorians.<P>
Often specialists in a variety of sciences work together to create new understandings. Research done by Dr. Meggers and Dr. Evans, has been combined with research being done by climatic modelers to better understand the El Nio conditions. Climatology is a new science. Archaeology contributes that during the last 2000 years there have been four periods of aridity (great dryness) in the Amazon Basin. The climatic modelers include that information in their thinking as they predict the global impact of El Nio and the probability of a mega Nio.<P>
Dr. Meggers finds value in these studies into the past. She suggests societies can profit by the mistakes of the past, but they should not focus on the wrongs. Archaeology can demonstrate problems and possibilities of people as they interact with their environment. Societies and civilizations have changed regions and been changed by them. Using all of a particular resource in an area has caused groups to move elsewhere, for example. Pollution of streams is another cause for societal change found anciently and not just today. Opportunities exist for people of today to learn from the past.<P>
Dr. Meggers is respected and appreciated by her colleagues at the Smithsonian. Many people who were born in 1921 have retired, yet Dr. Meggers is in her Smithsonian Institution office at 6 am daily. "I get more done if I am in early," she notes. She is writing a monograph (a short book) about the Meggers-Evans discovery regarding contact between the peoples of Japan and Ecuador five thousand years ago, and continuing her other work.<P>
Dr. Meggers is a person who has made a difference. She became an archaeologist who worked in the field when women were thought to be too fragile. She attributes part of her success to marrying a man who encouraged her and with whom she had a personal and professional partnership. He was pleased when she published first and her name became well known. They worked together in the field and at the Smithsonian. Their strengths complemented each other. He was excellent at the technical aspects, identifying stone objects, recognizing rocks, and managing the digs. She provided theoretical models and systems for classification. They both had stamina and the ability to work and live in the jungle during the field work. Their collaboration lasted until his death eleven years ago.<P>
As a young scientist and even now, Dr. Meggers looks to two scientists for inspiration, Dr. Evans, and Marie Curie. Science, according to Dr. Meggers, is patient, persistent effort. Curious people are needed in science because there is more to be uncovered. All of the important discoveries have not been made already. There is so much more to uncover.

President Johnson, Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, Norman Lear, Carol Burnett, Sammy Davis Jr., Doris 
Day, Jimmy Stewart, Mel Blanc, Goldie Hawn, The Beatles, and the list goes on and on.

Rev. Dr. Rick Nappi has been selected as a luminary by the NHF (National Health Federation).  Dr. Nappi is also a contributing editor for the "Health Freedom News", recipient of the luminary award, honorary member, writer and speaker for The National Health Federation. He sits on the advisory board of "Vie" (a national fitness magazine) and on the medical advisory board for "Knock-Out" ( a female athlete magazine), and writes a column every issue for the latter as well as supplying resource material for other writers ranging from "Cosmopolitan" to "Woman's World" magazine. In addition he is the Chairperson, contributing editor, writer and spokesperson for internet's "Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation" and Pastor of The Universial Life Church. Rev. Dr. Nappi also has launched a world wide web site on the internet were everyone can learn about natural medicine, engage in his health chat forums, get private consultations, celebrity interviews, weekly newsletter, try natural products, and combine this information and services with the teaching of faith in the divine, through online prayer, ordaining new Ministers, distance education and more 24 hours a day.  Without a doubt Rev. Dr. Nappi is a refreshing voice for the natural medicine industry and house of God and is always available to give information to the media and consumers. Natural health and faith without sacrifice!   
<P>
In today's busy world, we often forget to stop and smell the roses. However, as one of the foremost Doctors of Naturopathy/Homeopathy, Rev.Dr. Rick Nappi, N.D., DIHom., FBIH not only stops to smell the roses, but often uses them and a variety of God's plants to maintain good health naturally for himself as well as all his congregation.
<P>
Rev. Dr. Nappi's love of the outdoors stemmed from growing up in the lush, seaside landscape of South Hampton, New York. The great grandson of Homeopathic Doctors to the Russian Czar, one might say the desire to practice natural medicine was "in his blood." Yet it was the influence of his grandparents, who were also Homeopathic doctors and Master herbalist's, that spurred a young Dr. Nappi to learn how to take the beauty of the natural surroundings and use it to benefit the well being of the human body. "My initial introduction to the science of natural medicine," says Dr. Nappi, "was out in the fields, with my grandparents. They taught me how to plant, harvest, extract and prepare herbs for special medicinal purposes."
<P>
With this amazing background, Rev. Dr. Nappi began his college education at South Hampton University. Furthering his studies and formal education in Naturopathic and Homeopathic medicine he attended The Clayton School of Natural Healing, achieving academic excellence and a doctorate in Naturopathy. He then went on to the prestigious British Institute of Homeopathy in London, England where he received more academic praise and his Degree in Homeopathy (DIHom.). While completing his studies at The British Institute, he put his education to work and opened a Homeopathic pharmacy on 10 Downing street, where he began offering his hand crafted remedies. His expertise and compassion, made the pharmacy a popular destination for those seeking the latest in natural healthcare. 
<P>
Rev. Dr. Nappi then continued his educational pursuits by traveling east to China and broadened his scope by studying the ancient methods of Chinese medicine from old masters in Shanghai and Beijing. To this day he stills travels back to source out new discoveries as well as uncovering lost formulations.
<P>
Afterwards, he returned to the states as a fully rounded and accomplished Doctor of Naturopathy, Homeopath, Master Herbalist and established his practice in New York City, not far from the coastal shores where he cultivated his love of natural medicine. His mastery of these disciplines and no-nonsense approach to teaching natural, preventive medicine, not only allowed him to ensure optimal results for each individual in the shortest time possible, with superior homeopathic treatment, but he was also made a fellow of The British Institute of Homeopathy (FBIH). His dedication to his profession earned him a listing in the renowned International Register as well. 
<P>
Yet it was not only his superior knowledge, but his genuine interest in and the time he takes with each individual, which not only caused his practice to become one of the busiest in New York City, but also enabled him to share his expertise with the public through a 16 million area coverage on his popular weekly radio show, "The Nappi Report." 
<P>
Rev. Dr. Nappi is renowned for the time he takes with each patient, which is something he finds vital in the success of the individual's treatment. "Unlike the hurried mannerism of many doctors, I don't believe you can properly diagnose someone in a twenty minute visit," notes Rev. Dr. Nappi. "Everyone is different, so in order for me to treat a person accurately, I need  them to tell me about themselves and I mean everything ... from what they eat to their sleep habits. For example, giving someone a formula for a hemorrhoid will alleviate the symptom, but won't cure the actual cause. It is only when you trace the symptom back to the cause of the problem and address it, that you eliminate the affliction entirely." Dr. Nappi has worked with numerous medical problems, ranging from simple yeast infections, cancer to AIDS, by using not only Homeopathy but Iridology (the study of the iris) and reading the different pulse beats as well as the coating of the tongue. In conjunction with appropriate natural formulas that he formulates himself, these are just a few of the respected techniques he uses to help his clients live healthier and happier lives. His products can be found in pharmacies, health food stores, clinics, doctors offices and other fine health establishments worldwide . 
<P>
Rev. Dr. Nappi maintains an active practice in Manhattan, NY and has now come to Los Angeles, a city notorious for it's fast pace and health conscious residents and has established his renowned practice in Los Angeles, California. He is thrilled with the opportunity to offer everyone the benefit of natural medicine, as well as demonstrating the uses and benefits in conjunction with western medicine. His clientele list ranges from Corporate executives to a who's who list of celebrities ranging from June Pointer of the Pointer Sisters to Super Models such as Linda Evangelista and the working family. Due to the sensitive nature of his relationships with his clients, he will never entertain personal questions about any of them, so please don't ask, he is famous for his tight lip in this department.
<P>
It isn't often that a person's passion can benefit the well being of others, but Rev. Dr. Rick Nappi is the rare individual whose love of natural medicine and failth in God contributes to the well being of women and men of all ages. "I have dedicated my life to the science of natural health and the natural teachings of God, " Rev. Dr. Nappi says fondly. "It is my dream to look back on my life and know that I have made a contribution in uplifting the level of health for all through a rewarding career revolving around preventive medicine and the promotion of optimal health through natural means as God teaches us."

<H3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MINISTRY</H3>

<H4>THE ORDAINED MINISTER</H4>
Q. How old does one have to do to be an ordained minister?<P>
A. Ministers are of all ages, however, in California, you cannot officiate at a wedding unless you 
are at least 18 years old. The legal age may vary in different states so check with your local 
Marriage Bureau for you State's requirements.<P> 
Q. Are there any restrictions on membership in the ULC because of race, color, creed, or sex?<P>
A. None.<P>
Q. May I, as an ordained Minister perform work of a psychosocial nature without a license?<P>
A. Yes, but this varies from state to state. For instance, in California, you are exempt from 
licensing requirements by the California Business and Professions Code section 9052; you are 
also exempt from license requirements for performing marriage, family, or any religious 
counseling by the Business and Professions code section 17188; to perform psychological and 
psychometric services or counseling by section 2908 of the same code. (See page 43)<P>
Q. What authority do we have for the "Laying -on-of-Hands" during services and healing?<P>
A. The "Laying-on-of-Hands" has been an integral part of the church from the beginning. Read 
Hebrews 6:2 and Acts 8:17 & 18. "Then they laid their hands on them , and they received the 
Holy Ghost."<P>
Q. As a Minister what tax exempt privileges am I allowed?<P>
A. In most cases none. As a private citizen, all your earnings are subject to taxation. Some 
States do allow an exemption on private property for the clergy; check with you local Assessor.<P>
Q. What services do I have to perform as an ordained minister?<P>
A. There are no specific duties required, other than those needed by the congregation. You are 
authorized to perform all ministerial services such as: baptisms, marriages, funerals; and to 
conduct church worship and meetings.<P>
Q. Can I have a full-time job outside of my ministerial duties?<P>
A. Of course. And you may earn any amount wages that you desire; there is no limit as to time 
or types of employment a minister may have.<P>
Q. I am a prisoner; can they discriminate against me legally for being a ULC minister?<P>
A. You may be interested to know that Congress passed Tile III of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, Section 1402 (g) refers to members of Certain Religious Faiths: (1) exemption (2) time 
for filing application (3) period for which exemption is effective.<P>
Q: Can I use a tape recorder in my dealings with the IRS?<P>
A: Yes; there is no law that forbids its use. In a hearing before judge W.E. Craig, the taxpayer 
was given the right to use a tape recorder during his audit.<P>
Q: My accountant tells me that I am only allowed to get 30% deductions on my income tax. 
Where can I find where it says I can take the 5O%?<P>
A: A notarized statement of such must be sent by certified mail to the IRS. This is covered in 
"Your Federal Income Tax" for individuals in use in preparing 1979 returns. Ask the IRS for 
Publication 17, (Rev. Nov. 79) and look on page 90, center column.<P>
<H3>VOW OF POVERTY</H3>
Q: What is a vow of poverty?<P>
A: A vow of poverty states that one relinquishes all personal property to his church, including 
the clothes on his back. He owns absolutely nothing. We do not encourage anyone to take a 
vow of poverty.<P>
Q: Is a Minister who has taken the Vow of Poverty and who performs duties required by the 
religious order exempted from income tax withholding?<P>
A: Yes, provided that the income is directly related to the exempt functions of the organization, 
the remuneration you receive may be excludable from income taxes, according to the Internal 
Revenue Service.<P>
<H3>THE POST OFFICE</H3>
Q: May a congregation have a postal Bulk Rate mailing permit?<P>
A: Yes, a congregation as a nonprofit organization is entitled to mail at a bulk rate. This is a bulk 
rate which is available to all nonprofit organizations. Ask your local Postmaster about these 
rates and the permit required.<P>
Q: Can the congregation send fund-raising materials through the mail?<P>
A: Yes, providing it does not break Postal Laws (i.e.) Chain letters which request money,

<H3>ORGANIZING A ULC CONGREGATION</H3>
Q: Can I use my apartment as my church?<P>
A: Your apartment may be headquarters for your congregation; your congregation can hold 
meetings in the apartment or wherever the Board of Directors may decide.<P>
Q: What is the minimum number of people required to organize a congregation?<P>
A: A minimum of three people -- a Pastor (or President), Secretary and Treasurer.<P>
Q: Is it necessary to keep minutes of Board Meetings?<P>
A: Yes. Everything done by a church must be done by resolution voted on and passed by the 
Board of Directors. You need record only those things which passed.<P>
Q: If a congregation no longer functions, and no one wants it, who gets the property?<P>
A: It reverts to International Headquarters.<P>
Q: When issuing receipts does my congregation use the tax number or our charter number?<P>
A: The correct number to use is the tax number. <P>
Q: How do I use the corporate number on my charter agreement?<P>
A: The corporate number indicates that the Universal Life Church is registered in that state and 
is a valid non-profit organization. This number is used when dealing with any queries with the 
State and Local governments.<P>
Q: What courses do you offer to help me open and operate a congregation?<P>
A: All of the courses offered by us will help the new minister in starting a congregation. <P>
Q: Is a chartered congregation an extension, or branch, of the "Mother Church?<P>
A: No. Even though the IRS will try to tell you that you are an extension, this is not true as you 
are Universal Life. You are, also, not an associated church. They will try to get you to say that 
you are a branch church -- you are not a branch, you are Universal Life.<P>
Q: Can three of one family organize a congregation?<P>
A: Any three individuals 18 years or older may band together to organize a congregation.<P>
Q: Can the Pastor be on the Board of another congregation?<P>
A: There are no rules or regulations on the number of boards an individual may serve.<P>
Q: How often does the Board of Directors meet?<P>
A: Usually once a month. Under certain circumstances, your Board may vote to meet every 
other month.<P>
Q: How many members of the Board must be present to have a legal meeting?<P>
A: At least two.<P>
Q: Can I donate to the congregation if I'm the minister and a member of the Board of Directors?<P>
A: Yes. The law says you may donate up to 50% of your taxable income to the church of your 
choice'. It is no more than a coincidence if you are the pastor and member of the Board of 
Directors of the congregation to which you make a donation.<P>
Q: Does the International Headquarters control the money and property I donate to my 
chartered congregation?<P>
A: No. All money and property will be in your congregation's name, i.e. Universal Life Church. 
Your congregation will have no financial 
obligations to the International Headquarters. If you give additional financial support, you will do 
so of your own free will and because you will receive additional educational courses and 
degrees in turn for your donations.<P>
Q: What happens to my congregation' s assets when I die? Does all the money then go to the 
International Headquarters?<P>
A: Your congregation is operated by a Board of Directors. Upon your death as minister, the 
remaining Board members simply appoint a new minister and the congregation goes on 
indefinitely. If all the members of your congregation should die, including the entire Board of 
Directors, and all congregation assets were completely abandoned, then the assets would revert 
to the International Headquarters as opposed to reverting to the state.<P>
Q: Does our congregation need an employer ID number?<P>
A: Only if you are paying wages and withholding income taxes.<P>
Q: Can the congregation pay for my health insurance if I am a member of the Board of 
Directors?<P>
A: Yes--if the Board of Directors votes that all of the members should be covered with such 
insurance. You may vote to have the congregation reimburse the members for all medical, 
hospital, dental and other health care, including medications, provided such coverage is for all 
members and intended to insure the uninterrupted work by taking care of the health of the 
Board members.<P>
Q: Can the congregation pay for my life insurance if I am a minister in the congregation?<P>
A: No -- unless the congregation is made the beneficiary in the policy and the coverage is voted 
by the Board of Directors.<P>
Q: Can the congregation pay utilities of a home used as headquarters?<P>
A: Yes, the Board of Directors of your congregation may vote to pay all reasonable utilities.<P>
Q: May I donate real or personal property to the congregation if I am the minister and member 
of the Board of Directors?<P>
A: Yes. Real or personal property may be donated at "market value" without regard to your 
cost. However, if you have been taking depreciation on property, the depreciation you have 
taken must be subtracted from the "market value" of the property to establish the base for your 
tax-deduction from your gift to the church. We suggest that you do not donate property to your 
congregation unless it is a willing gift of which you relinquish all claim.<P>
Q: Could the board of trustees vote to give me as Pastor an allowance (no salary) of $750.00 
per month for housing and transportation, and other expenses without my having to report or 
account how it is spent?<P>
A: Records must be kept of all congregation expenditures.<P>
Q: Can a congregation start a nursery? If so does it need a state license?<P>
A: Yes, a congregation may start a nursery. If the congregation intends to make its services 
open to the general public then yes, a license to operate a nursery must be obtained from the 
state.<P>
Q: Does the congregation have to file a tax return for the State or Federal government?<P>
A: No. The chartered congregation reports to ULC International Headquarters indicating the 
number of meetings held, number of persons attending, monies in the bank at the beginning and 
end of the reporting period. If the government requests to see your records refer 
them to International Headquarters. No one may see church records without a court order.<P>
Q: Can the congregation provide me with an automobile if I'm the minister?<P>
A: Yes, if the automobile is to be used on church business. The congregation can lease a car for 
the Minister's use (including the car you already own) and vote to pay all expenses relating to 
the operation of that car, including gas, oil, repairs, license fees, insurance, etc. Or, the Board of 
Directors may vote to have the congregation buy a car and maintain it for the use of its pastor. 
The Board of Directors may wish to provide other services for its pastor, such as a house, 
insurance, medical services, etc., in a similar manner.<P>
Q: Can the Board vote to pay for the education of its members?<P>
A: Yes, the Board can vote to legally sponsor the education of its members.<P>
Q: Can real property be declared a church where there is no building, and be exempt from tax 
as such?<P>
A: Your congregation can hold meetings wherever the Board of Directors may decide.
However, any property used exclusively for church services, and only that part, may be eligible 
for tax exemption. Check with your local tax authority.<P>
Q: Is it OK if I am the only person making donations to my congregation?<P>
A: Yes, but it is advisable to have more than one if possible. Remember that you are one among 
many that are donating to the Universal Life Church, Inc. throughout the world.<P>
Q: Can I borrow money from my congregation?<P>
A: Yes, providing that you repay the loan with a reasonable interest.<P>
Q: How often does a chartered congregation have to meet?<P>
A: Generally, churches meet on a weekly basis, however, there is no rule in the law so it may be 
assumed that the meetings are so spaced as to be reasonable for the religious purpose of the 
congregation.<P>
Q: May the congregations of Universal Life establish their own retirement program?<P>
A: Yes, it is suggested that the Board of Directors of each congregation invest in a good solid 
retirement program.<P>
Q: Are churches exempt from the payment of sales taxes on items used for religious services?<P>
A: Yes. Most states exempt churches from having to low rates, listed in the advertising section 
of the make such oppressive taxes. California, is one state which does not make such 
exemption.<P>
Q: Can the congregation pay directly for any of the Pastor's clothing?<P>
A: Yes, for any garb being used by the Pastor while doing his Sacerdotal duties.<P>
Q: How could I find out about property tax exemption for my congregation?<P>
A: Contact the local county tax assessor for all such information. It varies from county to county 
because it is a local government function., as it should be. <P>
Q: Can we move our congregation to another State?<P>
A: Yes; just notify us of the address change and the change of officers, if any. Send in your old 
Charter and we will send you the new one with your new State number.<P>
Q: Do we need a congregation statement of beliefs? <P>
A: No; but you may have one if the members of your congregation so wish.<P>
Q: If we need copies of the Certificate of Authority for the church to operate in our State, who 
do we contact?<P>
A: Write to the Secretary of State's office and request specific information. There is a basic fee 
charged for duplication.<P>
Q: What name should I call my congregation? <P>
A: You are a congregation of the Universal Life Church, Inc. and this is the only legal name 
recognized by the Federal and State Governments.<P> 

Q: What must I do to prove that I have given to the church?<P>
A: It is important to keep records; receipts, canceled checks and other evidence that you have 
donated congregation's to the Universal Life Church, Inc., as evidence to substantiate your 
claims.<P>
Q: How old must one be to be on the Board of Directors? <P>
A: All members of the board must be of legal age, 18 years, or older.<P> 
Q: What other than money and property, can be donated to the congregation?<P>
A: Almost anything; such as jewelry, paintings, antiques and other objects of art. Household 
goods, used clothing, collections, books.<P>
Q: Is it necessary for our congregation to keep records of who made donations to it?<P>
A: As a properly chartered congregation it is your duty to substantiate the donations made by 
yourself and members of your congregation.<P>
Q: What is the liability of the members of our congregation?<P>
A: No member of the congregation shall be personally liable to its creditors for any 
indebtedness of liability, and any and all creditors of this church shall look only to the assets of 
the church for payment.<P>

Q: I am in the military; can the Board of Directors grant me a housing allowance in addition to 
that given to me by the military?<P>
A: Yes--but, since the government already provides you with housing (and, since the Board 
cannot pay for your housing directly and must make its bestowal in cash or its equivalent), such 
is considered by the IRS to be taxable income.<P>
Q: How should checks be made out to the congregation?<P>
A: All checks should be made out to the Universal Life Church and deposited to the 
congregation's account. Pseudo-names are no longer acceptable for donation purposes.<P>
Q: Must l file and incorporate my new congregation?<P>
A: The Universal Life Church, Inc. is already incorporated (or in the process of filing) in your 
State and no further filing of any kind is necessary.<P>
Q: If the congregation pays for some clothing directly, is it still considered income to the Pastor?<P>
A: No, it is garb used in the performance of his duties.<P>
Q: Since the Pastor may wear street clothes, what is considered appropriate for payment by the 
congregation?<P>
A: Not all Pastors wear clerical garb in the performance of their duties, so street garb is 
certainly appropriate.<P>
Q: If the congregation gives him a travel allowance, or pays directly for part of the Pastor's auto 
expenses can he still take this as a personal deduction on his 1040?<P>
A: No- the congregation has paid this as a service direct and it can not be deducted on his 
personal return.<P>
Q: Can you list briefly the various ways one can lose a congregation?<P>
A: The willful breaking of any local, state, or federal law.<P>
Q: Are prisoners allowed to have congregations?<P>
A: Yes; we have many congregations in institutions throughout the country.<P>
Q: Can my three cell-mates hold a congregational meeting behind cell bars?<P>
A: Yes; there is no reason why you cannot, but it is best to check with the Warden about the 
rules of the institution before proceeding.<P>
Q: If I die, can my congregation be passed on to my beneficiaries?<P>
A: No; the two remaining members of the Board select an individual to replace the one who is 
gone.<P>
Q: Do the Board Members have to be local, or can they be from another state?<P>
A: When at all possible, it is a good policy to have at least two of the members local. This is a 
majority (quorum) to transact business for the congregation.<P>
Q: Besides the Congregation number are there any other numbers we need to be concerned 
about?<P>
A: Yes. The IRS Identification number on your Certificate shows that all donations to this 
congregation are deductible. The State Number indicates that we have filed in your State.<P>
<H3>INVESTMENTS AND INCOMES</H3>
Q: What types of investments and incomes may churches have?<P>
A: It has been the policy of the Federal Government to actually promote organized religion by 
granting it almost total tax immunity. All income that accrues to a non-profit church corporation 
is tax exempt (with the exception of unrelated business income). There are about six different 
kinds of church income, five of which are totally tax exempt.<P>
1) Donation Income - All money and property donated or willed to a church or otherwise 
received from its church members is tax exempt. A church may perform any type of services or 
engage in any business activity for the benefit of its members without paying taxes on the 
income.<P>
2) Fund Raising Activity Income - Whenever a church sponsors a fund raising activity and 
charges admission, the income is tax exempt. All income that is generated by various church 
members by donating their services in return for contributions to their church is tax exempt.<P>
3) Passive Church Investment Income - All income earned by a church via its own investments 
in stock, bonds, rental properties, bank accounts, etc.
is tax exempt. A passive investment is any investment that does not require day to day 
management and supervision by the directors of the church.<p>
4) Capital Gains Income - Any income or profit realized by a church from the sale of church 
owned assets is tax exempt.<P>
5) Related Business Income - Any income that accrues to a church from a business venture that 
can be justified on the basis that the business
is related to the mission of the church is tax exempt. Several examples of related business 
income can be found throughout the Catholic Church with regard to the radio and television 
stations that the church owns and operates. Churches are also engaged in publishing as well as 
the life insurance business. The Lutheran Church maintains a $3 billion insurance fund exclusively 
for church members.<P>
6) Unrelated Business Income -- Churches can own and operate any kind of business. If the 
IRS can prove in court that the income from a particular business venture is not related to the 
overall mission of the church, then it can force the church to pay taxes on the income. The most 
famous and recent example of this is when the IRS finally forced the Christian Brothers Winery 
to pay income taxes on the revenue they received from the production and sale of liquor related 
products.<P>
Q: What is "self-dealing?<P>
A: "Self-dealing" includes borrowing or loaning money, buying or selling property, and any other 
activity in which a profit may be made for the Trustees or members of the Board of Directors - 
except that anyone may receive compensation reasonably related to services actually 
performed.<P>
Q: Can a pastor deposit his salary into the congregation account and take it out as cash?
A: No. This is "self-dealing."<P>
Q: My friend and I both have a congregation. If I make contributions to his congregation and he 
contributes to mine, would that be considered "self-dealing?"<P>
A: No.<P>
Q: My congregation operates a service station. Do I have to pay taxes on the income?<P>
A: Yes. This is "unrelated income"- it has nothing to do with religious purposes of a church even 
though the congregation operates the station. All unrelated income is taxable.<P>
Q: Can the congregation buy real estate and other property in its own name?<P>
A: Yes, any person, natural or artificial, may own real estate. An individual is a natural person, 
as opposed to an organization which conducts business, such as a church. A church, a Common 
Law organization, or a corporation, are examples of artificial, or juristic, persons.<P>
Q: Can the congregation own and operate a non-related business?<P>
A: Yes, the church may own a non-related business; see IRS Publication 598, "Tax on 
Unrelated Business Income of Exempt Organizations."<P>
Q: Can the congregation pay utilities of a home used as headquarters?<P>
A: Yes, the Board of Directors of your congregation may vote to pay all reasonable utilities.<P>
Q: How does a congregation get credit cards?<P>
A: The congregation applies for credit just like everyone else. Sometimes a different form is 
used. If your congregation has established accounts (stationary stores are easy to get) they will 
accept them as references. A congregation also uses bank relationships it presently has. Apply 
to them all. Often when a congregation makes 20 applications and one or two come through, 
the rest are easier to obtain. Go for a carte blanch (company paid) card, small department store 
cards and oil company cards. Credit card companies give a good credit rating to those who pay 
their bills immediately. So pay them when they come and don't pay any interest.<P>
Q: Can the congregation own stocks and bonds?<P>
A: Yes, the congregation may own securities as passive investments. There are many stock 
brokerage firms, some are called discount brokerage firms because they don't give advice or 
research. Discount firms charge 30% to 80% less in commissions.<P>

<H3>YOU ASKED FOR IT, AND NOW IT'S HERE! THE EYE ON MEDICINE TRAVEL CLUB SAVES YOU BIG BUCKS ON YOUR TRAVEL!</H3> 
</CENTER><P>
<B>Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation and one of the largest corporate wholesale travel companies in the USA have negotiated a contract that makes the general consumer the big winner with their travel plans.</B><P>
<B>HOW DID EYE ON MEDICINE GET INVOLVED IN TRAVEL?</B> First, Rev. Dr. Nappi is always traveling with an entourage of support staff. When they need to be at a conference or speaking engagement or traveling for research, they need reliable transportation and when they arrive at their destination, a comfortable hotel is a must. Second, Rev. Dr. Nappi gives over 2000 vacations away as gifts and incentives per year, through the Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation site, radio appearances, television appearances, congregation and valued patients and product purchasers. Since 1990 we have been using these packages and everyone seems to love them, not to mention the money they save. Now, Rev. Dr. Nappi would like to extend the same to you through this special exclusive offer. <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>HOW DO THEY DO IT?</B> As with everything we buy in the real world, you can pay retail or wholesale. In most cases in order to get wholesale prices you would have to purchase multiple units of one item. Large wholesale travel companies do just that. They buy large numbers of seats on all major airlines and large amounts of rooms at top hotels worldwide. By doing this they guarantee to purchase a certain quantity over a year period and for this airlines and hotels give them dirt cheap rates. It is really simple when you think about it. When is the last time you took a plane trip or stayed at a hotel? Was every room or seat on the plane full? Probably not! This is why large corporate travel companies get such a good rate. The airlines and hotels are open and paying for the overhead whether or not they are booked. So they look at the empty seat or room as a promotional piece. They think if a person likes it, they will use them again or refer a friend. The second reason for buying large blocks of seats and rooms is that these are corporate travel companies. They cater to the executive that has to get where they are going and there better be a good room waiting when they arrive. So this is how it is done. The Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation qualifies under the nonprofit entitlement to recieve these special diacounts and as a member of our congregation, you also are entitled. So why pay more when you can get more, for less.  <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>ONLY MAJOR AIRLINES AND HOTELS?</B> That's right, only major airlines and hotels. No planes with rubberbands or budget airlines. American, TWA, delta, United and all other major domestic and international airlines. No flea bag hotels! Only quality hotels at every destination and if it is a water location, you can bet you will be right on the water front. Remember, this is usually used by excecutives, and they only want the best. <B> Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>WHAT ABOUT RESTRICTIONS?</B> There are no blackouts or restrictions! In fact, you even have up to 1 year to make your travel plans once you purchase. When is the last time you got that kind of deal. On top of that, to make things even easier for some people, you and a friend can even leave from different airports and meet up at your destination. Flights leave from all major airports. <B> Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>IS IT BASED ON DOUBLE OCCUPANCY?</B> Yes! All packages are based on double occupancy. Two airfares and two people in a room. For large families special arrangements can be made for condos with multiple bedrooms for the entire family.  <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE?</B> The bottom line is simple. As stated earlier, this is a collaboration between Eye On Medicine, Corporate Travel, Major airlines and Hotels. These packages are for two persons and a stay at the participating hotels. For booking your vacation you only need to notify the travel company 60 days in advance and your off.  <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>HOW UNBELIEVABLE ARE THE PRICES?</B> I hope you are sitting down! When you join the Eye On Medicine Travel Club, your <B>AIRFARE is FREE! </B> All you have to do is pay for your hotel and that will be greatly reduced from the standard retail rate. If you travel you have to pay for a room anyway, but what you save on airfare gives you more to spend on your vacation. A good example would be two round trip airfares from New York to Hawaii; This would cost at least $1,600.00, so as you can see you start saving even before you begin! If there is any catch, it would be that you have to book your hotel through the corporate travel company to qualify, that's it! And why not, if they can save you airfare dollars, why not let them book you a quality room and save even more. <B> Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>HOW DO YOU GET THIS VALUE?  </B>  That's easy, all you have to do is fill out our online order form. We only ask for a $44.95 free will offering to the congregation, per each package (2 persons). Then your travel package is sent to you via snail mail and all you have to do is follow the directions and fill in your specifications and your on your way. So for one package for two free round trip airfares, you will give a free will offering to the church of $44.95. Just go online and order. We accept all major credit cards on line, or you can fax your order with credit card information or send a check or money order.  <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>
<B>I HAVE A COMPANY AND WOULD LIKE TO USE THESE FOR CUSTOMER PROMOTIONS?</B> We are asked this question all the time. Yes you can attain these in quantity to give away as a promotional gift. You cannot sell them, this would be against the law! You must be a licensed and bonded travel company. But you can purchase them from us to give away to your valued clients. We sell these to car dealers, software companies, retail chains, beauty salons, restaurants, healthclubs, botiques, etc. Just about every business can afford to use them. In order to qualify for wholesale, you must order a minimum of 50 packages at a wholesale offering to the church of only $12.95 per package. That's $647.50 for 50 packages, that's a $1,599.55 savings. There is a wholesale section on the order form.  <B>Go to travel package index and <a href="https://eyeonmedicine.com/apex/apex1.htm"> order form</B></A><P>

<FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>INTRODUCTION</FONT></b>

   Selling information is one of the most established and most powerful
businesses in our information based society.  With the continuing growth 
of the computer revolution, selling information in electronic form offers 
you outstanding profit opportunities. You can provide people with valuable 
information and Earn Yourself 1000's of Dollars in the process.

   The objective of this material is to provide you with a collection of 
carefully selected money making information tips that can help you start 
and succeed in your business, whatever it may be.

   Most important of all, this material will take you one step ahead of the 
conventional info-by-mail business. This material will show you how to sell 
information in <B>"ELECTRONIC FORM"</B> - using computer floppy disks - which are 
the most efficient and most profitable means by which information is now 
being packaged, sold, and delivered. For example, you can order a 
<B>DUPLICATOR DISK</B> from us and you can make copies of this Disk and
 sell the copies for as much as you want.

   Information in electronic form has quickly become one of the hottest 
selling products of the nineties and will be that way well into the 21st 
century. Recent figures indicate that over a billion dollars worth of books 
are sold by mail every year. The easiest way to profit from this expanding 
market is to provide customers with valuable information they can put to
immediate use. Many publishers are pulling in a fortune by selling useful 
publications right out of their own homes.

   People get involved in this business for many different reasons. There 
are few businesses left that have all the above benefits. Selling 
information, either in printed form or in electronic form, allows you to 
start on a shoestring and quickly reinvest your earnings. Some information 
marketers have been known to start with less than $100 and have quickly 
gone on to build million dollar businesses.

   If you buy information from wholesalers and resell it, you can make a 
profit from the same information material over and over.  If you write and 
print your own informative publication, profit margins will even be better. 
While a publication may only cost a couple of dollars to professionally 
produce, it can contain thousands of dollars worth of information.  It is 
usually NOT the size or length of a publication customers are interested 
in, it is the valuable information contained inside that they will gladly 
pay for.

   Likewise, the manner by which you package and deliver the information to 
your customers will determine your profit margins and how big you can build 
your business.

   You can start your business all by yourself. Not having to hire any 
employees will save you time, effort, money, and bureaucratic government 
regulation. As you will soon see, no special education or skills are 
required.  In fact, by using this software, you will probably know more 
about the industry than most of the people out there.<HR>


<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS</FONT></b>

   One of the best features of owning your own information-by-mail business
is that it is fun and easy to start and operate. You probably already own 
much of what you will need to begin operations. Whether you live in an 
apartment or house, you will need to set aside some space that you can 
designate as your office. While there is no reason why you can't start from 
your kitchen table, you should try to dedicate some space where you can set 
up a desk and chair that you can operate your business from.

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>1. Business Name And Organization</FONT></b>

   Choosing a name for your new business should be your first step.  This 
is an important step because a well-chosen name can help you generate more
sales for your business. It is important to choose a business name that 
accurately represents your business and gives an impression of trust and 
confidence.

   For example, would you feel comfortable ordering a financial guide from
a business called "Wallace Book Company" or "Wallace Financials"?

   Simply pick a name that you would feel comfortable ordering a 
publication from. If the business name is anything other than your own 
name, you will need to file for a Fictitious Business Name (also known as 
DBA)registration.

   Choosing a form of legal entity or structure for your business should be 
your next step.  You can organize your business three ways:

   <B><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>PROPRIETORSHIP....</FONT></B> A proprietorship is the least expensive to form and 
usually requires nothing more than a "D.B.A." (doing business as) name and 
possibly a local business license.

 This type of ownership allows you to have the maximum control over the 
operations of the business, but also creates maximum liability.  You will 
be personally liable for all debts incurred by your business.  Since 
Proprietorship is the least expensive and easiest to form, it is
recommended for anyone going into the information marketing business for 
the first time. You will make all final decisions and be responsible for 
all aspects of your business. This is a popular choice for a one-person 
operation.

   <B><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>PARTNERSHIPS....</FONT></B> If you need a business partner, either for financial or 
expertise reasons, the best way to outline your business relationship, from 
a legal standpoint, is to form your business as a Partnership.

   <B><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>CORPORATION.....</FONT></B> A corporation is the most formal form of business that 
one may consider. You can have a corporation whether you are the sole owner 
of the business or you have partners.

   This form of ownership is more expensive, but offers the least liability. 
You must consider this form of business after your business has 
successfully begun and reached consistent profitability. It is also 
advisable to consider forming a corporation before applying for expansion 
capital through a bank or other lending institution.  The services of an 
attorney are recommended when forming a corporation.  The attorney can 
assist you in filling out the proper forms and submitting them to the 
correct government agencies.
<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>2. Mailing Address And Phone Number</FONT></b>

   Your mailing address can be either a P.O. Box or a street address. It is 
recommended that you use a street address for your business.  Studies have 
shown that customers are more likely to order from an information-by-mail 
business with a street address than from one with a P.O. Box. Customers 
feel more confident about sending their hard earned money to someone they 
feel is at a relatively permanent address. This is probably because of the 
few "fly by night" con artists that have historically used P.O. Boxes as 
their storefronts. If you must use a P.O. Box it is recommended that you at
least list a phone number in your advertisements. If you work out of an
apartment, using the word "suite" before your apartment number will make it 
sound more professional.

   If you prefer not to use your own street address, there are companies 
that will rent you the use of their street address for mailing purposes. 
Some companies can provide more than just mailbox rentals. These extra 
services may include, sending and receiving faxes, voice mail, pagers, 
copying, notary, packaging services and supplies and authorized shipping 
outlets for some national shippers. Check your local yellow pages under 
"Mail Receiving & Forwarding Services."

   You should also consider getting a separate phone number for your new 
business. It will help you keep in touch with the people who can make your 
new business grow.

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>3. Bank Account & Merchant Account</FONT></b>

   After you have chosen a name for your business, properly formed and 
registered your business, and decided on a business address and phone 
number, you will need to open a business checking account at your local 
bank. You will need to bring in a copy of your fictitious business name 
application that you received from the county clerk.

   Shop around to see which local bank offers the most services with the 
least service fees. An important service feature that you should inquire 
about from all the banks is how soon you can set up a credit card merchant 
account and what the requirements will be. As your business grows, you will 
want to be able to offer your customers flexible payment terms, including 
accepting credit card orders. Most banks do not like to offer this service 
to businesses that obtain the majority of their sales by mail or phone.

   If you can't get a credit card merchant account, don't worry about it. 
Once your business is more established and profitable, the banks are more 
likely to work with you. Most banks should allow you to set up this kind of 
service a year or two after opening the account -- the sooner the better.


<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>WHAT INFORMATION DO I SELL?</FONT></b>

   Veteran information marketers know that information on just about every 
conceivable subject can be successfully marketed, specially if sold in 
electronic form. Look at most direct-response magazines and you will 
probably find companies offering valuable information on numerous topics.

   The most profitable by far is How-To information, particularly those 
on How-To Make Money! These types of information products provide 
information based on people's natural wants, desires and needs.

   One type of information product is specialized knowledge of a particular 
subject. This knowledge may be obtained through personal experience or 
detailed research of a certain subject. The most practical strategy is to 
write about something that you have personal experience with. It may be
a hobby, job, sport, vacation, recipe, or whatever you are knowledgeable 
about.

   If you want to provide information about a particular field you have 
little or no personal experience in, you will need to do some research. 
When doing research, look for information in magazine and newspaper 
articles and books on your chosen subject. Read as much information 
as you can until it begins to sound repetitive. This is a good indication 
that you have read all that there is to know about that subject. Take 
excellent notes and organize them accordingly.

   The second type of information that can be successfully sold through the 
mail are self-improvement products. These products help by providing timely 
and valuable information on a variety of subjects.

   Marketers have found the subject of financial wealth and physical health 
to be the most sought after topics in the mail order industry. Everyone has 
an interest in excellent health and wants to learn how to increase his/her 
financial status.

   Practically any national publication with classified advertisements will 
have offers selling information on these subjects. This type of information 
is best provided by those who have professional experience in the 
respective fields. However, if you do enough research, you will be able to 
write your own informative publication.

   Many of the most successful financial topics sold by mail relate to 
starting one's own business. Global competition has caused many major 
companies to downsize their work force. This has resulted in many 
unemployed individuals in search of new ways to earn a living. By providing 
information on how to start one's own business, you can help these people 
get their lives back in gear and make a profit in the process.

   One particularly popular health related topic is how to lose weight and 
stay physically and mentally fit. With health costs going through the roof 
with no end in sight, many health minded individuals are in search of ways 
to become healthier. By becoming healthier, expensive visits to your 
doctors can be avoided. By providing accurate and timely information on how 
the health minded individual can improve their lives, you can earn a 
healthy profit.


<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>PROMOTING YOUR PUBLICATION</FONT></b>

   Once you have obtained a software product that you can sell, you are 
ready to tell the world about it. No matter how valuable your information 
is, you will not make a penny from it unless you tell the people who want 
your information how they can get it. This is the most critical and most 
often misunderstood step in running your information marketing business.
 Information sellers have tried to reach their target markets with many 
different techniques. No matter what technique is used, information sellers 
all try to cost effectively reach those people most likely to buy their 
publications.  Some of the most popular ways are listed below:

<ul><li> Advertising your products on the Internet and World Wide Web.

<li> Selling through magazine or newspaper advertisements.

<li> Getting free publicity from magazines and newspapers.

<li> Selling through book distributors, dealers and resellers.

<li> Selling through radio and television advertisements.

<li> Selling over the phone through telemarketing.

<li> Selling through book stores or libraries.

<li> Selling through direct mail packages.

<li> Selling through computer bulletin board systems (BBS's) and 
 online services.</ul> 

The above techniques have consistently shown cost effective results. Dollar 
for dollar the best methods for selling your publication are by advertising 
in magazines, sending direct mail packages, getting free publicity, and 
using On-Line services.

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>Direct Mail</FONT></b>

   The subject of direct mail cannot be ignored when discussing how to make 
a profit in mail order. A properly designed and implemented direct mail 
campaign can often outperform a classified advertising approach. The main 
advantage of direct mail is that it is less expensive than classified 
advertising to generate qualified leads. Whether you do a two-step, 
combination, or telemarketing approach to generate inquiries for your 
publication, it is important to remember that your only objective is to 
obtain a name and address of a potential customer. The time, cost, and 
effort in placing the advertisements and possibly setting up an 800 number 
are often questioned when the only objective is to get a name and address 
to put on your direct mail package. This is why many publishers rent 
mailing lists of prospective customers to lower their costs and spend less 
time and effort in getting orders.

   In its simplest form, direct mail involves mailing the direct mail 
packages, explained in the two-step advertising approach, to a mailing list 
of names and addresses of prospective customers. Many mailing list brokers 
are willing to rent you names and addresses of prospective customers, 
usually grouped by their field of interest. These lists are usually rented 
for one time use. Most brokers will put a few secret names and addresses in 
their list that actually end up at one of the broker's addresses. By doing 
this they can check to see if you have used the list more than one time.

   Mailing list rates usually run between $40 to $75 per 1000 names. The 
names and addresses usually are on peel and stick labels that you attach to 
your direct mail envelopes. Some mailing list companies may offer their 
names on computer disk for those who have a computer. If your mailing is 
small and you have the time, you may want to hand address your envelopes. 
Hand addressing is more personal and has been proven to increase the chance 
of having your mail opened. Since the main cost in direct mail is the 
postage, many direct mailers obtain a third class bulk rate permit from 
their local post office that will allow them to save significantly on their 
postage costs. This permit currently costs $75. If you get a bulk rate 
permit, make sure to buy the lists that are sorted by consecutive zip code. 
This will help you organize your mailing to comply with the bulk rate 
mailing requirements.

   Mailing lists are usually created in one of three ways. They can be 
compiled, built, or purchased. Compiled lists contain names that have been 
obtained from published sources such as telephone books, directories, and 
newspapers. These lists are good for reaching easy to categorize 
professionals such as attorneys, accountants, and doctors.  Built lists 
contain names that have been obtained from exclusive sources such as a 
company's list of repeat customers. These lists are good for reaching 
buyers of products that are similar to your own line. Purchased lists 
contain names that have been obtained based on their buying habits such as 
mail order buyers. These lists are good for reaching people whose buying 
habits are similar to those of your customers.

   Usually, the more specific the list, the better the response rate will 
be. Let's say you want to sell a directory of golf courses in the United 
States. A mailing list containing names and addresses of golfers over the 
age of 55, who make over $100,000 a year, travel, or are retired, will be 
a better list to send your direct mail piece to than a generic list of 
sports enthusiasts. The more specific the mailing list the more it will 
cost. It is also important to specify that the lists have names and 
addresses less than 90 days old. This will insure fresh prospects who have 
not seen many other book offers. It is even better if you can get a list 
less than 30 days old.

   The day on which your direct mail offer arrives is important. You do not 
want your mailing to arrive during the weekend or at the end of the month. 
People usually plan activities during the weekend and may not have time to 
read your entire direct mail package. At the end of the month, people 
usually have to pay bills and thus may not have enough money for your 
offer. One other time of the year to avoid are the holidays. If possible, 
try to have your mailing arrive Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.

   Let's take a quick look at the advantages and disadvantages of a direct 
mail and classified advertising campaign. Particular attention should be 
paid to the cost, time, and effort required to obtain the inquiries. This 
is because once the inquiries are obtained, the cost to mail your direct
mail packages is the same. The only exception to this is if you have 
obtained a third class bulk rate permit to reduce your postage costs. 
Since mailers are currently required to mail no less than 200 pieces at 
one time or 50 pounds to qualify for bulk rates, those who use mailing 
lists can easily qualify. If you are using classified advertisements to
generate your names and addresses, you will need to receive 200 inquiries 
every few days to successfully utilize a third class bulk rate permit. This
is only possible in a major classified advertising campaign. An example of 
the costs of a direct mail approach and a classified advertising approach 
follows:

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>Using BBS's And Online Services To Promote Your Products.</FONT></b>

   Using a computer bulletin board system (BBS) and online service to 
promote your publication is the newest and most exciting method to get 
sales for your business. The best part about it is that you don't have to 
own a computer or even know anything about computers to take advantage 
of this explosive method. Before the method is explained, you need to first 
understand what BBSs and online services are and how they operate. Let's 
first take a look at BBS's.

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>What Are BBS's?</FONT></b>

   BBS's are computer systems that are accessible through the phone lines
by those who have a computer and modem. There are over 50,000 BBS's in the 
United States. Most BBS's are owned and operated by individuals and small 
companies. While many are free to access, other than the cost of the call, 
others charge small yearly subscription fees in order to have unlimited
access. These subscription fees are usually $10 to $20 a year. Users who 
have a computer and modem connected to a telephone line can connect to 
these BBS's to perform a variety of actions.

   The main reason people connect to a BBS is to download and upload 
computer files between their computer and the BBS. Downloading means 
copying a computer file from the BBS to your computer, while uploading
means copying files from your computer to the BBS. Some information on the
BBS can be read while connected online. Usually BBS's have computer files 
that are related to a certain field of interest. Some of the larger and 
more advanced BBS's allow users to send electronic messages to each other, 
known as "E-mail". Other BBS's allow users to communicate in real time with
others who are connected. This communication is done by typing messages on 
the screen that other users can see and respond to. These additional 
features are what begins to separate BBS's from online services. Check your
local library for a directory of BBS's.

<b><FONT  COLOR=#0000FF>What are Online Services?</FONT></b>

   Most online services contain all the features of traditional BBS's. 
Some online services actually began as small BBS's.  For one reason 
or another they developed into major operations, many with over 
1,000,000 subscribers. Currently there are fewer than 10 major online 
services in the United States. The appendix contains a list of some of 
them.  Some of the most popular ones, include American Online, Prodigy, 
CompuServe, GEnie, and Delphi. Many offer free trial periods to let you 
test their service, so call them for details.

   Besides transferring files, sending e-mail, and "chatting" in real time 
with others, online services offer users access to more information than 
traditional BBS's.  Many major newspapers and magazines have recognized 
the  power  of  online  services  and  thus  have  made  their  articles 
electronically accessible on some of the major online services. Some online 
services offer users the ability to access stock quotes, make travel 
arrangements, purchase products, and read the day's news, sports, and 
weather. Some companies offer technical assistance through online services.  

   Most of the online services offer users forums in which users with 
similar interests can "chat" online and transfer relevant computer files.
These forums, also known as Special Interest Groups (SIGs), are a 
proven way of targeting your market.  Most online services charge about 
$10 a month for a limited amount of connect time.  Online services are one
of the first usable services to evolve from the much talked about 
"Information Superhighway."  Now that you understand what BBS's and 
online services are and how they work, let's see how you can use them to 
help sell your publications.


   First of all, while BBS's can be used to help promote your publication, 
it is recommended that you concentrate your marketing efforts on the 
online services.  The reason is the quality of the customers.  Many of 
the users of free BBS's don't have credit cards, are young, and are only 
interested in free information.  There are three advantages to online 
service subscribers:

<B>1)</B> Since credit cards are usually required for service, most subscribers 
   own a credit card.

<B>2)</B> Most subscribers are professional people with annual incomes above 
   $30,000.

<B>3)</B> By being a subscriber, they've proven their wiliness to pay for access  
   to information.

   There are a couple of different ways to use online services for your 
publishing business. The most popular involves the placement of 
electronic classified advertisements on one or more of the online 
services.  While some may charge, others include this feature in your 
monthly fee.  Let's take a look at one of the ways you can use this 
technology to your advantage.  It is assumed that you own or have 
access to a computer and modem. If you don't own or have access 
to a computer and modem, there are individuals and companies that 
can do everything for you.

    You sign up as a subscriber to the online service, paying about $10
per month. This will allow you to use the online service for about five 
hours of connect time a month.  Although more time is available for an 
extra fee, five hours is more than enough.  First, you take a few minutes 
and simply write a classified advertisement online.  Although the online 
services call them classified advertisements, there is often no rule as to 
how long they can be.  Thus you can type your entire sales letter in as 
your classified advertisement. When you are done writing your advertisement,
you post it under an appropriate category.  The categories are similar to 
those in newspaper's and magazine's classified sections.  Within hours, 
possibly minutes, millions of people can access your advertisement!  
It is that simple!

   The majority of electronic marketers use the two-step approach to 
getting orders for their publications.  Their classified advertisement 
generates inquiries, and then these inquiries are sent additional 
information to generate an order.  Some publishers report getting 
100's of inquiries a day using this approach. Other publishers have 
successfully used the one-step and combination-approaches.

   As mentioned earlier, most online services give users the ability to 
send and receive E-mail to other users of the online service. Thus if you 
want to get inquiries, you can request readers of your classified 
advertisement to send an E-mail to you with their name and mailing address. 
You can then either mail them more information or respond by 
sending an E-mail back to them with more information. You can send and 
receive your E-mail anytime you log on to the online service with your 
computer. You can also list your mailing address and phone number in 
your classified advertisement for customers who prefer not to use e-mail.  
If they want to place an order, they can e-mail you their credit card 
information, if you accept credit cards, or they can mail in their
payment. Once paid, you can mail them your publication.

   Advertising on an online service is advantageous for a number of 
reasons. The most obvious is that you can write and post your 
advertisement in minutes, not weeks or months as with conventional 
magazines. It is also often free or inexpensive to place electronic 
classified advertisements. Finally, it can be instantly accessed by 
millions of buyers, often 24 hours a day.

   Although some online services do not allow advertising, the majority 
are beginning to offer advertising. For those that don't allow advertising, 
you can usually upload files containing informative free reports or 
articles. These files should contain newsworthy topics written like 
publicity releases. When properly written they can help generate names 
and addresses that you can mail advertising information to. Users of the
online service can download these files to their computer and read them
after logging off the online service. If they are interested in more 
information or in other related reports, they can respond by calling or 
writing the author of the report. These files can usually be any length. 
The longer it is, the longer it will take a user to download to their 
computer. A report of 5 pages or less is usually sufficient for most 
free reports.

   These reports can be posted in what the online services call forums.
Forums are areas of the online service where people with special interests
meet to discuss relevant topics. These forums usually also have message
and file areas where more information can be read and downloaded. The file
areas are where you can upload free reports for others to download. These
reports can include your name and address where people can get more 
information. Posting one free report may get you 100's of inquiries. Best 
of all, it will cost you only a few minutes of your time to create and post
the report.

   The real power of an online service is its ability to cut or eliminate
your business expenses. Selling information by mail has three major
expenses: advertising, postage, and printing. Placing classified
advertisements on online services significantly reduces or eliminates
your advertising costs. Online services may also help you almost
eliminate postage and printing costs.

   Your publication, if created on a computer, can usually be attached
to an E-mail that you send to your customer. For example, no matter
how your customers pay for your publication, if they have an E-mail 
address, you can send them an E-mail with your publication attached
as a file. When the customers receive your E-mail, they simply 
download the attached file to their computer and read it after logging
off the online service.

   To show you how powerful this method can be, let's look at one 
example. This example assumes that you can accept credit cards for
your publication orders. In less than 30 minutes, you can post an 
advertisement on the online service, receive an E-mail for more 
information from an interested reader, E-mail them back more 
information (maybe a four page sales letter), receive their credit 
card information back in an E-mail from them, and then send them an 
E-mail with the publication attached as a downloadable file.  Other
than your monthly fee of about $10, you have spent no money on the
advertisement, postage, and printing. You eliminated all these costs!
What other business can offer that!

   Although it is recommended you begin with online services, these same
methods can work for BBS's that offer posting of advertisements or free
reports, E-mail, and the ability to attach files to E-mail. Your 
publication, if created on a computer, can also be uploaded to a BBS 
as a downloadable file. This assumes the BBS owner allows you to
store your file on his/her computer. When BBS users place an order, 
they can simply download your entire publication through the BBS. 
Your only real cost is the original phone call to upload the file to the 
BBS. You are probably wondering what will stop an individual from
downloading your publication without paying for it. There are two
safeguards you can use.

   First, you can encrypt the file with a password. Without the password,
the user cannot open the file and read it.  When the customer pays you,
you give the customer the password. Software companies sell programs
that will encrypt your file so that it requires a password to be read. 
Second, you can upload half of your publication that users can download
for free. If they like it and want the rest, they can order it by mail.
You simply send them a computer diskette that contains the rest of
your publication.

<B>ALSO DON'T MISS THIS SPECIAL REPORT ON <A HREF="/secret/secret.htm"> SEARCH ENGINE POSITIONING!</B></A><P>
<B>These are the simple steps to getting exposure for your site or product today!</B><P>
<OL>
<b><LI>How can we do it? The answer is simple. We are into research not marketing profits. All revenues go directly back into further enhancement of the Eye On Medicine site and (Natural) AIDS research. So profit is not the goal, doing good is! Your dollars are put to good work and benefit many people. That's how  we can do it. </li><P>
<b><LI>What do other companies charge? There is no set standard, that's the problem. They can charge you what ever they think they can get and usually it is to much. On the average these companies charge around $25 or more per 1000 impressions (page views that your ad appears on). They also will take into account the times your ad shows and how many times it rotates with other ads on their automatic banner rotation software. In addition they want you to sign an exclusive or commitment contract.<P>
We are not in the advertising business so we keep it simple. You get 30 days of 24 hour, 7 days per week exposure for one flat fee. No banner rotation, no time charge. At the time of this publication we recieve over 1800 request per day, that's 54,000 per 30 day period and the number is growing weekly. You do the math and you will quickly see that it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out how good of a deal this is! We are not sales people so we just give you the facts and let you decide how and where you want to place your banner advertising. When you are ready we are here to serve you. It's that simple!</L><P>
<b><LI> You get one full month of exposure with a banner ad for only $59, A price no-one can beat. We invite you to shop around first, then come back, but don't take to long these pages will go fast. You can check the<a href="/ads/avail.htm"> Available Ad's</a> page for positions that are taken and a calendar of when certain ad's will be available. <P>
<LI> All pages that we allow banners on are high traffic and your banner will have just as good exposure on any one of the pages and the same exposure at the top or bottom of the page. That's why we select only the pages on our site that have high traffic. This ensures you get exposure no matter where we place you. Remember, we want you to be happy and we want your dollars to continue to do the good work we do so this is a partnership. If you do well, we do well and we will make sure you do well!  Some pages only have a position at the top which will be indicated with an (*).<P>
<LI>You can also request priority positioning if you would like. Make your selection and put it in the form, otherwise just leave that space blank, it's that simple. You can check the <a href="/ads/avail.htm"> Available Ad's</a> page first for positions that are available and a calendar of when certain adds will be available again. Priority positioning is available depending on availability. This rate is $99 per month<P>
<LI>You must supply your banner to us. If you have an existing one you will be asked for the url address where we can retrieve it or you can make an attachment and email it to us at <a href="mailto:drnappi@eyeonmedicine.com"> banners</a>.

<LI><B>CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS:</B> A constitutional analysis and remedy can be the most important selection for every human being. Each and every person has a unique and individual constitution. The constitution refers to the complete make-up of a person. As with each individual persons constitution (picture), every Homeopathic remedy has a complete and unique personality. In keeping with the law of similar, The concept in constitutional remedy application is to find the one remedy that is the same or extremely similar to the personality of the person. We take into consideration for example; the personality traits, bone size, skin and hair color, gender, posture, eye color, complexion, etc... Once this is determined we then find the remedy that fits and apply it to the person at a special potency. This is a useful tool to help balance the person psychospiritually as well as physically. For example this could alleviate depression, shyness, lack of self esteem, tempers, etc.. In short it reconnects one with themselves. This questioning session will take approximately 30 minutes via telephone. After that an analysis will determine your personal constitutional remedy. You will then be given the name of the remedy, what potency, when and how to take it and where to get it.<BR>
<B>FLAT FEE: $95.00</B>
<P>
<LI><B>METABOLIC SURVEY WORK-UP:</B>  The Metabolic survey work-up is an excellent  tool designed to uncover chemical imbalances and or deficiencies that may be causing a physical problem. In addition, it can point to underlying problems that are contributing to known problems. By uncovering these potentially hidden areas and addressing them, relief can be obtained more efficiently. One example can be in the case of hemorrhoids. To address the hemorrhoid directly is only going to effect the existing hemorrhoids. This is clearly only treating the symptom. To analyze and trace the hemorrhoid back to the cause and then direct your efforts toward alleviating the cause will ensure that the hemorrhoids do not return. In most cases we find the cause of a hemmorid to be due to a congested liver. So we do not treat the hemorrhoid itself per say, but rather the liver, thus bringing a more permanent relief. The questioning session will take approximately 20-30 minutes via telephone. Upon completion and analysis you will receive clear indicators with areas that should be addressed and balanced. Included is a protocol designed specifically for your needs.<BR>
<B>FLAT FEE: $100.00</B> (or in office) and $25.00 if you fill out the Metabolic Survey form online.
<P>
<LI><B>HEALTH REPORTS (complete condition protocols):</B> These comprehensive reports detail the aspects of specific conditions and are designed to provide protocols that are known to be effective in treating these diseases and conditions. They are of great value to practitioners as well as the lay person. Included in these reports are the nutritional aspects, Homeopathic, Naturopathic, Chinese, herbal, physical as well as mental approaches etc... used by holistic doctors in treating these conditions. ( To explore the conditions listed in these reports refer to the "Health Reports" section on the Dr. Nappi home page).<BR>

<H1>WHAT IS HOMEOPATHY?</H1>
HOMEOPATHY is a therapeutic method based on the strict application of the law of similars, which uses medicinal substances at small or infinitesimal doses.<P>
Samuel Hahnemann, A German physician 1735-1843 is considered the founder of homeopathy. Also, it is interesting to note that five centuries before the birth of Christ, Hippocrates observed that a parallel action existed between the toxic power of substances and its therapeutic effect.<P>
The <B>LAW OF SIMILARS </B>states that every pharmacologically active substance produces in the healthy and susceptible individual a set of symptoms characteristic of the  substance used. Every ill subject presents a set of symptoms characteristic of a disease. The cure, that is to say elimination of the symptoms of the illness, can be obtained by administration of a small quantity of the substance whose experimental effects are similar to the symptoms.<P>
Thus, homeopathic therapy consists of giving the patient an infinitesimal dose of the substance capable of producing, in healthy individuals, disorders similar to those which one wants to cure<P>
<H2>HOMEOPATHIC MEDICATIONS and How To Use Them. </H2>
Homeopathic remedies are prepared from substances belonging to all three realms of nature: Vegetable, Mineral, and Animal. In the preparation of these remedies, Mother Tinctures are prepared by maceration of the substance in alcohol for a prescribed length of time. The tinctures are then diluted to their prescribed potencies. Most mother tinctures are diluted to the following potencies; 3X-6X, 5C, 7C, 9C, 15C and 30C.<P>
DOSAGE is a natural result of the fundamental principal of homeopathy. Because similarity defines a medicine which acts along the same lines as the reaction of the affected organism, the remedy must be administered in doses which are just sufficient to assist this reaction without making it worse.<P>
CASE OF THE REMEDIES: Because of their dilution's and their specific physical state, homeopathic remedies are very sensitive to all types of pollution. They should therefore, be protected from all types of pollution. Avoid keeping remedies in the family medicine chest where they could be easily exposed to ether, camphor, perfumes, etc. These substances could easily neutralize the active homeopathic substance.<P>
Avoid eating mint flavored sweets or using mint flavored toothpaste just before or after taking the medicine. Avoid exposing the remedies to excessive light and or temperatures. On the other hand, there is no draw back to taking (allopathic) classical medications along with homeopathic medicine. It has also been noted that caffeine may have an affect of destroying the potency of the remedy. In addition, a good rule for successful homeopathic application would be to take the remedies on an empty, in other words, no closer than 45 minutes to a meal, and no sooner than 45 minutes after a meal. Lastly, in my practice I would consider all things ingested as food to play it safe.<P>
Handling of homeopathic medicines should be done in the following ways. (A). Do not handle with hands because contamination may occur. (B). Try to keep medicine tightly closed in their original containers, because airborne contaminates and moisture which can either weaken or destroy the potency of the remedy.<P>
All homeopathic medicines are prepared according to the standards of the current edition of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (H.P.U.S.) which is recognized by the FDA.<P>
Homeopathy has a clear mission statement; The restoration of HEALTH by natural means, with it's best landmark being<B> PRIMUM NON NOCERE-FIRST DO NO HARM!</B>

<h1>BETA CAROTENE AND VITAMIN A HALTED IN LUNG
CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL</h1>
 <p>

Beta Carotene and Vitamin A Halted in Lung Cancer Prevention Trial Investigators conducting
the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), a large study of the combination of beta
carotene and vitamin A as preventive agents for lung cancer in high-risk men and women,
terminated the intervention last week after an average of four years of treatment and told the
18,314 participants to stop taking their vitamins. Interim study results indicate that the
supplements provide no benefit and may be causing harm.  <p>

Investigators in another trial, the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, said today that their study of 22,071
U.S. male physicians ended on schedule, Dec. 31, 1995, after more than 12 years of treatment.
The study showed no significant evidence of benefit or harm from beta carotene on cancer or
cardiovascular disease. <p>

Both studies have been funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of
<strong>Health</strong> (NIH). The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study was also funded by NIH's National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute.<p>

CARET's lead investigator, Gilbert S. Omenn, M.D., Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center and the University of Washington School of Public <strong>Health</strong> in Seattle, explained
that regular independent review of the study data showed that lung cancer incidence was unlikely
to be reduced by the daily intervention of 30 milligrams (mg) of beta carotene and 25,000
international units (IU) of vitamin A by the scheduled end of the study and that there was a
substantial possibility that the supplements might be harming the participants, who are smokers,
former smokers, and men exposed to asbestos on the job. <p>

 <p>

CARET results to date, including 388 people diagnosed with lung cancer and 974 deaths from all
causes, showed 28 percent more lung cancers and 17 percent more deaths in participants taking
beta carotene and vitamin A. While these interim results are not significant evidence of harm from
a statistical standpoint, they are similar to the results of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene
(ATBC) Lung Cancer Prevention Trial published in 1994, which showed 18 percent more lung
cancers and 8 percent more deaths in the portion of the 29,133 male smokers in Finland who took
20 mg of beta carotene daily for five to eight years.<p>

 <p>

Letters asking the 18,314 CARET participants to stop taking their vitamin supplements or
placebos were mailed Jan. 13. Investigators plan to follow the participants for at least five more
years to determine the long-term effects of the intervention, which was interrupted 21 months
early. Omenn said that CARET data also raise the possibility that former smokers, who comprised
34 percent of the participants when recruited, may respond more favorably to vitamin A and beta
carotene than current smokers, but that the data are too limited to draw any conclusions at this
time. Results from the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, the trial of 22,071 U.S. male physicians taking 50
mg of beta carotene or a placebo every other day for 12 years, showed that beta-carotene
supplements had no significant effect -- positive or negative -- on cancer or cardiovascular disease
in this population of mostly nonsmokers (11 percent are current smokers while 51 percent
smoked at some time in their life). Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., of Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, headed this study, which showed in 1988
that low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of a first heart attack.<p>

 <p>

In response to the lack of benefit seen in CARET, the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, and the ATBC
trial, another ongoing trial is removing beta carotene supplements from its intervention. The
Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study, a trial of 40,000 female <strong>health</strong> professionals, headed by Julie Buring,
Sc.D., of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, began in 1992. The study
will continue to evaluate every-other-day doses of 600 IU of vitamin E and 100 mg of aspirin or
placebos.  <p>

<p>

<h4>Public <strong>Health</strong> Concern </h4>
 <p>

The results of CARET and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study provide strong evidence of no benefit
from beta carotene supplements and raise questions about their safety for the general public. "The
National Cancer Institute has never had a recommendation for Americans to take supplements,"
said Peter Greenwald, M.D., Dr.P.H., director of NCI's Division of Cancer Prevention and
Control. "The best advice for smokers who want to reduce their risk of lung cancer is still the
most direct: Stop smoking. Results from CARET and the ATBC Trial do suggest, however, that
smokers should avoid beta carotene supplements."<p>

 Omenn underscored the "quit smoking" message by praising the many CARET participants who
were smokers at the beginning of the trial and who have quit during the study. Twenty-two
percent of those who smoked at the beginning of the trial have quit.<p>

 <p>

Greenwald continued, "For all Americans who wish to reduce their risk of lung and other cancers,
a low-fat diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains is the choice to make. These studies
show nothing to suggest that smokers or nonsmokers might benefit from beta carotene
supplements." Hennekens concurred, noting that "taken together, the results of CARET, ATBC,
and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study clearly tell us that beta-carotene supplementation is not a magic
bullet -- it can neither substitute for a good diet nor compensate for a bad one."<p>

 <p>

NCI Director Richard Klausner, M.D., praised the work of the researchers and participants of
CARET and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, as well as applauding the process of science. "Medicine
and public <strong>health</strong> must be based, whenever possible, on evidence. These trials discussed today
provide that essential evidence... While the results are disappointing, the research process, I
believe, is working."<p>

 <p>

<h4>CARET Background and Study Design  </h4>
The study is being conducted in six areas of the United States with a principal investigator at each
site and Omenn coordinating the trial. The six investigators and cities participating in CARET are:
Gary E. Goodman, M.D., Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash.; Barbara G.
Valanis, Dr.P.H., Kaiser Center for <strong>Health</strong> Research, Portland, Ore.; James P. Keogh, M.D.,
University of Maryland at Baltimore, Baltimore, Md.; John R. Balmes, M.D., University of
California-San Francisco, San Francisco, Calif.; Frank Meyskens, Jr., M.D., University of 
California-Irvine, Irvine, Calif.; Mark R. Cullen, M.D., Yale University School of Medicine, New
Haven, Conn. <p>

The study is comprised of two groups: 14,254 current and former smokers with a long history of
smoking and 4,060 asbestos-exposed individuals. The total number of participants is 18,314.   <p>

Recruited in Seattle, Portland, and Irvine were 14,254 men and women ages 50 to 69 who are
current smokers or are smokers who had quit within six years of enrolling in the study. Smokers 
and former smokers must have had a smoking history of at least 20 pack years (one pack per day
for 20 years or two packs for 10 years, etc). These participants are 56 percent male (7,965) and
44 percent female (6,289) and had an average of 50 pack years of smoking. About 34 percent
were former smokers when they joined the study. All participants were counseled to quit smoking
during their visits to the study centers. The racial distribution of the participants is 95 percent
white, 2 percent African-American, 1 percent Hispanic, and 2 percent Asian or other.<p>

 <p>

At five of the six centers (Irvine, Calif. excluded), 4,060 men ages 45 to 69 years who had been
exposed to asbestos while at work were enrolled in CARET. These participants had to have
extensive occupational asbestos exposure beginning at least 15 years earlier, determined by either
a chest X-ray that showed asbestos exposure or employment for more than five years in trades
that carry a high risk of exposure to asbestos: plumbers and pipefitters, steam fitters, shipyard
boilermakers, nonshipyard boilermakers, shipyard electricians, shipscalers, insulators, plasterboard
workers, or sheetmetal workers. In addition, they had to be either current smokers or had to have
quit smoking within the last 15 years. One- half the CARET participants in both groups took a
combination of beta carotene and vitamin A and one-half took inactive placebos. <p>

Beta carotene is an antioxidant, a compound that may prevent cancer-causing substances from
damaging DNA. Epidemiologic studies have linked high dietary intake of beta carotene and high
serum levels of this micronutrient to a reduced risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer. Vitamin A
was chosen for study because it is known to play a part in cell differentiation, a process of
"maturing" cells that helps prevent them from inappropriate growth, such as the uncontrolled cell
growth that is seen in cancer. Vitamin A (retinol) and its analogues have been shown to be
effective in preventing cancers in animals exposed to chemicals like those in cigarette smoke. Beta
carotene and vitamin A were given as a combination under the hypothesis of a potentially
favorable interaction between the two compounds. The dose of beta carotene in CARET was 30
mg/day, which is equivalent to 50,000 IU of vitamin A or about five medium-sized carrots.
Vitamin A was given as retinyl palmitate in a dose of 25,000 IU.<p>

 <p>

<h4>Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study Background and Study Design</h4>
 <p>

The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study was conducted nationwide among 22,071 U.S. male physicians ages
40 to 84 years, 11 percent of whom were current smokers and 51 percent of whom had smoked at
some time in their life when recruited to the study in 1982. <p>

 <p>

The participants took either 50 mg of beta carotene every other day or a placebo and 325 mg of
aspirin or a placebo on the alternate day. The randomized aspirin component ended early, after
five years, primarily because a benefit of aspirin on risk of first heart attack was found (a 44
percent reduction was seen in those taking aspirin). The beta carotene treatment continued until
its scheduled termination on Dec. 31, 1995. Questions and Answers about these studies follow.<p>

 <p>

<h4>Questions and Answers: Beta Carotene Chemoprevention Trials</h4>
 <p>

1. What is a chemoprevention trial?  <p>

A chemoprevention trial is a type of clinical trial, which is a research study conducted with
people. In a cancer chemoprevention trial, natural or laboratory-made substances are tested to see
if they prevent cancer. The people who participate in such a study are healthy or are at risk of
developing cancer, or in some studies, people who have been diagnosed with cancer and are at
risk of developing a second cancer. <p>

 <p>

2. What is the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial?<p>

 <p>

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial or ATBC Trial was conducted by
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in collaboration with the National Public <strong>Health</strong> Institute of
Finland. The purpose of the study was to see if certain vitamin supplements would prevent lung
and other cancers in a group of 29,133 male smokers in Finland. The 50 to 69 year old
participants took a pill containing either 50 milligrams (mg) alpha tocopherol (a form of vitamin
E), 20 mg beta carotene (a precursor of vitamin A), both, or a placebo (inactive pill that looks like
the vitamin) daily for five to eight years.<p>

 <p>

3. What is the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial or CARET?<p>

 <p>

The Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial or CARET is a large chemoprevention trial that is
being conducted in six areas in the United States and is funded by NCI. The purpose of the study
was to see if the combination of beta carotene and vitamin A (a retinol) supplements would
prevent lung and other cancers in men and women who are smokers or former smokers ages 50 to
69 years, and men who have been exposed to asbestos ages 45 to 69 years. The 18,314
participants stopped taking the supplements prior to the completion of the trial.<p>

 <p>

4. What is the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study?<p>

 <p>

The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study is a chemoprevention trial with 22,071 male U.S. physicians, of
which only 11 percent smoked. The purpose of the study was to test whether a beta carotene
supplement reduces the risk of cancer and heart disease as well as whether low-dose aspirin
reduced the risk of heart disease. The aspirin component was stopped in early 1988 due to a 44
percent reduction in risk of first heart attack among those taking aspirin. The beta carotene
component ended Dec. 31, 1995 after more than 12 years of study. <p>

 <p>

5. What did these trials show?<p>

 <p>

In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial, 18 percent more lung cancers
were diagnosed and 8 percent more overall deaths occurred in study participants taking beta
carotene. In CARET, after an average of four years of receiving supplements, 28 percent more
lung cancers were diagnosed and 17 percent more deaths occurred in participants taking beta
carotene and vitamin A than in those taking placebos. Neither of these studies showed a benefit
from taking supplements. <p>

 <p>

Because the interim results of CARET were similar to the ATBC study, the intervention was
stopped 21 months early. Both of these studies involved persons who were specifically invited to
participate because of their high risk for developing lung cancer.  The Physician's <strong>Health</strong> Study
was completed at the end of 1995 and showed no benefit or harm in people taking beta carotene
supplements for more than 12 years. <p>

 <p>

6. Why did CARET stop early?<p>

 <p>

The study itself was not stopped, but the participants were told to stop taking the beta carotene
and vitamin A or placebos. The Safety and Endpoints Monitoring Committee for CARET and an
ad hoc committee assembled by NCI saw that the interim results clearly showed no benefit from
the supplements and also showed there was a possibility that they were harming participants.
CARET investigators made the decision to stop the intervention, but they will follow the study
group for five more years to determine the long-term effects of the intervention.<p>

 <p>

The intervention was halted on Jan. 11, 1996 by the CARET investigators. Letters were mailed to
participants by Jan. 13 and a public announcement made Jan. 18.  <p>

<p>

7. Who were the participants in CARET?<p>

 <p>

The study had two groups: 14,254 current and former smokers with a long history of smoking
and 4,060 asbestos-exposed individuals.  The smokers and former smokers included 14,254 men
and women ages 50 to 69 who are current smokers or are smokers who had quit within six years
of enrolling in the study. Smokers and former smokers must have had a smoking history of at least
20 pack years (one pack per day for 20 years or two packs for 10 years, etc). These participants
are 56 percent male (7,965) and 44 percent female (6,289) and had an average of 50 pack years of
smoking. About 34 percent were former smokers when they joined the study. All participants
were counseled to quit smoking at their visits to the study centers.<p>

 <p>

The asbestos-exposed participants were 4,060 men ages 45 to 69 years who had been exposed to
asbestos while at work. These participants had to have extensive occupational asbestos exposure
beginning at least 15 years prior to enrollment, determined by either a chest X-ray that showed
asbestos exposure or employment for more than five years in trades that carry a high risk of
exposure to asbestos: plumbers and pipefitters, steam fitters, shipyard boilermakers, nonshipyard
boilermakers, shipyard electricians, shipscalers, insulators, plasterboard workers, or sheetmetal
workers. In addition, they had to be either current smokers or had to have quit smoking within the
last 15 years.  <p>

8. What is beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

Beta carotene, which is found in plants, is a precursor of vitamin A. The body converts beta
carotene to vitamin A. It occurs mainly in fruits and vegetables that are deep yellow, orange, or
dark green in color, such as carrots, squash, yams, peaches, apricots, spinach, collard or mustard
greens, and broccoli. It is an antioxidant, a compound that may prevent cancer-causing substances
from damaging DNA. Epidemiologic studies have linked high intake of foods rich in beta carotene
and high serum levels of the micronutrient to a reduced risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer.<p>

 <p>

9. What is vitamin A?<p>

 <p>

Vitamin A is a vitamin, a substance found in foods that is necessary for human <strong>health</strong>. Vitamin A
is found in liver, various dairy products with fat, such as milk, cheese, butter and ice cream, and in
fatty fish such as herring, sardines, and tuna. It can also be found in the liver oils of shark, cod,
and halibut.<p>

Vitamin A is known to play a part in cell differentiation, a process by which cells "mature."
Differentiation helps prevent cells from inappropriate growth, such as the uncontrolled cell
growth that is seen in cancer. Many studies in animals show that vitamin A and similar compounds
decrease the incidence of cancer.<p>

 <p>

10. Should Americans who smoke avoid taking beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

The NCI has never had a recommendation for Americans to take supplements. The best advice for
smokers who want to reduce their risk of lung cancer is still the most direct: Stop smoking. The
results from CARET and the ATBC Trial suggest that smokers should avoid taking beta carotene
supplements. <p>

 <p>

11. Should Americans who don't smoke take beta carotene supplements?<p>

 <p>

The results of the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study showed no benefit or harm to nonsmokers who took
beta carotene every other day for 12 years. The results from CARET and the ATBC Study do not
provide information about the effects of beta carotene supplements on non-smokers. NCI does
not recommend that Americans take supplements. For those who wish to reduce their risk of
cancer, NCI advises that it is prudent to adopt a low-fat diet containing plenty of fruits,
vegetables, and grains.<p>

 <p>

12. Should Americans stop eating five fruits and vegetables daily (5-A-Day)?<p>

 <p>

No. 5-A-Day remains a good idea. In both the ATBC Study and CARET, participants with the
highest levels of beta carotene in their blood, measured before the study began, went on to have 
fewer lung cancers. These results are consistent with the possibility that a different compound or
compounds in foods that have high levels of beta carotene may be responsible for the protective
effect of dietary beta carotene seen in epidemiologic studies. Because these are studies of pills,
not food intake, NCI stresses that the study results do not change the results of studies that show
that eating a variety of fruits and vegetables each day remains a good way to reduce the risk of
some cancers.<p>

 <p>

13. What other chemoprevention studies are under way with beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

The NCI has a number of different agents under study, including calcium, fiber, tamoxifen, and
others. Only one large-scale study including beta carotene (the Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study) was 
ongoing when CARET stopped its intervention, and the beta carotene portion of that study has
been halted. Principal investigators of smaller or shorter-term studies including beta carotene were
alerted and advised to consider the results of these studies in making decisions about the trials
they are conducting.<p>

In the Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of <strong>Health</strong>, 40,000 apparently
healthy women <strong>health</strong> professionals ages 45 and older were being assigned at random to 50 mg
beta carotene, 600 IU vitamin E, 100 mg aspirin, and/or placebos every other day. The beta
carotene portion of this trial is being dropped. The trial, which will show the balance of benefits
and risks of these agents on cancer and cardiovascular disease, began in 1992.<p>

<A NAME="subscriber"><B>Q: Why should you use us?</B></A>
<BR>
A: <B>THE FACTS: When we began our project to put Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation on the internet in 1991, we knew nothing. We were ripped off by everyone and wasted tens of thousands of dollars. But as they say, the best education is the one you pay for. Since then we have become experts in web promotion learning through our mistakes. Now we have it down to a science. We now have our in-house staff of good honest people that are actively promoting our site on a daily basis. If you found us, then we must be doing a great job and now we can do the same for you!<P>
What this means for you is the same expert abilities working to promote you. We are not a marketing company, we are a nonprofit church and doctors so we don't try to sell anyone on our service. Being doctors we know the importance of preciseness and timeliness, and precision. We treat this aspect in the same fashion we treat our patients and congregation. We don't charge high fees or monthly charges for our services. Just one flat fee to put your name out there and get your site known and fast. Our only goal is to keep growing awareness of natural health to the world and to share the word of God. Your $99.99 goes directly to the church to sponsor our<a href="/97/974.htm"> charity projects</a>. Profit is not our mission, doing good for others is!</B><P>


<A NAME="renewed"><B>Q:How do we do it so cheap?</B>
<BR>
A:<B> Everyday our staff and volunteers are searching the web for new search engines, crawlers, indices and link pages to promote our site. Being in the health industry, we cross every platform on the web, because without good health, it doesn't matter what your business is, you won't preform at your best. We have bulit a list of over 600 + search engines, and link pages that bring you high traffic and get your name out there. We are also adding to this list every week and will soon be adding another 500 to it. That means a list of over 1000. We can afford to do this for you so inexpensivley as follows: <P>
1. We promote our site every day. Our staff hand picks these sites and applies to them. It only takes another few minutes to do the same for you at the same time and it dosen't cost us any more in labor, saving you big dollars and valuable time. That's efficiency.<P>
2. Every search engine and link has their own protocol of how to fill out their submission form. Do it wrong and you will be excluded. We found this out when we first started by using those budget one form fits all companies and found not only did we waste our money and time, but we also had to correct our position with all those search engines, what a mess. We are experts in filling out forms. What else do doctors do? We spend half of our lives filling out forms. We do it right every time for each submission. We already paid for the mistakes that you don't have to make. We have already done the research and can easily put it to work for you while you sleep. There is no one that compares, because there is no one that has put a system together with the precision of a surgeon that is cost and time effective.<P> 
<A NAME="anonmail"><B>Q: What is the bottom line to you?</B>
<BR>
A:The bottom line to you is cost effective promotion and fast results. Below are the services short and simple. No strings, no hidden costs, no commitment contracts. Just straight out promotion! <P>
1. For only $99.99 we get you started by promoting you to 600 + search engines, link pages, indices, crawlers, and award granting sites. One flat fee, that's it! This individual process takes us approximatly 40 hours to do right. We supply you with a list of them right here at this sight, just click on <a href="/serve/web2.htm">LIST</a> so if you want to do it yourself, go right ahead. If it takes us 40 hours and we do it every day. It will take you about 100 hours, but will you do it right? It's your time and money. Spend it as you wish!<P>
2. ADDITIONAL COVERAGE: We are adding to our list every week and you can take advantage of our research to promote your site on a perpetual basis. For a small fee of $7.95 per month we will include you in our submissions to all the sites we find and submit to, no matter how many! We find this to be the key to promoting a successful site, promote, promote, promote. This is an automatic process so you never have to remember, we remember for you and do it every time we do it for ourselves and that's every week. So the only way you would not get further promotion, is if we stopped promoting and that is never going to happen. To take advantage of this feature all you have to do is indicate this on the form you fill out and you will be charged $7.95 per month on your credit card automatically, just as your access provider does. The rest you can leave up to us!<P>
<A NAME="office"><B>Q:How do you get started today?</B>
<BR>
A: 
1. Simple: All you have to do is go to the <a href="http://www.eyeonmedicine.com/serve/web3.htm">Eye On Medicine Form</a> Once there, just answer the questions one time and submit it to us. Once we recieve it we have all the information we need and will begin at once to submit you to 600 + search engines, link pages, indices, etc. Now all you have to do is get ready for all the traffic that is going to be coming to your site! <P>

<A NAME="wholesale"><B>Q: Do you have special rates for web service promoters?</B></A>
<BR>
A: <B> YES WE DO! If you are a web promotion service or a webmaster that does or would like to provide a web submit service for your clients we do have special rates. Let us do it for you while you spend your time building your promotion service. The wholesale price for 600 + submit is $69.95 and 122 submit $29.95. Simply email us with the name of your company, site name, URL and email contact address and we will set up a resellers account for you. You can charge whatever fee you wish to your clients. <a href="MAILTO:wsubmit@eyeonmedicine.com"> wholesale</a> program. <HR>

One of the world's most modern cities... yet with only a few short steps, you'll travel

See London and see a theatrical tradition that dates back 400 years to 1576 when the city's first theatre
opened under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth I.

<h1>Eye On Medicine Body Chemistry Health Survey </h1>
</center><HR>

In order to gain optimal health you need to know where your health is at the moment. In order to attain this goal you need a starting point from which to begin. The following survey is what every client that comes to Rick Nappi fills out. From this he can get a very clear picture of where a person is health wise. From there he can then target a course of action that is advantageous to gaining optimal health. Through these 197 questions he more than likely learns more about you than any doctor you have been to in the past. This tool that he uses has been invaluable in clearing what has been called the impossible cases. After you complete this form and submit it, Rick Nappi will personally review it just as he does when someone comes to him in person. Upon review, you will be sent the results via email or fax if preferred within 72 hours outlining the areas to be aware of and what he would do to begin to correct them. There is only one major difference from this form online and when you see him personally, the price. The fee in office is $100, the fee online is 1/4 of that at $25.00 and there is no difference in attention it receives.<P>
If you wish, you can print this form out and fill it in off line and fax it to 212-982-8386 If you pay by credit card through our secure server, your survey will be processed at once. For checks or money orders you must send the form in with full payment before we can process it. There will be directions below for this procedure. In the near future you can request a form and our auto responder will send you a complete blank form.<P>

They were also master cultivators of "Kvass" known in Russia as the "Wonder Mushroom Drink." The secret of this medicinal drink and it's proper preparation have survived over 300 years within one family, now resting in the hands of Dr. Rick Nappi, the great grandson of these masters. On an Eastern Long Island family farm of over 60 years, Dr. Nappi and his sister Tina, continue the family tradition, cultivating and perfecting this powerful drink. With the same love and care dating back to their great grand parents, they continue to produce the finest "Kvass" found anywhere in the world.

Kvass has been healing people worldwide for thousands of years and in my opinion should be a part of everyone s daily health regimen. Not only does time and countless reports of it's benefits stand up to the test, but one of the most prestigious institutes in Russia has done extensive research regarding this medicinal drink. <B>The Moscow Central Bacteriological Institute</B> has been studying this bacterial/yeast drink since the forties.

Only use a glass bowl. No cylinders, plastic, ceramic, crystal or sundry containers. This could kill the active properties of the Kvass </center>

Gently pull the mother (bottom) and new baby (top) from the glass bowl and separate them. Remove 12 ounces of the tea (6 oz for the mother, 6 oz for the new baby. This will be used as the cultivation tea to make more Kvass). Place the Mother in one bowl and the baby in another bowel. Now you are ready to begin the process over again. When you are finished you will then have 4 Kvass. Start over right away. Do not store in plastic bags and refrigerate or leave out in the open. You can give babies to your friends. </center></a>

<B>The Color of Love will be here soon. It's time that we address the one world concept of love. It does not matter what color your skin is, or where you are from, we are all here on this planet together. The future is now and everyone must deal with the reality that love is void of color and geographics. It is a perplexing dilema for those that feel the love and difficult for those that see it from the outside. The Color of Love is  the bridge that will explore a universe toward understanding, a place of harmony, a place where love will conquer over injustice, a place where hopefully all will gain new insight toward a new one world philosophy of togetherness. Afterall, isn't that what we all desire, to be what we are and to be excepted as we are, no matter where we are from or what color our skin may be?</B>

</CENTER>
<H4>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO HERE IS <IMG SRC="/images/excuse.jpg"> OF ONE AND YOU MAY WIN A TRIP!</H4><BR>
No matter what your age, gender or culture, we have all used excuses to avoid added complications in our daily lives. Some may think this is a bad quality, but we think that is a bunch of garbage. Closer to the truth, those that say that may in fact be jealous because they could not think of an excuse good enough when they needed it. That's where this public service comes in. It is our intent, with your help, to see that people from around the world will never be without a great excuse when they most need it. Now anyone can come here and find the perfect excuse to fit the situation. <P>
Once we begin to collect your great excuses, we will list them in the appropriate categories for quick access. Anything goes here and any excuse could help someone out of a jam. So don't think it isn't good enough. Any category is open: Excuses for being late for school, work, not showing up, breaking a date, not doing homework, not calling someone, avoiding sex, etc.....The list goes on and on and the excuses are endless. What ever the excuse, share it with someone who needs it and we will post them for all to see. And once a month we will give a lucky excuse two round trip airfares to Hawaii, London, Mexico, Orlando home of Walt Disney. <HR>
JUST FILL OUT THE FORM BELOW AND WE WILL ADD YOUR EXCUSE!<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Being a healthier person is not as difficult or as time consuming as sensationalists would have you believe.  The
truth is, it can be fun and almost effortless.  Rick Nappi, Doctor of Naturopathy/homeopathy knows this from practical experience and application.
he maintains a private practice in Manhattan, N.Y.  and Hollywood, California.  Former health talk radio host and founder of the Intelligent health web site
his "Ask Dr. Nappi", interactive information line receives over 30,000 inquires per month.  he sits on the medical advisory board of two athletic sports magazines.  even with his full schedule,
he spends the rest of his time flying worldwide caring the health needs of celebrities like June Pointer (Pointer Sisters), super models such as Linda Evangelista, film producers like
Legend Fred Caruso (God Father, Blue Velvet), to corporate executives, the working family and homeless mothers and children.<P>

The point being, Dr. Nappi's empathy rides the pulse of today's  consumer.  Interacting with so many people daily, he realized that it doesn't matter
what you do for a living, or what level you are on, all people from all walks of life today are extremely busy and on the go.  They as well as Dr. Nappi just don't have time for inflexible routines and complicated health 
programs.  We need a new approach that everyone can succeed with, one that is actually hassle free and fun.  These are the first steps to being a healthier person, staying with it, and continuing with it for the rest of your life without effort.  Thus, 
<STRONG><B>THE PERFECT MEAL</B></STRONG>.

<CENTER><H2><U>START A HEALTHIER LIFE WITHOUT SACRIFICE</U></H2></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>MENTAL ATTITUDE:</STRONG> Feel good about yourself and know that you are doing the best you can.  You will achieve all the goals you set for yourself.  As is said, "you are what you eat," you are also what you think, so feed your brain. You are a winner! <STRONG>Fact: Happy people produce more endorphins and anti-bodies!</STRONG>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>MOVEMENT:</STRONG> My definition of exercise is movement.  you don't have to lift weights to be healthy.  Walking, swimming, hiking, bicycling, stretching are just a few.  Most of these can be incorporated into your workday.  Even walking to the copy machine or stretching while you wait for the copies is a form of 
exercise that will have a positive benefit.  Every little bit can add up to a lot.  Most importantly, if you don't have time to breathe, you don't have time to live, so relax and take a deep breath. <STRONG>Fact: movement increases circulation, stamina and burns calories!</STRONG>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>NUTRITION:</STRONG> I say, eat what makes you feel good, which is different for each person.  Depriving yourself of the things you love is nothing short of life deprivation.  I observe more depression and illness form this than any other
cause.  Balanced nutrition is important for a healthy life and longevity.  More importantly, realize that the body is a wonderful and complicated mechanism that thrives on variety.  It is the very thing that sustains life, good health and happiness.  Be realistic, steak eaters do not turn into celery eaters overnight.  Drastic changes can actually cause more harm than good.
Nutritional change should be paced, feel comfortable and natural, even in cases of obesity.  Deprive someone of their ice-cream entirely, and they will crave twice as much. <STRONG>Fact: Small changes over a longer period of time are more effective and the results are longer lived!</STRONG>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>MEGA DOSES AND BALANCE:</STRONG>  Too much of a good thing can be as bad for you as too little.  Research has shown that mega doses of nutrients can actually do harm.  In addition, the body can only absorb so much at one time, so why waste your time and money on what your body will only reject anyway.  Balance is the key.  Don't buy into the hype, listen to your common sense, be realistic.  The right amount of nutrients will be beneficial and have a balanced effect on your life. <STRONG>The Perfect Meal</STRONG> was developed to supply this balance.  A whole food, derived from plants, containing all the nutrients and enzymes essential for good health.  <STRONG>The Perfect Meal</STRONG> is not a vitamin supplement, but a real whole food (143 cals) that takes seconds and tastes great.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>INGREDIENTS & ORGANICS:</STRONG>    We use the highest quality Organics, no chemicals or pesticides.  We refuse to use the words "certified organic" as others do.  The truth is, when water used to irrigate plants goes through the pipe network or it rains the ideal of purity has been pierced.  Once this flaw is corrected, we will proudly display "certified" on our labels.  Until then why should you pay 30-50% more for a myth.  For now, organic is as organic can be in today's environment and that is the truth.  Don't buy hype!  <STRONG>For Ingredients, nutritional information, philosophy and directions for The Perfect Meal, read the last two paragraphs.</STRONG>

<H2>A Word About Healthy Relationships</H2>
 
Healthy Relationships is the brain child of  Dr. Rick Nappi. While on a 
one year intensive research project he found himself working long hours 
in a place where he knew no-one. Feeling isolated and too tired to get out after long days he became frustrated and lonely. While commenting on this dilemma to several colleagues he was amazed to find that they were also suffering from this same frustration. Imagine, smart, attractive and nice professionals without the time or energy to go through the laborious process of meeting others through the standard venues. This is one of the unfortunate characteristics of those who have dedicated themselves to the health care profession. Long hours, revolving shifts and on call 24 hours a day. But what if there was a way for health care professionals to meet and exchange ideas and even find romance without the draining scene, embarrassing moments, outright rejection or uncomfortable aspects for those that are to shy? i.e. Healthy Relationships, a place where health care professionals and those that may not be in our industry, but would like to meet us and otherwise would never have access to us could finally get together and meet. This would be a dream come true. We'll now it has arrived and it is called Healthy Relationships. It's lots of fun and it works. A place where professional single adults can meet, get to know each other, and form new relationships. Whether you just hag out online or venture beyond, you could have access to a growing number of members who are making connections every day. <P>

  
<H2>How Healthy Relationships Works</H2>

Healthy Relationships provides many ways to help you get comfortable with our
service:<P>

<H2>Exciting professionals are at Healthy Relationships</H2>
 
The members at Healthy Relationships are people like you and me. Great people, smart, professional, upscale and attractive to mention only a few positive traits. They are Doctors, Nurses, practitioners of all health care fields, health care students, nutritionists, master chefs, fitness trainers, scientists, psychiatrists, lawyers, professors, etc. Even these busy professionals have a private life and would like to meet new friends and even spark new romance. The landscape is filled with diverse wonderful people that just don't have the time to waste on the traditional dead end dating game or would like to narrow the field down to more like minded people. They come in all ages, shapes and sizes. Singles, athletes, single parents, models, we even have some mystery celebrities and even people that are not in the health care profession that would like to meet someone who is. What ever your taste, you will find it here at Healthy Relationships. And as we continue to grow there will be even more interesting people to meet each week. Just click on the<I> just looking around</I> feature and see for yourself.<P>

Healthy Relationships provides an extremely secure and comfortable 
environment for all of it's members. 
Being in the healthcare industry we take the privacy and 
confidentiality of each member very seriously. 
We give you the same right to privacy that our own patients in our private practices expect from us. We never make available any of your personal information. We also reserve the right to reject any publicly viewable words or photographs that we feel are inappropriate and or potentially offensive to any of our members. Remember, Healthy Relationships is a sister company of Eye On Medicine so we consider ourselves open to many age groups as a learning tool. Healthy Relationships is only for our 18 year and older population.<P>

<B>Working around the clock does not leave much time for me to meet people socially. But I wanted to start meeting new friends and maybe even meet my future mate. After talking with colleagues, I found that they were experiencing the same dilemma. That's why I came up with HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS!<P>
Now professionals in the healthcare industry have a place where they can meet quality people within our industry that normally would not have the time to ever meet each other any other way. Better yet, it's a great place for people that are not in our industry to get to know us. Lets face it, with the hours we put in, the chances of people meeting us in a bar are pretty slim.<P>
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS is the first of it's kind on the WWW dedicated to healthcare professionals and those that would like to meet us. No bar scene, no rejection, no embarrassment. Founded by a doctor that understands how hard you work and that also realizes that we need to create a balance and have some fun. After all, most people we meet professionally come to us because they need a dose of healthy TLC. We'll now there is finally a place where we can receive some TLC after a hard days work.<P>
So put down your stethoscope and start having some fun. Whether your looking for a pen pal, activity partner, short or long term relationship, there are wonderful, quality people of all ages waiting to meet you!<P>All revenues go directly back into the further enhancement of the Eye On Medicine Site and a portion to (Natural) AIDS research.</B><P>
<B>We especially want to thank the modeling industry, all the celebrities, handsome doctors, beautiful nurses and other professionals from all industries for assisting us in making this project a success and affording us the opportunity to do the work that is so important. Sorry, we can't tell you who they are, because they use stealth codes just as you will when you join. But you never know who you are chatting with at Healthy Relationships, until the first meeting!</B><HR><P>

" There are too many people wasting their money on office visits and prescription drugs needlessly. Even in my practice, many of the people I see do not really have to come in to see me. The problem is that no one ever educated them properly on self care. This is what has compelled me to develop a system that can replace me and still be effective in many acute cases."<I>R. Nappi</I><P>
Now families can save hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year by taking charge of their own healthcare, says Rick Nappi, N.D., DIHom.<P>
" Computers are now in most households and this technology can now be used to help families become more independent when exercising preventive health or alleviating some common acute illnesses. This can translate into big savings for millions of Americans. This is why I developed "The Official Encyclopedia of Intelligent Health. <P>
"The Official Encyclopedia of Intelligent Health" is an IBM or compatible software program that will run on any system that has a Windows application, including Windows 95." <I>R. Nappi</I><P>
" I have taken 21 of the most common acute family ailments and have made it easy for anyone to be able to select the correct homeopathic remedy that will give fast relief. Through the use of sophisticated computer technology your computer and I do all the work for you. Even a child can master it's use in less than 1 minute. Just select the difficulty you are experiencing and I then ask you simple yes or no questions just as I would if you came to see me. Then when you are finished answering the questions, the computer goes to work and searches for the top three homeopathic remedies that fit your symptoms and which is the best to use and how to and how long to use them.<P>
There is also a Materia Medica of 59 remedies that give you the full description and use of each 
remedy. To make it even better, I use homeopathic remedies that can be purchased in almost any health food store worldwide. If you can't find one, I will send it to you." <I>R. Nappi</I><P>
This acute home prescriber covers <B>bites and stings, breathing difficulties, burns, boils, colds and flu, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, toothache, blisters, bruises, cough, earache, hoarseness, sports injuries, urinary problems, cuts and wounds, fever, indigestion, strains/sprains, vomiting.</B><P>
"This an invaluable tool for the entire family. I have shared it with hundreds of families that have utilized it with great benefit and have saved hundreds of dollars. If you have children you should not be without it. The peace of mind is worth every penny. If you travel, download it onto your notebook and I guarantee you will use it on your first trip!"<P> 
" I will be continually expanding the encyclopedia and upgrades will be very affordable and will cover nutrition, herbology, in-depth protocols and more. The 1.0 windows version is on one 3.5 disk and the hard drive space it takes is negligible. I could not make it any more affordable at a price of only $100<B> NOT! NOW IT'S FREE!</B> Take charge of your health now, take action, feel great tomorrow and every day!"<I> R. Nappi</I><HR>
<B>Now if your ready to order just click on this <a href="/money/mon1c.htm"> ACTION</a> word. </B><HR>

<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>Are we being poisoned? In Latin, the word "Biotic" means life, the word "Anti" means against. So, "Anti-Biotic" means, "Against Life". The Antibiotic Project is intended to independantly document victims of antibiotics. This is a multi-phase project. Gather data, investigate the cancer aspect and side effects for kids, corrolation of data collected, the results of the study, exploring new approaches.</FONT></TD>
<TD></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>The top priority of a Pastor is to Ordain as many Ministers through his congregation to go out and share the word of divinity. This is a real accredited Ministers credentials recognized by the Federal Courts and grants you the privlages of a Minister. This credintial bares the state seal and is endoursed and signed by the Bishop. Join the many famous people who are, or have been, ULC ministers. President Johnson, 
Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, Norman Lear, Carol Burnett, Sammy Davis Jr., Doris 
Day, Jimmy Stewart, Mel Blanc, Goldie Hawn, The Beatles, and the list goes on and on.
 Please help us meet our goal in Ordaining a record number of new Ministers. It only takes a minute, you can do it right online and it's free! Tell a friend, God's speed!</FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a multi phase project. Phase 1 will be the building of the Eye On Medicine Pious Foundation Open Center. A center open to the public focused on both youth and adult education. It is our goal to be able to award scolorships to those interested in pursuing careers in the holistic feild in conjunction with the teachings of the spirit. This central facility will also serve as a place for people from around the world to visit and exchange information and knowledge, both professional and layperson. This facility will also be a refuge for those attempting to escape from domestic abuse. When ther is nowhere to turn, we will be there for you and teach you how to become independent and start a new life! The second phase will be the building of satalite centers nationwide.    </FONT></TD>

This will be a free public service for congregation members and new comers. We will provide information for the indigent, to increase their quality of life. Such as health alerts, utility assistance, prescription assistance, diognostic assistance, etc. Included will be a prayer line and non-denominational spiritual counseling.  </FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=-1>The Cyber Church is the future of the world today. With over 40 million people online, it is time to have a place of worship on the information super highway! This web site will enable us to reach the world in a more cost effective way and allot more dollars to the people most in need. It will encompase a prayer chapel where people can submit a prayer and it will be included in Rev. Dr. Rick Nappi's daily evening non-denominational prayer service. It will also save trees by getting information out electronically. We will also have a free online Ordaining Center. One will only have to fill in the information and then recieve their Ministers credentials. It will also serve as a distance school and offer accredited courses leading to Masters and PhD. degrees in relegious studies. Also building a religious cyber library for anyone needing this information. </FONT></TD>

<B>NOTICE: You may see the following The Netscape security certificate did not match up with your site. Is
this a security problem?<P>

NO! The eye on medicine site resides on the server
 owned by a company called clever.net. Thus from what they have
 explained to me, the certificate for the secure server sits on their
 root directory and is shared by those that rent space on their
 server. We are one of those leasees and one of the services we pay
 for is the use of their secure mechanism. That is why the disclaimer
 pops up. As long as you see the solid key at the bottom of your screen, you are encrypted. Your transaction only sits on the server for 15 seconds. I sometime find it annoying as well. I understand that this
 is a standard disclaimer. However, I assure you that your transaction
 is secure and we are in compliance with all net commerce protocols. This holds true for all order form pages on the Eye On Medicine Site.<P> I
 hope this memo explains to your satisfaction.
Thank you Dr. Nappi<HR>

<A NAME="subscriber"><B>Q: The Kvass Story continued from the introduction.</B></A>
<BR>
A: The Kvass is not a new fad drink or some pseudo remedy. Kvass has been healing people worldwide for thousands of years and in my opinion should be a part of everyone's daily health regimen.
Not only does time and countless reports of it's benefits stand up to the test, but one of the most
prestigious institutes in Russia has done extensive research regarding this medicinal drink. The Moscow
Central Bacteriological Institute has been studying this bacterial/yeast drink for over 50 years. This drink is actually made from a yeast culture, which is grown on a medium of black/orange pekoe tea, sugar and 15% cultivation tea from a previously harvested batch of Kvass drink.<P>
The benefits of the Kvass fermentation are the wide array of beneficial substances produced by the process. Among them are the production of; beneficial enzymes, detoxifying acids, antibacterial agents, a multitude of B vitamins. One of the Kvasses unique features is the mushroom shape it forms during growth, which can be seen floating on top of the tea in which it grows in.<P>
This mushroom like growth is actually formed from Bacterium Xylinum and nest like deposits of yeast cells of the genus Saccharomyces.<P>
Biochemists that have studied the phenomenon  of the Kvass attribute the amazing beneficial and therapeutic effects to the I-lactic acid and glucuronic acid. Those that think lactic acid sounds familiar, it does. It is found in the yogurt you eat and sauerkraut to name a few. Lactic acid that is found in what is termed (active) fermented liquids is more highly ionized and superior to acetic acid found in vinegars. Scientific and clinical studies have shown that lactic acid enhances and activates cell restoration, thus increasing oxygen in the blood stream. With the two combined there is an increase in the level of energy. It is also known to regulate and balance the blood pH (in acidity) and will stimulate liver function. An interesting observation by cancer researchers found that lactic acid is rarely found in the connective tissue of cancer patients. The absence of l-lactic acid will lead to a condition known as (hypoxia), which in simple terms is oxygen deficiency, thus creating a build up of bad DL-lactic acid.<P>
The liver is an organ that is much over looked and taken for granted. However, if we did not have a liver to process all the food we eat, the best food would be pure poison to us. Glucuronic acid is a substance that detoxifies the liver in addition to binding metabolic and environmental poisons we ingest on a daily basis. Glucuronic acid facilitates the excretion of these poisons from the body.<P>
What does this mean? Glucuronic acid is beneficial for the arthritis, gout, arteriosclerosis patients where there is an excess of uric acid, cholesterol or other unhealthy metabolic properties. Glucuronic acid is also a building block of an important group of mucopolysaccharides. These mucopolysaccharides are large complex molecules of sugar attached to amino acids that form a watery, intercellular (form of cement in simple terms), of the body which cushions and holds the organs together and lubricates joints.<P>
The Kvass is a drink that contains all of these properties and more. I believe we should all incorporate this healthy drink into our daily nutritional regimen. 
<P>

<A NAME="renewed"><B>Q:What are some of the other important properties of Mucopolysaccharides?</B>
<BR>
A:<B> Mucopolysaccharides include the following important properties;</B><P>
<B>Hyaluronic acid: </B>This property is found in some of the most expensive face creams on the market. It is also found naturally in the skin of the human body. Where it binds cells together, it holds water in the tissues.<P>
<B>Chondroitin sulfate:</B> This is a property found in human cartilage and the connective tissues. It helps the body speed the healing of bone and soft tissue.<P>
<B>Mucoitin sulfuric acid:</B> This is a vital building block of the stomach lining and the vitreous humour of the eye. A dysfunction of the humour is one of the symptoms of cataract patients.<P>
<B>Heparin:</B> Put in simple terms, heparin is an anti-coagulant (blood thinner). This property is found especially in the liver and tissues of the lungs. It helps in the prevention of unhealthy blood clouting.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="anonmail"><B>Q: What are the benefits of drinking the tea of the Kvass?</B>
<BR>
A: For thousands of years there have been populations worldwide that have been using and benefiting from the Kvass tea. Claims range from increased energy to restored youthfulness. In more recent times it has been used by many of the worlds top athletes. In addition this drink has been used by the Russian and German Olympic athletes who claim Kvass gave them the winning edge. <P>
<B>Other Healthful aspects of the Kvass:</B><P>
1. Helps normalize and balance digestive functions when taken with meals.<P>
2. Helps relieve constipation.<P>
3. Has been beneficial in individuals suffering from kidney and gallstones.<P>
4. There have been reports of weight loss with daily consumption.<P>
5. Has been beneficial to persons suffering from cataracts, Aids, cancer, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
<P>



<A NAME="office"><B>Q:What are some of the other good properties found in the Kvass tea?</B>
<BR>
A: <B>The Kvass also contains the following:</B><P>
1. B-1<P>
2. B-2<P>
3. B-3<P>
4. B-6<P>
5. B-12<P>
6. Folic acid<P>
7. Glucuronic acid<P>
<P>

<A NAME="profile"><B> Q: How long will the Kvass you send me last?</B>
<BR>
A: Your Kvass will last you a lifetime because you can continue to grow new babies every 12 days. The one we send you will last you a while. When it begins to get dark, it usually means it is getting old and can be retired. Then just use one of the new babies to make more tea and new babies. Don't throw it away, instead grind it up and put it in your planting soil, your plants will love it.
<P>



<A NAME="photo"><B>Q: How do I make more tea when my supply runs out?</B><BR>

A: Making new tea is easy. Just take 6 ounces of the tea from your first batch, follow the instructions the same as you did to make your first batch that you received from us. Then add the 6 ounces to the new batch and float the baby on top and wait 12 days and you will have a new batch of tea.<P>

<A NAME="browse"><B>Q: How long will my tea stay good in the refrigerator?</B>

<BR>
A: Your tea will stay good for at least 30 days. There have been documentation stipulating shelf life of 1 1/2 years, but I would not keep it that long for it will tend to get more tart with time.
<P>

<A NAME="last"><B>Q: How much should I drink per day and what if I am a recovering alcoholic or pregnant?</B>
<BR>
A: I would recommend starting with 4 ounces a day and build up to 14 ounces spread over the day. <P>
2. The Kvass contains about 1/2% alcohol. This would be about the same as apple cider. The pH acidity level is about 2.5, which is similar to that of many soft drinks.<P>
3. If you are pregnant or nursing, please consult your doctor first.<P>

<P>
<A NAME="resign"><B>Q: Is the Kvass drink safe for pets? </B>
<BR>
A: Absolutely! In fact there are many professional breeders ranging from horses to cattle to pigs that mix the Kvass drink in with their animals drinking water and feed. My sister feeds it to her three dogs and two cats daily. They are the healthiest I have ever seen.

<CENTER><EM>THE LOGIC</EM></CENTER>
Perfect Meal is the optimal food of the 90's.  This is not a supplement, it is whole food.  Logic has it that the optimal source 
of nutrition comes from raw or freeze dried plant foods that still have their enzymes, nutrients, vitamins and super anti-oxidants
intact as nature intended.  Not from synthetic vitamins, pills, powders, minerals, cooked or processed foods, and animal products.

<STRONG>Science 101:</STRONG> As one sits down to eat, food must be chewed to a point of pulverization in preparation for swallowing and digestion.
As digestion continues nutrients are released and go to cell level and are carried through the bloodstream providing essential nutrients the body needs to survive.
  Thus attaining optimal nutrition.  However, in the real world many people forget to eat at all, or if they do, they eat nutrient poor foods.  In addition, most don't macerate (chew)
food  enough preventing vital nutrients from releasing into the body for absorption or for speedy and proper digestion.  The result can be under nourishment, a strain on the digestive tract, constipation, indigestion,
 putrefaction, impacted waste (which can be from 5 to 20 lb.), fatigue, headaches bloating and a host of other more serious ailments down the road.<P>
Perfect meal is a sound solution to this dilemma.  14 of the ultimate food sources of each and every nutrient essential
 for optimal health, vitality and energy.  Pre-macerated for speedy and optimal cell level absorption, while greatly reducing energy spent on breaking down
improperly chewed foods.  This will help balance and stabilize bowel, colon, digestion, elimination and help  break down and rid the body of impacted waste materials.  The optimal formula for optimal nutrition, weight loss programs,
cholesterol control and body building.  Contains your complete daily vitamin requirement.  Free of cholesterol producing and allergy causing ingredients, 
synthetic or yeast based vitamins and minerals, soy proteins or fiber, MSG, wheat, eggs, honey, dairy products, salt, table sugar, caffeine, artificial preservatives, flavors, coloring,
fillers or animal products of any kind.<P>

<B>The Color of Love will be here soon. It's time that we address the one world concept of love. It does not matter what color your skin is, or where you are from, we are all here on this planet together. The future is now and everyone must deal with the reality that love is void of color and geographics. It is a perplexing dilema for those that feel the love and difficult for those that see it from the outside. The Color of Love is  the bridge that will explore a universe toward understanding, a place of harmony, a place where love will conquer over injustice, a place where hopefully all will gain new insight toward a new one world philosophy of togetherness. Afterall, isn't that what we all desire, to be what we are and to be excepted as we are, no matter where we are from or what color our skin may be?</B>

Sometime we just like to look around and see everything around us, make our decisions, and then make our selections when we are ready. With our just looking around feature, you can take your time and see all the people you want, without feeling uncomfortable. Here you have two ways in which you can do this. You can either browse around in general at all the Healthy Relationships members, or you can look up a specific member by their Stealth Code. Which ever way you decide, you are going to have fun without feeling any pressure. If you are registered as a full member, or if you have registered for your special free trial guest pass, you will be able to enjoy the full benefits and features of Healthy Relationships. Some of which are the ability to send and receive email and fill out a profile for other members to see.<P>

  <p>
  <STRONG>Names</STRONG>: Leopards Bane, European Arnica<p>
  <STRONG>Habitat</STRONG>: Native to Europe, Siberia and North West N. America.<p>
  <STRONG>Collection</STRONG>: The flowers are collected between June and August.<p>
  <STRONG>Part Used</STRONG>: Flower heads.<P>
  <STRONG>Constituents</STRONG>: 
  <UL>
  <LI>Sesquiterpene lactones, including the pseudoguanolides arnifolin, the arnicolides, helenalin, and the recently isolated 6-0 isobutyryl-tetrahydrohelenalin and 2 b-ethoxy-6-0-isobutyryl-2, 3-dihydrohelenalin.
  <LI>Flavonoids such as eupafolin, patuletin, spinacetin and the less common aciniatin, and methylated flavonoids including betuletol and hispidulin.
  <LI>Volatile oil, containing thymol and various ethers of thymol.
  <LI>Mucilage and polysaccharides.
  <LI>Miscellaneous substances such as resins, bitters (arnicin), tannins, carotenes, etc.
  </UL><p>
  <STRONG>Actions</STRONG>: Anti-inflammatory, vulnerary.<p>
  <STRONG>Indications</STRONG>: While this herb should not be taken internally as it is potentially toxic, it provides us with one of the best remedies for external local healing and may be considered a specific when it comes to the treatment of  <STRONG>bruises </STRONG> and <STRONG>sprains.</STRONG>  The homeopathic preparation is entirely safe to take internally, especially when taken according to homeopathic directions.  The herb itself, used externally, will help in the relief of <STRONG>rheumatic pain,</STRONG> the pain and inflammation of <STRONG>phlebitis</STRONG> and similar conditions.  It may in fact be used wherever there is pain or inflammation on the skin, as long as the skin is not broken.  Arnica has been shown to be an immuno-stimulant, as both the sesquiterpene lactone helenalin and the polysaccharide fraction stimulate phagocytosis.  Sesquiterpene lactones are known to have anti-inflammatory activity and their biological effects appear to be mediated through immunological processes.  As helenalin is one of the most active, this might help account for the use of Arnica for pain and inflammation.  <EM>Ellingwood</EM> considered it specific for bruised, sore, lacerated and contused muscular structures.  In addition he recommends it for the following pathologies:<STRONG>Muscular soreness, pain, soreness of the breasts, severe injury, cold sores, abscesses.</STRONG>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Combinations</STRONG>: For a lotion it may be combined with distilled Witch Hazel.<p>
  <STRONG>Preparations & Dosage</STRONG> : You can prepare your own tincture of this herb as follows: pour 1/2 liter (one pint) of 70% alcohol over 50 grams (two ounces) of freshly picked flowers.  Seal it tightly in a clear glass container and let it stand for at least a week in the sun or in a warm place.  Filter it and it is ready for use.  To store it, put the tincture in a sealed container and keep it out of direct sunlight.

 <STRONG>Actions</STRONG>:Immunomodulator.<p>
 <STRONG>Indications</STRONG>: Used since ancient times in Traditional Chinese Medicine, it has become an important remedy in the west since its effects upon the immune system came to light.  As the power of immunological research is focussed on medicinal herbs a whole new array of effects are being discovered.  The polysaccharides in <EM>Astragalus</EM> have been shown to intensify phagocytosis of reticulo-endothelial systems, stimulate pituitary-adrenal cortical activity and restore depleted red blood cell formation in bone marrow.  <EM>Astragalus</EM> is also one of the herbs known to stimulate the body's natural production of interferon.  The therapeutic potential offered is very exciting.  For more details please refer to pages 3-285 to 3-292.  The conclusion being drawn by most western herbalists is that <EM>Astragalus</EM> is an ideal remedy for anyone who might be immuno-compromized in any way.  This can range from someone who easily catches colds to someone with cancer.
 <P>
 <STRONG>Preparations & Dosage</STRONG> : Decoction: put 1 teaspoonful of the root into a cup of water, bring to boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes. This should be drunk three times a day.  Tincture: take 2-4 ml of the tincture three times a day.

  <I>Melissa officinalis</I><BR>
  Labiatae
  <p>
  <U>Citations</U>
  <p>
  <STRONG>Names</STRONG>: Lemon Balm, Sweet Balm, Melissa<p>
  <STRONG>Habitat</STRONG>: A common plant in Britain, Europe, W. Asia and N. Africa.<p>
  <STRONG>Collection</STRONG>: The leaves may be harvested two or three times a year between June and September.  They are gathered by cutting off the young shoots when they are approximately 30cm (12 inches) long.  They should be dried in the shade at a temperature not above 35 degrees C.<p>
  <STRONG>Part Used</STRONG>: Dried aerial parts, or fresh in season.<P>
  <STRONG>Constituents</STRONG>: 
  <UL>
  <LI>Volitile oil, 0.1-0.2%, consisting mainly of citral a & b (=neral and geranial), with caryophyllene oxide, and in smaller quantities a whole range of terpenes such as linalool, citronellal, b-caryophyllene, nerol, geraniol, traces of eugenyl acetate, beta-ocimene, copaene and a-cubebene.
  <LI>Flavonoids in low concentrations; luteolin-7-glucoside and rhamnazin.
  <LI>Polyphenolics, including protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid & tannins.
  <LI>Triterpenic acids such as ursolic and pomolic acids.
  </UL><p>
  <STRONG>Actions</STRONG>: Carminative, nervine, anti-spasmocid, anti-depressive, diaphoretic, anti-microbial, hepatic.<p>
  <STRONG>Indications</STRONG>: Balm is an excellent carminative herb that relieves spasms in the digestive tract and is used in <STRONG>flatulent dyspepsia.</STRONG>  Because of its mild anti-depressive properties, it is primarily indicated where there is dyspepsia associated with <STRONG>anxiety</STRONG> or <STRONG>depression,</STRONG> as the gently sedative oils relieve <STRONG>tension</STRONG> and <STRONG>stress reactions,</STRONG> thus acting to lighten depression.  The volatile oil appears to act on the interface between the digestive tract and nervous system.  It has been described by some herbalists as being trophorestorative to the nervous system, similar in some ways to Oats.  It may be used in <STRONG>migraine</STRONG> that is associated with tension, <STRONG>neuralgia,</STRONG> anxiety induced <STRONG>palpitations, insomnia.</STRONG>  Balm has a tonic effect on the heart and circulatory system causing mild vaso-dilation of the peripheral vessels, thus acting to lower <STRONG>blood pressure.</STRONG>  It can be used in feverish conditions such as <STRONG>influenza.</STRONG>  Hot water extracts have anti-viral properties, possibly due in part to rosmarinic acid and other polyphenolics.  A lotion based extract may be used for skin lesions of  <STRONG>Herpes simplex,</STRONG> the anti-viral activity having been confirmed in both laboratory and clinical trials.  Its hormone regulating effects are well documented in the laboratory.  Freeze-dried aqueous extracts inhibit many of the effects of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) on the thyroid gland by interfering with the binding of TSH to plasma membranes and by inhibiting the enzyme iodothyronine de-iodinase in vitro.  It also inhibits the receptor binding and biological activity of immunoglobulins in the blood of patients with <STRONG>Graves disease,</STRONG> a condition which results in hyperthyroidism.<BR>
  According to <EM>Kings Dispensatory,</EM> Balm is moderately stimulant, diaphoretic, and antispasmodic.  A warm infusion, drunk freely, has been serviceable a diaphoretic in <STRONG>Febrile diseases</STRONG> and <STRONG>painful menstruation,</STRONG> and to assist the operation of other diaphoretic medicines; in combination with ipecacuanha and potassium nitrate, a valuable diaphoretic is formed.  It is also occasionally used to assist menstruation.  When given in fevers, it may be rendered more agreeable by the addition of lemon juice.  The infusion may be taken <EM>ad libitum.</EM>
  <P>
  <STRONG>Combinations</STRONG>:In digestive troubles it may be combined with Hops, Chamomile or Meadowsweet.  However, Hops is contra-indicated in depression.  For stress and tension it will combine with Lavender and Linden.<p>
  <STRONG>Preparations & Dosage</STRONG> : Infusion: pour a cup of boiling water onto 2-3 teaspoonfuls of the dried herb or 4-6 fresh leaves and leave to infuse for 10-15 minutes, well covered until drunk.  A cup of this tea should be taken in the morning and the evening, or when needed.<br>
  Tincture: take 2-6 ml of the tincture three times a day.

Black Catechu

Acacia catechu
Leguminosae

Names : Cutch, Dark Catechu.

Habitat : India and Burma.

Part Used :Extract from leaves and young shoots.

Constituents :  o Tannins, catechin, phlobatannins  including catechutanninc
acid    
                o Flavonoids including quercitin, quercetrin, fisetin   
                o Miscellaneous; gums and resins, pigments.

Actions : Astringent.

Indications : The powerful astringent may be used in chronic diarrhoea,
dysentery and chronic catarrh. Useful for arresting excessive mucous
discharges and checking haemorrhages, it is also recommended as a local
application for sore mouths and gums. Some research has shown Acacia catachu
to be hypotensive in vivo and in vitro; its mechanism of action is thought
to be bradykinin related and due to vasodilatation. In practice, however,
there are many effective hypotensives that do not have the potential problem
of constipation.

        Also described as: Catechu possesses strong astringent properties. It is
used for arresting mucous discharges when excessive, for removing relaxation
or congestion of mucous membranes and for checking haemorrhages. In chronic
diarrhoea, chronic catarrh, colliquative diarrhoea & chronic dysentery it
has proved beneficial, especially when combined with opium. As a local
application, it is a valuable agent for removing cynanche tonsillaris,
aphthous ulcerations of the mouth, elongation of the uvula and relaxation
and congestion of the mucous membrane of the fauces, especially of the kind
to which public singers are subject; it is also useful in congestion,
tenderness and sponginess of the gums, particularly when the result of
mercurial ptyalism. The tincture of Catechu is often beneficial in fissure
of the nipples, when applied twice a day with a fine hair pencil. An
ointment composed of 4 ounces of Catechu, 9 drachms of alum, 4 ounces of
white resin and 10 fluid ounces of olive oil, with a sufficient quantity of
water, is in great repute in India as an application to ulcers. Chronic and
phagedenic ulcers are frequently benefited by the application of Catechu to
them. Chronic gonorrhoea, old gleets and fluor albus, as well as haemorrhage
from the nose and other parts, have been cured by the local application of
an aqueous solution of Catechu. Powdered Catechu may be given in a dose of
from 5 to 20 grains, or more, repeated as often as required; it may be
administered in pill form, in syrup, or in gum mucilage. The dose of the
tincture is from 20 minims to 1/2 fluid ounce. 

Preparations & Dosage : An infusion may be made with 0.3 - 2 g of the dried
herb. The tincture is 1:5 in 45% alcohol at a dose of between 2.5-5 ml.

Black Cohosh

Cimicifuga racemosa
Ranunculaceae

Names : Black Snakeroot, Bugbane, Rattleroot, Rattleweed, Squawroot.

Habitat : USA and Canada.

Collection : The roots are unearthed with the rhizome in autumn after the
fruits have ripened. They should be cut lengthwise and dried carefully.

Part Used : Root and rhizome; dried, not fresh.

Constituents :  o Triterpene glycosides, including actein, cimigoside,
cimifugine (=macrotin)racemoside   
                o Isoflavones such as formononetin   
                o Isoferulic acid    
                o Miscellaneous; volatile oil, tannin.

Actions : Emmenagogue, anti-spasmodic, alterative, nervine, hypotensive.

Indications : Black Cohosh is a most valuable herb that has a powerful
action as a relaxant and a normalizer of the female reproductive system. It
may be used beneficially in cases of painful or delayed menstruation.
Ovarian cramps or cramping pain in the womb will be relieved by Black
Cohosh. It is very active in the treatment of rheumatic pains, but also in
rheumatoid arthritis, osteo-arthritis, in muscular and neurological pain. It
finds use in sciatica and neuralgia. As a relaxing nervine it may be used in
many situations where such an agent is needed. It has been found beneficial
in cases of tinnitus. Quoting from Kings American Dispensatory:

Kings This is a very active, powerful, and useful remedy, and appears to
fulfil a great number of indications. It possesses an undoubted influence
over the nervous system. In small doses the appetite and digestion are
improved, and larger amounts augment the secretions of the gastro-intestinal
tract. Excretions from the skin and kldneys are increased by it, the
peculiar earthy odor of the drug being imparted to the urine; the secretions
of the bronchial mucous surfaces are also augmented under its
administration. The heart-beat is slowed and given increased power by it,
while arterial tension is elevated.  

        Upon the reproductive organs it exerts a specific influence, promoting the
menstrual discharge, and by its power of increasing contractility of the
unstriped fibres of the uterus, it acts as an efficient parturient. The
venereal propensity in man is said to be stimulated by Cimicifuga.
        Few of our remedies have acquired as great a reputation in the treatment of
rheumatism and neuralgia. Indeed, few cases of rheumatism, or conditions
depending upon a rheumatic basis, will present, which will not be influenced
for the better by Cimicifuga. Rheumatism of the heart, diaphragm, psoas
muscles, lumbago stiff neck in fact all cases characterized by that kind of
pain known as "rheumatic" dull, tensive intermittent, as if dependent upon a
contracted state of muscular fibre, soreness in muscular tissue, especially
over the abdomen and in the extensor and flexor muscles of the extremities,
all yield readily to it. 

        Muscular pain of a rheumatoid character, when not amounting to a true
rheumatic attack, and other rheumatoid pains when acute and not of spinal
origin such as gastralgia, enteralgia, tenesmic vesical pains, pleurodynia,
pain in the mediastina orbits or ears, are relieved by Cimicifuga. In
diseases of the ear the drug is indicated when the condition is aggravated
by rheumatic association, or in neuralgia of the parts with stiffness in the
faucial and pharyngeal muscles. In eye strain, giving rise to headache, and
associated with a sensation of stiffness in the ocular muscles, or a bruised
feeling in the muscles of the frontal region, it will give marked benefit.
In doses of 1 fluid drachm of the tincture, repeated every hour, it has
effected thorough cures of acute conjunctivitis, without the aid of any

local application.  

        Cimicifuga plays a very important part in the therapeutics of gynaecology.
It is a remedy for atony of the reproductive tract. In the painful
conditions incident to imperfect menstruation, its remedial action is fully
displayed. By its special affinity for the female reproductive organs, it is
an efficient agent for the restoratlon of suppressed menses. It is even a
better remedy in that variety of amenorrhoea termed absentio mesium. In
dysmenorrhoea it is surpassed by no other drug, being of greatest utility in
irritative and congestive conditions of the uterus and appendages,
characterized by tensive, dragging pains, resembling the pains of
rheumatism. If the patient be despondent and chilly, combine Cimicifuga with
Pulsatilla, especially in anemic subjects. It is a good remedy for the
reflex side-aches of the unmarred woman; also for mastitis and mastodynia.
It should be remembered in rheumatism of the uterus, and in uterine
leucorrhoea, with a flabby condition of the viscus, its effects are decided.
When there is a disordered action or lack of functional power in the uterus,
giving rise to sterility, Cimicifuga often corrects the impaired condition
and cures. Reflex mammary pains during gestation are met by it, and in
rheumatic subjects it promptly relieves such ovarian troubles as ovaralgia
and neuralgia, the pain being of an aching character. Orchialgia and aching
sensations of the prostate are conditions calling for Cimicifuga , and as a
tonic it is not without good effects in spermatorrhoea.

        Cimicifuga has proved a better agent in obstetrical practice than ergot. It
produces natural intermittent uterine contractions, whereas ergot produces
constant contractions, thereby endangering the life of the child, or rupture
of the uterus. Where the pains are inefficient, feeble, or irregular,
Cimicifuga will stimulate to normal action. It is an excellent partus
praeparator if given for several weeks before confinement. It is a
diagnostic agent to differentiate between spurious and true labor pains, the
latter being increased, while the former are dissipated under its use. It is
the best and safest agent known for the relief of after-pains, and is
effectual in allaying the general excitement of the nervous system after labor.

        Cimicifuga exerts, a powerful influence over the nervous system, and has
long been favorably known as a remedy for chorea. It may be used alone or
with Valeriana, equal parts. It is, particularly useful here when associated
with amenorrhoea, or when the menstrual function fails to act for the first
time. Its action is slow, but its effects, are permanent. It has been used
successfully as an antispasmodlc in hysteria, epilepsy when due to menstrual
failures, asthma and kindred affections, periodical convulsions, nervous
excitability, pertussis, delirium tremens and many other spasmodic affections.

        For headache, whether congestive or from cold, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, or
from la grippe, it is promptly curative. As a palliative agent in phthisis
pulmonalis, good results are obtained, in that it lessens cough, soothes the
pain, especially the aching under the scapulae, lessens secretions and
allays nervous irritability. Fevers, intermittant and remittent have been
benefited by it; well-marked antiperiodic and tonic virtues having been
observed in the drug. In the exanthemata, it is a valuable agent,
controlling pain, especially the terrible bone aches of smallpox, rendering
the disease much milder. In scarlatina and measles, it relieves the headache
and the backache preceding the eruptions. It is stated that it has been used
in the south with some success as a prophylactic against variola. Cimicifuga
exerts a tonic influence over both the serous and mucous tissues of the
system, and will be found a superior remedy in the majority of chronic
diseases of these parts. In all cases where acidity of the stomach is
present, this should first be removed, or some mild alkaline preparation be
administered in conjunction with the remedy, before any beneficial change
will ensue. As a remedy for pain, Cimicifuga is a very prompt agent, often
relieving in a few hours, painful conditions that have existed for a long time

        The saturated tincture of the root is recommended as a valuable embrocation
in all cases where a stimulant, tonic, anodyne, and alterative combined is
required, as in all cases of inflammation of the nerves, tic-dolloureux,
periodic cephalic pain, inflammation of the spine, ovarian inflammation,
spasms of the broad ligaments, rheumatism, crick in the back or side,
inflammation of the eyes, old ulcers, etc.  Preparations of Cimicifuga, to
be of any medicinal value, must be prepared from recently dried roots. 

Preparations & Dosage : Decoction: pour a cup of water onto l/2-l
teaspoonfuls of the dried root and bring to boil. Let it simmer for l0-l5
minutes. This should be drunk three times a day.
        
Tincture: take 2-4 ml of the tincture three times a day.
As a partus accelerator, it may be substituted for, and should be preferred
to, ergot; 1/2 drachm of the powdered root may be given in warm water every
15 or 20 minutes, until the expulsive action of the uterus is induced, and
which it seldom fails to bring on speedily and powerfully. In acute
troubles, as acute muscular rheumatism, and in false pains, and as an
oxytocic, Webster prefers the strong decoction of the recent root in
tablespoonful doses. The fluid extract of black cohosh may be used in all
cases where the article is indicated; its dose is from 1/2 fluid drachm to 2
fluid drachms. The ordinary dose for its specific effects is a teaspoonful
of a mixture of from 10 drops to 1 drachm of Cimicifuga tincture in 4 ounces
of water, the larger or smaller dose being determined by the condition of
the patient.

Black Haw

Viburnum prunifolium
Caprifoliaceae

Names : Stagbush, American Sloe.

Habitat : Eastern and Central USA.

Collection : The bark from the roots and the trunk is collected in the
autumn. The shrubs should be dug out and the bark stripped from roots and
trunk. The bark from branches should be collected in spring and summer. In
both cases the bark should be dried in the shade.

Part Used : Dried bark of root, stem or trunk.

Constituents :  o Coumarins, including scopoletin   
                o Salicin   
                o l-Methyl-2,3-dibutyl hemimellitate    
                o Miscellaneous; viburnin, plant acids, volatile oil, tannin.

Actions : Anti-spasmodic, nervine, hypotensive, astringent.

Indications : Black Haw has a very similar use to Cramp Bark, to which it is
closely related. It is a powerful relaxant of the uterus and is used for
dysmenorrhoea, false labour pains as well as in threatened miscarriage. Its
relaxant and sedative actions explain its power in reducing blood pressure
in hypertension, which happens through a relaxation of the peripheral blood
vessels. It may be used as an anti-spasmodic in the treatment of asthma.

Also described as an herb that has a decided affinity for the female
reproductive organs is well established. Decoctions of the drug were
formerly used as a gargle in apthae, as a wash in indolent ulcers, and in
various ophthalmic disorders. By its astringency it has proved of value in
diarrhoea and dysentery. It has been recommended in jaundice, but we have a
better agent in Chionanthus. Palpitation of the heart is said to have been
relieved by it. Its principal use at the present day is in disorders of the
female organs of reproduction. As a uterine tonic it is unquestionably of
great utility. In the hyperasthetic, or irritable condition of the uterus
incident to highly nervous women, or as the result of overwork, it will be
found an admirable agent. In dysmenorrhoea, with deficient menses, uterine
colic, and in those cases where there are severe lumbar and bearing-down
pains, it will prove an efficient drug. It is specifically indicated in
cramp-like menstrual pains, pains decidedly expulsive and intermittent in
character and in the various painful contractions of the pelvic muscles, so
common to disorders of women. Uterine congestion and chronic uterine
inflammation are often greatly relieved by Black Haw. It acts promptly in
spasmodic dysmenorrhoea. especially with excessive flow. It is a good remedy
for uterine hemorrhage attending the menopause. In amenorrhoea in pale,
bloodless subjects, the menses are restored by it. Cramps of limbs attending
pregnancy yield to both black haw and cramp bark. It is considered almost
specific for cramp in the legs, not dependent on pregnancy, especially when
occurring at night. The condition for which black haw is most valued is that
of threatened abortion. It is the most prompt drug in the materia medica to
check abortion, provided the membranes have not ruptured. In all cases of
habitual abortion it should be given in small doses for a considerable
length of time. The abundant testimony as to its value in this condition
alone gives it a high place among drugs. By its quieting effects upon the
irritable womb, women who have previously been unable to go to full term
have been aided by this drug to pass through the pregnancy without mishaps
which would otherwise have proven disastrous to both child and mother. It
has been used to control postpartum haemorrhage, but is less effective than
ergot and cinnamon. It assists in reducing the size of the womb in
subinvolution of that organ. Viburnum is of some value in nervous disorders,
and has been advised in chorea, hysteria, hystero-epilepsy, petit mal, and
paralysis agitans. It is of service only when these troubles are associated
with menstrual wrongs. Viburnum opulus resembles this agent very closely in
its effects, and may be used in the above-named conditions, for which the
black haw is useful.

Specific Indications and Uses - Uterine irritability and hyperasthesia;
threatened abortion; uterine colic; dysmenorrhoea with deficient menses;
severe lumbar and bearing-down pains; cramp-like, expulsive menstrual pain;
intermittent, painful contractions of the pelvic tissues; after-pains and
false pains of pregnancy; obstinate hiccough.

Preparations & Dosage : Decoction: put 2 teaspoonfuls of the dried bark in a
cup of water, bring to the boil and simmer for l0 minutes. This should be
drunk three times a day. 

      Tincture: take 5-l0 ml of the tincture three times a day.

Boneset
 
Eupatorium perfoliatum
Compositae

Names : Feverwort

Habitat : N. America

Collection : Boneset should be collected as soon as the flowers open in
August or September.

Part Used : Dried aerial parts

Constituents :  o Sesquiterpene lactones ; eupafolin, euperfolitin,
eufoliatin, eufoliatorin, euperfolide, eucannabinolide and helenalin.
                o Immunostimulatory polysaccharides, mainly
4-0-methylglucuroxylans
                o Flavonoids; quercitin, kaempferol, hyperoside, astragalin,
rutin, eupatorin & others.
                o Miscellaneous: diterpenes - dendroidinic acid, hebenolide;
sterols; volatile oil.

Actions : Diaphoretic, bitter, laxative, tonic, anti-spasmodic, carminative,
astringent.

Indications : Boneset is one the best remedies for the relief of the
associated symptoms that accompany influenza. It will speedily relieve the
aches and pains as well as aid the body in dealing with any fever that is
present. Boneset may also be used to help clear the upper respiratory tract
of mucous congestion. Its mild aperient activity will ease constipation. It
may safely be used in any fever and also as a general cleansing agent. It
may provide symptomatic aid in the treatment of muscular rheumatism.      

        It is also known as a stimulating, tonic and antispasmodic diaphoretic;
indicated for influenzal epidemics and febrile conditions arising in marshy
districts. Acts upon the gastro-hepatic organs and promotes secretion and
excretion of bile. They give the following specific indications: Influenzal
colds & fevers with night sweats and aching bones. Pulmonary
inflammation/catarrh with cough and chest soreness. Post-influenzal gastric
irritation with biliousness and constipation. Skin diseases & eruptive
fevers of hepatic origin.

        An interesting quote from Kings American Dispensatory: As a tonic, it is
useful in remittent, intermittent, and typhoid fevers, dyspepsia, and
general debility. In intermittent fever, a strong infusion, as hot as can be
comfortably swallowed, is administered for the purpose of vomiting freely.
This is also attended with profuse diaphoresis, and sooner or later by an
evacuation of the bowels. During the intermission, the cold infusion or
extract is given every hour as a tonic and antiperiodic. The chill and
succeeding fever is slight, the skin dry, and not,as a rule, followed by
perspiration; there are pains in the bones, praecordial oppression, and
great thirst. If, however, the case is one in which the fever lasts all day,
a slight sweating may follow at night. Another indication in ague is
vomiting, especially of much bile. Eupatorium given as above, or sometimes
in small doses, may relieve headache of intermittant character when the
intermissions are irregular. In epidemic influenza the warm infusion is
valuable as an emetic and diaphoretic, likewise in febrile diseases,
catarrh, colds, with hoarseness and pleuritic pains, and wherever such
effects are indicated. In infuenza it relieves the pain in the limbs and
back. Its popular name boneset is derived from its well-known property of
relieving the deep seated pains in the limbs which accompany this disorder,
and colds and rheumatism. often this pain is periosteal, and if neuralgic in
character, or due to a febrile condition, Eupatorium will relieve it. But it
is not a remedy for periosteal pain due to inflammation or to organic
changes in the periosteum. On the other hand, when given until the patient
sweats, and then continued in 5-drop doses of specific eupatorium it has
relieved the severe nocturnal muscular and "bone pains" of syphilis. It is a
remedy for the cough of the aged, that cough in which there is an abundance
of secretion, but lack of power to expectorate. The cough of measles, common
colds, of asthma, and hoarseness are also relieved by it. Unless given in
excess it acts as a good tonic to the gastric functions, increasing the
appetite and power of digestion. The stomach disorders of the inebriate are,
in a measure corrected by the use of small, tonic doses of Eupatorium. 

Combinations : In the treatment of influenza it may be combined with Yarrow,
Elder Flowers, Cayenne or Ginger. With Pleurisy Root and Elecampane in
bronchial conditions.

Preparations & Dosage : Infusion: pour a cup of boiling water onto l-2
teaspoonfuls of the dried herb and leave to infuse for l0-l5 minutes. This
should be drunk as hot as possible. During fevers or the flu it should be
drunk every half hour. Tincture: take 2-4ml of the tincture three times a day.

Borage

Borago officinalis
Boraginaceae

Habitat : Indigenous to Great Britain, Europe, and North Africa, naturalized
in North America.

that will aid this gland with the stress it is exposed to, both externally
and internally. Borage may be used as a tonic for the adrenals over a period
of time. It may be used during fevers and especially during convalescence.
It has a reputation as an anti-inflammatory herb used in conditions such as
pleurisy. The leaves and seeds stimulate the flow or milk in nursing
mothers. Borage contains potassium and calcium.

Preparations & Dosage : Infusion: pour a cup of boiling water onto 2
teaspoonfuls of the dried herb and leave to infuse for l0-l5 minutes. This
should be drunk three times a day. Tincture: take l-4ml of the tincture

dihydro-lupanine and various derivatives.
                o Phenethylamines such as tyramine, hydroxytyramine, epinine and
salsolidine.
                o Isoflavone glycosides including genistein, 3-0-methylorobol,
7-glucosyl-3-0-methylorobol, scoparin and sarothamnoside.

seeds contain lectins (phytohaemagglutinins).

Actions : Cardioactive diuretic, hypertensive, peripheral vasoconstrictor,
astringent.

Indications :  Broom is a valuable remedy where there is a weak heart and
low blood pressure. Since it is also a diuretic and produces peripheral
constriction of the blood vessels while increasing the efficiency of each

Bugleweed

Lycopus europaeus
Labiatae

Names : Sweet Bugle, Water Bugle, Gypsywort.

Habitat : Eastern USA- L. virginicus. Europe-L. europaeus.

Collection : It should be collected just before the buds open.

Part Used :  Aerial parts.

Constituents :       o Phenolic acid derivatives; caffeic, rosmarinic,
chlorogenic and ellagic acids.

                     o Pimaric acid methyl ester .

Actions : Diuretic, peripheral vasoconstrictor, astringent, nervine,
anti-tussive.

Indications : Bugleweed is a specific for over-active thyroid glands,
especially where the symptoms include tightness of breathing, palpitation
and shaking. It may safely be used where palpitations occur that are of
nervous origin. Bugleweed will aid the weak heart where there is associated
build-up of water in the body. As a sedative cough reliever it will ease
irritating coughs, especially when they are of nervous origin.

         Lycopus fills an important place in Eclectic therapeutics. Its action is
chiefly exhibited on the vascular structures and the sympathetic nervous
system. It is a certain sedative, mild narcotic, subastringent and tonic.
Its sedative action is most pronounced and most frequently indicated where
the vascular action is tumultuous, the velocity of the pulse rapid, with
evident want of cardiac power. It is for this purpose that it is principally
employed in advanced stages of acute disease with great debility, and in
chronic disease with frequent pulse. It improves the circulation and its
good influence is extended to all the parts under the control of the
vegetative system of nerves. As a sedative, many class it with aconite and
veratrum.  It acts somewhat like digitalis in reducing the velocity of the
pulse, but is devoid of the dangerous effects resulting from the use of that
drug, and hence has proved useful in some cardiac affection. It controls
excessive vascular excitement, general irritability and diminishes exalted
organic action. Upon the stomach its action is kindly, improving the
appetite and serving as a mild gastric tonic. Normal secretion is
established by it and blood-making and nutrition are improve.

        Also known for its Specific Symptomology thus - In diseases of the heart,
either functional or organic, marked by irritability and irregularity of the
organ, dyspnoea, feeling of oppression in the cardiac region, its
administration is followed by gratifying results. Hypertrophy and dilatation
have been known to undergo marked diminution in consequence of its
administration. Therapeutic uses - It possesses tonic, sedative, astringent
and narcotic properties and has been successfully used in incipient
phthisis, haemoptysis, etc. It act like digitalis in reducing the velocity
of the pulse, but has no cumulative effects. In pericarditis and
endocarditis its sedative action lessens the frequency of the pulse,
irritability and its attendant inflammation, in a manner equaled by no other
remedy. Exopthalmic goitre. In diseases of the respiratory apparatus lycopus
has been found to be very useful. Haemoptysis, associated with rapid and
tumultuous hearts action, yields readily to its influence, as does
hemorrhage from any part. Some laud lycopus highly for its efficiency when
used in cases of incipient phthisis and in chronic inflammatory diseases of
the lungs. by regulating the hearts action and equalizing the circulation in
the lungs it mitigates or arrests the local inflammation.

Combinations :  Bugleweed may be used with nervines such as Skullcap or
Valerian. 

Preparations & Dosage :  Infusion: pour a cup of boiling water onto 1
teaspoonful of the dried herb and let infuse for 10-15 minutes. This should
be drunk three times a day.

        Tincture: take 1-2 ml of the tincture three times a day.

Myrica cerifera
Myricaceae


Names : Candleberry, Waxberry, Wax Myrtle.

Habitat : Native to the USA but widely cultivated in Europe and the British
Isles.

Collection : Thee root should be unearthed in spring or autumn and its bark
pared off and dried.

Part Used : Bark of root

Constituents :  o Triterpenes, including taraxerol, taraxerone and myricadiol 
                o Flavonoids such as myricitrin 
                o Miscellaneous tannins, phenols, resins and gums

Actions : Astringent, circulatory stimulant, diaphoretic.

Indications : As a circulatory stimulant, Bayberry plays a role in many
conditions when they are approached in a holistic way. Due to its specific
actions it is a valuable astringent in diarrhoea and dysentery. It is
indicated in mucous colitis. As a gargle it helps sore throats and as a
douche it helps in leucorrhoea. It may be used in the treatment of colds.

       It is also known as a Positive diffusive stimulant - arouses
circulation and eliminative organs. It is for heavy catarrhal states of
mucous membranes, removing thick and viscid secretions from the G-I tract.
It has a positive influence upon the uterus and the venous system. Here are
the following specific indications : colds and acute febrile conditions,
prolapsed uterus, leucorrhoea, atonic vaginitis, nasal polypi.

      Also considered a specific  stimulating astringent indicated where
ever there is excessive mucous discharge. For atonic or persistent diarrhoea
and locally for bleeding gums. In addition it is used for the following
pathologies : dysentery, stomatitis, nasal catarrh, measles and scarlet
fever, convulsions, jaundice.

It is also described as an astringent and stimulant, and as such is valuable
in debilitated conditions of the mucous membranes; in higher doses, it is
apt to occasion emesis. It was largely employed by the followers of Samuel
Thomson, in catarrhal states of the alimentary tract. The bark has been
successfully employed in scrofula, jaundice, diarrhea, dysentery, aphthae,
and other diseases where astringent stimulants were indicated. Specific
Myrica, in small doses (2 to 5 drops) will be found a good stimulant to the
vegetative system of nerves, aiding the processes of digestion, blood making
and nutrition. In larger doses (5 to 20 drops) it is a decided gastric
stimulant. In small doses it has been found advantageous in chronic
gastritis, chronic catarrhal diarrhoea, gastro-enteritis and in dysentery
having a typhoid character. It is said to restore arrested lochia
discharges. Cases calling for myrica show feeble venous action, while the
pulse is full and oppressed. It is not adapted to acute disorders of the
alimentary tract, as a rule. A weak infusion used as an injection, is an
admirable remedy in amenorrhea and atonic leucorrhoea.  In scarlatina in the
latter stages,when the tissues are swollen and enfeebled it may be used both
for its antiseptic and stimulating effects.The powdered bark, combined with
bloodroot, forms an excellent application to indolent ulcers, and has
likewise been employed as a snuff for the cure of some forms of nasal
polyps. In the form of poultice, with elm or alone, it is a valuable
application to scrophula tumours or ulcers. The decoction is beneficial as a
gargle in sore mouth and throat, and is of service in injection, in
leucorrhea and fistula, and also as a wash for ulcers, tinea capitis, etc.
It also forms an excellent gum wash for tender, spongy, and bleeding gums.
The leaves are reputed astringent, and useful in scurvy and spasmodic
affections.

Combinations : As a digestive astringent it may be used with Comfrey Root
and Agrimony. For colds and fevers combine with diaphoretics such as
Pleurisy Root.
Preparations & Dosage : Decoction: put l teaspoonful of the bark into a cup
of cold water and bring to the boil. Leave for l0-l5 minutes. This should be
drunk three times a day. Tincture: take l-2 ml of the tincture three times a
day.

<B>On the Teen Scene: Eating Disorders Require Medical Attention</B><P>

by Dixie Farley<P>

<B>This article is part of a series with important health information for teenagers.</B><P>

For reasons that are unclear, some people--mainly young women--develop potentially life-threatening eating disorders called bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. People with bulimia, known as bulimics, indulge in bingeing (episodes of eating large amounts of food) and purging (getting rid of the food by vomiting or using laxatives). People with anorexia, whom doctors sometimes call anorectics, severely limit their food intake. About half of them also have bulimia symptoms.<P>

The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that 7,000 bulimia cases and 7,000 anorexia cases were diagnosed in 1993, the latest year for which statistics are available. Studies indicate that by their first year of college, 4.5 to 18 percent of women and 0.4 percent of men have a history of bulimia and that as many as 1 in 100 females between the ages of 12 and 18 have anorexia.<P>

Males account for only 5 to 10 percent of bulimia and anorexia cases. While people of all races develop the disorders, the vast majority of those diagnosed are white.<P>

Most people find it difficult to stop their bulimic or anorectic behavior without professional help. If untreated, the disorders may become chronic and lead to severe health problems, even death. The National Center for Health Statistics reports 62 deaths from anorexia and two deaths from bulimia in 1992, the latest year for which it has figures.<P>

As to the causes of bulimia and anorexia, there are many theories. One is that some young women feel abnormally pressured to be as thin as the "ideal" portrayed by magazines, movies and television. Another is that defects in key chemical messengers in the brain may contribute to the disorders' development or persistence.<P>

<B>The Bulimia Secret</B><P>

Once people begin bingeing and purging, usually in conjunction with a diet, the cycle easily gets out of control. While cases tend to develop during the teens or early 20s, many bulimics successfully hide their symptoms, thereby delaying help until they reach their 30s or 40s. Several years ago, actress Jane Fonda revealed she had been a secret bulimic from age 12 until her recovery at 35. She told of bingeing and purging up to 20 times a day.<P>

Many people with bulimia maintain a nearly normal weight. Though they appear healthy and successful--"perfectionists" at whatever they do--in reality, they have low self-esteem and are often depressed. They may exhibit other compulsive behaviors. For example, one physician reports that a third of his bulimia patients regularly engage in shoplifting and that a quarter of the patients have suffered from alcohol abuse or addiction at some point in their lives.<P>

While normal food intake for a teenager is 2,000 to 3,000 calories in a day, bulimic binges average about 3,400 calories in 1 1/4 hours, according to one study. Some bulimics consume up to 20,000 calories in binges lasting as long as eight hours. Some spend $50 or more a day on food and may resort to stealing food or money to support their obsession.<P>

To lose the weight gained during a binge, bulimics begin purging by vomiting (by self-induced gagging or with an emetic, a substance that causes vomiting) or by using laxatives (50 to 100 tablets at a time), diuretics (drugs that increase urination), or enemas. Between binges, they may fast or exercise excessively.<P>

Extreme purging rapidly upsets the body's balance of sodium, potassium, and other chemicals. This can cause fatigue, seizures, irregular heartbeat, and thinner bones. Repeated vomiting can damage the stomach and esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach), make the gums recede, and erode tooth enamel. (Some patients need all their teeth pulled prematurely). Other effects include various skin rashes, broken blood vessels in the face, and irregular menstrual cycles.<P>

<B>Complexities of Anorexia</B>

While anorexia most commonly begins in the teens, it can start at any age and has been reported from age 5 to 60. Incidence among 8- to 11-year-olds is said to be increasing.<P>

Anorexia may be a single, limited episode with large weight loss within a few months followed by recovery. Or it may develop gradually and persist for years. The illness may go back and forth between getting better and getting worse. Or it may steadily get more severe.<P>

Anorectics may exercise excessively. Their preoccupation with food usually prompts habits such as moving food about on the plate and cutting it into tiny pieces to prolong eating, and not eating with the family.<P>

Obsessed with weight loss and fear of becoming fat, anorectics see normal folds of flesh as "fat" that must be eliminated. When the normal fat padding is lost, sitting or lying down brings discomfort not rest, making sleep difficult. As the disorder continues, victims may become isolated and withdraw from friends and family.<P>

The body responds to starvation by slowing or stopping certain bodily processes. Blood pressure falls, breathing rate slows, menstruation ceases (or, in girls in their early teens, never begins), and activity of the thyroid gland (which regulates growth) diminishes. Skin becomes dry, and hair and nails become brittle. Lightheadedness, cold intolerance, constipation, and joint swelling are other symptoms. Reduced fat causes the body temperature to fall. Soft hair called lanugo forms on the skin for warmth. Body chemicals may get so imbalanced that heart failure occurs.<P>

Anorectics who additionally binge and purge impair their health even further. The late recording artist Karen Carpenter, an anorectic who used syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, died after buildup of the drug irreversibly damaged her heart.<P>

<B>Getting Help</B><P>

<B>Early treatment is vital. As either disorder becomes more entrenched, its damage becomes less reversible.</B><P>

Usually, the family is asked to help in the treatment, which may include psychotherapy, nutrition counseling, behavior modification, and self-help groups. Therapy often lasts a year or more--on an outpatient basis unless life-threatening physical symptoms or severe psychological problems require hospitalization. If there is deterioration or no response to therapy, the patient (or parent or other advocate) may want to talk to the health professional about the plan of treatment.<P>

<B>There are no drugs approved specifically for bulimia or anorexia, but several, including some antidepressants, are being investigated for this use.</B><P>

If you think a friend or family member has bulimia or anorexia, point out in a caring, nonjudgmental way the behavior you have observed and encourage the person to get medical help. If you think you have bulimia or anorexia, remember that you are not alone and that this is a health problem that requires professional help. As a first step, talk to your parents, family doctor, religious counselor, or school counselor or nurse.<P>

                                 <B> Disorders' Definitions</B><P>

According to the American Psychiatric Association, a person diagnosed as bulimic or anorectic must have all of that disorder's specific symptoms:<P>

<B>Bulimia Nervosa</B><P>

Recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months) a feeling of lack of control over eating during the binges regular use of one or more of the following to prevent weight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or diuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise persistent over-concern with body shape and weight. <P>

<B>Anorexia Nervosa</B><P>

Refusal to maintain weight that's over the lowest weight considered normal for age and height intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight distorted body image in women, three consecutive missed menstrual periods without pregnancy. <P>
