<BODY><H1>HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE</H1> 
<P>The majority of high-level radioactive waste is the fuel from the
hot core of commercial nuclear power plants. This irradiated fuel is the
most intensely radioactive material on the planet, and gives a lethal
dose of radiation if unshielded. It accounts for 95% of the
radioactivity generated in the last 50 years from all sources, including
nuclear weapons production. Uranium is processed into fuel rods and
loaded into nuclear power reactors where it undergoes the nuclear
fission reaction. After several years, when removed from the reactor
core, the fuel is about 1 million times more radioactive than when it
was loaded. This irradiated fuel is currently stored in water pools at
the reactor site.
</P><P>The increase in radioactivity is due to the formation of
intensely radioactive elements known as fission products, such as cesium
and strontium, resulting from the physical splitting of uranium-235
atoms. Heavier elements known as transuranics are also formed, including
plutonium. Each 1000 megawatt nuclear power plant produces about 500
pounds of plutonium a year, and about 30 metric tons of high-level
waste.
</P><H1>HALF-LIFE AND HAZARDOUS LIFE</H1> 
<P>The half-life of a radioactive element is the amount of time it
takes for one-half of the quantity of that element to decay-either to a
stable form, or to another radioactive element in a &quot;decay chain.&quot;
After ten half-lives, one thousandth of the original concentration is
left; after 20 half lives, one millionth. Generally 10--20 half lives is
called the hazardous life of the waste. Example: Plutonium-239 which is
in irradiated fuel, has a half-life of 24,400 years. It is dangerous for
a quarter million years, or 12,000 human generations. As it decays,
uranium-235 is generated; half-life:
</P><P>710,000 years. Thus the hazard of irradiated fuel will continue
for millions of years. This material must be isolated from contaminating
or irradiating living things for this long.
</P><H1>WASTE CLASSIFICATION</H1> 
<P>Radioactive waste classification in the U.S. is misleading and needs
reassessment. The regulatory definition of high-level radioactive waste
includes only irradiated fuel and the liquid and sludge from
reprocessing fuel to recover plutonium (including solids resulting from
stabilization of reprocessing wastes). Reprocessing of commercial fuel
proved not to be economical or technically feasible in the U.S.. There
are components and other wastes from nuclear reactors that become
intensely radioactive, can deliver a lethal dose, and yet are regulated
separately as &quot;low-level&quot; waste.
</P><H2>VOLUME vs RADIOACTIVITY</H2> 
<P>Irradiated fuel makes up only about 1% of the total volume of all
radioactive wastes generated in the U.S., but it contains about 95% of
the radioactivity. As of 1994 there was a cumulative total of 29,700
metric tons of irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear power generation
in the United States, nearly all of it at the reactor sites. This fuel
contained approximately 25,000,000,000 curies of radioactivity.
</P><P><B>A curie is a large unit: 2,224,000,000,000 </B>(over 2
trillion) radioactive emissions, or 'counts' per minute. Natural
radiation measured with a simple Geiger counter is typically between 2
and 20 counts per minute. Each of these emissions has the potential to
initiate a cancer.
</P><P>Some of the radioactive elements decay quickly, but even after
1000 years, there will be 1,752 curies in each ton of irradiated fuel.
</P><H1>CURRENT WASTE STORAGE</H1> 
<P>On-reactor-site fuel pools hold the cumulative total of high-level
waste that has been generated by the reactor since starting operations.
Fuel pools were not designed for more than temporary storage. Many
utilities have consolidated the storage racks to hold the irradiated
fuel more densely. There are many hazards associated with fuel pools,
including the potential for loss of coolant which could result in
spontaneous combustion of the fuel, or in some circumstances, nuclear
meltdown of the pool.
</P><P>To date, all plans for off-site storage of this material have
failed. Eight reactors nationally have reached pool capacity and
installed on-site dry cask storage. These concrete and metal containers
had no full-scale testing prior to their first installation, and have
been in place only a few years. The useful life of a dry cask is
measured in decades, not millennia, so these are not long-term
&quot;solutions&quot; to high-level waste. Dry cask installation
substantially changes the land-use of the site. The majority of nuclear
reactors are sited on bodies of water or on top of water-rich ground.
</P><P>Between 1991 and 1995, the program to site an interim dump for
high-level waste was the Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) program,
under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). This campaign was spearheaded
by the Nuclear Waste Negotiator (whose authorization expired in 1994).
The effort to find a volunteer community to take a high-level waste dump
showed that where democracy is functioning, communities reject proposals
that threaten their homes and health. More than 30 MRS proposals were
defeated by local communities between 1991 and 1994. On January 31,
1995, members of New Mexico's Mescalero Apache Tribe voted to reject a
utility-sponsored dump that grew out of the MRS program. This was a blow
to the nuclear industry, many of whose officials believed the proposed
Mescalero project was their best hope of obtaining an &quot;interim&quot;
radioactive waste dump.
</P><H1>MULTI-PURPOSE CANISTERS</H1> 
<P>Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPCs) are a new program of the Department
of Energy to standardize dry storage of waste. A small number of
canister styles are expected to serve for storage, transport and
disposal. There is concern that in trying to maximize the versatility of
the MPC, the engineering for each separate function may not be
sufficiently robust. The large rail cask design will hold about 21,000
pounds of irradiated fuel, (about 20 times more than existing,
inadequate shipping casks) and yet will not have any dramatically
increased safety features. Casks this large will carry massive
quantities of nuclear fuel, increasing concerns about criticality
(uncontrolled nuclear reaction) under some accident conditions.
</P><H1>GEOLOGIC &quot;DISPOSAL&quot;</H1> 
<P>The term &quot;disposal&quot; simply does not apply to materials
that will remain hazardous virtually forever. The English Channel did
not exist 5 thousand years ago, and within the last 10,000 years, a
volcano near Yucca Mountain erupted. Recognizing Earth as a constantly
changing, dynamic system is new to Western science. There is no place on
Earth where one can confidently predict that if we were to place the
high-level waste in a hole, it would remain isolated.
</P><P>Yucca Mountain, NV is the site specified for study as a possible
repository in the 1987 amendments to the NWPA. This site should be
rejected as unsuitable since it is classified in the highest risk
category for earthquakes. Further, it will not retain radioactive gases,
such as Carbon-14, resulting from radioactive decay, and thus could not
meet the original repository standards set by the Environmental
Protection Agency. It also sits on top of the drinking water source for
Las Vegas.
</P><P>If all U.S. reactors continue to operate through their current
license period, the inventory of high-level irradiated fuel will more
than double.

<BODY><H1>HOT CARGO:</H1> 
<H1>RADIOACTIVE WASTE TRANSPORTATION</H1> 
<P>When a centralized storage facility for highly radioactive
</P><P>nuclear fuel is opened, thousands of shipments of dangerous
</P><P>waste will begin coursing the nation's highways and rails each
</P><P>year. Accidents will happen. Are shipping containers safe? Are
</P><P>communities prepared for radiation-related accidents?
</P><H2>RADIOACTIVE FUEL BACKING UP</H2> 
<P>Without a safe publicly acceptable permanent repository,
</P><P>high-level waste is building up at 109 nuclear reactors across
</P><P>the country. This highly radioactive waste is presently shielded
</P><P>and cooled underwater in fuel pools which are rapidly filling to
</P><P>capacity. With no permanent disposal location, some utilities
</P><P>are beginning to store this waste outdoors in concrete
</P><P>containers. Shielding, with concrete, lead or water is
</P><P>essential; a person standing three feet from unshielded
</P><P>irradiated fuel would receive a lethal radiation dose in 10
</P><P>seconds. While the nuclear industry has plans for a permanent
</P><P>repository in Nevada, these plans are no closer to realization
</P><P>than they were in 1972 when the first repository site was
</P><P>proposed in Lyons, Kansas. The operation date for a Nevada
</P><P>repository has now slipped to the year 2023. As a temporary fix,
</P><P>utilities are planning a centralized storage facility on Native
</P><P>American lands in New Mexico. Or alternatively, a bill
</P><P>introduced to the U.S. Congress in January 1995 would site a
</P><P>surface storage facility at the entrance to the proposed Nevada
</P><P>repository at Yucca Mountain. If either of these plans happen,
</P><P>the high-level waste flood gates would open. Thousands of truck
</P><P>and train shipments would move dangerous radioactive waste
</P><P>across the country, by everyone's backyard. Transportation
</P><P>routes would go through 43 states. Department of Transportation
</P><P>regulations require highway shipments of nuclear waste to take
</P><P>the most direct Interstate routes, even if these routes traverse
</P><P>densely populated metropolitan areas.
</P><H2>SHIPPING CONTAINERS:</H2> 
<H2>THEY'RE BIG. THEY'RE STRONG. THEY'RE VULNERABLE.</H2> 
<P>A shipping cask is a cylindrical metal container, made up of
</P><P>steel and lead or uranium. Each truck shipping cask weighs 25
</P><P>tons; rail casks weigh up to 125 tons. Inside the cask, the fuel
</P><P>consists of solid uranium stacked like poker chips within metal
</P><P>tubes. A collection of these tubes is called an assembly. A
</P><P>typical pressurized water reactor (PWR) uses 60 fuel assemblies,
</P><P>or 30 tons of fuel, each year. Each truck cask contains 1 or 2
</P><P>PWR fuel assemblies. Each rail cask holds up to 24 fuel
</P><P>assemblies. In terms of radioactivity, each fuel assembly
</P><P>contains 10 times the long-lived radioactivity released by the
</P><P>Hiroshima bomb.
</P><P>The more severe an accident, the more likely that radioactive
</P><P>material would be released to the environment. A low speed
</P><P>accident could unseat a valve or damage a seal, releasing
</P><P>radioactive particulates to the environment. The same event
</P><P>could crack the brittle metal tubing about the fuel. According
</P><P>to the American Petroleum Institute, heavy truck accidents occur
</P><P>about 6 times each million miles traveled. With thousands of
</P><P>truck shipments, at least 15 accidents are expected each year.
</P><P>Shipping containers are designed to withstand a crash into an
</P><P>immovable object at 30 miles per hour. Obviously Interstate
</P><P>trucks travel much faster than 30 m.p.h. Impact into a bridge
</P><P>abutment or falls off a bridge could easily exceed the design
</P><P>limits of the container.
</P><P>A fire associated with a truck or rail accident increases the
</P><P>probability that radioactivity will be released. Fires occur in
</P><P>1.6% of all truck and 1% of all train accidents. Shipping
</P><P>containers are designed to withstand a 1/2-hour fire at a
</P><P>temperature of 1475 F. But rail fires could burn for hours,
</P><P>sometimes for days, at temperatures considerably higher. Diesel
</P><P>fuel burns at 1850 F. Some materials burn twice as hot. The heat
</P><P>could vaporize some radioactive materials and sweep them up into
</P><P>the air. Persons downwind could inhale radioactive particulates
</P><P>and later develop cancer or genetic effects.
</P><P>None of the containers presently used on highways and rails has
</P><P>been physically tested. These containers were designed and built
</P><P>in the 1960's and '70's. Waste containers have only been tested
</P><P>by computer or hand calculators. Before the flood gates open on
</P><P>nuclear shipments, the Department of Energy should at least
</P><P>require that the new generation of shipping containers presently
</P><P>proposed be actually physically tested, but the Department has
</P><P>no such plans.
</P><H2>ARE YOU READY?</H2> 
<P>Even if a small percentage of radioactive waste is released from
</P><P>a shipping container, the number of health effects and the
</P><P>impact on a local community could be disastrous. A 1980 study by
</P><P>the Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates economic
</P><P>consequences in an urban area on the order of $2 billion. A more
</P><P>recent study by Department of Energy contractors estimates
</P><P>economic costs on the order of $460 million, and a period
</P><P>greater than 1 year to clean up the radioactive residue.
</P><P>Who would be first on the accident scene? Local fire, police and
</P><P>emergency personnel, who are neither trained nor equipped to
</P><P>cope with emergencies of this magnitude. It is important that
</P><P>fire companies extinguish a fire within a half hour, yet it is
</P><P>often unclear who has authority and responsibility for cleanup
</P><P>and protecting the public health in an emergency.
</P><H2>WHAT TO DO</H2> 
<P>High-level waste containers should be designed to withstand all
</P><P>real highway and rail accidents. The standards need to be
</P><P>raised. Waste containers should be physically tested to
</P><P>withstand realistic and credible accidents. Local community
</P><P>emergency personnel should be trained and equipped to handle
</P><P>radiation-related accidents. No nuclear fuel should move until
</P><P>these basic safety conditions are met.

</HEAD> 
<BODY><H1>AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO</H1> 
<H1>RE-EVALUATE RADIOACTIVE WASTE POLICY</H1> 
<P>More than 120 environmental groups, three-dozen federal
</P><P>legislators, governors, and numerous others have endorsed
</P><P>establishment of an independent Presidential Commission to
</P><P>completely review and re-evaluate our nation's radioactive waste
</P><P>policy. In late March 1995, Sen. Richard Bryan and Sen. Harry
</P><P>Reid, both of Nevada, introduced S. 544, which would establish
</P><P>such a commission.
</P><H2>Background</H2> 
<P>Few dispute that our nation's existing radioactive waste
</P><P>policies have failed. According to a 1987 federal law, a
</P><P>permanent high-level radioactive waste dump is supposed to be in
</P><P>place by 1998. Congress chose only one site--Yucca Mountain,
</P><P>Nevada--to undergo testing to determine its suitability for
</P><P>waste storage. According to nuclear industry promoters, the
</P><P>federal Department of Energy--in other words, the taxpayer--is
</P><P>supposed to take title to this lethal waste, and liability for
</P><P>all leaks or accidents. Yucca Mountain is now some 15 years and
</P><P>billions of dollars behind schedule, and new scientific
</P><P>information makes it increasingly unlikely that the site will be
</P><P>found suitable for long-term storage of the nation's most
</P><P>hazardous substance.
</P><P>Technical problems plague a new generation of proposed
</P><P>&quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste dumps, too. A dozen or
so were
</P><P>supposed to be in place, according to federal law, by December
</P><P>31, 1992. In fact, none were, and as of April 1995, none are.
</P><P>The problem of &quot;disposing&quot; of a billion pounds of
&quot;depleted
</P><P>uranium&quot; from uranium enrichment activities remains vexing
and
</P><P>unsolved, as does the problem of storage for extremely hazardous
</P><P>radioactive waste created over the past 50 years by our nation's
</P><P>nuclear weapons complex.
</P><P>Nonetheless, while federal government production of new atomic
</P><P>waste has slowed (although clean-up of weapons plants may
</P><P>actually create waste), commercial nuclear reactors and
</P><P>associated facilities continue to generate hazardous material,
</P><P>with no permanent solution for its storage in sight.
</P><H2>The Nuclear Industry's &quot;Solution&quot;</H2> 
<P>The nuclear power industry regards atomic waste as a
</P><P>commodity--something which should be reprocessed or recycled
</P><P>whenever possible. Because this is neither economically nor
</P><P>socially feasible, and faced with the problems noted above, the
</P><P>industry has endorsed the concept of &quot;interim&quot; offsite
storage,
</P><P>which essentially means &quot;move it anywhere but get it off
our
</P><P>property.&quot; Most &quot;interim&quot; storage schemes would
place the
</P><P>high-level waste either in Nevada (apparently because of the
</P><P>dubious Yucca Mountain connection, since Nevada has no nuclear
</P><P>power plants) or on Native American lands. But &quot;interim&quot;
storage
</P><P>has run into substantial criticism since it fails to cope with
</P><P>the central issue: what our nation should do with the waste on a
</P><P>more permanent basis, or whether we should generate radioactive
</P><P>materials in the absence of a permanent solution for their
</P><P>storage. In the meantime, radioactive waste for the most part is
</P><P>being stored on-site at nuclear reactors.
</P><P>Although the nuclear power industry has tried to portray new
</P><P>&quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste dumps as essential to
ensure
</P><P>continued use of nuclear medicine, the vast majority of medical
</P><P>radioactive waste is both small in amount of radioactivity and
</P><P>is short-lived, making effective storage quite reasonable.
</P><P>Nuclear reactor waste, on the other hand, is both long-lived and
</P><P>can be lethally dangerous. In addition, unlike medical waste,
</P><P>nuclear reactor waste includes such hazardous elements as
</P><P>Plutonium-239, which has a hazardous life of 240,000 years, far
</P><P>beyond the 100-year control period proposed for &quot;low-level&quot;
</P><P>radioactive waste dumps. This raises substantial issues as to
</P><P>whether the current classification scheme for radioactive waste
</P><P>holds scientific credibility, or whether it is merely a
</P><P>convenience to the nuclear industry.
</P><P>&quot;Interim&quot; storage of high-level waste, and
establishment of
</P><P>potentially national or regional &quot;low-level&quot; nuclear
waste
</P><P>treatment centers and dumps also raises the spectre of
</P><P>widespread transportation of deadly atomic garbage. In January
</P><P>1995, the State of Nevada and 102 grassroots environmental
</P><P>groups released a study indicating likely transportation routes
</P><P>for high-level waste: these rail and highway routes would affect
</P><P>thousands of communities in 43 different states--all to move the
</P><P>waste to an uncertain future at a temporary dumpsite, with the
</P><P>distinct possibility that the waste may have to move again.
</P><P>&quot;Interim&quot; storage is not a solution for a sound
radioactive
</P><P>waste management policy. It is simply a stop-gap measure aimed
</P><P>at removing the waste from where it now rests--with the nuclear
</P><P>utilities--in order to give utilities room to make still more
</P><P>nuclear waste--with no permanent solution in sight, and to
</P><P>transfer the liability for accidents from the utilities to
</P><P>taxpayers.
</P><H2>An Independent Commission</H2> 
<P>For these reasons--the failure of existing radioactive waste
</P><P>policies and the bankruptcy of current radioactive waste
</P><P>proposals--a groundswell of public opinion is developing in
</P><P>favor of a different approach. It is time to re-examine our
</P><P>nation's radioactive waste issues and to think about new ways to
</P><P>address this seemingly insoluble problem. One thing is clear: a
</P><P>sound scientific basis, greater technical justification and
</P><P>greater public acceptance are prerequisites for developing a
</P><P>meaningful radioactive waste storage policy. This cannot be
</P><P>achieved by stop-gap measures endorsed only by nuclear
</P><P>utilities. S. 544 would create an independent Presidential
</P><P>Commission to re-evaluate our nation's atomic waste policies and
</P><P>to make recommendations that would point the way toward a more
</P><P>sensible means of handling these unwanted byproducts of the
</P><P>nuclear age. The Commission would consist of recognized
</P><P>scientists; of representatives from state government agencies
</P><P>charged with addressing this problem; of members of affected and
</P><P>potentially-affected communities; of Native American tribes;
</P><P>and, in recognition of the essential role played by ordinary
</P><P>citizens, ordinary citizens. In short, the Commission would
</P><P>resemble our nation itself. It would grapple with this most
</P><P>difficult of issues, and attempt to reach a defensible
</P><P>consensus. During the two-year charter of the Commission, no
</P><P>federal licenses could be issued for radioactive waste storage,
</P><P>except for temporary on-site storage (most &quot;low-level&quot;
</P><P>radioactive waste dumps are licensed by the states).
</P><P>The concept of an independent Presidential Commission is
</P><P>gaining increasing momentum as the only sound way to address the
</P><P>fundamental flaws in our current radioactive waste policies. We
</P><P>have learned over the years that it is not possible to simply
</P><P>force radioactive waste dumps on people who don't want them, and
</P><P>that it is unsound to develop radioactive waste policy that is
</P><P>neither publicly-acceptable nor scientifically-defensible. An
</P><P>independent commission could go a long way toward restoring
</P><P>public confidence in our governmental institutions and in
</P><P>promulgating radioactive waste policies that make sense for our
</P><P>nation.

<H1>&quot;LOW-LEVEL&quot; RADIOACTIVE WASTE </H1> 
<P>&quot;Low-Level&quot; Radioactive Waste
</P><P><B> </B>is one of the most misleading terms ever created. In
the U.S., it is all nuclear waste that is not legally high-level waste,
some transuranic waste, or mill tailings.
</P><P><B>High-Level Radioactive Waste </B>is: the irradiated fuel
from the cores of nuclear reactors,  the liquid and sludge wastes that
are left over after irradiated fuel has been reprocessed (a procedure
used to extract uranium and plutonium), the solid that would result from
efforts to solidify that liquid and sludge from reprocessing.
</P><P><B>Transuranic Waste </B>is material contaminated with
radioactive elements heavier than uranium, such as plutonium, neptunium,
americium and curium. These elements: have extremely long hazardous
lives--hundreds of thousands to millions of years and  emit alpha
radiation a type of radiation that is especially dangerous if inhaled or
swallowed.<B> Some transuranic waste is allowed in the &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste category. </B>In 1983, when the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) adopted regulations on land disposal of radioactive
waste (lOCFR61), it increased the allowable concentration of
transuranics in &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste.
</P><P><B>Uranium Mill tailings, </B>resulting from mining and milling
uranium for weapons and commercial reactors, are not usually included in
the &quot;low-level&quot; waste category, but may be handled with it in
some states. The large volumes of these wastes, which will emit
radiation for centuries, pose serious health problems.
</P><H3>WHAT IS &quot;LOW-LEVEL&quot; RADIOACTIVE WASTE ? </H3> 
<P>&quot;Low-Level&quot; Radioactive Waste includes<B>:</B> 
</P><P><B>Irradiated Components and Piping:</B> reactor hardware and
pipes that are in continual contact with highly radioactive water for
the 20 to 30 years the reactor operates. The metal becomes
&quot;activated&quot; or radioactive itself from bombardment by neutrons
that are released when energy is produced. Also called Irradiated
Primary System Components.
</P><P><B>Control Rods: </B>from the core of nuclear power
plants--rods that regulate and stop the nuclear reactions in the reactor
core.
</P><P><B>Poison Curtains: </B>which absorb neutrons from the water in
the reactor core and irradiated fuel (high level waste) pool.
</P><P><B>Resins, Sludges, Filters and Evaporator Bottoms: </B>from
cleansing the water that circulates around the irradiated fuel in the
reactor vessel and in the fuel pool, which holds the irradiated fuel
when it is removed from the core.
</P><P><B>Entire Nuclear Power Plants </B>if and when they are
dismantled. This includes, for example, from a typical 1,000 megawatt
nuclear reactor building floor: over 13,000 tons of contaminated
concrete and over 1,400 tons of contaminated reinforcing steel bar.
</P><P>The highly radioactive and long-lived reactor wastes are
included in the &quot;low-level&quot; waste category along with the much
less concentrated and generally much shorter-lived wastes from medical
treatment and diagnosis and some types of scientific research.
</P><H3>RADIOACTIVE CONCENTRATION vs VOLUME </H3> 
<P>The nuclear industry and government commonly describe &quot;low-level&quot;
waste in terms of volume although there can be a tremendous
concentration of radioactivity in a small package and a small
concentration in a big package. The amount of radioactivity, measured in
CURIES, indicates how much radioactive energy is being emitted by the
waste. (1 Curie = 37,000,000,000 or 37 Billion disintegrations or
radioactive emissions per second from a radioactive material.)
</P><P>The medical waste from diagnosis and treatment shipped in one
year from most states usually gives off a fraction of one curie of
radiation. In contrast, each nuclear reactor generates hundreds and
thousands of curies in &quot;low-level&quot; waste every year.
</P><P>Nuclear reactor waste is concentrated: Solidified liquid emits
about 2 curies per cubic meter; Filter/Demineralizer sludges emit about
10 curies per cubic meter; Cartridge filters emit about 20 curies per
cubic meter; Demineralizer resins emit about 160 curies per cubic meter.<B>
 </B>Primary Components average 1000 to 5000 curies per cubic meter. 
</P><P>All of this material is legally considered low-level.
</P><H3>HALF-LIFE and HAZARDOUS LIFE </H3> 
<P>Radioactive elements decay by emitting energy in the form of
radioactive particles and rays. As radiation is given off, other
elements (some radioactive and some stable) are formed.
</P><P>The <B>Half-Life </B>is the time it takes for HALF of the
radioactive element to decay<B> </B>(give off half of its
radioactivity). Different radioactive elements have different
half-lives.
</P><P>The <B>Hazardous Life </B>of a radioactive element is about 10
or 20 Half-Lives. (It is best to measure the amount of radiation after
10 or 20 half-lives before releasing waste from active controls.)
</P><P><B>Reactor waste </B>remains hazardous for a very long time<B>.
</B>Most <B>medical waste </B>from treatment and diagnosis is hazardous
for a very<B> </B>short time<B>. </B>Research and industrial waste can
contain small amounts of some long-lived radioactive materials.
</P><P>Among the radioactive elements commonly found in nuclear reactor
&quot;low-level&quot; waste are: Tritium, with a half-life of 12 years
and a hazardous life of 120-240 years; Iodine-131, half-life of 8 days,
hazardous life of 80-160 days; Strontium-90, half life of 28 years,
hazardous life of 280-560 years; Nickel-59, half life of 76,000 years,
hazardous life of 760,000-1,520,000 years, and Iodine-129, half-life of
sixteen million years, hazardous life of160-320 million years. 
</P><P>By contrast, common medical waste elements include
Technetium-99m, with a half-life of 6 hours and a hazardous life of
2.5-5 days; Galium-67, half-life of 78 hours and hazardous life of 1-2
months; and Iodine-131, with its half-life of 8 days and hazardous life
of 80-160 days.
</P><P>The vast majority of medical waste is hazardous for less than 8
months. Yet, it is in the same category as reactor waste that will be
hazardous for hundreds of thousands to millions of years.
</P><P>Clearly, the definition of &quot;low-level radioactive waste&quot;
must be changed<B>. </B>It would make sense to redefine the more
concentrated and/or longer-lived waste as high-level. Active
recontainerization and operational control must be provided for the
entire hazardous life of the waste, yet the NRC requires only 100 years
of passive institutional control. Thus, waste hazardous longer than 100
years could be forgotten. Retrievability is essential.
</P><H3>PLANNED LEAKAGE AND &quot;ACCEPTABLE&quot; RISK </H3> 
<P>Waste containers and forms will not last as long as some waste
remains hazardous. Therefore, waste should be placed in a manner which
will facilitate recontainerization and make continued isolation from the
environment possible in the future. If the waste is &quot;disposed of&quot;
as the NRC currently requires, it will not be isolated from the
environment. &quot;Planned leakage will occur at (what NRC considers) an
&quot;acceptable&quot; leak rate leading to
&quot;acceptable&quot; public radiation exposures and health risks. The
allowable leak rates and exposure levels are determined by federal
agencies, not those experiencing the risk.
</P><P>To avoid leakage, above-ground, engineered storage at or near
the source of generation could allow responsible routine monitoring and
repair.
</P><H3>STATES' AUTHORITY </H3> 
<P>States have the right and responsibility to protect their citizens'
health. In 1980, Congress gave states the responsibility for &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste. How and whether states choose to take on that
responsibility will be reflected indefinitely into the future.

<H1>SAFETY PROBLEMS WITH PRESSURIZED WATER REACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES
</H1>

<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>

<P>Of the 110 operational nuclear power reactors in the United States,
73 of these reactors are pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs. Over
half of these models are manufactured by Westinghouse with the remainder
supplied by Combustion Engineering and Babcox &amp; Wilcox. Each design
uses the controlled atomic fissioning of enriched uranium fuel in the reactor
pressure vessel to generate a tremendous amount of heat, to produce steam,
which drives a turbine-generator system for electricity.</P>

<P>The fundamental characteristic of the PWR is that the primary coolant
raises steam in a heat exchanger called a steam generator. Depending on
the design, a reactor can have two to four steam generators; each steam
generator consisting of a primary coolant loop comprised of thousands of
steam generator tubes directly circulating water from the reactor under
high pressure (approx. 2250 psi) and high temperature (600 F). The high
pressure does not allow the water to boil in the primary coolant loop thus
enabling more efficient heat transfer. In order to be effective heat exchangers
the tubes are 3/4 inch in diameter with the tube wall being as thick as
a dime. The heat is exchanged in the steam generator where water is allowed
to turn to steam though a secondary loop that exits the reactor containment
building to power the turbogenerator. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="pwr.jpg" HEIGHT=337 WIDTH=371 ALIGN=BOTTOM> </P>

<H3>AGE-RELATED DEGRADATION OF PWR SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS</H3>

<P>As in any other industry, the nuclear industry is experiencing problems
with the wear-and-tear of components and systems. Unlike other industries,
however, the failure of safety related components at nuclear power plants
can result in a catastrophic accident on a scale or larger than the radiological
accident at Chernobyl. The industry is now plagued with age-related deterioration
mechanisms unique to nuclear power operations. Chronic exposure to extreme
radiation, heat, pressure, fatigue, and corrosive chemistry are combining
to cause embrittlement of metal, cracking, and erosion of components integral
to the protection of the public's health and safety. As nuclear reactors
get older the chance of failure of this equipment only increases.</P>

<H3>STEAM GENERATOR TUBE DETERIORATION</H3>

<P>Virtually all PWRs are experiencing accelerating deterioration of steam
generator tubes because of the susceptibility of the metal used in this
component and other safety-related parts. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) reports that cracking of steam generator tubes is surging in US reactors.
Cracking has been identified by NRC as having serious safety implications
because the thousands steam generator tubes constitute a major reactor
coolant pressure boundary. A multiple tube rupture in this system could
result in a rapid loss of coolant accident in the reactor beyond the ability
of the Emergency Core Cooling System to control. This could result in a
meltdown of the reactor core. Because the steam generators are equipped
with relief valves, a rupture of the primary coolant loop results in a
radioactivity release that bypasses the containment structure with significant
risk of a catastrophic accident.</P>

<P>The NRC has issued numerous warnings about steam generator deterioration.
Commissioner Kenneth Rogers described this scenario as &quot;a loaded gun,
an accident waiting to happen.&quot; However, current NRC requirements
for inspecting steam generator tubes are inadequate to detect unsafe conditions
developing in nuclear power plants. The NRC admits that neither itself
nor the industry are able to predict how fast cracks in tubes can grow,
noting that in the duration of one 18-month operational cycle a reactor
can experience a hundred-fold increase in cracked tubes.</P>

<P>The repair or replacement of steam generators is a great economic burden
on the PWR operator, for the larger PWR units upwards of $300 million to
replace. A number of PWRs licensed by the NRC for 40 years are beginning
to see only ten effective power years before extensive repairs or replacement
are required to keep them operational. In all cases, the deterioration
of steam generators spells the increased potential for early closure of
reactors in an increasing competitive electricity market and an increased
risk of catastrophic radiological accident in the United States.</P>

<H3>REACTOR PRESSURE VESSEL EMBRITTLEMENT</H3>

<P>The reactor pressure vessel is by far the single largest safety-related
component in the reactor. The pressure vessel is the principle boundary
for the reactor core cooling capability and radiation containment system.
A NRC report emphasizes the importance of this component stating &quot;integrity
of the reactor pressure vessel is essential in ensuring reactor safety.&quot;
If the reactor pressure vessel fails, there is no backup system to cool
the reactor and avoid an uncontrollable meltdown of the nuclear fuel.</P>

<P>Early in 1993, the NRC publicly identified 15 U.S. reactors where the
pressure vessels had become so weakened by radiation as to call into question
their continued operation. The agency said that the component was aging
much faster than the manufacturers had anticipated. Caused by neutron bombardment
from the reactor fuel core, &quot;embrittlement &quot; is the loss of ductility
or the metal's ability to expand and contract to withstand stress under
rapid cooling and pressurization. The initiation of the Emergency Core
Cooling System could then place such stresses on an embrittled reactor
vessel resulting in a phenomenon not unlike pouring cold water into a baked
wine glass---resulting in the complete loss of integrity of the component.</P>

<P>This is known as Pressurized Thermal Shock or the severe overcooling
of the reactor vessel. This event can cascade out of other accidents such
as instrumentation failure, small-break loss of coolant accident or a steam
generator tube rupture</P>

<BODY>
<H1>HAZARDS OF BOILING WATER REACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES</H1>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<P>Of the 110 operational nuclear power reactors in the United States,
thirty-five are boiling water reactors (BWR). General Electric is the sole
designer and manufacturer of BWRs in the United States. The BWR's distinguishing
feature is that the reactor vessel serves as the boiler for the nuclear steam
supply system.  The steam is generated in the reactor vessel by the controlled
fissioning of enriched uranium fuel which passes directly to the turbogenerator
to generate electricity. </P>
<IMG SRC="bwr.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<H3>LACK OF CONTAINMENT INTEGRITY DURING A NUCLEAR ACCIDENT</H3>
<P>The purpose of a reactor containment system is to create a barrier against
the release of radioactivity generated during nuclear power operations from
certain &quot;design basis&quot; accidents, such as increased pressure from a
single pipe break.  It is important to understand that nuclear power plants are
not required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC) to remain intact as a
barrier to all possible accidents or &quot;non-design basis&quot; accidents,
such as the melting of reactor fuel.  All nuclear reactors can have accidents
which can exceed the design basis of their containment.</P>
<P>But even basic questions about the the GE containment design remain
unanswered and its integrity in serious doubt. For example, eighteen of these
BWRs use a smaller GE Mark I pressure suppression containment conceived as a
cost-saving alternative to the larger reinforced concrete containments marketed
by competitors.  A large inverted light-bulb-shaped steel structure called &quot;the
drywell&quot; is constructed of a steel liner and a concrete drywell shield wall
enclosing the reactor vessel. The atmosphere of the drywell is connected through
large diameter pipes to a large hollow doughnut-shaped pressure suppression pool
called &quot;the torus&quot;, or wetwell, which is half-filled with water.  In
the event of a loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA), steam would be released into the
drywell and directed underwater in the torus where it is supposed to condense,
thus suppressing a pressure buildup in the containment.</P>
<P>However, as early as 1972, Dr. Stephen Hanuaer, an Atomic Energy Commission
safety official, recommended that the pressure suppression system be
discontinued and any further designs not be accepted for construction permits.
Shortly thereafter, three General Electric nuclear engineers publicly resigned
their prestigious positions citing dangerous shortcomings in the GE design.</P>
<P>An NRC analysis of the potential failure of the Mark I under accident
conditions concluded in a 1985 report that Mark I failure within the first few
hours following core melt would appear rather likely.&quot;</P>
<P>In 1986, Harold Denton, then the NRC's top safety official, told an industry
trade group that the &quot;Mark I containment, especially being smaller with
lower design pressure, in spite of the suppression pool, if you look at the WASH
1400 safety study, you'll find something like a 90% probability of that
containment failing.&quot; In order to protect the Mark I containment from a
total rupture it was determined necessary to vent any high pressure buildup. As
a result, an industry workgroup designed and installed the &quot;direct torus
vent system&quot; at all Mark I reactors. Operated from the control room, the
vent is a reinforced pipe installed in the torus and designed to release
radioactive high pressure steam generated in a severe accident by allowing the
unfiltered release directly to the atmosphere through the 300 foot vent stack.
Reactor operators now have the option by direct action to expose the public and
the environment to unknown amounts of harmful radiation in order to &quot;save
containment.&quot; As a result of GE's design deficiency,  the original idea for
a passive containment system has been dangerously compromised and given over to
human control with all its associated risks of error and technical failure.</P>
<H3>DETERIORATION OF  BWR SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS</H3>
<P>It is becoming increasingly clear that the aging of reactor components poses
serious economic and safety risks at BWRs. A report by NRC published in 1993
confirmed that age-related degradation in BWRs will damage or destroy many vital
safety-related components inside the reactor vessel before the forty year
license expires. The NRC report states &quot;Failure of internals could create
conditions that may challenge the integrity the reactor primary containment
systems.&quot;  The study looked at major components in the reactor vessel and
found that safety-related parts were vulnerable to failure as the result of the
deterioration of susceptible materials (Type 304 stainless steel ) due to
chronic radiation exposure, heat, fatigue, and corrosive chemistry.  One such
safety-related component is the core shroud and it is also an indicator of
cracking in other vital components through the reactor made of the same
material.</P>
<H3>Core Shroud Cracking</H3>
<P>The core shroud is a large stainless steel cylinder of circumferentially
welded plates surrounding the reactor fuel core. The shroud provides for the
core geometry of the fuel bundles. It is integral to providing a refloodable
compartment in the event of a loss-of-coolant-accident. Extensive cracking of
circumferential welds on the core shroud has been discovered in a growing number
of U.S. and foreign BWRs.  A lateral shift along circumferential cracks at the
welds by as little as 1/8 inch can result in the misalignment of the fuel and
the inability to insert the control rods coupled with loss of fuel core cooling
capability. This scenario can result in a core melt accident. A German utility
operating a GE BWR where extensive core shroud cracking was identified estimated
the cost of replacement at $65 million dollars. The Wuergassen reactor,
Germany's oldest boiling water reactor, was closed in 1995 after wary German
nuclear regulators rejected a plan to repair rather than replace the reactor's
cracked core shroud.</P>
<P>Rather than address the central issue of age related deterioration, U.S. BWR
operators now opt for a dangerous piecemeal approach of patching cracking parts
at least cost but increased risk.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Nuclear Power Plant Fuel--a source of Plutonium for
Weapons?</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><B>Nuclear Power Plant Fuel -- a source of PLUTONIUM FOR WEAPONS?</B></H1>
<P>Many people may not realize that every nuclear power plant -- as a normal
part of the fissioning process -- produces plutonium.  Plutonium and/or
highly-enriched uranium are essential ingredients of nuclear bombs.</P>
<P>Every year the thousand-megawatt Callaway reactor in Missouri, for example,
produces an estimated 293 kilograms of plutonium 1. -- enough plutonium every
year to make <B>forty </B>nuclear bombs (each containing about 7.3 kilograms
[16 pounds] of mixed isotopes of plutonium per bomb).2</P>
<P><B>If the nuclear power reactor continues operating for a total of 30
years, it will have produced enough plutonium for at least 1200 bombs</B><B>.</B></P>
<P>Every year and a half, some of the irradiated fuel rods -- all of which
contain plutonium 3 -- are removed from the reactor vessel and are replaced with
fresh uranium rods.  The irradiated rods are then stored in a concrete
spent-fuel pool or in dry-storage canisters -- on site --for an indefinite
amount of time.  No permanent repository exists anywhere for the irradiated
rods.</P>
<P>&quot;Reprocessing&quot; technologies exist that can extract plutonium from
irradiated reactor fuel.  Although no commercial reprocessing plant is currently
operating in the U.S., reprocessing is under way in Japan, England, France,
Russia and India.  And the Department of Energy and Japan are expending
significant funds here in the U.S. on research, development, and demonstration
projects for cheaper, faster, more efficient ways to reprocess irradiated fuel.</P>
<P>The nuclear industry and others support the reprocessing of irradiated,
commercial nuclear power plant fuel and the &quot;recycling,&quot; then, of its
extracted plutonium into new nuclear plant fuel (a mixture of uranium and
plutonium oxides).  Proponents of reprocessing are advocating the &quot;burn-up&quot;
of plutonium as fuel in existing and/or &quot;advanced&quot; nuclear power
reactors.</P>
<P>Environmentalists, on the other hand, point out that past reprocessing has
been responsible for major environmental degradation in the countries that have
employed it, including the United States.  In order to extract plutonium,
reprocessing requires that irradiated reactor fuel rods -- the most radioactive
materials on earth -- be cut up, and dissolved in a solvent, resulting in the
release of massive quantities of radioactive gases and other substances. 
Leakage of the remaining stored high-level radioactive wastes at West Valley,
New York; Hanford, Washington; Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Savannah River, South
Carolina, has created cleanup problems that will take hundreds of billions of
dollars, with complete remediation an impossibility.</P>
<P>They also warn that terrorists could steal the extracted plutonium from
stockpiles at reprocessing or fuel fabrication plants, or during transport
between the facilities, and use it in the manufacture ofnuclear bombs.  The
potential for sabotage or theft at these facilities would be substantial.</P>
<P>Additionally, other dangers inherent in nuclear power plants would remain: 
the routine releases of fission products into the environment, the exposure of
workers to radiation, the potential for a major accident, and the accumulation
of long-lived wastes from the reactors' continuing operation. 4</P>
<P>Proposals pending in Congress to transport the irradiated fuel that is
currently stockpiled at some seventy nuclear power plant locations out to Nevada
for interim storage -- and possibly someday, for ultimate disposal or
reprocessing -- would place thousands of shipments of plutonium-bearing fuel
onto our railroads and highways, coast-to-coast. Federal regulations require
that armed escorts be present during all shipments of irradiated fuel --
evidence that the threat of nuclear terrorism is real.</P>
<P>No American electric utility has placed an order for a nuclear power plant
that was not subsequently canceled since October 1973 (the Palo Verde plant in
Arizona).  That is, no new nuclear plants are being added.  However, every
existing reactor, because of the presence of plutonium, is a potential target
for terrorism.</P>
<P>Nuclear reactors and the plutonium they generate threaten the hope for world
peace and survival.</P>
<P><B>We would like to acknowledge the contribution by Dr. Thomas B. Cochran,
Senior Staff Scientist of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who calculated
the annual plutonium production of the Callaway nuclear power plant.</B></P>
<H2>NOTES:</H2>
<OL>
<LI>1. The above calculation of 293 kilograms of plutonium per year assumes the
Callaway reactor (1150-megawatt electric; 3565-megawatt thermal) operates at 80%
of its capacity.  Please remember:  approximately 60 percent of the plutonium
will be plutonium-239, which has a half-life of 24,000 years and remains
hazardous for at least ten half-lives.
</LI>
<LI>2. See <I>Reviews of Modern Physics</I>, Vol. 50, No. 1, Part II, Jan.
1978, page S29.   With greater technical expertise, a nuclear weapon can be
built with considerably less plutonium than the amount estimated here.</LI>
<LI>3. Although the plutonium generated by a commercial nuclear power plant is
not technically &quot;weapons grade,&quot; it has long been acknowledged that
nuclear bombs can be and have been built with reactor-grade plutonium.
</LI>
<LI>4. All nuclear power plants release radioactive gases, liquids, and
particulates into the environment as a part of their routine operation.  It does
not take an accident.  Such releases include tritium (radioactive hydrogen) and
other radioactive gaseous material, much of which can be neither filtered nor
monitored.

<H2>Broad Opposition To DOE Proposal To Use  Weapons Plutonium For Commercial
Nuclear Power Reactor Fuel</H2>
<P>Washington, D.C.  A growing coalition of national, international and
grassroots groups today announced vigorous opposition to a plan by the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) that could lead to the use of approximately 50 tons
of plutonium from nuclear bombs as fuel in U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. 
The DOE today released a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) on
plutonium disposition that advocates investigating two options: use as fuel or
immobilize in glass for permanent storage of excess military plutonium.</P>
<P>One of the options involves combining plutonium and uranium into mixed-oxide
(MOX) fuel pellets for use in nuclear power reactors.  The other is to vitrify
(encapsulate in glass) plutonium into a waste form.  The pursuit of the MOX
option would undermine a 20-year United States policy to avoid the civilian use
of plutonium.  In addition, if a MOX fabrication plant were in operation, there
would be renewed pressure for the DOE to increase the reprocessing of irradiated
(spent) fuel to isolate plutonium which could then be used as MOX.</P>
<P>&quot;This is a stunning reversal of the prudent foundation of U.S.
nonproliferation policy designed to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of
terrorists and rogue states,&quot; said Jim Adams, Senior Analyst for the Safe
Energy Communication Council.  &quot;Opposed by many scientists, experts and the
public, developing the MOX option would open a dangerous Pandora's box,&quot; he
concluded.</P>
<P>The PEIS failed to formally consider the economic and nonproliferation
factors weighing against the use of MOX.  These issues were discussed in other
documents that were not subjectto the strict standards required by the National
Environmental Policy Act.  &quot;It is important that Secretary of Energy Hazel
O'Leary weigh the cost and nonproliferation factors that were kept out of the
PEIS before arriving at a final decision,&quot; noted Paul Leventhal, President
of the Nuclear Control Institute.  &quot;Plutonium fuel in commercial reactors
makes no sense from a cost standpoint and is downright dangerous from a
proliferation standpoint.  Vitrification makes sense from both perspectives and
should be her first choice,&quot; concluded Mr. Leventhal.</P>
<P>The pursuit of the MOX option will send the wrong signal to other countries
about a change in the U.S. position on nuclear fuel policy.  &quot;Using the MOX
fuel option for plutonium disposition will take longer, be more expensive, and
encourage world-wide use of plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons,&quot;
stated Maureen Eldredge, Program Director for the Military Production Network, a
coalition of grassroots organizations.  &quot;There is no good rationale for
continuing down this dangerous path.  If this is an example of how the U.S.
shows strong leadership on international security issues, we are in big trouble.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Greenpeace opposes any recommendation by the DOE to use plutonium as
nuclear fuel.The decision to use MOX is a wrong-headed and risky reversal of
U.S. nonproliferation policy and is being made to the satisfaction of the
plutonium industry in Russia, France, Britain, and Japan,&quot; said Tom
Clements, a spokesman for Greenpeace International.  &quot;We will vigorously
work to oppose the use of plutonium fuel and promote its treatment as nuclear
waste,&quot;  he concluded.  Bill Magavern, the Director of Public Citizen's
Critical Mass Energy Project, declared, &quot;Citizens groups across the country
have stopped previous attempts to use plutonium as a reactor fuel and we will
fight this proposal as long as a better alternative exists-- and immobilization
is a better alternative.&quot;</P>
<P>Furthermore, the U.S. is worried about the intention of Russian leaders who
are leaning towards the development of a MOX industry to deal with surplus
plutonium from thedismantlement of nuclear weapons.  &quot;The most important
result of a decision to pursue a MOX option will be to encourage Russia to
produce more weapons-usable plutonium from used nuclear reactor fuel.  It will
help create a surreal cycle by which Russia will make spent fuel out of weapons
plutonium only to extract more plutonium out of the reactor spent fuel, thereby
perpetuating the threat of theft and diversion,&quot; said Dr. Arjun Makhijani,
President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park,
Maryland.</P>
<P>Another major concern for coalition members is the impact of the DOE
providing significant subsidies to the nuclear power industry to facilitate the
use of MOX in commercial reactors.  &quot;This smells like polluter pork to me,&quot;
said Anna Aurilio, a staff scientist with the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group.  &quot;It is scary that utility executives would be bribed to keep
operating their aging, uneconomic reactors,&quot; she added</P>
<P>&quot;We have major problems in the U.S. with nuclear power wastes, and now
DOE is going to spend hundreds of millions of tax-payer dollars to subsidize
failing, uneconomic reactors, which will generate wastes more dangerous and
complicated than what we have today,&quot; declared Mary Olson, a spokesperson
for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service.  &quot;The concerns of
citizens in reactor communities, who will be directly affected by the use of MOX
fuel, did not influence the development of this policy, but they will have a lot
to say about whether it will be implemented,&quot; she concluded.</P>
<P>&quot;Commercial use of plutonium poses significant radiological hazards to
facility workers and highly radioactive waste streams which imperil the
surrounding environment and for which there are no viable waste management
solution.  The better approach would be to convert the plutonium into glassified
waste for permanent underground disposal,&quot;  concluded Timothy Takaro, a
board member of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</P>

<H2><B>NRC LICENSING BOARD ALLOWS CITIZEN CHALLENGE TO OYSTER CREEK'S PLAN TO
MOVE IRRADIATED FUEL </B></H2> 
<P>WASHINGTON, DC, Oct.29,1996 -- In a Memorandum and Order from the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) Nuclear
Information and Resource Service (NIRS) and Oyster Creek Nuclear Watch (OCNW)
were granted legal intervention status in their challenge to General Public
Utility Nuclear's (GPUN) plan to move highly-radioactive fuel. The fuel would be
moved in heavy transfer casks from an elevated water-filled storage pond several
stories up in the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor building to a interim nuclear
waste dry storage facility located on the electric utility's property in Forked
River, New Jersey. The NRC's three judge panel also accepted that the nuclear
watchdog groups &quot;have submitted a litigable contention&quot; involving a
legal question in the utility plan.  </P>
<P>In April, 1996, GPUN filed a license amendment application with the NRC to
modify its safety specifications which currently restrict the movement of heavy
loads over stored irradiated fuel in the reactor to an 800 lbs. limit.  In order
to proceed with the plan to move a series of 100-ton casks containing the
reactor's burned atomic fuel, GPUN must first modify its technical
specifications to permit the movement of a four-ton shielded lid over scores of
hot radioactive fuel assemblies loaded into a NUHOMS dry storage cask set in the
irradiated fuel pool. NIRS, OCNW, and a third citizen group in western
Massachusetts, the Citizens Awareness Network (CAN), filed a petition to
intervene and argued before the NRC judges in an August prehearing conference
that the license amendment, by waiving weight restrictions on moving loads over
irradiated fuel, would irresponsibly erode &quot;defense-in-depth&quot;
procedures designed to prevent an accident involving human error, mechanical or
electrical failure from damaging the highly radioactive fuel and causing
radiation contamination to communities near the reactor.</P>
<P>The ASLB order, dated October 25, 1996 states &quot;there is sufficient
information on the record before us to establish a reasonable basis for the
assertion of petitioners NIRS and OCNW that a shield plug drop accident can
occur and that such an accident can have off-site radiological consequences that
may impact the Atomic Energy Act-protected health and safety interests of their
members.&quot;</P>
<P>The NRC order requires GPUN to respond by November 15 to a &quot;legitimate
question&quot; raised by the watchdog groups about the utility's effort to
change its current technical specification and its relation to a &quot;legal
interpretation&quot; of NRC requirements governing the movement of heavy loads
over stored irradiated fuel.  </P>
<P><B> &quot;</B>The weight restriction was not written into Oyster Creek's
safety analysis by an oversight, its there to prevent a nuclear accident,<B>&quot;</B>
said Paul Gunter, Director of the Reactor Watchdog Project at NIRS. &quot;GPUN's
proposed change to its safety procedures is only the first sign of a steady
erosion that would need to take place for this precarious shuffling of nuclear
waste at the reactor,&quot; continued Gunter. &quot;The obvious first step in
responsibly managing this problem is to stop generating this dangerous<B> </B>garbage,&quot;
Gunter concluded.</P>
<P>&quot;We are looking for a greater level of scrutiny in the movement of
high-level radioactive waste at the reactor,&quot; said William deCamp, Jr. of
Oyster Creek Nuclear Watch. &quot;The board's decision confirms that our
concerns are far from frivolous,&quot; deCamp said. </P>
<P>The CAN group in Massachusetts is permitted to participate through
submissions by amicus curiae or as a &quot;friend of the court&quot; but has
been denied intervenor status in the Oyster Creek proceeding when the ASLB did
not accept the group's argument that a decision might establish a &quot;bad
precedent&quot; affecting future activities at their nearby Vermont Yankee
atomic power plant.        <B>

<H2> NRC Levies $900,000 Fine Against Thermo-Lag Manufacturer </H2>
<H2>Public safety Remains In Jeopardy As Combustible Fire Barrier Is Still
Installed at Reactors</H2> 
<P>Washington , DC, October 2 -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
yesterday proposed a $900,000 fine against the manufacturer of an inoperable
fire barrier,one of the largest fines ever issued by the agency. The Nuclear
Information and Resource Service warned that the barriers still are installed in
46 nuclear power plants around the country. </P>
<P>NRC issued the proposed fine on October 1, 1996 against the St. Louis firm
Thermal Sciences, Inc. and its owner Mr. Rubin Feldman.  The nine separate
violations allege that the vendor deliberately provided inaccurate and/or
incomplete information pertaining to the performance of its fire barrier
product, called Thermo-Lag. </P>
<P>The NRC declared the fire barrier &quot;inoperable&quot; in 1992 after
independent fire tests revealed that the barrier was as combustible as &quot;treated
plywood&quot; and consistently failed NRC fire endurance requirements. The NRC
then required utilities to institute hourly fire patrols to &quot;compensate&quot;
for the substandard fire barriers. However, the agency so far has refused to
order the barriers removed.</P>
<P>&quot;Working with an industry whistleblower, we challenged this dangerous
fire hazard in U.S. nuclear power plants five years ago,&quot; said Paul
Gunter,head of NIRS' Reactor Watchdog Project. &quot;The NRC has now fined the
company for lying about its product's quality but all that has been done by the
industry and the regulator is to paper over the problem,&quot; said Gunter.  &quot;As
long as the NRC and the utilities have been aware of this problem, they have
only been able to generate stacks of paper that would really be more effective
as a fire barrier than Thermo-Lag itself,&quot; said Gunter.</P>
<P>&quot;The NRC should have ordered this combustible material removed and
replaced years ago,&quot; continued Gunter. &quot;Because of a
multimillion-dollar price tag to remove Thermo-Lag and replace it with a fire
barrier that works, the nuclear utilities have successfully stalled any
effective action to protect the public in the event of fire,&quot; said Gunter.</P>
<P>Gunter argued that the &quot;fire watch&quot; personnel currently walking
hourly patrols through nuclear reactors where the fire barrier has been
installed do not constitute an effective compensatory measure.</P>
<P>&quot;Thermo-Lag was falsely promised to the nuclear industry as a way to
suppress and retard fire to protect vital electrical cables for up to three
hours&quot; said Gunter. &quot;Public safety is in jeopardy in the event that
human access is denied by fire, smoke or radiation,&quot; said Gunter. &quot;These
reactors are essentially unprotected from fire,&quot; concluded Gunter. An NRC
study states that a typical nuclear power plant will have 2 to 3 significant
fires during its operational life. Fire constitutes as much as 50% of the risk
of events leading to a core melt accident according to the NRC.</P>
<P>Gerald Brown, of Brown Consulting Services, the original whistleblower on
the Thermo-Lag issue is also available for comment. </P>

<H2>MOBILE CHERNOBYL BILL DEAD IN ITS TRACKS;</H2>
<H2>REASON, CAUTION AND CLINTON VETO THREAT PREVAIL</H2>
<P>Today, citizen's groups nationwide declared the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act&quot;
bill dead in its tracks. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments (HR 1020,
Upton, R-Mich.; S 1271, Craig, R-Id.; S 1936, Murkowski, R-Ak) would have turned
U.S. nuclear waste policy upside down, mandating the shipment of highly
radioactive waste across 43 states to a parking-lot type &quot;interim&quot;
storage facility in Nevada. The bills would have exempted the project from
federal and state environmental laws and regulations, and would have mandated a
radiation standard equivalent to a 1 in 286 lifetime fatal cancer rate.</P>
<P>S. 1936 passed the Senate July 31, but did not garner enough support to be
able to override a promised Presidential veto. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
decided not to bring up the contested bill, following pleas by Nevada Republican
congressional candidates and after President Clinton again affirmed his veto
promise. Citizens in Nevada and the State itself are overwhelmingly opposed to
both proposed &quot;interim&quot; and permanent nuclear dumps at Yucca Mountain.
Grassroots citizen's groups across the country have worked the past two years to
prevent the nuclear industry legislation from being enacted.</P>
<P>Said NIRS Executive Director, Michael Mariotte, &quot;More than 50 million
Americans live within a half mile of likely nuclear waste shipping routes. A
worst case scenario of a transport accident involves a head-on collision and a
high-temperature fire--much the same scenario of a train accident near
Washington DC last winter. A damaged cask consumed by fire could release
millions of curies of lethal radiation--the same type of material, including
plutonium, strontium, cesium and so forth, released at Chernobyl.  That is why
we called this bill--and this concept--the 'Mobile Chernobyl Act.'&quot;</P>
<P>Opposition to the legislation has been widespread. Cities and counties from
Los Angeles to Upstate New York to western North Carolina have passed
resolutions opposing the legislation, primarily on the basis of their concern
about nuclear waste shipments through their area. Transportation hubs such as
St. Louis, Denver and Philadelphia all went on record in opposition to this
plan.</P>
<P>Said NIRS' campaigner Mary Olson: &quot;We appreciate the Clinton
Administration's principled opposition to this legislation. They very early
realized that exempting high-level nuclear waste from environmental laws and
regulations and then transferring liability for the waste it to the taxpayers,
without an acceptable permanent storage site is neither fiscally nor morally
responsible. President Clinton's commitment to veto the legislation, along with
citizen opposition in every state, stopped this nuclear utility &quot;dream bill&quot;
from seeing the light of day.&quot;</P>
<P>The nuclear utilities and their trade associations spent tens of millions of
dollars in advertising, lobbying costs and PAC contributions in their bid to
start moving high-level nuclear waste off their sites immediately, even while
they continue to generate more waste. More than 150 environmental organizations
worked to stop this legislation, calling instead for an independent review of
radioactive waste policies, including military, civilian, high and &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste, before there are any further legislative initiatives.</P>

<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  This afternoon the
Commission would like to welcome representatives of the Low-Level Waste Forum. 
The Forum periodically briefs the Commission on the status of the Low-Level
Waste Siting program in the U.S.  The development and construction of low-level
radioactive waste disposal sites is an integral part of the nuclear program in
this country not only for reactors, but for materials licensees.  The
establishment in this country of adequate low-level radioactive waste disposal
capacity that protects the public's health and safety should be a major
priority.</P>
<P>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to tour the Barnwell disposal site
in South Carolina, and in fact I also visited the final disposal repository for
low-level waste in Sweden earlier.  So I am particularly anxious to hear from
the Low-Level Waste Forum on the status and progress that is being made in other
states and compacts as well as any comments you might have on the effect of
Barnwell on the process of developing low-level waste sites.</P>
<P>Commissioner Rogers, do you have anything?</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  No.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Commissioner Dicus?</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  No.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Mr. Larson, you may proceed.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Thank you, Chairman Jackson.  It's a pleasure to be here today.
 We have had the opportunity to brief Commissioner Rogers in the past at visits
to the NRC, but we haven't had that same opportunity for you or for our former
colleague Greta.  It's a pleasure to be here.  We are glad to be here.</P>
<P>Just a few words about the Forum before we introduce ourselves.  The
Low-Level Waste Forum is an association of representatives of compacts and
states. Compact representatives are appointed by their compact commissions and
the state representatives by their governors.</P>
<P>Our primary purpose is to implement the federal legislation that was passed
in 1980 and amended in 1985, and also to promote the objectives of interstate
compacts in developing new disposal capacity.</P>
<P>The organization generally operates on consensus. We represent individually
states and compacts and we have our own individual views on a number of issues.</P>
<P>Occasionally we have issues that we do join together on and establish a
common position.  You may hear today in the discussion different positions
offered by the representatives here.</P>
<P>Why don't we just introduce ourselves.  Don.</P>
<P>MR. WOMELDORF:  I'm Don Womeldorf.  I'm the</P>
<P>executive director of the Southwestern Low-Level Waste Commission.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  I'm Bill Dornsife, director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of
Radiation Protection.  I represent Pennsylvania as host state for the
Appalachian Compact. Under our legislation our agency has both regulatory
authority and also contract oversight authority.  We have the dubious
distinction of trying to become an Agreement State to take over that.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  That's a high honor.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Yes.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  I'm Kathryn Haynes.  I'm executive director of the Southeast
Compact Commission.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Gregg Larson.  I'm executive director of the Midwest Compact
Commission.</P>
<P>MR. MATHEWS:  I'm Lee Mathews, general counsel of the Texas Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority.</P>
<P>MR. STRONG:  I'm Terry Strong.  I'm director of Washington's radiation
protection program and I am the chairman of the Northwest Compact.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  One of the things that the Forum does is serve as a focal point
for exchanging views and information between federal agencies and people here in
Washington and our states and compacts.  Of course that's the purpose of the
briefing this afternoon.</P>
<P>We would like to start off by highlighting some items that are of particular
interest to us and the focus of a lot of national attention right now.  The
first is the status of the siting process out in the state of California, which
is the host state for the Southwestern Compact Commission.  Don is the
representative of the compact commission and will brief you in more detail about
the status of that site development effort.</P>
<P>MR. WOMELDORF:  Thank you.  Yes, I am representing the Southwestern Compact
Commission, not the state of California.  I want to make sure that distinction
is clear.</P>
<P>California issued a license in 1993 which was immediately challenged in the
courts.  Those challenges have now been played out to the level of the
California Supreme Court, and all along the way the California license activity
and decision have been supported.  So that is no longer an issue.</P>
<P>The critical path now is the transfer of the property from federal to state
ownership.  As you may know, the Department of Interior is saying that if this
transfer takes place now there won't be any public safeguards, and of course our
commission's view is that this isn't true at all, because California is an
Agreement State; it's under NRC's oversight as an Agreement State; and those
safeguards are going to be built in there as well as California's own </P>
<P> regulatory activities.</P>
<P>It is important, I think, to note that all of the lawsuits and all of the
studies so far have indeed supported the California licensing decision.  It has
been one thing after another, and all along it has been yes-yes-yes, the site is
okay, the technology is okay, the regulatory scheme is okay.  We don't feel that
one more study, as the Department of Interior currently is proposing, is going
to change anything.  We think it's only a delay.</P>
<P>So our commission's suggestion is to follow the NAS recommendation, transfer
the land now, then make sure that things are going to be safe through additional
studies and monitoring as appropriate.</P>
<P>Along those lines, you have in your packet a communication from the Forum to
the Department of Interior transmitting a resolution of the Forum which was
passed last month that goes along pretty much those same lines.</P>
<P>That is all I will say at this point.  If you have any questions, of course,
I will respond to those.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Commissioner Rogers.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  No.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  No.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Chairman Jackson, one thing that we would like to ask the
Commission is whether or not there might be some role for the Commission to play
in moving the process forward in California.  I guess in the past we have had
discussions with the NRC about dual regulation and some of the problems that are
entailed in dual regulation between EPA and the NRC.  We find ourselves in a
position now where we seem to be moving in a triangular regulation where have
got another regulatory agency.  In this case it seems to be the Department of
Interior, which doesn't really have any charge in this area.</P>
<P>In looking over your confirmation statement, you seem to express an interest
and concern about storage of low-level radioactive waste.  One of the issues
that worries us about instances like the California situation is that if
California is not successful in developing its disposal facility, we are going
to have generators eventually storing waste again.  We think it's an important
public health and safety issue, and any support that the NRC could give
regarding the transfer of that land to California would be very much
appreciated.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Since in fact it's an issue between a particular branch
of the federal government and the state, we would not get involved in a direct
way.  I understand your concerns.  From the general perspective I am
sympathetic.  I will make sure that we take that into consideration.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>The second status report we would like to give on a siting effort that has
advanced fairly far along is the siting effort in the state of Texas where they
are now going through licensing proceedings.  They also have a new compact that
has been formed, and that is before Congress now for consent.  Lee is here
representing the state of Texas.</P>
<P>MR. MATHEWS:  Thank you.  The Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact for low-level
waste disposal is currently pending in Congress.  House and Senate ratification
bills have been passed out of the respective committees and are awaiting floor
action.  We anticipate that action in the House will occur first, and we
understand that that could occur any time.  It could happen this month; it could
happen next year.  But we are hopeful it will be sooner rather than later.</P>
<P>Under the compact arrangement, which is probably unique among the compacts,
Texas will be the permanent host state for compact waste.  A proposed site has
already been identified in west Texas.  Under the compact arrangement, Maine and
Vermont will be able to send limited amounts of waste to Texas and Texas will
receive $50 million in total from the other two states for that privilege.</P>
<P>Equally important, we think, is the fact that the host county will receive
$5 million to do with as they wish, no strings attached.</P>
<P>The review of our license application by the state regulatory agency is, I
am happy to report, complete.  An environmental assessment will be issued by
that agency in three weeks.  This will trigger a round of adjudicative hearings,
which we hope will be complete by this time next year.  So always being the
optimist, I believe we could have a site operating by early 1998 under the
current arrangements.</P>
<P>That's where we are at the present.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  We have talked about two compacts, one compact that is in
existence and one compact that is pending, but two states that have submitted
license applications in the state of California have been granted their
application.  We also have disposal sites that are currently operating now, one
of which you visited this week, Barnwell, and two others, one in Utah and one in
the state of Washington.  The Utah site and the state of Washington site are
both in the Northwest Compact.  Terry Strong is here today and can give you a
status report on what is happening at those two sites.</P>
<P>MR. STRONG:  Washington had the first compact.  It was relatively easy for
us to do that, for the states adjacent to us to band together around us.  Our
site also has no provision for anybody else in the compact to have to</P>
<P> have a site.  It was envisioned that ours would go on.</P>
<P>The provisions of the federal 1985 Amendments Act allowed a compact once it
was ratified and secure to close its borders to receipt of waste from out of the
region, and we have done that.  In furtherance, we believe, of the intent of the
federal Act, we also, after negotiation, entered into a contract with the Rocky
Mountain Compact.  So there are 11 western states that are in the region, all
sending their waste to Hanford.</P>
<P>When we began this in 1980 and the federal acts were passed, no one
envisioned having two sites in one region.  That has been an interesting issue
for us to deal with.</P>
<P>The niche that is filled by the Envirocare site in Utah has been an
important one.  Their original intent, and they continue to follow through on
this, was to take large quantities of slightly contaminated material.  It is
this kind of material that most of the other compact regions as they look at the
kinds of waste and the volumes that they would be faced with are not prepared to
handle, and the niche that is filled by Envirocare is to handle just exactly
that kind of material.  And we don't want it at the Richland site either.  So
that part of the relationship goes very well.  It is handling all of the
material that is generated in the Northwest Compact region, and it provides an
escape valve in the interim for all the other compacts, and I think it works
very well.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Kathryn Visocki is here from the Southeast Compact and can tell
you a little bit more about the status of Barnwell.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  Old habits die hard.  My name is Kathryn Haynes now.</P>
<P>[Laughter.]</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  We got it because we see your name in front of you.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  Which is funny, because I was planning anyway to start by
telling you that old habits die hard.  I've been with the Southeast Compact for
quite a while and I spent 11 years talking about the Barnwell facility as our
regional facility.  Of course now I've had to break that habit.  So when I speak
of the Barnwell facility now, it is not within our compact any longer, as you
know.</P>
<P>The measures that were taken last summer to withdraw South Carolina from the
Southeast Compact and to make the Barnwell facility available to the whole
nation except for North Carolina, those measures were attached to a budget bill
in South Carolina.  Therefore, there has been a lawsuit raised by a South
Carolina environmental group questioning the validity of that act.  It is not
known at this point what time the court will consider that question, but there
is some question as to whether the act will be upheld and whether the same
measures will have to be revisited in the South Carolina General Assembly.</P>
<P>That is just one of the areas in which we feel the access to the Barnwell
facility is tenuous.  There is a great deal of uncertainty.  Not just because of
the lawsuit, but also because of the fact that the general assembly can revisit
that policy at any time.  We have seen it happen before and we know it can
happen again.  There was supposed to be between seven to ten years of actual
physical capacity for waste, but we all know that the technical capacity is not
necessarily the issue.</P>
<P>I would like to make it clear that the Southeast Compact nonetheless does
take their responsibility seriously in providing for access to disposal for its
generators in the Southeast.  North Carolina continues to be our selected host
state and they continue to work, reviewing the license application and
developing a facility.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  What is the basis for the seven to ten years of
capacity of Barnwell?  What is that based on?</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  I'm not sure I'm qualified to address that.  It was an estimate
that has been presented to us by South Carolina.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  It's just past history that what they have been
getting up to now is continued in the future at seven to ten years?  What would
be the basis for that?</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  I'm really not sure I can answer that.  All I know is that is
what South Carolina tells us, that they have computed seven to ten years.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Based on my visit there recently, Commissioner, there is
a rate of generation assumption having to do with recent history.  It does not
specifically take account of any premature closures, et cetera, of nuclear
facilities, but it also does take account of new compaction technologies that
exist.  That is the kind of perspective that was offered to me recently.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  Thank you.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  In the Appalachian Compact, as I mentioned, Pennsylvania is
the host state.  We had been pursuing under our laws and regulations a site
screening process where our contractor would be identifying three sites, and
those sites would then be narrowed down to one after site characterization.</P>
<P>Because of the controversy that we have been seeing and some other issues,
we have recently added another step to the process, and it's called the
community partnering process.  It's an attempt to find three volunteer
communities.  We have just recently completed the planning process with that new
step and started implementing that process.  I am pleased to say that so far the
reaction has been pretty positive.  It's amazing when you take pressure off
elected officials at the local level in terms of forcing a site on somebody how
the lines of communications are much easier to deal with.</P>
<P>So far we are really pleased with that new process.  However, of course, it
will add another two or three years to the time when we expect to have a site on
line.  So now we are talking probably the year 2002 or 2003 until we would be
ready to accept waste.</P>
<P>I just want to also add that particularly with the Texas and the California
issue, those two issues kind of send a chilling message to the rest of us.  They
are trying to move ahead with siting.  Congress and the federal government had
told us, states, you're responsible for this, go forth and propagate, form
compacts and develop new facilities, and now two states have done that and the
federal government appears to be holding up progress.  So it certainly doesn't
encourage the rest of us that are pursuing the process.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  I represent the Midwest Compact.  Our host state is the state
of Ohio.  Ohio just recently enacted enabling legislation, back in June of last
year, that will allow their state to go forward and develop a disposal facility.
 So we are really at the start of the siting process in our compact commission.</P>
<P>We have also put at your place a report entitled &quot;Summary Report.&quot;
 It has a map on the back of the report that shows you the breakdown of states
within the compacts and touches on where the siting efforts are in the other
states that aren't in compacts or the other compacts that aren't represented
here today.  Unless you have any questions about those, we won't discuss them.</P>
<P>Any other questions on where we stand as far as our site development
efforts?</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  Just a quick question to Bill.  Several of the host
states and the compacts have had various sorts of processes to involve
communities in the selection process, and you think yours is going to work well.
 What makes it unique from some of these other ones where some have worked and
some have not?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  As you are aware, we probably had one of the more aggressive
public involvement programs in our Pennsylvania program to begin with.  Quite
frankly, when you are talking about siting at a statewide level, it is very
difficult to get the public interested in the issue.</P>
<P>It is not until you actually get down to picking sites that people start
discussing the issue at the local level, and by then it is probably too late,
because people have gotten biases.  So we are thinking going to the volunteer
process with a grass roots effort allows that communication to occur before a
site even gets considered.  Then the community has the right to decide; they are
empowered to make the decision of whether they want to proceed.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  If they say yes, we want to proceed, do they have a
point in time that that decision is irreversible?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  The way we envision our process, there are four steps.  The
first is just information and there is formal interest.  Then there is a
negotiation step. At the end of that negotiation step there is some sort of a
formal agreement entered into.  It can't be totally irrevocable, but there will
be terms in there that will make it more binding and more difficult to get out
of, but that is after a community has expressed the majority interest in
pursuing it and being a host.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  What incentives are there in your program for a
community to want to advance itself as a disposal site?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  We have a number of incentives that were already built into
the legislation.  We had gone through a very detailed public involvement process
that tried to identify the concerns.  They range from providing independent
monitoring.</P>
<P>For example, we have local inspectors that have the authority to shut down a
facility if they see a violation of health and safety.  We have various kinds of
monitoring offered free to the citizens to make sure they have not been
affected.  There are property guarantees. Obviously local monitoring. 
Transportation.  We even look at affected municipalities and give them benefits.
 In addition, both the law and the contract requires our contractor to negotiate
additional benefits, whatever the community wants.  So we are probably talking
several million dollars worth of benefits at the very least.  Obviously not all
monetarily related, but certainly some of it is monetarily related.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  I had a question about the Southeast Compact.  The focus
really is still on Barnwell in the Southeast Compact.  Is that correct?</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  That is not correct.  I was asked to take that part of the
program today.  Since I traditionally have spoken about Barnwell, they asked me
to speak about it. Barnwell is definitely not the focus of our activities.  I'm
glad you asked the question.  It gives me an opportunity to make the point. 
What I was trying to point out to you is that our focus is to develop capacity
for our generators in the Southeast.</P>
<P>Before South Carolina took those actions we had already identified North
Carolina as the host state.  The application for a license had already been
submitted and the process was already started to review that application.</P>
<P>That process was not in the least bit slowed up or changed in any way.  It
was made very clear to North Carolina that nothing had changed; they were still
the host state; and they still had an obligation.  I don't want to imply that
North Carolina hasn't taken that seriously, because they have.  They continue to
work to get the application reviewed and the license issued.</P>
<P>In terms of our relationship with South Carolina, however, I think there
have been some assumptions made or misunderstandings in the general industry and
community that there would be harsh feelings between the state of South Carolina
and the Southeast Compact Commission.  At least from my perception I have not
seen that.  We maintain a good working relationship.  The state of South
Carolina needed to do what they needed to do.  Our commission needed to do what
it needed to do.  We all have respected that and continue to keep a good
relationship with the state.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Thank you.  Let me go back to your point when you were
talking about California.  What is it that you think the NRC can profitably do
with respect to the problems with California and even Texas?</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  I think one thing might be to stress what the implications are
if we fail in our efforts to develop disposal capacity.  We have three sites
operating. The one in Washington works very well for their compact, and the
Rocky Mountain Compact, 11 states, but those are the only 11 states that are
being served by that compact.  The Envirocare facility takes only a limited part
of our waste stream, high volume, low activity waste.</P>
<P>And Barnwell, we recognize, is not a long-term solution to our disposal
needs because of its limited capacity.</P>
<P>So in the end we still are all very much interested and concerned about the
need to develop new disposal capacity.  We don't want to return to the situation
that we had a year ago when we had no access to Barnwell.</P>
<P>In my compact region we had 170-some generators storing waste on site.  The
same was true for the other states and compacts that also lost access to
Barnwell.</P>
<P>California is very important as far as our success.  They are the first
state to have a new facility that is licensed and ready to bring on line.  We
have all been waiting for that to happen.  To see that now in some trouble
because, of all things, the federal government is not being supportive of the
land transfer and allowing development of that site to go forward is troubling
to us, because we took on this responsibility, the federal government gave it to
us, and we think we have gone forward in good faith to do that.</P>
<P>I'm not sure if that is specific enough an answer for you, Chairman Jackson.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  If I could add.  It's somewhat troubling to me becoming an
Agreement State to see an Agreement State having gone through a process of
approving issues and now some other entity that clearly does not have
radiological health and safety oversight looking at radiological health and
safety issues.  It makes you wonder who is really responsible for these issues.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  I think it's helpful to think of this in terms of what is going
on in the legislatures in the states where a facility is being developed.  It is
very difficult for state legislatures -- I'll use North Carolina as an example
-- to understand why their state has to go through all this trouble -- and it is
a lot of trouble -- to develop one of these facilities and take all the
political flak for it if Congress might change their mind at any moment.  I
think that's the perception in many host states, that Congress is not standing
behind their own policy.  They told us to develop these sites and now they are
not assisting California and they are not assisting Texas.  I think that is the
very simplified perception of many people in the host states.  They are being
given a tough job and they are not given any support and maybe we shouldn't do
this; maybe we should just wait and see, because it looks like Congress will
change its mind or the feds are changing their mind.  That's a very common
attitude, I think, in many of the host states.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  I think our reaction would be very different if it was the NRC
that was raising the concerns about the site out in California, but to have
health and safety concerns related to radiation being raised by the Department
of Interior is just inconsistent with what the federal government has said,
which is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the agency that is assigned
responsibility at the federal level for regulation of radioactive material. 
This is where the responsibility lies, not in the Department of Interior.</P>
<P>Just to move on, a second topic that we wanted to talk about this afternoon
was the future status of the low-level radioactive waste program within the
Commission.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  That was going to be my question.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  We anticipated it.</P>
<P>I indicated earlier that generally the Forum operates on the basis of
consensus.  We all sometimes have different opinions on different issues, but
this was one that we had a unified opinion on.  We did send you a letter that
indicated our concern with any reduction in efforts in the low-level radioactive
waste program that would affect the interaction that we have had historically
between your agency and the Low-Level Waste Forum.</P>
<P>We have been very fortunate to have Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff
attend our meetings.  We have been fortunate to have Commissioners, including
two of the past chairs of the Commission, come to our Forum meetings. We believe
that if there is an interest in cost reduction that one of the best ways that
you can minimize costs is to continue to have a good strong relationship with
us, because what it allows is interaction with one organization and all of us
rather than to have to deal with all of us separately. So we would encourage
continued support of the Commission of participation in our meetings and other
activities that the Forum is involved in.</P>
<P>In addition to that letter that we sent to the Commission, I think
individually many states and compacts did communicate with the Commission. 
Without speaking for them, I did happen to have an opportunity this morning to
look through the letters again.  I think for the most part everyone was in
agreement that the program should not be phased out, and I think most of the
comments were to the effect that option 2, which was a reduction in staffing,
was perhaps necessary, but I think most states expressed some concern over the
size of the reduction and felt that the size that had been recommended might
impair some of the good things that the Commission staff has done in this area.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Have you thought about what kinds of interaction should
have the greatest focus given that at least at this point most of the probable
sites are in Agreement States?</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  I think it is true, Chairman Jackson, that most of the sites
are in Agreement States.  We do have three states that, if sites are eventually
selected and license applications are submitted, will be coming to you rather
than to their state agencies.  That is Michigan, Connecticut and New Jersey.  I
know in their letters they did raise that concern, that by phasing out or
reducing significantly the staffing of the low-level waste program that it would
perhaps prevent timely licensing of facilities in those three states.</P>
<P>I had an opportunity also to look at the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste
letter, and I think they did a very good job of highlighting the areas where we
have received a significant amount of support from the program and we have
benefited from the activities of the Commission and the staff.  I think they
also did indicate some areas where they thought some reductions might not affect
the overall program.</P>
<P>I think all of us are concerned that the kind of reduction that was talked
about in the options paper might be such that it would eliminate what critical
mass is necessary to keep some sort of a program going.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Maybe I could offer the perspective of someone becoming an
Agreement State and what kind of needs we might have.  I think primarily our
particular needs would be for assistance in development of guidance.  Not
necessarily draft guidance, but review and comment on guidance that we would be
developing.</P>
<P>Some necessary research, particularly on engineered facilities.  That is
somewhat lacking.  And long-term performance, waste form performance.  That kind
of research would be particularly helpful.</P>
<P>Also, obviously some presence to provide for updating of regulations as
times change, to assist the Agreement States in that process.</P>
<P>Those are the three areas that I think would be most useful from our
standpoint.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Have you given any thought to how these things should be
paid for?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  I will be bold to say that obviously the nuclear power plants
are a very large contributor to the problem and they need the low-level waste
disposal as much as anyone.  They obviously will continue regardless of how we
proceed here with the agreement program to continue to be NRC licensees.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Just to give you another example of how an issue can arise that
is unanticipated.  I think this was mentioned in that alternatives paper.  In
trying to look ahead and determine what are the needs going to be in the future,
it is hard to say, but historically there have been things that arose that
nobody could predict that required staff time and attention.</P>
<P>Just an example of something recent has been a concept that has been
developed called assured storage, which is another type of approach that has
been suggested to developing disposal capacity in a way where it is not called
disposal; it's called storage.  I think there are many members of our
organization and states and compacts that have significant reservations about
that type of an approach to developing some way of safely managing this waste. 
The NRC had an opportunity to weigh in on that in a way that I think was
consistent with the views that many of us hold on that.</P>
<P>There are other issues like that that are going to arise in the future that
are just very unpredictable. Without being able to look to the agency that has
primary responsibility for radioactive materials and not have the ability to
consult with that agency when issues like that do arise is troubling to us.</P>
<P>Another example of an area where the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did play
a role in assisting our efforts was in California and the review that was done
by the National Academy of Sciences.  Don is very familiar with that and might
want to say a few words about that.</P>
<P>MR. WOMELDORF:  A couple of years ago some of the project opponents
identified what was seen as a misrepresentation in the license application on
the amount of plutonium slated to go to Ward Valley and raised that issue, and
it came up again at the National Academy of Sciences review recently.</P>
<P>We were pleased to see the quick response from NRC staff such as Jim
Kennedy, Andy Campbell and others to help identify why those numbers looked the
way they did.  It showed that the California decision again was supported, that
the amount of plutonium that was going to go to Ward Valley was exceedingly
small, very low, and that issue, I think, has pretty well been put to bed. 
Others are going to pop up, and California may come back to you with other
requests for information in the future, but that one seems to be quiet, at least
for the time being.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Another area that has been of continuing concern to us has been
dual regulation of radioactive materials.  There are two areas that we have been
focusing on recently.  One is the NESHAPs, the national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants, and the other has been mixed waste.  Bill is going to
talk a little bit about the NESHAPs program.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Some of the states that are in the process of licensing
facilities have had some problems with the way the NESHAPs have been handled. 
The dual pool regulation involved there in terms of recognizing it is a
legitimate radiological health and safety issue, and having two different
agencies responsible for it creates some problems.</P>
<P>We are obviously very supportive of the proposal to deal with that and the
way that proposed regulations have come out.</P>
<P>There is absolutely no reason in our mind why this shouldn't be dealt with
the same as all the other radiological health and safety issues that come up,
including the public involvement and all the other things that the states are
probably in a better position to deal with.</P>
<P>The other concern we have had about NESHAPs is because it is a separate
agency it tends to get tied up in some of these other issues that are outside of
the agreement program, like threatened and endangered species and some of the
other federal actions that are required.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Next is the other issue that is affected by dual regulation. 
Lee is going to comment briefly on that.</P>
<P>MR. MATHEWS:  Members of the Forum and others have urged for a number of
years that DOE consider accepting or investigating the acceptance at its sites
of commercial mixed waste for treatment and disposal.  There is not a whole lot
of commercial mixed waste out there.  It makes it difficult and expensive for
the states to provide separate disposal modules for this material.</P>
<P>In addition, we feel like it subjects the states to additional permitting. 
We would have to get hazardous waste licenses and permits in addition to
radioactive waste licenses.  Most of the states therefore have not made any
concrete plans for accepting mixed waste at their disposal facilities.</P>
<P>The Federal Facilities Compliance Act Task Force has put this item on their
agenda for review and have approached DOE about conducting a pilot project to
determine the feasibility of accepting certain mixed waste streams at certain of
their disposal facilities.  DOE seems favorably disposed to consider that
possibility, and we are encouraged that this should go forward and be a fruitful
area of cooperation and investigation with DOE.</P>
<P>In addition, NRC by letter dated February 9 to DOE, has encouraged DOE in
this initiative regarding the pilot project.  We are certainly happy to see some
progress made along this line.  It's worrisome to the states, and we feel like
DOE probably can provide aid in this area, and we will be looking forward to the
joint effort between the states, DOE and NRC.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Chairman Jackson, I think we have covered the subject areas
that we wanted to touch on during the course of the briefing.  I don't know if
there are any other areas that you or the Commissioners might want to ask us
about.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Commissioner Rogers.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  Not really a different area. Since we are very much
grappling with this question of what we should be doing in the low-level waste
area, I think it would be perhaps helpful if we could have even a little bit
more feedback from you folks on what you see as the kind of minimal strengths
that NRC might have, in your view.  I think that could be helpful to us in
trying to make some decisions in this area.</P>
<P>You have touched on the two major efforts in sort of general ways, namely,
helping you with regulatory activities and then helping you with technical
activities via research programs.  I think it would be helpful if perhaps we
could have a little more focus from you, and whether you all agree on that, I
don't know.  It's helpful to us to know that you think that we ought to maintain
a low-level waste program.  That's kind of a starting point for us to focus on
low-level waste, but it doesn't really help us too much when we have to make
decisions as to exactly how we are going to do this and exactly what level of
efforts might be appropriate.</P>
<P>For example, you referred to the ACNW letter to the Commission on this
subject.  It occurred to me that perhaps we could help to maintain some kind of
a national technical strength by networking technical experts in the individual
states program together with our own technical experts so that we might not
necessarily be the sole repository of technical expertise in all relevant areas
to the low-level waste disposal programs, let's say, but nevertheless we could
contribute and help to act as a coordinating resource for technical expertise in
this area.</P>
<P>That way we might be able to play an important role but not necessarily have
all of the expertise here, because I'm sure within each of your organizations
you have technical expertise.  You probably don't have all that you want,
however.  You probably don't have as many people as you would like to cover all
of the bases, but you may have some really first rate people that are real
technical experts on some key areas of the low-level waste disposal, either the
engineered barriers area, or hydrological questions.  I won't try to make a list
here, but I think you get the idea.</P>
<P>I think it would be helpful to us if you could indicate what your needs are
and how we might be able to work together with you in some way to see that those
needs are met without our necessarily being the only resource that is available.</P>
<P>Can we have some response on that?  I don't expect it to be definitive.  You
may want to think about it some more, but what is your response to perhaps
enlarging our mutual supportive roles while at the same time NRC is responding
to its need to contract its FTEs and expenditures?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  I personally think your suggesting of being a repository for
resources is probably not a bad idea.  In addition, I would suggest maybe
considering other parts to that resource.  For example, USGS; the NIST for
concrete performance.  There are a number of resources that you could muster to
help us.  I think that's a good suggestion, something I would like to think more
about.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  I'm sure we would love to be able to have everything
right here, but that isn't going to be realistic in the future.  The question
is, if we are not going to have everything, what is something that we might have
that would still be very important and very useful in the research area?</P>
<P>If you look in the regulatory area, I don't think you can look elsewhere. 
You've pointed out and the ACNW has pointed out that we can play a very useful
role there in assisting with regulatory questions at the state level.  Not
necessarily dictating them, but being a resource to look at the development of
guidance.  You've mentioned that.  But also certain aspects of regulations. 
Some of those considerations are very local, very state-oriented things that
have to be in your local and state statutes, but we can be helpful in certain
parts of that, I would think.</P>
<P>I wonder if there is any way that you could give us something that is a
little more focused than what we have just talked about today.  Is there any
mechanism that you can think of that would allow you to share your own thoughts
and then get them to us?</P>
<P>MR. STRONG:  I think we do have a lot of expertise in the state of
Washington, and on a collaborative basis I don't see why we shouldn't be working
even more closely together.  A specific example of that, not in the low-level
waste area, but earlier this week your staff and Agreement State staffs met in
Vancouver, Washington, on three issues. It was not a training workshop put on by
your staff.  It was a collaborative effort, and I don't see why we shouldn't do
much more of that specifically in this area.  It was an outstanding opportunity.
 I think we ought to capitalize on it.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  What strengths do you feel you have in the area of
performance assessment?  This is something that we have been working on here
quite hard for the last few years, particularly in the low-level waste area,
that I think has really started to look very good, very professional and
complete.  What do you folks have in your own organization with respect to
performance assessment capabilities?</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  I think from our standpoint we can certainly identify the key
issues that need to be resolved. For example, one of the issues that I think is
in dire need of more research is what is the long-term performance of a concrete
waste form.  That would be very handy to have, because you can get chemical
absorption for ten to hundreds of thousands of years without maintaining
physical stability.</P>
<P>We have been working very closely with the folks at INEL, the DOE Low-Level
Waste Technical Assistance program.  We have access to a number of computer
programs and experts out there to help us develop some of the early guidance
documents and things that we need for performance assessment.  So we have been
using other resources.  We do have some expertise on our staff, certainly, but
that is one of the areas we primarily look to the outside for expertise.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER ROGERS:  Do you within your organization share this?  In other
words, do you as representatives of individual compacts encourage your technical
people to exchange information among each other?</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  We do, Commissioner Rogers.  There is another organization that
also operates along the same lines that we do called the Technical Coordinating
Committee, which consists of representatives of host states.  In once sense I am
here representing the Midwest Compact, but the people who are really doing the
siting work are people from the state of Ohio, and they are probably the more
appropriate people to respond to your questions about performance assessment or
other specific activities that they might be engaged in that interface with DOE.
 It's probably true with Kathryn as well.</P>
<P>That is certainly something that we can also take back to our organization
and ask the states who are doing the siting work like Bill and other state
officials the question that you have raised.</P>
<P>I just want to stress that in one sense some of that activity, perhaps not
so much solely technical, is going on now with our organization and with the
NRC.  We are fortunate to have Jim Kennedy come to our Forum meetings.</P>
<P>He is there to answer questions that can cover a gamut of things, from
performance assessment to the latest position that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has on import and export of low-level radioactive waste.  He's in the
hot seat quite often during our meetings, because we have a lot of questions
about what the agency that is establishing policies regarding radioactive
materials is saying about different issues.  So that kind of interaction is
going on.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  One of the concerns that we run into, though, is host states
essentially have two responsibilities.  One is regulatory and one is site
development.  Obviously the concerns are somewhat different between the two. 
The TCC, the Technical Coordinating Committee, is more of a site development
effort.  NRC had been sponsoring meetings of the state regulators to talk about
those issues, and recently the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors
has gotten a grant from DOE to pick up a continuing workshop effort to deal with
those regulatory issues and share information about regulatory issues.  So
whatever support you could provide for the regulatory effort would be very much
appreciated.  That's really where the regulatory issues are discussed.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Commissioner Dicus.</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  One quick thing on the research effort, and I think it
goes to Commissioner Rogers' question about your mechanism for gathering
information and then putting that information together and getting it to us. You
mentioned one thing in particular that would be helpful, that perhaps the
individual states cannot do.  For example, concrete's ability to perform over
time.  Are there other particular projects that you think would be worthy of the
expenditure of time and effort on the agency's part that will be helpful to you?
 If you had a way to bring those to us, it would be helpful.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Hopefully that regulatory group that the conference is
sponsoring is the appropriate collection point for those ideas.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Bill's example is a good one insofar as it is the type of
activity that doesn't just benefit his compact because it may be looking at a
concrete container or a concrete bulk facility, but for all of our host states
that are looking at that kind of technology.  That kind of assistance from the
NRC benefits a broad number of siting efforts.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Another area that has been of concern to us that NRC has
authority over is export and import of waste.  Obviously we get a lot of
criticism and concern expressed by the public about the possibility of waste
being imported and exported.  We know there are regulations in place now.  We
certainly would like to work with you on those and make sure that what is in
those regulations is enforced.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  If there aren't any other questions, I guess we are at the end
of --</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  End of your rope?</P>
<P>[Laughter.]</P>
<P>COMMISSIONER DICUS:  One more.  You used a term a while ago.  I haven't been
away from the low-level waste arena too long, but apparently this term slipped
in on me in the meantime.  This assured storage, what is that issue or term? 
I'm not familiar with it.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  Assured storage is an alternative that has been put forward, I
think in the belief that it might result in an easier siting and development of
disposal facilities.  It is basically developing a facility, not calling it a
disposal facility, but calling it a storage facility, and going forward with
that development without the type of rigorous regulatory compliance and
performance assessment that you would go through for a 10 CFR 61 type of
facility.  I think the belief among some people is that that is easier to do
because the public may feel more comfortable with the word &quot;storage&quot;
than &quot;disposal.&quot;</P>
<P>Speaking for myself, I don't find that to be true. I think more than
anything else, when we get asked questions by citizens about what it is that we
are proposing to develop in the way of a disposal facility, they are looking for
certainty in our answers, and to be telling them that we are going to develop a
storage facility, the very next question is going to be, for how long, what's
going to happen at the end of the storage period?</P>
<P>My belief is that the approach that was taken by the NRC back when it
developed 10 CFR 61 is a correct approach, to call it disposal.  That's what we
intend to do and to subject it to the kinds of rigorous analysis that the public
expects.  There are some members of the public who don't think 10 CFR 61 is
sufficient.  To go forward and develop the kinds of facilities we are doing and
to call it storage and not have it subject to those requirements is not the
proper way to go.  That's the position that I think staff at the NRC have
communicated.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  I think from a regulatory standpoint we see the same kinds of
concerns for this long-term storage as we see for disposal.  It's materials
performance concerns; it's assurance of eventual disposal. If you go beyond 100
years, what do you do about long-term care, intruder protection?  Those same
issues still occur with this kind of a concept.  So we're not sure from a
regulatory standpoint it is really a whole lot easier to deal with.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Those are the kinds of issues that exist in the high
level waste area in spades.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  This is a concept, though, that has been given quite a bit of
attention at the state level.  So you probably will be hearing it frequently in
the future.  I know in North Carolina it has come up in several legislative
hearings.  The state licensing agency has received a number of questions about
how they would go about licensing such a facility.  So I would expect that you
would be getting those kinds of questions soon as well.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  There are some states that have expressed further interest in
it.  They want to know more about the alternative, what are the cost
implications of it. So I think there will continue to be some interest in the
alternative.</P>
<P>MR. DORNSIFE:  Just as another issue, obviously we are very much interested
in the rebaselining effort that is ongoing in the agency, and where it affects
the low-level waste program and Agreement State programs that are integral to
our efforts, we would like to be involved wherever we can in terms of helping
you with that effort.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  You will be.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  Something that has been very helpful to the Low-Level Waste
Forum and its members is having regular attendance at our meetings by your staff
members and occasionally by an actual Commissioner.  In the past we have had
attendance from a Commissioner.  I think it has happened two times.  The last
two chairs of the Commission have attended our Forum meetings.</P>
<P>We purposely schedule our meetings so that at least one of them is in the
Washington area to make that a little bit more convenient for you.  As I said,
even if we are outside the region, we normally have a member of your staff to
attend.  Jim Kennedy and sometimes others.  That is enormously helpful for us. 
It is very efficient and effective.  It saves all of us having to come back and
forth to Washington all the time, and for your staff, I'm sure, to travel all
over the country.  It helps us to know what issues are on your minds before you
make decisions, and likewise I'm sure you are kept informed on the issues that
are important to us.</P>
<P>We would like to ask you to continue to support your staff in attending our
meetings and for you to attend as well when you can.  Our next meeting in the
Washington area is May 29 through 31, and that's in Annapolis.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Well, you have your sister here.  In addition, I respond
to invitations.</P>
<P>MS. HAYNES:  Thank you.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  I think with that we are done.  I would like to do one other
thing.  It was an oversight on our part not to recognize the efforts of Andy
Campbell on your staff, who was very helpful to us in working through the
question of the amount of plutonium going into the Ward Valley facility and
assisting the NAS panel with that.  We very much appreciated his help.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  Thank you.</P>
<P>MR. LARSON:  With that, thank you very much for your time this afternoon.</P>
<P>CHAIRMAN JACKSON:  I would like to thank all of you representing the
Low-Level Waste Forum for what I thought was a really informative and useful
briefing. Obviously this is an issue that has to be addressed, given some of the
things you pointed out, in a thorough but timely manner.  It looks like there is
some progress from what you are telling us, but as I always say, there is always
room for improvement.  You are clearly working to do your part in trying to move
the siting process along.</P>
<P>As I try to capture what you have said and what my fellow Commissioners have
said, it is clear that going forward appropriate partnering of resources between
what is available in the states and here merits serious consideration in
addition to any specific technical assistance that NRC can uniquely provide.  We
have to consider that as part of our ongoing rebaselining assessments, et
cetera.</P>
<P>As Commissioner Rogers has said, and you have identified a number of things
here, some focused input that is more comprehensive even than what you have
already outlined on these issues from you would be helpful to us and especially
helpful to me since I'm a visual learner.</P>
<P>Again, I would like to thank all of you for an excellent briefing.  Unless
my fellow Commissioners have any additional comments, we are adjourned.</P>
<P>[Whereupon, at 2:10 p.m., the meeting was adjourned.]</P>

<BODY><H1>Welcome to NIRSNET on the Web</H1>
<P><A HREF="nirsweb.gif"><IMG SRC="nirsweb.gif"></A>
</P>
<P>Welcome to NIRSNET on the Web! NIRS was perhaps the first environmental
organization in the U.S. to establish a computer bulletin board (BBS) for its
members, back in 1983. Over the years, NIRSNET had its ups and downs, but always
has been limited to NIRS' members. Now, we are trying a new experiment--moving
NIRS' website in-house-- and putting the essence of NIRSNET, its voluminous
files, on the Web for all to access. Some files are hyperlinked. As time goes
on, we plan to add more features to this site--many of these likely will be
accessible only to NIRS members. If you're not a member, please join now. For
more information, contact NIRS at <A HREF="mailto:nirsnet@igc.apc.org">nirsnet@igc.apc.org</A>
or call 202-328-0002. Thanks. We hope NIRSNET on the Web meets your needs. You
may also send your suggestions for improvement and comments to the above e-mail
address directly from this site.

<BODY>
<P>BANNED RUSSIAN REPORT AVAILABLE ON THE WEB.</P>
<P>The Bellona report &quot;The Russian Northern Fleet - Sources of Radioactive
contamination&quot; was banned in Russia following the St. Petersburg customs
confiscation and destruction of 1505 copies on Oct. 18.</P>
<P>The Bellona report on the Russian Northern Fleet is the first book to be
prohibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The prohibition
constitutes the most severe setback to the freedom of speech in the new Russia
to date. In addition, this decision violates the Russian constitution, which
states that everybody is free to publish literature which does not sympathise
with nazism.</P>
<P>The constitution emphasises in particular, that it is not legal to keep
information on environmental conditions secret. The Bellona report is based on
open sources in its entirety, describing the problems concerning nuclear wastes
and submarines in the northern Russian region.</P>
<P>This report is the foundation of the spy and treason charges against jailed
Bellona co-worker Alexandr Nikitin. Nikitin is in custody in St. Petersburg
since Feb. 6 this year. Nikitin is co-author of the report.</P>
<P>Full Norwegian and English versions of the report are already available on
the web. As of today, Russian versions are available also in both KOI-8 and
windows character encodings:</P>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">
<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="Preferred Customer">
</HEAD> 
<BODY><H1>THE LEGACY OF CHERNOBYL</H1>
<P>There are 107 licensed nuclear power reactors in the United States
today, located in 71 sites in 33 states. While none of the U.S. reactors
resemble the Chernobyl reactor that melted down in April 1986, the
questions remain: How safe are nuclear power plants? What are the
effects of even the minimum allowed dosage of radiation?</P>
<P>Nearly ten years after the core meltdown of Chernobyl's Number 4
reactor, citizens of the former Soviet Union, particularly in Ukraine
and nearby Byelorussia, are still unsure about the levels of radiation
to which they were exposed. And they are still debating its effects.</P>
<P>There is no safe level of radiation, according to Soviet radiologist
Elena Burlakova, who has studied Chernobyl survivors. She believes
long-term, low-level exposure, as experienced after the Chernobyl
meltdown, is particularly harmful. &quot;Our bodies do not possess the
ability to adapt to the prolonged exposure to low levels of stimuli,&quot;
she says.
&quot;When we are exposed to radiation, we are more vulnerable to other
harmful substances in our environment.&quot;
</P><P>Not surprisingly, Burlakova's ideas were largely ignored by
Soviet officials trying to control the chronic unrest following the
Chernobyl plant accident.</P>
<P>Burlakova is one of the scientists that Ukrainian journalist Alla
Yaroshinskaya interviews in CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH, published in
October by the University of Nebraska Press ($10 paperback).
Yaroshinskaya also talks with a number of Chernobyl survivors, among
them people who were relocated from villages near the plant to areas
that were only slightly less contaminated by radiation.</P>
<P>&quot;Alla Yaroshinskaya's description of the repression of
scientists and physicians and the suppression of scientific information
in the former USSR provides blatant examples of what it means to have
governments sponsoring nuclear research and health evaluation,&quot;
according to American biologist John Gofman.</P>
<P>&quot;To all people who care about their personal health and the
health of future generations - and all who care about the ecology of our
planet: Read and take very seriously the true meaning of Alla
Yaroshinskaya's CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH,&quot; writes Gofman.</P>
<P>An emeritus professor of molecular and cell biology at the
University of California at Berkeley, Gofman shared the Right Livelihood
Award - called the &quot;alternative Nobel&quot; - with Yaroshinskaya in
1992.</P>
<HR><H2>ABOUT THE BOOK</H2> <P>
In CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH, translated by Michele Kahn and Julia
Sallabank, Ukrainian journalist Alla Yaroshinskaya chronicles the
bureaucratic and scientific corruption as well as the human tragedy
following the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
<P>As the book begins, she recalls the panic immediately following the
accident, including her own brief escape to Moscow and the Caucasus with
her two small sons. Only too soon, however, she had to return to Ukraine
to resume work.</P>
<P>The following summer, she followed a hunch to the Narodichi district
of Ukraine, near Chernobyl. &quot;We learned that four villages . . .
had been evacuated because of the lethal level of radiation prevalent
there. According to the media (among them our paper), the inhabitants
had been evacuated to safe zones where everything had been provided for
them. . . .
&quot;What aroused my suspicions was the fact that the houses for the
evacuees were being built in the immediate vicinity of Chernobyl, right
next to the forbidden zone,&quot; she writes.</P>
<P>Without authorization from her newspaper or national leaders,
Yaroshinskaya began to investigate, uncovering shocking misinformation
and insufficient relief efforts. A local official showed her a map of
the Narodichi district indicating radioactive pollution throughout.
People were relocated within miles of contaminated areas and not
provided with adequate food, heaters, or medical care. Eighty percent of
the children in the district suffered from thyroid problems, despite
official government claims to the contrary.</P>
<P>Yaroshinskaya's own newspaper and several others refused to publish
her reports, despite the budding national policy of glasnost, but she
continued her investigations and, after repeated tries, published a few
articles in Pravda and Isvestia. She has continued to call for complete
public access to governmental records surrounding the accident. Since
her election to the Soviet parliament in 1989, she has used her
political influence to press for governmental accountability and
continued assistance for Chernobyl survivors.</P>
<P>To order a copy of CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH, please call the
University of Nebraska Press at 1-800-755-1105 or fax 1-800-526-2617.</P>
<HR><H2>Early Praise for CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH</H2><P> 
&quot;Yaroshinskaya details the tragedies that continue to plague
hundreds of contaminated Ukrainian villages and millions of people, as
well as the continued efforts toward a cover-up. . . . Readers will find
this a convincing, absorbing, alarming, and important book.&quot; -
Publishers Weekly</P>
<P>&quot;Yaroshinskaya presents a moving account of the ongoing effects
of Chernobyl, and a searing indictment of the government response to
them. . . . a book of the greatest importance to anyone concerned with
the dangers of high technology set loose without proper concern for
public safety.&quot; - Kirkus Reviews</P>
<P>&quot;Chernobyl is a vivid, first-hand account of the author's long
but ultimately victorious struggle against Soviet officialdom, which
sought to suppress bad news, to blame the accident on low-level
operators rather than policy-makers, and to ascribe widespread panic to
sinister foreign influences.&quot; - David MacRae, cotranslator of THE
TRUTH ABOUT CHERNOBYL and NO BREATHING ROOM: THE AFTERMATH OF CHERNOBYL</P>
<HR><H2>from CHERNOBYL: THE FORBIDDEN TRUTH</H2>
<P>&quot;On May 1 [May Day 1986] in all the town and villages of
Ukraine, Byelorussia, Russia, the Baltic lands, as in previous years,
millions of people lined the streets. Children dressed in national
costume, breathing radioactive fumes, danced on the main street of the
Ukrainian capital. . . .
&quot;Rumours were all around us. After the first of May they began to
snowball. The radio and newspaper told us one thing, then people coming
from the worst hit areas told us another. All seats on trains and planes
leaving Kiev were booked up for months ahead. People were at their wit's
end, terrified by the unknown, and were storming the trains. They wanted
to go away, anywhere as far as possible from Chernobyl.&quot; (pp 17-18)
&quot;[In Mirni, Narodichi district] the peasants asked me to walk with
them along the two roads of the new village. Many of the houses were
empty. In four of the new buildings, the floorboards had been torn up
and pesticide-impregnated earth had been thrown out of the windows. One
of my companions joked: 'We don't even have flies here, they're all
dead.' A light breeze wafted the nauseating smell of ammonia towards us.
&quot;In some houses it was very cold. The heaters had blown up. 'The
bosses say that old people don't know how to use the heating properly.'.
. .
&quot;I wanted to know how the evacuees were provided with 'clean' food.
The manager of the shop complained that she was sent disgusting bread,
burnt, inedible. There was no mineral water. There was not always enough
meat to go round. Those who worked could not buy it in the daytime, and
after work there was hardly ever any left. There was no smoked fish. No
chickens. From time to time, there were ducks. There was fruit juice.
The ration allocated from on high was roughly: one kilo of buckwheat and
millet, two tins of condensed milk per month for each evacuee.&quot;
(pp. 29-30)</P>
<P>&quot;After Boris Yeltsin's decree [in 1991] outlawing the Communist
Party, the archives were opened and we at last received the secret
protocols of the meetings of the Politburo's operational group which
dealt with matters arising from the Chernobyl accident and the clean-up.
. . .
&quot;Reading through these unique documents, it occurred to me that the
most dangerous isotope to escape from the mouth of the reactor did not
appear on the periodic table. It was not 'Cs-137' (the isotope of
Caesium). It was 'Lie-86.' A lie as global as the disaster itself.&quot;

<H2>MINUTES OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</H2>
<H2>COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, STATE OF CALIFORNIA</H2>
<P>Joanne Sturges, Executive Officer</P>
<P>Clerk of the Board of Supervisors</P>
<P>383 Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration</P>
<P>Los Angeles, California 90012</P>
<P>At its meeting held January 23, 1996, the Board took the following action:</P>
<P>7</P>
<P>Supervisor Antonovich made the following statement:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Legislation currently before the Congress, H.R. 1020
(Johnston), would move all the spent nuclear fuel rods in the United States from
their present location at Nuclear-Reactor sites to Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for
'interim' storage. One problem with concentrating all of these nuclear fuel rods
at one location is that it would require the shipment of 15,000 casks of nuclear
fuel along common-use roads and railways over a 30-year period. In particular,
there would be heavy traffic of radioactive nuclear waste through the Antelope
Valley along the rail line that passes directly through the middle of Lancaster
and Palmdale. Imposing on one part of the Country the dangers implicit in a
solution to a nationwide problem is unreasonable.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Therefore, on motion of Supervisor Antonovich, seconded by Supervisor Burke,
unanimously carried, the Board took the following actions:</P>
<P>a. Went on record in opposition to H.R. 1020 in its current form which would
move all spent nuclear fuel rods in the United States from their present
location at nuclear-reactor sites to Yucca Mountain, Nevada for &quot;interim&quot;
storage;</P>
<P>b. Endorsed in principle the concept of regional nuclear waste disposal
sites; and</P>
<P>c. Instructed the Executive Officer of the Board to request the Federal
government, in the event of the passage of H.R. 1020, to use remote rail and
highway routes that bypass the Antelope Valley and other population centers in
Los Angeles County.</P>

<BODY>
<H3>RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</H3>
<H3>OF THE COUNTY OF SANTA BARBARA, STATE OF CALIFORNIA</H3>
<H3>RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE TRANSPORTATION</H3>
<H3>OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL AND RADIOACTIVE      RESOLUTION NO. 96-l9</H3>
<H3>WASTE THROUGH SANTA BARBARA COUNTY</H3>
<P>WHEREAS it is the primary responsibility of local government to assure the
safety of its citizens; and </P>
<P>WHEREAS, in order to do so a local government must be able to guarantee the
safest possible transportation of hazardous material through its communities and
densely populated areas; and </P>
<P>WHEREAS, the proximity of Santa Barbara County to the Diablo Canyon Nuclear
Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County and the eventual need to transport spent
nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste to either an interim or permanent
national repository makes the possibility of the transportation of such waste
material through Santa Barbara County a real and critical  public safety
concern; and </P>
<P>WHEREAS, Santa Barbara County is concerned about the potential
transportation of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste via the major freeway
route of north or southbound Highway 101 and the adjacent Southern Pacific
railroad corridor through major population centers; and </P>
<P>WHEREAS,   for  reasons  related to the unique physical characteristics of
Southern Santa Barbara, the only major public transportation systems in and out
of Santa Barbara towards the north or the south are US Highway 101 and the
Southern Pacific railroad corridor adjacent to Highway 101, and </P>
<P>WHEREAS,  an experience with the July l99l Southern Pacific train derailment
in the Seacliff area near the boundaries of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties
and the June 1990 Painted Cave fire in Santa  Barbara County has shown,  the
Santa Barbara area is particularly susceptible to isolation and the attendant
public safety concerns in the event of a public emergency or disaster; and </P>
<P>WHEREAS an accident involving nuclear waste could endanger thousands of
people if it were to occur along this area's major freeway corridor, and
decontamination could take a very extended period of time.                      
              . </P>
<P>NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Barbara County Board of
supervisors opposes the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive
waste through populated areas of Santa Barbara County, and urges appropriate
federal and state authorities to develop a national policy for transporting
spent nuclear fuel and </P>
<P>radioactive waste that would: </P>
<OL>
<LI>  Mandate public safety as the highest priority; 
</LI>
<LI>  Mandate transportation of these hazardous materials along the least
populated         transportation corridors available, 
</LI>
<LI>  Provide adequate disaster funding and training to local public safety
authorities of        communities affected by such routing. 
</LI>
</OL>
<P>PASSED AND ADOPTED by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa
Barbara, State of California, this 23rd day of January 1996. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>San Luis Obispo county resolution</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H3>RESOLUTION</H3>
<P>WHEREAS, radioactive spent fuel waste may be transported through San Luis
Obispo County should Senate bills 167, 433, 1271 and HR 1020 be enacted by
Congress,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, if federal and state legislation should authorize a &quot;low
level&quot; depository at Ward Valley, such nuclear wastes would be transported
through the county,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, low-level nuclear waste contains long-lived radioactive
isotopes such as plutonium,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, lives, health, and properties of San Luis Obispo County
residents living along transportation routes will be unnecessarily endangered by
possible accidents, incidents, sabotage, terrorism, etc.,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, even during incident/accident-free transportation, health
risks exist to persons living adjacent to routes due to the accumulation of
repeated radiation exposures allowed under the proposed legislation,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, according to the US Department of Energy's own studies, an
accident during the transport of nuclear waste could contaminate an area 4 1/2
times the size of the city of San Luis Obispo, and cause years of clean-up and
evacuation to parts of the county, at a cost of up to $10 billion,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, San Luis Obispo County or the incorporated cities do not have
adequately trained emergency response personnel or equipment to cope with a
radioactive disaster that could occur as a result of radioactive waste
transportation through the county,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, unless fully funded by federal government, HR 10, S1271, S 443
and S 167 and other similar legislation would create an unfunded mandate to SLO
County local governments with regard to the training and equipping of an
emergency response team to cope with a nuclear catastrophe,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, property values are likely to fall, attraction of new business
is likely to fail, and improvement of the incorporated cities of SLO County as
well as its non incorporated urbanized areas may become difficult if not
impossible should radioactive waste be transported through SLO County or the
incorporated cities, resulting in a significant drop in revenue,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, SLO County's tourist, wine, and agricultural industries would
be negatively impacted by the transportation of nuclear waste through the
county,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, the continued production of nuclear power by nuclear power
plants will create additional transportation problems in the disposal of their
radioactive waste,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, hundreds, if not thousands, of heavy-truck shipments would
place an additional burden on road maintenance within SLO County and its
incorporated cities,</P>
<P>and, WHEREAS, safer, less costly, renewable energy technology exists</P>
<P>NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of San Luis Obispo opposes
radioactive waste transportation through our jurisdiction,</P>
<P>and, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of San Luis Obispo supports the
renewable energy alternatives to nuclear power,</P>
<P>and, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of San Luis Obispo is on record as
opposing Senate Bills 167, 443, 1271, and HR 1020 and all similar legislation
which would require radioactive waste transportation near or through SLO County
or through the incorporated cities, </P>
<P>and, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of San Luis Obispo supports Senate Bill
544 which suspends transportation and calls for the creation of an independent
presidential commission to re-examine our nation's radioactive waste policy,</P>
<P>and, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of San Luis Obispo will carry this
resolution to all of our elected local, state, and general officials and to the
President of the United States.</P>

<BODY>
<H3>City and County of Denver</H3>
<H3>Resolution No. 26, Series 1996</H3>
<H3>Requesting that the Colorado Congressional Delegation oppose Senate Bill
1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995.</H3>
<P>Whereas, passage of Senate Bill 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995,
would:</P>
<UL>
<LI>authorize and direct the construction of an interim storage facility at
Yucca Mountain in Nevada;
</LI>
<LI>preempt state and local environmental and safety laws;
</LI>
<LI>allow transportation of high-level nuclear waste (irradiate nuclear fuel)
on a large scale;  and
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Whereas, irradiated nuclear fuel is extremely dangerous and it has been
estimated that 2,347 truck casks (each cask may be as large as 125 tons) and 180
rail casks will be shipped through Colorado; and</P>
<P>Whereas, the proposed highway route is I-70 from Kansas to Denver to Utah,
and the proposed rail route runs from St. Vrains to Denver to Greeley to
Cheyenne;  and </P>
<P>Whereas, a risk analysis of all corridors and methods of transportation
needs to be complete before transportation of nuclear waste begins;  and</P>
<P>Whereas, it is essential that proposed routes of transport are not those
corridors that the City is studying and proposing for further development of
commuter rail (such as routes between downtown Denver and the airport); and </P>
<P>Whereas , Senate Bill 1271 would limit the availability of funds to assist
communities should nuclear transport accidents occur;</P>
<P>Now, Therefore,</P>
<P>Be it Resolved by the Council of the City and County of Denver:</P>
<P>Section 1.  That the Council of the City and County of Denver urge the
Colorado Congressional Delegation and members of the Energy and Natural Resource
Committee to oppose Senate Bill 1271.</P>
<P>Section 2.  That the Council of the City and County of Denver encourages the
Congress to consider all ramifications of nuclear waste transportation before
any transportation efforts begin.</P>
<P>Section 3.  That the Clerk of the City and County of Denver shall attest and
affix the seal of the City ad County of Denver to this resolution, and that a
copy hereof be transmitted to each member of the Colorado Congressional
Delegation and members of the Energy and Natural Resource Committee.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>St. Louis resolution</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>RESOLUTION NUMBER 269</H1>
<P>WHEREAS, we have been advised of legislation pending in the United States
Congress, HR1020/S.1271, titled the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995, which
could lead to the transport, by railway and highway, of shipments of high level
radioactive waste through the Metropolitan St. Louis Area; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS, the shipments would consist of spent fuel rods which have been
stockpiled for decades at several dozen reactors throughout the Eastern and
Southern parts of this country; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS, in March 1987, a train transporting radioactive waste from the
Three Mile Island reactor was involved in a collision with a stalled automobile
at the intersection of Macklind and Manchester Avenues, vividly reminding us
that accidents can happen at any time; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS, there are many unanswered questions regarding the safe, permanent
storage of radioactive waste; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS, since the City of St. Louis is without sufficient emergency
personnel, equipment, and financial resources to safeguard its residents in the
event of an unpredictable, major nuclear accident, it is clear that the shipment
of nuclear waste materials through the City of St. Louis represents an
undesirable risk.</P>
<P>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the City of St.
Louis that we are opposed to any federal or state legislation which would permit
the transportation of radioactive waste through the Metropolitan St. Louis area
until such time as a permanent solution has been found to growing national
problem and we further request that the Missouri Congressional delegation, along
with Governor Carnahan and the Missouri Public Safety Director, work together to
defeat such legislation for the benefit of all residents of the State of
Missouri and we direct the Clerk of this Board to send a copy of this Resolution
to the members of the Missouri Congressional delegation, Governor Carnahan, and
the Public Safety Director for the State of Missouri upon adoption by this
Board.</P>
<P>Introduced on the 15th day of March, 1996 by;</P>

<H3>RESOLUTION </H3>
<P>Calling for a national independent commission to review United States
radioactive waste policy.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, The Department of Energy plans to move high level nuclear waste to
Nevada through 43 states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, beginning in
1998, under the provisions of H R.1020; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS, Pennsylvania can expect 3,S79 truck casks and 2,190 rail casks to

likely to fail, and improvement of Mount Rainier may become difficult if not
impossible should radioactive waste be transported through Mount Rainier; and
</P>
<P>WHEREAS, this radioactive waste is to be transported to an &quot;interim&quot;

Bill 167 and all similar legislation which would require radioactive waste
transportation near or through our communities; and </P>

<BODY><HR>
<CENTER><H2>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1936 (Senate - July 11, 1996) </H2></CENTER>
 
<P>Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for an agreement with regard to <B>nuclear
waste</B> . I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration
of S. 1936, the <B>nuclear waste</B>  bill, on Tuesday, July 23, at 12 noon,
and immediately after the bill is called up, the majority leader be recognized
for the purpose of filing a cloture motion on the bill, and there then be 15
minutes for debate prior to the cloture vote.
</P>
<P>This is the latest version. The time is equally divided in the usual form,
with the cloture vote occurring at 2:15 on Tuesday, July 23. If cloture is
invoked, the bill will immediately be laid aside and it will become the pending
business on Tuesday, September 3, 1996, at a time to be determined by the two
leaders; and following final passage of the bill, if in the affirmative, then it
would be in order for the Senate to insist on its amendments, if applicable,
request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint
conferees on the part of the Senate, all without further action or debate.
</P>
<P>The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I object.
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire of the Senator from Nevada what his objection is
to that?
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I would be happy to state my objection. As you know, the Senators
from Nevada have worked with the majority leader, with those on the other side
of the aisle who are proponents of this legislation. We have had an exchange of
proposals, as the majority leader knows, during the course of this afternoon.
</P>
<P>The latest proposal that was brought back by the other side of the aisle had
a provision in it which had not previously been discussed and was unacceptable,
so we could not accept it.
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. The provision with regard to going to conference?
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. That is the provision that had not heretofore been discussed, as
the majority leader knows, and we had assumed within the parameters of what was
being discussed all rights would be reserved under rule XXII, including any
options that might be available to us in the event that this legislation moved
to conference.
</P>
<P>So it was on that basis that we interposed our objection.
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. I want to make sure I understood. I just note that if every
opportunity was taken with regard to going to conference, that could lead to at
least three more votes, three more debatable motions, and would take up days,
and therefore without that, we have accomplished almost nothing with that.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I do have the right to object. I think there has been an
objection. I say respectfully to my friend the majority leader and to the
minority leader, we have an obligation to move legislation along here. We agree
with the statement of the majority leader, we should move legislation, but take
it a step at a time.
</P>
<P>What we thought we were doing, the Senators from Nevada, is moving this--we
were jumping two steps. We were willing to do away with those, but we cannot
waive all of our rights, and we know how important it is to move legislation. We
felt that by going directly to the Defense appropriations bill, getting that
</P>
<P>completed, doing other things that will be able to be completed, without the
two Senators from Nevada exercising their rights--under the rules, we felt we
were doing the country and the two leaders here, in effect, a favor, but to have
us avoid three or four different procedural moves that we have, seems to be a
little bit too much.
</P>
<P>We appreciate you trying to work with us. I object.

<P><EM>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1894 (Senate - July 11, 1996) </EM></P>
<P></P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. I yield for a question.
</P>
<P>Mrs. BOXER. As I listened to the Senator from Alaska, there is a way to
break through all this.
</P>
<P>As I hear the Senators in Nevada, they will not object to moving to the
defense bill at all. As a matter of fact, as long as I have known them, they
have worked hard on those bills, as hard as anyone else here. But they are
saying, if this particular bill dealing with <B>nuclear waste</B>  would be
pulled, they would not object. If I might ask my friends, are they not saying
that the reason they are objecting is because they are bringing this <B>nuclear
waste</B>  bill forward?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield so that I may answer the question?
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. I yield for the Senator to answer the question.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from California, I am a supporter of this
bill. I am on the Appropriations Committee. One of the most troubling things I
have done since I have been in the Senate is to have my friend, the senior
Senator from Hawaii, come to me and say, `Can we move this bill?' and I say,
`No.' There is no one in the Senate I have more respect for than the senior
Senator from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>We feel that the shoe is on the other foot. We are not the ones holding
things up. It is being held up because they are moving on this bill, which the
President said he is going to veto. Maybe we cannot continue this forever. But
it is going to take weeks of the Senate's time on <B>nuclear waste</B> .
</P>
<P>We know what our rights are, and we felt that we offered a reasonable
proposal to move this along, get the appropriations bills done before the
September reconvening of the Senate. But this is an issue that is important. It
is important not only to the people in the State of Nevada but for this country.
And for us to say we are going to walk away from this would be something that we
cannot do.
</P>
<PRE>[Page: S7753]</PRE>
<P>Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the comments. Again, I have
said several times today that I understand the feelings of the Senators from
Nevada. I am sympathetic to them. But this legislation has been crafted very
carefully, in a bipartisan way, by the committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee. It has been in the making literally for years. I am
under the impression that 65 Senators will vote to end the debate on this, will
vote for cloture.
</P>
<P>How can the majority leader refuse to bring up a bill and try to pass a bill
of this consequence, which involves radioactive <B>nuclear waste</B> , when 65
Senators want an opportunity to vote on it? Now, I understand how they feel, but
two Senators are thwarting the wishes of 65 Senators and their constituents all
across America. I have no option but to bring up legislation of this importance,
which involves that many States with that many Senators.
</P>
<P>Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the majority leader this. I understand his point, but
74 or so Senators voted for the minimum wage, and we do not seem to get action
on that. So it is a matter of priorities, I say.
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. You got action on it because I worked with your leader and we made
it happen, and it is going to be acted on and wind up on the President's desk.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more question?
</P>
<P>Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to, sure.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I say, respectfully, to the majority leader, with whom I served in
the House in a leadership position there and now in a leadership position here,
that we know you have the right to bring this up. But, also, I, the Senator from
Nevada,
</P>
<P>did not work out these rules. These rules were worked out many years ago. It
started with the Constitution and the Senate rules that are in existence. I did
not draw them up. I am just playing by the rules. The majority leader knew--or
should have known, as we say in the law--that this would happen. You are--and I
do not mean `you' in the pejorative sense--holding up the progress; we are not.
We could move on and we could have this bill passed, the one now before the
body, our defense appropriations bill. </P>

<P>Mr. BRYAN. A further question of the Senator, if the Senator will yield.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I think the Senator's point was that the population numbers that
I read of part of those cities represents the corporate city limits, and I
believe the Senator's point, if I understood him correctly, is that each of
these communities are part of a metropolitan area. As the Senator pointed out,
in our hometown of Las Vegas, there are roughly a million people in the
metropolitan area who would be directly and adversely impacted by a rail or
highway accident. Yet, Las Vegas is listed for purposes of population as
258,000. I believe, if I understood the Senator's point, in addition to the
population indicated here, there are suburban communities that would be
populated as well, perhaps even greater.

<P><EM>NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT (Senate - July 10, 1996) </EM></P>
<P></P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my colleague for a question.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. If I understand what the Senator is saying, this is absolutely
astounding. Is the Senator suggesting that the EPA has said, as a safe drinking
standard for America, 4 millirems? That is per year?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. Four millirems is the correct answer.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. As the Senator well knows, the WIPP is a facility in New Mexico
designed to receive transuranic <B>nuclear waste</B> . Is the Senator
indicating for the good citizens of New Mexico, 15 millirems?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. And that the citizens in the State of Nevada--we were admitted to
the Union, if I recall, before the good State of New Mexico--but somehow for the
rest of America, they have a 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water, at
another <B>nuclear</B>  storage area in our country they are proposing 15
millirems, but in the State of Nevada from a sole source, a single source, they
are suggesting that Nevadans would have to accept a standard of 100 millirems
from one source on an annual basis? Is that what they are suggesting?
</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<PRE>[Page: S7638]</PRE>
<P>Mr. REID. My colleague is absolutely right, absolutely right. In Nevada they
are saying, `We're going to pour this cement pad and dump this out. If it leads
to 100 millirems exposure, that is OK.' That is what they are saying.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I must say, it prompts the question in this Senator's mind. There
must be more to this than we understand. Somehow, in a deliberative chamber,
that there would be a suggestion made that health and safety standards, which
presumably are legislated for the Nation, and with each of us entitled to equal
protection under the law, and presumably I would think we would be entitled to
equal protection in terms of health and safety standards, that a Congress which
purports to be interested and concerned with the rights and sovereignty of
States, individual States, would suggest that one State out of the Nation, and
one State alone, would have a standard applied to that State that is 25 times
the safe standard for safe drinking water and would be more than 6 times the
standard that the citizens of our southwestern State, New Mexico, would be
subjected to for the transuranic, that somehow we have a standard of 100
millirems.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The answer is yes. As the Senator from
North Dakota, in questions to this Senator earlier in the day asked, is there
any reason for that? No. There is no scientific basis. There is no scientific
theory. There are only people who want to jam this down the throats of the
people in Nevada saying, `Don't worry about it. It will be OK.'
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I must say, the thought occurs to this Senator, and the question
arises in this Senator's mind, that why would any legislative body seek to
impose a standard on a single State that no other Member of this body would be
willing to accept for his or her State, when what we are talking about is health
and safety? We are talking about potential dangers from the standpoint of
cancer,
</P>
<P>genetic health problems, all of which, as I recall, we experience currently
as a result of some of the atmospheric experiences in Nevada State in the 1950's
and 1960's.
</P>
<P>(Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada, the question is absolutely
pertinent. The answer is, we do not know why that standard is set. There is no
scientific basis. There is none whatever.
</P>
<P>It goes to show how maybe the two Senators from Nevada were not such great
advocates after all to get the President of the United States to agree to veto
this. For Heaven's sake, why would we? On this basis alone, the President should
veto this legislation. On this basis alone, he should veto this legislation,
notwithstanding the fact that they are trying to change the substantive law in
effect since 1982, that you could not have a permanent site and a temporary site
in the same State. The President of the United States has many, many reasons to
veto this bill. That is why he has said he will veto the bill.

<BODY><HR>
<CENTER><H2>THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1996 (Senate - July 10, 1996)
</H2></CENTER>  
<P>Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as we reach the final days of the 104th Congress,
an urgent environmental problem remains unresolved. However, unlike many issues,
fortunately the question of how to deal with this Nation's high-level <B>nuclear
waste</B>  has an answer that is responsible, fair, environmentally friendly and
supported by members of both parties.
</P>
<P>Today, high level <B>nuclear waste</B>  and highly radioactive used <B>nuclear</B>
 fuel is accumulating at more than 80 sites in 41 States. Each year, as that
increases, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at each of these
sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. The only responsible choice is
to support legislation that solves this problem by safely moving this used fuel
to a safe, monitored facility in the remote Nevada desert. This answer will lead
us to a safer future for all Americans.
</P>
<P>To facilitate our consideration of such legislation, yesterday I, along with
Senator <STRONG>Murkowski</STRONG>, introduced S. 1936, a bill to amend the
<B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Policy Act of 1982, and it was placed on the calendar. S.
1936 retains the fundamental goals and structure of the substitute for S. 1271
that was reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last March.
</P>
<P>However, S. 1936 contains many important clarifications and changes that
deal with concerns raised regarding the details of that legislation by Members
of this body. In addition, we took into account the provisions of H.R. 1020,
which was reported out of the House Commerce Committee on an overwhelming
bipartisan vote last year. We adopted much of the language found in H.R. 1020 in
order to make the bill as similar to the bill under consideration in the House
as possible.
</P>
<P>I would like to describe some of the most significant of these changes. S.
1936 eliminates certain provisions contained in S. 1271 that would have limited
the application of the National Environmental Policy Act to the intermodal
transfer facility and imposed a general limitation on NEPA's application to the
Secretary's actions to only those NEPA requirements specified in the bill. This
was to allay the concern that sufficient environmental analysis would not be
done under S. 1271.
</P>
<P>S. 1936 clarifies that transportation of spent fuel shall be governed by all
requirements of Federal, State, and local governments and Indian tribes to the
same extent that any person engaging in transportation in interstate commerce
must comply with those requirements. S. 1936 also allows that the Secretary
provide technical assistance and
</P>
<P>funds for training to Unions with experience in safety training for
transportation workers. In addition, S. 1936 clarifies that existing employee
protections in title 49, United States Code in connection with refusal to work
in hazardous conditions apply to transportation under this act. It also provides
that certain inspection activities will be carried out by carmen and operating
crews only if they are adequately trained. Finally, S. 1936 provides authority
for the Secretary of Transportation to establish training standards, as
necessary, for workers engaged in the transportation, storage and disposal of
spent fuel and high-level <B>waste</B> .
</P>
<P>In order to ensure that the size and scope of the interim storage facility
is manageable in the context of the overall <B>nuclear waste</B>  program, and
yet adequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel storage needs, S. 1936
would limit the size of phase I of the interim storage facility to 15,000 metric
tons of spent fuel, and the size of phase II of the facility to 40,000 metric
tons. Phase II of the facility would be expandable to 60,000 metric tons if the
Secretary fails to meet her projected goals with regard to site characterization
and licensing of the permanent repository site. In contrast, S. 1271 provided
for storage of 20,000 metric tons of spent fuel in phase I and 100,000 metric
tons in phase II.
</P>
<P>Unlike S. 1271, which provided for unlimited use of existing facilities at
the Nevada Test Site for handling spent fuel at the interim facility, S. 1936
allows only the use of those facilities for emergency situations during phase I
of the interim facility. These facilities should not be needed during phase I
and construction of new facilities will be overseen by the <B>Nuclear</B> 
Regulatory Commission for any fuel handling during phase II of the interim
facility.
</P>
<P>S. 1271 would have set the standard for releases of radioactivity from the
repository at a maximum annual dose to an average member of the general
population in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain at 100 millirem.
</P>
<P>The 100 millirem standard is fully consistent with current national and
international standards designed to protect public health and safety and the
environment. While maintaining an initial 100 millirem standard, S. 1936 would
allow the <B>Nuclear</B>  Regulatory Commission to apply another standard if it
finds that the standard in the legislation would pose an unreasonable risk to
the health and safety of the public.
</P>
<P>S. 1936 contains provisions not found in S. 1271 that would grant financial
and technical assistance for oversight activities and payments in lieu of taxes
to affected units of local government and Indian tribes within the State of
Nevada. S. 1936 also contains new provisions transferring certain Bureau of Land
Management parcels to Nye County, NV.
</P>
<P>In order to ensure that monies collected for the <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Fund
are utilized for purposes of the <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Program, beginning in
fiscal year 2003, S. 1936 would convert the current <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Fee
that is paid by electricity consumers into a user fee that is assessed based
upon the level of appropriations for the year in which the fee is collected.
</P>
<P>Section 408 of S. 1271 provided authority for the Secretary to execute
emergency relief contracts with certain eligible utilities that would provide
for qualified entities to ship, store, and condition spent <B>nuclear</B> 
fuel. This provision concerned some who feared it could be interpreted to
provide new authority for reprocessing in this country or abroad. This provision
is not contained in S. 1936.
</P>
<P>S. 1271 contained a provision that stated the actions authorized by the bill
would be governed only by the requirements of the <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Policy
Act, the Atomic Energy Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. S.
1936 eliminates this provision and instead provides that, if any law is
inconsistent with the provisions of the <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Policy Act and
the Atomic Energy Act, those acts will govern. S. 1936 further provides that any
requirement of a State or local government is preempted only if complying with
the State or local requirement and the <B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Policy Act is
impossible, or if the requirement is an obstacle to carrying out the act. This
language is consistent with the preemption authority found in the existing
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
</P>
<P>S. 1936 authorizes the Secretary to take title to the fuel at the Dairyland
Power Cooperative's La Crosse reactor, and authorizes the Secretary to pay for
the on-site storage of the fuel until DOE removes the fuel from the site under
terms of the act.
</P>
<P>S. 1936 contains language making a number of changes designed to improve the
management of the <B>nuclear waste</B>  program to ensure the program is
operated, to the maximum extent possible, in like manner to a private business.
</P>
<P>Finally, although we had not reached a final agreement with Senator
<STRONG>Johnston</STRONG> on language regarding the schedule and conditions for
the beginning of construction on the interim facility at the time S. 1936 was
filed, the bill contains new language that was drafted in an attempt to address
Senator <STRONG>Johnston</STRONG>'s concerns. The language in S. 1936 provides
that construction shall not begin on an interim storage facility at Yucca
Mountain before December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>The bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability of the
Yucca Mountain site to the President and Congress by the Secretary of Energy 6
months before the construction can begin on the interim facility. If, based upon
the information before
</P>
<P>him, the President determines, in his discretion, that Yucca Mountain is not
suitable for development as a repository, then the Secretary shall cease work on
both the interim and permanent repository programs at the Yucca Mountain site.
The bill further provides that, if the President makes such a determination, he
shall have 18 months to designate an interim storage facility site. If the
President fails to designate a site, or if a site he has designated has not been
approved by Congress within 2 years of his determination, the Secretary is
instructed to construct an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain Site.
</P>
<P>This provision ensures that the construction of an interim storage facility
at the Yucca Mountain site will not occur before the President and Congress have
had an ample opportunity to review the technical assessment of the suitability
of the Yucca Mountain site for a permanent repository and to designate an
alternative site for interim storage based upon that technical information.
However, this provision also ensures that, ultimately, an interim storage
facility site will be chosen. Without this assurance, we leave open the
possibility we will find in 1998 we have no interim storage, no permanent
repository program, and--after more than 15 years and $6 billion spent--that we
are back to where we started in 1982 when we passed the first version of the
<B>Nuclear Waste</B>  Policy Act .
</P>
<P>This issue provides a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have one,
remote, safe and secure <B>nuclear waste</B>  storage facility. Or, through
inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have 80 such sites
spread across the Nation. It is irresponsible to shirk our responsibility to
protect the environment and the future for our children and grandchildren. This
Nation needs to confront its <B>nuclear waste</B>  problem now. I urge my
colleagues to vote for cloture and support the passage of S. 1936.

<PRE>[Page: S7644]</PRE>
<P>Harry, one of the things that I do that gives me as much concern as anything
else is we get notices every day of hazardous substances that are being driven
through our town.
</P>
<P>He said:
</P>
<P>It would be better if they didn't even tell us about it, because if
something happened with one of those vehicles with the hazardous substance in
it, there is nothing we can do about it anyway. We have no equipment. None of
our personnel, police or fire, are trained to handle these hazardous substances.
Our equipment is certainly inadequate.
</P>
<P>Multiply this thousands and thousands of times all over America. We are
going to ship <B>nuclear waste</B>  on trucks and trains. There will be
accidents. There have been accidents. We have already had seven <B>nuclear
waste</B>  accidents. They have not been significantly harmful, but there have
been accidents.
</P>
<P>The industry and the sponsors of this bill, as I have indicated, would have
you believe, would like you to believe that this transportation is risk free.
Well, it is not. There have been truck and train accidents involving <B>nuclear
waste</B> , and there will continue to be accidents involving <B>nuclear waste</B>
. There will be many more accidents because there will be many more shipments.
</P>
<P>The industry and the sponsors of this bill will tell you that the
probability of an accident resulting in a large radioactive release is very
small; that, in fact, we have never had a significant release. Well,
probabilities have inevitable results, that if you push them long and hard
enough, the adverse outcome will occur.
</P>
<P>The day before Chernobyl, the probability of such an accident was very, very
low. But the day after the accident, the consequences were enormous, and the
probabilities of other such accidents increased significantly.
</P>
<P>Mr. President, there are a number of us who have been concerned about the
safety and reliability of our <B>nuclear</B>  arsenal. In working on these
issues, I came to realize that there have been numerous accidents involving <B>nuclear</B>
 weapons. We have been so fortunate. We have been so lucky that there has not
been death and destruction as a result of those accidents. In North Dakota, a
B-52 caught fire loaded with <B>nuclear</B>  weapons. The wind usually blew in
one direction, but during the course of this fire on the airplane, it blew in
the other direction and, as a result of that, there was no danger as a result of
<B>nuclear</B>  weaponry.
</P>
<P>We know that there has been an accident in Canada of an airplane with <B>nuclear</B>
 weapons on it. Again, it was found and everything worked out fine. But these
accidents will happen. The day before Chernobyl, the probability of such an
accident was very low. But the accident happened. And the consequences were
enormous. The same potential exists here.
</P>
<P>Mr. President, again, I would like to draw your attention to the chart that
shows the number of trucks and trains that will be used to transport this very
high-level <B>nuclear waste</B> . I, of course, highlighted the States with the
biggest risks. It is in bold print: Illinois, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, and
Wyoming. There are others that are close to that. But I just highlighted those.
</P>
<P>It is significant, because we are talking about over 12,000 shipments
through Illinois alone; over 11,000 shipments through Nebraska and Wyoming; over
14,000 through Utah; over 15,000 for Nevada. These are some of the States.
</P>
<P>As I have indicated, we have already had seven <B>nuclear waste</B> 
transportation accidents. The average has been 1 accident for every 300
shipments of <B>nuclear waste</B> . Well, we do not know for sure how many new
trains and trucks will be required because of S. 1936. But we know it will be
magnified significantly. So we can expect at least 150 or 200 accidents if this
S. 1936 is implemented.
</P>
<P>Where will the accidents take place? Omaha? Chicago? New York? Atlanta? I do
not know. No one knows, just like no one knew that this inferno would occur at
Chernobyl. We should not be ready to take that risk, because it is unnecessary.
Why would we want to take the risk? To help the <B>nuclear</B>  industry reduce
its costs and risk exposure? It is a tautology that accidents are unpredictable;
but that an accident will happen is certain.

States, individual States, would suggest that one State out of the Nation, and
one State alone, would have a standard applied to that State that is 25 times
the safe standard for safe drinking water and would be more than 6 times the
standard that the citizens of our southwestern State, New Mexico, would be
subjected to for the transuranic, that somehow we have a standard of 100
millirems.
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The answer is yes. As the Senator from
North Dakota, in questions to this Senator earlier in the day asked, is there
any reason for that? No. There is no scientific basis. There is no scientific
theory. There are only people who want to jam this down the throats of the
people in Nevada saying, `Don't worry about it. It will be OK.'
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. I must say, the thought occurs to this Senator, and the question
arises in this Senator's mind, that why would any legislative body seek to
impose a standard on a single State that no other Member of this body would be
willing to accept for his or her State, when what we are talking about is health
and safety? We are talking about potential dangers from the standpoint of
cancer,
</P>
<P>genetic health problems, all of which, as I recall, we experience currently
as a result of some of the atmospheric experiences in Nevada State in the 1950's
and 1960's.
</P>
<P>(Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada, the question is absolutely
pertinent. The answer is, we do not know why that standard is set. There is no
scientific basis. There is none whatever.
</P>
<P>It goes to show how maybe the two Senators from Nevada were not such great
advocates after all to get the President of the United States to agree to veto
this. For Heaven's sake, why would we? On this basis alone, the President should
veto this legislation. On this basis alone, he should veto this legislation,
notwithstanding the fact that they are trying to change the substantive law in
effect since 1982, that you could not have a permanent site and a temporary site
in the same State. The President of the United States has many, many reasons to
veto this bill. That is why he has said he will veto the bill.
</P>
<P>Yet, what are we doing? We have 34 legislative days left until we adjourn in
October. I think it is 34 or 35 days. We are here talking about <B>nuclear
waste</B> . We should be talking about health care, welfare reform, teenage
pregnancy. We have a lot of things to do with pensions that we need to do work
on. We have 12 appropriations bills we could better spend our time on. We have
reconciliation. We have numerous conferences we could be completing and here
debating. But what are we doing? We are going to spend days on a bill that the
President has said he is going to veto.
</P>
<P>Now, the State of Nevada, I say to my friend, the Presiding Officer, unlike
his State, which is a very populous State, we are a small State. For many, many
years we were the least populated State in the Union. We are used to having
people say, `Well, Nevada is not much. It is just a big desert, so we will give
you anything we want.' I think they have carried it too far in this instance.
The President of the United States acknowledges it has been carried too far.

<BODY><HR>
<P><EM>NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT (Senate - July 10, 1996) </EM></P>
<P></P>
<P>Mr. REID. The Senator's question is directly to the point. It is absolutely
true. It is now beyond the planning stage. Dry cask storage containers work.
They work better when you leave them on-site. Then you do not encounter the
problems, as I indicated, with train wrecks and truck wrecks and firings and
those kinds of things. So the Senator is absolutely right. The current law has
health, safety and environmental safeguards to protect our citizenry from risks
involved in moving and disposing of high-level <B>nuclear waste</B> .
</P>
<P>S. 1936 would effectively end the work on a permanent repository and abandon
the health, safety and environmental protection our citizens deserve. I am not
talking about just Nevada citizens; I am talking about citizens of this country.
It would create an unneeded and costly interim storage facility. It would expose
the Government and its citizens to needless financial risk.
</P>
<P>So, Mr. President, why are we here addressing this issue instead of issues
that need attention, actions that will improve the condition of the average
American, instead of this bill, which will only improve the bottom line of the
<B>nuclear</B>  power industry, at best?
</P>
<P>We are here because the <B>nuclear</B>  industry wants to transfer
</P>
<P>their risks, their responsibilities, and their legitimate business expenses
to the American taxpayer. This has been their agenda for almost two decades.
They think that now is the time to close the deal. They want the <B>nuclear
waste</B>  out of their backyard and into someone else's backyard. They do not
care what the risks are.
</P>
<P>The bill is not in the best interest of the people of this country. It
should not become law. Because of Bill Clinton, it will not become law. The
President will veto this. If we do not have the foresight, Mr. President, to
kill it here and now, the President will veto it.
</P>
<P>S. 1936 is not just bad, it is dangerous legislation. It tramples due
process and it gives the lie to the claims of support for self-determination and
local control, made with great piety by some of our membership. It legislates
technical guidelines for public health and safety, arrogantly assuming the
mantle of `the Government knows best,' when in actual fact this branch of
Government knows virtually nothing about these technical issues. It mandates a
level of risk to citizens of this country and the citizens of Nevada that is at
least four times the level permissible at any other radioactive <B>waste</B> 
facility.
</P>
<P>Mr. President, let me go over this chart again that I did with my colleague
from North Dakota. There is no exposure level--there is no exposure level--any
place in the country, anyplace in the world, that has laws like this.
</P>
<P>The EPA safe drinking water, 4 millirems per year; NRC Low-Level <B>Nuclear
Waste</B>  Site, 25 millirems per year; the EPA WIPP facility in New Mexico, 15
millirems per year; the Independent Spent <B>Nuclear</B>  Fuel Storage
Facility, 25 millirems; the International Exposure Range, 10 to 30.
</P>
<P>What do we have in S. 1936? One hundred millirems. I mean, look at it. Why
would we allow radiation exposure levels to individuals that have anything to do
with <B>nuclear waste</B>  in Nevada 4 times, 10 times, 20 times what it is in
other places, other agencies? It just simply is wrong.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my colleague for a question.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. If I understand what the Senator is saying, this is absolutely
astounding. Is the Senator suggesting that the EPA has said, as a safe drinking
standard for America, 4 millirems? That is per year?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. Four millirems is the correct answer.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. As the Senator well knows, the WIPP is a facility in New Mexico
designed to receive transuranic <B>nuclear waste</B> . Is the Senator
indicating for the good citizens of New Mexico, 15 millirems?
</P>
<P>Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.
</P>
<P>Mr. BRYAN. And that the citizens in the State of Nevada--we were admitted to
the Union, if I recall, before the good State of New Mexico--but somehow for the
rest of America, they have a 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water, at
another <B>nuclear</B>  storage area in our country they are proposing 15
millirems, but in the State of Nevada from a sole source, a single source, they
are suggesting that Nevadans would have to accept a standard of 100 millirems
from one source on an annual basis? Is that what they are suggesting?

<P>As of yet, Alaska has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel either
from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and subsequent
radiological release of this irradiated material occur during shipment, federal
taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION dollars per accident. 
So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes yet, as a federal
taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if it passes
congress.</P>

<P>As of yet, Delaware has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel
either from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and
subsequent radiological release of this irradiated material occur during
shipment, federal taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION
dollars per accident.  So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes
yet, as a federal taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if
it passes congress.</P>

<H1>HAWAII</H1>
<P>As of yet, Hawaii has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel either
from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and subsequent
radiological release of this irradiated material occur during shipment, federal
taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION dollars per accident. 
So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes yet, as a federal
taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if it passes
congress.</P>
<P>Both Senators Akaka and Inouye voted AGAINST S 1936, the Senate version of
this bill.  Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 186 are
co-sponsors of HR 1020, and have effectively endorsed these shipments already.

<P>As of yet, Montana has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel
either from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and
subsequent radiological release of this irradiated material occur during
shipment, federal taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION
dollars per accident.  So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes
yet, as a federal taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if
it passes congress.</P>
<P>Senator Burns voted FOR S 1936 and Senator Baucus voted AGAINST it.  S 1936
is the Senate version of HR 1020. Of the 435 members of the House of
Representatives, 186 are co-sponsors of HR 1020, and have effectively endorsed
these shipments already.  Representatives from your state who are co-sponsors
are noted by **.</P>

<P>As of yet, North Dakota has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel
either from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and
subsequent radiological release of this irradiated material occur during
shipment, federal taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION
dollars per accident.  So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes
yet, as a federal taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if
it passes congress.</P>
<P>Both Senators Conrad and Dorgan voted AGAINST S 1936, the Senate version of
this bill.  Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 186 are
co-sponsors of HR 1020, and have effectively endorsed these shipments already.

<H1>RHODE ISLAND</H1>
<P>As of yet, Rhode Island has no planned shipments of irradiated reactor fuel
either from in-state or out-of-state.  However, should an accident and
subsequent radiological release of this irradiated material occur during
shipment, federal taxpayers would be liable for damages up to 8.96 BILLION
dollars per accident.  So, even though your state has no planned shipment routes
yet, as a federal taxpayer, HR 1020, or similar legislation, would affect you if
it passes congress.</P>
<P>Both Senators Pell and Chafee voted AGAINST S 1936, the Senate version of
this bill.  Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, 186 are
co-sponsors of HR 1020, and have effectively endorsed these shipments already.

<H1>PlanetLink's Vision</H1>

<HR Size=3>

This time in our history is like no other. New advancements in technology, especially communications, 
are having a tremendous impact on our planet, essentially making it seem as though it is smaller and 
time is accelerated. The Internet, or Information Superhighway, is one component of this change. 
<BR><BR>

Our social structures and traditional medical models are undergoing change as well. Many of us are 
reminded daily of social problems such as homelessness, alienation, and environmental degradation. 
The technology of modern medicine has the ability to perform surgical miracles. But often falls short 
when the task of prevention is addressed. From an environmental standpoint, insects and parasites are 
becoming immune to pesticides, necessitating the use of even stronger poisons. While, at the same time, 
more people are developing a wide variety of mystery illnesses, chemical sensitivities and auto immune 
diseases. It is clear to many that changes will be required in order to ensure the survival of life as we know it.
<BR><BR>

There is a growing movement towards using holistic modalities in dealing with our health problems, 
not only physical but emotional and spiritual as well. Many individuals are seeking new ways to grow, 
expand their perceptions, and develop healthier attitudes in their relationships with one another and with themselves.
<BR><BR>

It is the vision of PlanetLink to create a forum for the distribution of information, products, and 
services pertaining to Natural Healing and Consciousness Transformation. The vision of PlanetLink is 
to provide the opportunity for achievement of beneficial change in body, mind and spirit. It is with 
utmost sincerity that we set an intention for PlanetLink to become a major catalyst for positive change 
in our world. An intention which holds the potential to inspire and teach, enlighten and delight, and 
provide the opportunity for each person who desires to participate, the ability to reach their greatest potential.

<H2><HR>THE AURA OF RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<B><BR>
An Interview with Barbara Ann Brennan, author of <I>Hands of Light</I> and
<I>Light Emerging </I><BR>
by Randy Peyser<BR>
</B><BR>
Randy Peyser:  In your latest book, &quot;Light Emerging&quot;, you state
that the main desire in life is to fulfill the spiritual longing, and once
that is realized and fulfilled, then everything else falls into place.<BR>
<BR>
Barbara Brennan:  Yes.  And any desire you have as a normal human being
is directly connected to that spiritual longing.  What we're doing is bringing
spirit into matter and making heaven on earth, so to speak.  <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the most outrageous thing is that you desire, the most outrageous
longing that you have, or what you want to do with your life, or who you
wish to be - that is what you've come here to do or to be.  No matter how
totally off the wall it may sound or totally impossible, that's what it
is - that is what you've come to create in this lifetime.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  I would like to quote a beautiful, channelled passage from &quot;Light
Emerging&quot; that speaks about creating that which you desire:<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;<I>And so dear ones, what are your true needs?  Here is how to allow
</I>the feelings and the longings for those real needs to fill your being
so <I>that they can be fulfilled.&quot;  &quot;First make a list - what
you wish to </I>create for yourself, keep it simple and  profound .  As
you make the <I>visualization clear, do not it send it up to us as if we
will give it down </I>to you, but rather seed it deeply into the core of
your being so that it <I>can emerge from your inner fountain.&quot; </I><BR>
<BR>
BB:  Let's say, for example, that you don't have a relationship and you
want one.  You feel a longing.  You have a personal need, but under that
personal need is a spiritual longing for communion.  <BR>
<BR>
It is by allowing yourself to feel that longing and to actually feel the
loneliness, pain, and all of the negative feelings around it, and then by
letting that flow through you, that you open your heart and space to allow
someone to come.  <BR>
<BR>
You also find out how you're preventing yourself from creating your relationship.
 When the relationship comes into your life, then you again are faced with
more personal process work that you need to do in order to clear yourself.
 <BR>
<BR>
All of life brings you to the exact spiritual work that you need to do to
center yourself more and more into your core, and allow it to express in
your world.  So the longing for a mate can be directly related from a spiritual
perspective to the longing for communion and communication, to infuse with
another divine being. <BR>
 <BR>
RP:  So the more we align with that spiritual longing and actively work
with our own sense of spirituality, then that opens the door for relationships.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Well, even just working on your longing for relationships.   If you
long to have a relationship, you may not feel that it is a spiritual longing.
  You might just feel lonely.  So, instead of cutting off the loneliness,
let yourself feel it.   Out of that emptiness will arise your beginning
to perceive how you have kept yourself from having a relationship, or what
you need to do to open yourself to one.  <BR>
<BR>
That eventually brings a relationship.  Then the relationship brings you
into deeper longings of communion and intimacy, all of which lead toward
the core center self, the divinity within you.  All of it is opening to
the divine.  And it may not even feel like that in the beginning.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  Do we all have the same spiritual longing? <BR>
<BR>
BB:  Everybody is different.  Obviously all of us essentially long to know
who we are from our true divine center and to let that divine center within
us, our core, express into our lives in every way we could ever dream of.
 We all have a deep longing to create from the divinity within us.  But
what that creation is like is different for each individual. <BR>
<BR>
RP:  You do a tremendous amount of work with the auric field.<BR>
And I was wondering if you'd like to share some of that information with
our readers.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Yes.  The human auric field and the study of the auric field is really
important.  With the auric field you can perceive how every decision and
how everything that you experience in your life effects your body.  It all
shows in the auric field, every thought, every feeling, etc.  <BR>
<BR>
The auric field has a specific pattern of health.  The way we deal with
our life experiences, or how we react to negative experiences in our lives
are reflected in the aura.  <BR>
<BR>
When we distort our energy fields, that has a direct and immediate effect
on the physical body.  It might be slight at first, but if we habitually
react in a negative way to situations, the habitual reaction will eventually
show in the physical body and cause a physical disturbance.  <BR>
<BR>
The reason this happens is that the auric field is the foundation of the
body.  The field was there before the body, rather than the body before
the field.  The field creates the body.   Your body is actually <I>in</I>
you, rather than you are in your body.  <BR>
<BR>
Your auric field is bigger than you.  That's why hands-on healing works.
 If the energy is coming from the cells of the body and you put a little
energy in the cells, it doesn't give you the idea it would do much.   But
on the other hand, if the energy field in the structure is there<I> before</I>
the cell, and there's something wrong with the structure and the healer
repairs the structure of the field and teaches the client how to maintain
the healthy structure, then the physical body will respond in check.  Then
it makes more sense.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  How do you perceive the aura?  Is it through the sensation of warmth
or through visualization?<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Yes, it's through those and more.  You learn to expand all of the regular
senses.   And when you expand them, some of them begin to differentiate.
  For example there's a big difference between the experience of love and
the experience of feelings.  Those are actually separate senses in the world
of the auric field.  So you expand those and then you begin learning that
in fact your perception serves your awareness.  <BR>
<BR>
You can become as aware of the auric field as you are of anything else in
your world.  So we do work on expanding the senses of touch, vision, emotional
feelings, the feeling of love and the direct knowing of something, as well
as the auditory, receiving sounds or words of information.  And how you
do it is by practicing.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  How did you learn all this?  <BR>
<BR>
BB:   I have a Masters in physics.  I was working with light sensitive devices
as a scientist.   I used all those analogies on the instruments that we
use on satellites, looking at the infra-red as well as the ultraviolet,
invisible light coming off the earth.  I applied all those analogies to
perceiving the auric field.  I was also training to become a therapist in
bioenergetics when I began perceiving the auric field myself, and then it
really took course.  <BR>
<BR>
Over a period of 15 years that perception developed and I also used my scientific
background to interpret how my perceptions worked and then applied it to
other people.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  In 'Light Emerging', you talk about three kinds of auric fields that
have to do with interactions when people are in relationship.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Yes, there are three types of ways we exchange energy in consciousness.
  Energy in consciousness cannot be divided.  They're always together. 
So the most common one is actually the bioplasmic streamers.  We send arcs
of energy back and forth to each other.  It's like bioplasm flowing between
people.  It probably is bioplasm actually of a higher vibration.  It contains
the energy consciousness of the interaction, so it can be positive or negative.
 It works long- distance as well as close up, and it also travels through
time. <BR>
<BR>
Another way we exchange the energy of conciousness is by harmonic inductance,
meaning if you hit one too many forks, another will sound.  Many people
have that experience by getting close to somebody that has a very high frequency
for healing the auric field, such as by meditating at the foot of a guru,
that kind of thing.  If you sit in a room with a guru you will often perceive
very strong energy coming through you.   <BR>
<BR>
The third way which is very powerful, is through cords that connect through
the chakras.  The chakras are the energy centers, and those cords connect
between people that have been connected with each other at one time or another.
 The deeper and the more intimate the relationship, the more the cord connection.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  Can these cords go through various lifetimes with people?<BR>
<BR>
BB:  The cords never actually end.  Once connected, always connected,  whether
it's in this lifetime or not.  People that die are connected to you and
the cords are still there, unless you tear them out because you think you
should.  That happens a lot.   People don't know that's what they're doing,
but they do that sometimes in the process of mourning or in the process
of divorce.  <BR>
<BR>
When a parent dies, the cords are still connected and they're connected
through generations.  A lot of information flows through the cords.  I observed
a woman who was working with me in the office, three days after her mother
died.  I had my back to her and she was working (with auric visions you
can see 360 degrees, you don't have to look at somebody).  Anyway, I saw
her deceased mother come into the room and try to feed her information through
the cords.   <BR>
<BR>
I realized this happens a lot when a parent dies.  A parent will go to the
children and spouse and actually pour love and information into that person
through the cord, provided the person in the physical body will allow it.
 <BR>
<BR>
The flow of energy consciousness that goes through the cords to the surviving
family member is a condensed wisdom from that entire lifetime of the parent.
 It's not in specific language, but it is a condensed form of wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  It sounds like a very special gift from the person who's died to  the
people they've left.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Yes, it is a gift.  And it also causes pain in the person who left
the physical world if that gift isn't received.  Many times our processes
tend to break or stop that flow.   There's a whole way of honoring our ancestors
by allowing them to share this gift. <BR>
<BR>
RP:  I'm glad you're sharing this information.  People I know want to receive
messages and communicate with their deceased loved ones.  So it's nice to
hear what you're saying.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  I would like to share the experience around my father's death with
you.  My father was slowing dying of Alzheimer's over a 15 to 20 year period.
 What actually happened to him in that process is he lost his ego.  Step
by step, he reversed and became younger and younger. As he did that, he
went through his childhood traumas and flushed them out.  <BR>
<BR>
He didn't know that that was going on, of course, but he would sit on the
couch and cry because he had lost his mother and his sister. They had both
died.  His mother died when he was eight and his sister died when he was
seventy.  But he had the two events in his psyche close together.  He had
the loss of two of the most important women in his life happening at the
same time. <BR>
<BR>
It was very moving.  The family didn't really understand what was going
on, but I did.  Each year he'd go through emotional clearings by reliving
those things as his ego dissolved with the Alzheimer's.  So there was a
lot of healing that happened with him.  <BR>
<BR>
I knew that one of the causes, on some spiritual level with him dying in
that way was that he was so terrified of death.  It was like a slow deadening
of consciousness.<BR>
<BR>
I was in Boston leading a workshop and my mother was there.  I saw that
he wasn't dying and that he was hanging on to her.  It was like this big
heavy weight on her.  <BR>
<BR>
When I was doing healings with people, I went over and took my father's
energy off my mother's back.  That released that connection there.  They
weren't letting go of each other.  Two weeks later in the middle of the
next workshop I gave in Long Island, my father died. <BR>
<BR>
I had gone into meditation because I had felt death all night.  And I hadn't
realized it was my father.  I had gone into meditation because I had half
an hour before I had to get on the stage in front of 200 people, and I meditated
because I thought I was going to give my father healing.  As I meditated,
he came into the room and he started pouring me full of things... he was
giving <I>me</I> healing.  <BR>
<BR>
And then he asked me to channel for the group.  So I went back into the
classroom and I told the group that my father had died.  It was so moving
because the channeling was about honoring our heritage and honoring all
of our ancestors.   And what happened is that everybodys' ancestors appeared
in the room in spirit form.  <BR>
<BR>
My father came with my grandmother, whom I had never met.  My aunt, my father's
mother, who had passed away also came into the room with somebody else that
had died with a baby.  The whole room filled up with everybodys' ancestors
who were all there.  They were kind of standing up behind us and a lot of
people saw this. <BR>
 <BR>
The whole guided meditation was about honoring and thanking our ancestors,
to be grateful for what they've given us and to allow ourselves to receive
that connection.  <BR>
<BR>
To recognize it was a tremendous healing.  There was a woman in the Long
Island workshop who came up to me and said, &quot;I was in the Boston workshop,
but during it I had to leave because my mother had died.  And when I had
found out during the workshop that she had died, I saw her leaving with
some angels.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
I had told my students in the Long Island workshop that when people died
they have their guides with them.  And this woman said, &quot;This was such
a tremendous healing because you just told me this now, and I saw it two
weeks ago during the Boston workshop.&quot;  Her mother had committed suicide.
 So it was very powerful.  <BR>
<BR>
The other thing that I got from channeling was that my father having Alzheimer's
was actually an agreement between my mother and father.  They've been married
for 55 years.  Alzheimer's was a process of them letting go of each other
and allowing my mother to slowly take over, because my father ran everything.
 So there was time for her to take over.  It was really, really hard on
her, but she did learn to run everything in her life during this time. 
She's doing very well now.  She's 84.  <BR>
<BR>
RP:  He gave her the gift of independence.<BR>
<BR>
BB:  Yeah, and it was a hard way to get it.<BR>
<BR>
RP:  Thank you.  You are such a gift to me, to the readers, to the planet.
 I'm very, very thankful, very grateful to have had this opportunity to
talk with you.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor666845"></A>What are Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and
Thoracic Outlet Syndrome?</CENTER>
</H3>
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) are painful
conditions that usually begin in the neck and shoulders and continue down
the arms to the wrists and hands. Both conditions can be caused by trauma
to, or compression of, the nerves and blood vessels. CTS results from compression
of the median nerve, which is located in the carpal tunnel of the wrist
joint; TOS results from compression of the nerves in the sides of the neck.
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#anchor693034">Return to top of page</A><BR>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor667089"></A>What are the symptoms? </CENTER>
</H3>
Symptoms of both conditions are similar, including pain and weakness in
the arms and hands, limited range of motion, swelling, and feelings of cold,
numbing, or tingling. CTS usually appears in the hands and wrists, while
TOS often appears in the upper arm, but this is not always the case.<BR>
<BR>
Many people who suffer form CTS and TOS have jobs that require them to perform
repetitive motions or to hold their bodies for extended periods of time
in static positions. Their work requires concentration on things other than
the comfort of their bodies -- like the information on a computer screen
or the manual task they're performing. Usually it is pain that forces a
person to recognize the body's condition of stress. And the longer a person
ignores this pain, the more frequently and severely the symptoms will occur.
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#anchor693034">Return to top of page</A><HR> 
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor668895"></A>What is Resonance Release Work(TM)?</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Resonance Release Work(TM) is the painless alternative to deep tissue massage
therapy. It is a highly refined, non-intrusive, hands-on system which releases
tension in the musculature to unlock the body's innate intelligence and
improve its postural alignment. <BR>
<BR>
In order to understand how Resonance Release Work(TM) promotes healing,
you have to understand the nature of the soft tissue, which includes muscles,
fascia, and other connective tissue, where compression and alignment problems
first manifest. When soft tissue is damaged or hypertense, it becomes unable
to hold the skeleton in its proper alignment. Improper skeletal alignment
results in pressure on nerves or blood vessels, which is usually first experienced
as a dull ache or pain, or a restriction in range of motion. This is the
&quot;compression&quot; we refer to.<BR>
<BR>
Resonance Release Work(TM) eases compression and trauma to the muscles by
gently working the soft tissue. In our work we hold several points or parts
of your body at the same time, thereby &quot;tricking&quot; your body into
releasing its muscular tension. As one part of your body relaxes, it regains
1) its natural balance within itself, and 2) its balance with the rest of
the body. <BR>
<BR>
This is how Resonance Released Work(TM) returns soft tissue to its natural
balance, thereby allowing the skeleton to return to its proper alignment,
which eliminates the immediate cause of pain. And when the body is in balance
it can best access its &quot;innate intelligence&quot; to promote healing.
<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#anchor693034">Return to top of page</A><HR> 
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor670092"></A>What is the Innate Intelligence of
the body?</CENTER>
</H3>
The body naturally knows how to operate effortlessly, efficiently, and comfortably.
This knowledge is often referred to as the body's &quot;innate intelligence,&quot;
which directs the muscles to contract and relax when we move, as appropriate.
When this innate intelligence is fully accessible, we have the greatest
range and ease of motion, and we feel the best and have the most energy.
But when access to the innate intelligence is blocked by stress, our body
awareness becomes diminished and our access to the innate intelligence of
the body becomes limited. This is when we begin to experience aches and
pains. <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#anchor693034">Return to top of page </A><HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor670324"></A>How do we work with CTS and TOS sufferers?</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Our goal in treating a person who suffers from CTS or TOS is twofold: We
want to reduce your pain and other symptoms, and we want to teach you how
to maintain your health. <BR>
<BR>
It is important for you to learn how to listen to and feel your body while
it is properly aligned and free of pain. Once you have experienced the feel
of being in balance you become aware of the contrast between a healthy state
and a stressed state, and you'll be able to feel the difference when stress
starts to distort you skeletal alignment. So when we work with you we not
only alleviate discomfort but we also teach you how to become aware of how
your body feels at any given time. And as you increase your body awareness
you will learn not only how to identify the source of pain but also how
to relax and release the affected areas. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>What is Pain?</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
There are two types of pain: pain caused by acute injury and actual damage,
and hypersensitivity perceived as pain, indicating lack of body awareness
and dysfunction and damage over a period of time that are degenerative in
nature. <BR>
<BR>
We are all familiar with the first type of pain. The second type of pain
we usually try to ignore, or we mask it with over-the-counter pain relievers.
The second type of pain is not serious enough to immobilize us, but the
dull ache or tightness in our body keeps us uncomfortable.<BR>
<BR>
When an area has been neglected, touching it is almost too much stimulation
and may cause a sensation like pain. The problem is usually a muscle that
is locked in contraction instead of being rested and relaxed. This area
needs stimulation to help it relax. In fact, our natural inclination is
to rub an area that feels &quot;tight&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
It is like a small baby crying to get its needs met. At first the baby makes
small sounds, but as its needs gets stronger so do the baby's cries. The
baby will cry as long and as loud as it can until its needs are met or until
it exhausts itself and can't cry any longer. If we give the baby what it
needs it will become satisfied and quiet. The longer the needs are ignored,
the more energy it will take to satisfy them; and while needs go unmet,
the potential for harm is greatest. <BR>
<BR>
Our bodies send signals to our brains to warn us of a tired, cramped muscle
or alignment problem. The signal may start with a minor ache, but if we
don't listen and deal with the issue, we greatly increase the potential
for damage: degenerative or acute. As the pain increases, complications
will develop as our bodies compensate for improper skeletal alignment. This
is how repetitive stress injuries like CTS and TOS begin.<BR>
<BR>
Prevention is the greatest cure. It is always better to deal with CTS and
TOS before they become acute. Our bodies give us signals; we just need to
listen to them. <BR>
<BR>

<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor670925"></A>How long will it take me to heal?</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
You should feel relief from the pain after the first session. Within the
first few sessions your response to the work will determine the extent to
which we can help you. How long it takes for you to heal depends on several
factors. Basically the longer you have been suffering and the more severe
the pain, the longer it will take to heal. You probably didn't want to hear
that, right?<BR>
<BR>
You will probably need to think in terms of months, rather than weeks. Many
of our clients have tried traditional medicine and have been disappointed,
before they come to see us. So it is best for you to see us in the early
stages of these syndromes.<BR>
<BR>
We determine the frequency of your sessions based on how long the effects
of a session last for you. At the beginning it will usually be 1-3 days;
as you improve, the effects will last longer and longer. The more time you
spend with Your body in between sessions, and the more time you utilize
the innate intelligence of your body, the faster and deeper your rehabilitation
will be. But ultimately, while you can optimize your healing, you must allow
your body its natural recovery time.<BR>

<BR>
As a computer programer, <B>Repetitive Stress Syndrome</B> has been a problem
for me for several years, even after chiropractic treatment, physical therapy,
and exercise programs. <B>Resonance Release Work</B> has relieved a lot
of my symptoms and has put me in control of my condition. <B>RRW</B> therapy
relaxes my muscles that are causing the stress; as a result, my bones align,
my joints are more flexible, my nerves are less irriated, and the pain goes
away. The greatest benefit has been the body awareness and muscle working
techniques that I have learned in therapy. I no longer need to wait for
help, I can work on my own body, release my muscles, and relieve my stress
immediately. I have learned some exercises and stretches that maintain my
body between therapy sessions. I recommend trying <B>RRW</B> therapy; it
is working for me.<BR>
<I>Betsy S. - Computer Programmer, City of San Francisco</I><BR>
<BR>
Al's massage technique really worked for me in curing my <B>Carpal Tunnel</B>
problems. When I was working on my MBA thesis, I developed <B>Carpel Tunnel</B>
problems. My entire right arm, neck, and hand was affected by limited motion
and constant pain. After only one sessions of <B>Resonance Release Work
</B>with Al Ichekawa the pain was released and my entire neck, arm, and
hand was opened. After one month, my <B>Carpel Tunnel</B> was completely
gone. It has not flared up again. I have found a great release and a less
stressed way of life with the consistent massage therapy done by Al. I would
highly recommend <B>Resonance Release Work</B> if you have these problems.
It really worked for me. His technique is the best I have found and I have
used him exclusively for the past five years. As a Healthcare Administrator,
my job is highly demanding, yet I am more relaxed than ever due to the regular
massage treatment of Al Ichikawa. He's the best.<BR>

<BR>
</I>I've received massage for <B>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome</B> from several
different therapists. Any &quot;deep&quot; massage around the thoracic outlet
would leave me sore for up to a week. In addition, I didn't find much relief
from most treatment. However, I've found a massage therapist who is able
to go &quot;deep&quot; without pain and I get some relief of symptoms. His
massages haven't cured me but they have helped me to develop better body
awareness which has led to improved posture and hence less pain. I have
no association with Al Ichikawa and <B>Resonance Release Work</B> other
than being a client. I want to help other people as well as help promote
a practitioner who does very good work.<BR>

<BR>
</I>On November 11, 1994 I was involved in an automobile accident. I was
refered to a chiropractor for the pain I was feeling in my neck, shoulder/arm,
and back. After a while, my chiropractor wasn't able to help with the constant
pain I would feel from writing or typing on the computer. I was then refered
to Al Ichikawa, a massage therapist who had developed a treatment called
<B>Resonance Release Work. </B>After the first visit with Al, the numbness
I had been feeling in my left arm was greatly improved. Throughout the three
months of treatment, I could feel the muscles respond and relax. My experience
of <B>RRW</B> is that there is no pain or discomfort even thought the work
feels very deep. I can honestly say that if I was not refered to Mr. Ichikawa,
my pain would still be evident. I also learned how to take better care of
my body and how to respond to the many warning signs the body gives when
there is a problem. I also want to say that it is a comforting feeling to
be able to type this letter and not feel pain through my wrists. This is
all due to Mr. Ichikawa's pioneering style of massage.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Dr. Jennifer Brett<BR>
Naturopathic Physician</CENTER></H1>
<H2><CENTER>Listening and Caring -<BR>
Wouldn't you prefer a doctor <BR>
who makes time for both?</CENTER>
</H2>
Dr. Jennifer E. Brett, N.D. is a naturopathic physician who spends a great
deal of time listening and learning from her patients. During the average
first visit, Dr. Brett spends at least 1 hour with the patient exploring
all areas of that patient's health. Return visits average 30 minutes of
time spent with the doctor. It is not uncom-mon to hear a patient of Dr.
Brett's remark, &quot;Why have none of my other doctors spent the time to
listen about all these areas of my health? I feel Dr. Brett is the first
doctor to truly under-stand my problem and she has helped me under-stand
how all these odd symptoms I have had for years relate to one underlying
problem.&quot; 
<H2><BR><HR>Naturopathic Medicine:</H2>
Naturopathic medicine is based on the fact that the human body has the power
to heal itself Naturopathic physicians use techniques and therapies which
enable the body to make the most of these inherent self-healing abilities.
For more than 70 years, naturopathic physicians have been practicing this
type of medicine in Connecticut. For more information on Naturopathic Medicine,
visit the <A HREF="http://healer.infinite.org/Naturopathic.Physician/index.html">American Association of Naturopathic Physicians.</A><BR>

<BR>
<B>Advantages of Naturopathic Medicine:</B><BR>
Naturopathic physicians evaluate the whole person, not just a particular
organ or system. In other words, they consider all aspects of the patient
including emotional, environmental and lifestyle factors in order to understand
the dynam-ics of health and illness that are influencing that particular
patient's condition. And they evaluate your health risks. Health risk analysis
allows earli-er intervention in acute and chronic disease processes when
there is less damage, and this allows for less invasive, natural therapies
to be <BR>
<BR>
<B>Preventive medicine:</B><BR>
Most people think of seeing a physician only when they are ill. But a vital
role of the naturopathic physician is that of teacher. Naturopathic physicians
teach people of all ages how to restore and maintain their own health by
modification of each individual's lifestyles - teaching them how to live
in harmony with themselves and their environment. During a visit to a naturopathic
physi-cian, you are encouraged to understand how your choices and actions
affect your health. Thus pre preventive education, early detection, risk-factor
analysis and programs to delay the onset or pro-progression of specific
diseases are integral parts of the preventive approach of naturopathic health
care. 
<H2><HR>Professional Training:</H2>
After completion of pre-medical college training, naturopathic physicians
receive four more years of professional, medical schooling. This training
prepares naturopathic physicians to be general, family practitioners and
specialists in preventive medicine and natural therapeutics. They are trained
in the conventional medical sciences and the conventional medical examination
proce-dures, but then receive further training in other health parameters.
Naturopathic physicians receive extensive training in nutrition, botanical
medicine, physical medicine and other natural health care techniques. 
<H2><HR>Will Insurance Cover My Visits?</H2>
In Connecticut most major insurance companies cover the services of naturopathic
physicians. Dr. Brett is also a preferred provider for Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Century plans.<BR>

<B>Melatonin</B><BR>
Melatonin has recently been written up in magazines such as Newsweek as
having miraculous benefits from helping sleep to preventing aging and cancer.
But before you go out and buy a 10 year supply of this product, you should
know that there may be side effects and that I do not recommend long term
use.<BR>
<BR>
Melatonin is a hormone which helps to reset your biological rhythms each
day when you turn out the lights. It probably also is part of the internal
clock which dates you as being either young or old. But like any other hormone,
too much of a good thing may lead to disease. And this hormone has not even
been tested over long periods of time in people.<BR>
<BR>
The following problems are thought possibly to be related to natural, over
production of melatonin: seasonal affective disorder (depression which shows
up primarily in the winter), bulimia, and some forms of impotence/lack of
sexual desire. In addition, since melatonin can suppress sex hormone output
(there is ongoing research to see if this hormone can be used as a birth
control pill), long term use may also lead to early onset of osteoporosis
and may increase cholesterol levels.<BR>
<BR>
The bottom line is that if you need a little help falling asleep at night,
try herbs such as valerian root, chamomile, and skullcap first. Then, if
that does not work or you are battling jet lag, a small dose of melatonin,
taken before bed, may help. But do not plan to use this hormone daily unless
you want to become, in effect, part of a large, uncontrolled study to find
out what the long term effects of this hormone are in humans. I plan to
wait 3-10 years before making a final judgement on the relative safety of
what are, in effect, megadoses of this hormone.<BR>

<B>Pycnogenol</B><BR>
Pycnogenol, or &quot;OPC's&quot; from pine bark and grape seeds were first
studied by Jaques Masquelier in the 1930's. Previous North American use
of antiinflammatories from the pine family of trees can be traced back to
Native American healing. In fact, a tea made from the common bush/tree arbor
vitae (Thuja occidentalis) was given to a French exploration party by natives
of what is now Canada in 1533 to prevent the Europeans from dying of scurvy.<BR>
<BR>
OPC's are now known to be potent antioxidants from the group of chemicals
known as proanthocyanadins. Previously called &quot;biofiavinoids&quot;,
this group of chemicals, frequently found in berries, color many plant parts
with blue or brown (as opposed to the yellow and green of carotenes).<BR>
<BR>
Clinical studies have found that OPC's can be used in such diverse illnesses
as allergies, diabetes, hypertension, PMS and edema.<BR>
<BR>
OPC's are used primarily to improve circulation, reduce inflammation and
reduce easy bruising and bleeding.<BR>

<B>Hyssop and Lomatium for HIV</B><BR>
A polysaccharide found in hyssop (Hyssop officianalis) was found to strongly
inhibit the replication of the HIV virus in vitro. In people with HIV, viral
replication was inhibited slightly without any negative effects on T-cell
counts or normal immune function. A few years ago, hyssop was also found
effecfive in limiting flu symptoms and herpes outbreaks.<BR>
<BR>
Lomatium, or desert parsley, has been used for viral infections by naturopathic
physicians for over 10 years. A recent study reported in Bioorganic and
Medicinal Chemistry found that lomatium inhibited replication of HIV- 1,
but did not enhance the action of AZT when the two were used together I
frequently use lomatium for chronic fatigue syndrome and have found that
it can be very effective in some individuals for limiting the symptoms from
that disease. It works best when mixed with other immune system tonics,
such as red clover, astragalus or echinacea.<BR>
<BR>
Other herbs found to be helpful for HIV infections include bitter melon,
poke weed, garlic, St. John's wort, licorice and many Chinese and Ayervedic
herbs.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Herbs Proven Effective for Menopausal Complaints</B><BR>
In a study done at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (my alma
mater), 71 % of the women given an herbal formula for menopausal symptoms
noted at least some improvement. The herb formula consisted of licorice
(Glycyrhiza glabra), burdock (Arctium lappa), wild yam (Dioscorea villosa),
angelica (Angelica spp.) and motherwort (Leonorus cardiaca). The main symptoms
which improved were hot flashes, vaginal dryness, insomnia and mood changes.<BR>
<BR>
Even better results can occur when an herbal protocol is made specifically
for an individual, rather than mixing general herbs for conditions such
as menopause. By making the botanical tonic specific for you and your symptoms,
better than 90 % of women can be helped through menopause without hormones.<BR>
<BR>
For more information on natural remedies for menopausal symptoms, such as
using soy foods and vitamin E to reduce hot flashes, contact the office
for my handout on menopause.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Acid Blockers and Nutrition</B><BR>
Inhibitors of stomach acids (such as Tagamet and Pepcid) have just been
approved for over-the-counter use by the FDA. I am concerned about the long
term effects of the use of these drugs for three reasons. First, many people
with heartburn and gastritis have specific bacteria which cause or aggravate
their condition. Stomach acids will normally kill over 90% of all bacteria.
But when these acids are blocked, bacteria can multiply freely. This, in
turn, may lead to a worsening of their disease even while symptoms are controlled.<BR>
<BR>
Second, proteins are meant to be partially broken down in the stomach by
the combined action of pepsin and HCL (acid) Acid blockers may make protein
digestion less efficient and thereby reduce absorption of the essential
amino acids. Reduced protein absorption may also enhance the growth of irritating
bacteria in the lower bowel, exacerbating problems such as irritable bowel
syndrome and flatulence.<BR>
<BR>
And lastly, many nutrition-oriented physicians have noted a decrease in
the absorption and utilization of minerals in those who are taking acid
blocking drugs. Calcium, iron, chromium and magnesium all absorb better
when stomach pH levels are low (acid levels are normal). Long term use of
Tagamet or Pepcid may lead to chronic deficiencies, which, in turn, can
exacerbate problems such as osteoporosis, hypoglycemia, diabetes, anemia
and muscle spasms.<BR>
<BR>
Although short term use of these drugs for acute indigestion is unlikely
to cause problems, we should all be cautious about using these drugs for
long periods of time.<BR>

<B>Garlic and Leg Pain</B><BR>
Garlic has long been known to be a tonic for the circulatory system. It
reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels and can help keep hands and
feet warm in the winter In a recent study of men with intermittent claudication
(leg pain associated with cardiovascular disease), those who received 800
mg. of standardized garlic powder daily had significant improvement in pain-free
walking compared to controls. They were also found to have a decreased risk
for further cardiovascular complaints since serum cholesterol levels fell,
as did platelet aggregation and plasma viscosity (both are measures of how
fast the blood may clot).<BR>
<BR>
Garlic also enhances immune function and improves digestion. Pills need
not be taken if you eat at least 1 clove daily.<BR>

<B>Another Unusual Use of a Common Plant</B><BR>
Sambucus, the elderberry plant, is receiving a good deal of attention lately.
Used as a component of elderberry wine and elderberry jam, berries from
this plant contain high concentration of anthocyanadins, or bioflavinoids.
And like other sources of these compounds, extracts of elderberry have been
found to be antiinflammatory and immune enhancing. One recent study found
that people taking elderberry extract reduced the length of time they were
sick with the flu to 1/2 that of people who received a placebo. (Now imagine
how much better these people would have felt if they had also taken vitamin
C, echinacea, and zinc lozenges!) Other preliminary studies suggest that
this plant may help reduce the pain and inflammation of arthritis. So perhaps
the name &quot;elderberry&quot; is not too far off the mark.<BR>
<BR>
Other &quot;berries&quot; high in anthocyanadins include: billberries, blueberries,
hawthorne berries, and the fruit and leaves of the ginkgo tree. All are
antioxidant and antiinflammatory. And all may be useful in reducing eyestrain
from computer use as well as improving night vision.<BR>
<BR>
Look for elderberry extract to be marketed in a health food store near you
under the name &quot;Sambucol&quot;. And I would not be surprised if a company
marketing &quot;healthfood&quot; jams shows up on grocery shelves in the
near future.<BR>

<P><B>Awaken The Warrior</B><BR>
Success in meeting life's challenges is directly related to your relationship
with the warrior. It is the warrior's energy that initiates action, takes
risks and defines boundaries. Awakening your inner warrior empowers you
to break through the barriers (old habits, limiting beliefs, unconscious
patterns) that stop you from reaching your personal and professional goals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Step Into Power</B><BR>
Awakening the Warrior Within is an intensive workshop offering a unique
combination of awareness exercises, communication skills and self-defense
techniques. The program's focus is on the development of the inner warrior
and the workshop is designed for individuals committed to achieving mastery
in life.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Claim Autonomy</B><BR>
Dawn Callan founder of Awakening the Warrior Within, has devised a sophisticated
and efficient self-defense program that attunes each participant to their
inner power and awakens the application of that power into decisive action.
During the workshop you learn simple and effective physical techniques that
enable you to experience the warrior's self-protective qualities and maximize
your potential as a human being.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transform Core Issues</B><BR>
Accessing the warrior's qualities (strength, courage, will, commitment)
empowers you to transform the conditions in your life that need changing
(corruption, tyranny, a bad marriage, an unfulfilling lifestyle, an unsatisfying
career). Viewed in this way, your inner warrior is a great ally and trusted
friend.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Self Defense</B><BR>
Throughout the workshop participants learn self-defense skills that enable
them to disarm an attack. Techniques include: hand strikes, kicks, use of
sound and breath, recognizing danger signals, knowing when to strike, trusting
one's instincts, defining boundaries, identifying the primary and secondary
targets of the body, defense on the ground upper and lower body combinations,
what to do if you &quot;freeze&quot;, making the first strike count, how
to stay focused and basic survival skills.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>Ten Universal Laws of the Warrior Code</H2>
The Ten Universal Laws of the Warrior Code are contained In Dawn Callan's
hot new book: <I>Awakening</I> <I>the Warrior Within</I> - <I>Secrets</I>
<I>of Personal</I> <I>Safety</I> <I>and</I> <I>Inner</I> <I>Security. </I>Published

<BR>
These Codes encourage individuals to live impeccably with more joy, more
choice, and more peace. A path not without risk, but not without rewards.
Living by the Warrior Code will enrich dally llving on your own terms. 
<OL>
  <LI><B>Pay attention.</B> Stay in the present. Its the only place anything
is really happening. 
  <LI><B>Take responsibility. </B>This is your life, take it back. Either
you get to own it, or you blame someone or something else for it. 
  <LI><B>No kvetching. </B>No whining, no sniveling - it takes you out of
the present and lets you abdicate responsibility. 
  <LI><B>Don't take any shit.</B> It's very bad for one's self-esteem to
take any abuse. Stand up to your tyrants, both internal and external. The
cost is too great not to. 
  <LI><B>Do it anyway.</B> Hard choices temper our strength and our integrity;
they make the difference between a life of mediocrity and a life of excellence.
  <LI><B>Don't quit. </B>Look at what stops you, at where you give the effort
up. That is the edge between becoming a victim or a warrior. 
  <LI><B>Keep your agreements.</B> A warrior is only as good as his or her
word. The way we build self-trust and trust in others is by making and keeping
agreements. 
  <LI><B>Keep your sense of humor.</B> Otherwise what's the point? Humor
helps us to stretch beyond ourselves and our own limits. 
  <LI><B>Love one another.</B> Otherwise where's the meaning? It's the way
we remember we're not alone in this universe. 
  <LI><B>Honor your connection to Source.</B> There is a force in the universe,
greater than ourselves, that creates us, sustains us, provides for us, cares
for us, guides us, and loves us. It speaks to us from within. Trust it.

<H2>Here's what people are saying about Awakening the Warrior</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>&quot;This work will take you to the brink of your greatest fear and
draw you through it to a side of tremendous empowerment.&quot; 
  <DD>Dr. Linda Peterson Ph.D. 
  <DD>University of Nevada Medical School<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;I am the author of five published books and one video of the
subject of street self defense. As an instructor on survival myself, I see
your course as a solution to a serious system glitch. I have never before
seen the 'warrior' awakened so effectively without massive trauma.&quot;
  <DD>Marc MacYoung 
  <DD>Glendale, CA<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>This course was the most helpful life-changing experience I have had
in such a short amount of time. I will not ever have to be a victim in any
circumstances: on the street, at home, at work, or in relationship.&quot;
  <DD>Judy Bayens M.A. 
  <DD>Community Counseling &amp; Personal Growth Ministry, Grand Rapids,
MI<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;I have owned my own business since 1983. After the workshop
I broke the elusive six figure barrier I had not been able to reach.&quot;
  <DD>Lyn Pfaelzer 
  <DD>Pfaelzer Communications, CA<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;At the interview (for a new job) I was able to draw upon the
knowledge and insights from this workshop. I'm now Director of P.R. and
advertising for RE/MAX of Michigan. My employer said one of the key factors
to hiring me was that he sensed I would not be afraid to stand up to him
when it was necessary... nor let anyone else back me into a corner.&quot;

<HR>Over 100 Million Americans suffer from some form of digestive disease.
In fact, more Americans are hospitalized due to diseases of the digestive
tract and colon than for any other group of disorders. It is estimated that
the total cost in lost productivity, lost wages, and medical bills is over
$50 billion dollars per year.

<H2><A NAME="anchor677076"></A>Other Related Diseases</H2>
It is worth noting that many other diseases (that at first glance appear
to have no connection with the digestive tract) have actually been related
by many doctors to functional bowel disorder. These include: 
<UL>

<H2><A NAME="anchor678190"></A>Colon/rectal cancer</H2>
The situation is serious. Diseases of the intestinal system have reached
an all time high in the United States - and are still on the rise. <B>The
number one cause of cancer amoung men and women combined is colon/rectal
cancer.<BR>
<BR>
</B>According to the Merck Manual, the allopathic medical industry's standard
text for diagnosis and treatment of disease, the incidence of diverticulosis
has increased dramatically over the past 40 years. It has risen from 10%
of the adult population over the age of 40 in 1950, to an astounding. <B>&quot;Every
person has many&quot;, in 1992. In other words, according to the Merck Manual, virtually
100% of all American adults will eventually have diverticulosis of the large
intestine.<BR>
</B><I><A HREF="#anchor717862">Return to top of page</A></I> 
<H2><A NAME="anchor678666"></A>Why has this happened?</H2>
Our modern lifestyle has taken it's toll on our digestive and eliminative
organs. Refined, processed, low fiber foods, animal fats, a lack of exercise,
and an ever increasing level of stress all contribute to our current gastro-intestinal
health crisis.<BR>
<BR>
Consider that a sluggish bowel can retain pounds of old toxic and poisonous
fecal matter (10 to 20 pounds is not unusual, and up to 65 pounds has been
actually reported). Many times the real cause behind sickness and disease
is this retention and subsequent reabsorption of built up toxic waste.<BR>
<BR>
There has been a great misconception amoung the general public and most
medical professionals about how often a normal person should have a bowel
movement. For many years, doctors have thought that anywhere between one
bowel movement a day and one a week was normal. What we have learned is
that it is normal, and necessary, to have one bowel movement a day for each
meal that you eat.<BR>
<I><A HREF="#anchor717862">Return to top of page</A></I> 
<H2><A NAME="anchor679076"></A>What can be done?</H2>
Any program designed to clean and detoxify the colon needs to address several
key areas. The program must: 
<UL>
<LI>Help bring the colon back to life by stimulating the muscle movement
of the colon 
<LI>Encourage matter to move forward through the system 
<LI>Halt putrefaction 
<LI>Draw old fecal matter off the walls of the colon and out of any bowel
pockets 
<LI>Disinfect 
<LI>Draw out posions and toxins 
<LI>Help leach out heavy metals such as mercury and lead 
<LI>Remove chemicals and drug residues 
<LI>Soothe and promote healing of the mucus membrane lining of the entire
digestive tract 
<LI>Help stimulate the body to begin the healing and repair of herniated
areas 
<LI>Increase the flow of bile to help clean the gall blader, bile ducts,
and liver 
<LI>Promote healthy intestinal flora 
<LI>Destroy and expel parasites 
<LI>Destroy Candida albicans overgrowth 
<LI>Maintain regularity 
<LI>Decrease straining 
<LI>Speed up the transit time of feces through the large intestine

<H1>Ericssons Alka-Mine Coral Calcium</H1>

<CENTER><HR></CENTER>

Coral Calcium is collected from the unique coral reefs around the Japanese
islands of Okinawa and Tokunoshima. These islands' inhabitants included
the oldest recorded person alive (121 years) and they have the lowest incidence
of serious illnesses such as cancer, arthritic conditions, heart disease
and digestive problems in Japan. Research suggests that over a period of
weeks, Japanese coral calcium helps to benefit and change the body's water
content - which makes up 70 percent of each of us, with blood being
90%, - helping to remove toxins, raise the alkaline content (thereby reducing
acidity), and improve the auto-immune system.

<A HREF="program.html"><B>The New Life Program</B></A><B>.............................$59</B><INPUT
TYPE="checkbox" NAME="teamupprogram" VALUE="order teamup program"><B>check
this box to order</B><BR>
All three of the products below - Formulas A, B & C. For greatest effectiveness,
this full program should be completed first. Afterwards, Formula C can be
used on a daily basis as a candida/parasite control supplement and as a
high quality source of fiber. Formula A can also be used daily or as needed.
Dr. Schulze recommends The New Life Program three to four times per year
as part of your preventative health program. A complete instruction booklet
is included. <BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="forma.html">Intestinal Corrective - Formula &quot;A&quot;</A>...............$20</B><INPUT
TYPE="checkbox" NAME="teamupformulaA" VALUE="order formula A"><B>check this
box to order</B><BR>
This stimulating formula provides both cleansing and healing to the entire
gastrointestinal system. It stimulates peristalsis (the muscular movement
of the colon). It halts putrefaction and disenfects, sooths, and heals the
mucus membrane lining of your entire digestive tract.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="formb.html">Intestinal Detoxifier - Formula &quot;B&quot;</A>
...............$19</B><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="teamupformulaB" VALUE=
"order formula B"><B>check this box to order</B><BR>
This cleansing and soothing formula is to be used periodically in conjunction
with the <B>Intestinal Corrective.</B> This formula is a strong purifier
and intestinal vacuum. It will draw old fecal matter off the walls of your
colon and out of any bowel pockets. It will also draw out posions, toxins,
heavey metals, and even radioactive materials such as strontium 90. This
formula will also remove over 2,000 known drug residues.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="formc.html">Intestinal Maintenance - Formula &quot;C&quot;</A>
............$20</B><INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="teamupformulaC" VALUE="order formula C"><B>check
this box to order</B><BR>
This formula restores and maintains regularity. The natural fiber promotes
proper elimination because of it's bulking effect in the colon. This is
because undigested fiber holds water, which offsets dehydration of the feces,
and increases bacterial flora. These action will create a softer stool,
decreasing straining, and speed up the transit time of the feces through
the large intestine. The formula is also designed to provide maintenance
doses of Paratrol, a proprietary herbal complex that helps control parasite
and Candida infestations.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../iss12/images/en.gif" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="319" ALIGN=
"RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Dear Reader,<BR>
<BR>
As the `somewhat still-new' publishers of this publication, we continue
to describe ourselves as a &quot;positive news&quot; newspaper. If anyone
were to ask what we are about, we continue to reply that we are an &quot;International
Solutions-Oriented Newspaper&quot;. And, although we are growing and changing
very rapidly. (evolving. we hope) we continue to consider ourselves in this
fashion.<BR>
<BR>
A `positive news' reality check is done many times before we go into print.
Many news pieces have stretched our minds as well as our hearts. We've gone
back and forth in deciding what is `positive news'? (How will we be received
if we print certain news articles?) (If there is already a negative reaction
to even the title of a certain piece of news, is it a waste of effort to
print it?) The question is always, &quot;what is positive news?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After a good bit of thinking, the answer comes: that 'positive news' is
not just the fun, or the `do good' stuff that we all like, (although that
is definitely a big portion of what we choose to print), but positive news
is.. TRUTH!<BR>
<BR>
And, of course, like always., that brings up another question ... like,
who's `truth' are we talking about here? In other words, what is TRUTH?<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's a tough question to answer folks, and, after much deliberation
over this question, our definition is...knowledge without bias and fear.<BR>
<BR>
We can only feel what is true and stay in the moment. So we present what
is knowledge and stay tuned to the changes.<BR>
<BR>
KNOWLEDGE (even if at first it does not appear positive), being the opposite
of ignorance, is really our goal. In other words, we want to present to
you the knowledge by which you decide if it is your truth or not. To do
this we often have to search out the other side of an issue in question,
or,( because time is still within limits here on earth)we just have to use
good ole' FAITH which comes from the heart.<BR>
<BR>
Some may wonder. `what is so positive about &quot;Secret Black Helicopters&quot;.
and why do I need to know about them?' And why do I need to know that Biological
Germ Warwfare is the cause of GWS and is being covered up?<BR>
<BR>
In answer to these questions, let us first assume that we are attempting
to publish this newspaper without fear.. (and isn't that good news!)  And,
we invite you the reader to experience a shift of mind whereby you become
less fear-based, too. In other words, as the reader, you are able to read
information (take it in) without the initial intense reactions that would
have normally been created by all of us in the past. It is just ` information'
and as such, cannot hurt us.<BR>
<BR>
We would like to assume that our readers are with us on this quest for knowledge
without fear. But first we must realize that it is `us' who, in the past,
have decided to runaway.  It has been `us' in the past who have assumed
the role of the victim. We were told and we assumed in the past that we
were powerless in making necessary changes. We were very scattered in our
thinking then. (don't you remember?) and, in our support of each other.
The past and present energy around world issues has certainly become quite
intense and who could blame our gentle souls for wanting to run away!(Some
have fought these issues with a voice, some with violence, some have ignored
the issues, and some have runaway in fright, others just keep on, keeping
on healing themselves)<BR>
<BR>
 Nothing in this publication has been published to frighten anyone. At the
most, it is a means of exchange for the purpose of change. We hope that
its message is one that assumes we are all very powerful beings.. that it
is not necessary to hide from even the most bizarre appearing information.
(Do we still hide from what we may still call, a physically deformed person,
or do we lend compassion knowing that that which we see is apart of us that
asks for healing?)<BR>
<BR>
We would ask the reader to relax for a moment while reading this publication
as if you were a reporter on the scene hearing information for the first
time. And, as a reporter, just doing your job, leave judgments and emotional
reactions behind you.   In this frame of mind. there is a lot to take in
and to learn about our world, the Universe. and its people. All kinds of
people. Many who believe in diverse ways of living and being.<BR>
<BR>
Again. our purpose is to &quot;Bridge the Light&quot;. Our understanding
of the word &quot;Light&quot; is knowledge, which again, is the opposite
of ignorance. When we are ignor or are unaware of the activities around
us, we are in the dark. ..and what is positive about that?<BR>
<BR>
We hope at this time we are all waking up to some truths. ..(Light, Knowledge).Have
you ever noticed that things we try to deny or hide from ourselves keep
coming back to our awareness?<BR>
<BR>
Over and over again, situations(lessons) keep repeating themselves in different
scenarios with the same message. Have you ever seen anyone who has actually
knocked them selves on the head when they just didn't get it, and then suddenly
they do! Like... dah! That knocking on the head represents what we do to
ourselves in other unconscious ways too, only with much more serious consequences.
Sometimes, we even kill ourselves before we wake up! Suppose then that we
find out (in some other dimension, perhaps) that we bought into someone
elses' idea of what there is to be afraid of. And, then realized how powerful
we were all along! We might think, ` Gee, I could have been an instrument
of change!' (Gee, I could have had a V8!...as that old commercial goes).
  <BR>
<BR>
The idea of exposing the truth through our publication is to acknowledge
that we (as in all of us) have created mistakes on this planet, and to stop
the blame.  We are as responsible for creating &quot;Black Helicopters &quot;as
any one else.. (all that fear, cover-up, and darkness that surrounds what
they are about doesn't go away just because we deny that it exists). Denial
is really an indignant attitude.  &quot;I am not going to address this because
it's not my reality&quot;. Just imagine if all parents took that attitude
when their children were acting in destructive ways, and they never exposed
any problem to the child...we'd really be in trouble! Chances are the child
would continue to act destructive until someone took notice and did something
about it! Often exposure does the work in creating change.   <BR>
Just like the child needs help in growing up; aren't a lot of us doing the
work of teachers by example. Isn't it interesting that we expose the truth
to those who need to grow up, and we get to learn how to wake up!   So,
come on, folks, it's really up to us! This is the role we have chosen and
it's time we jump in with our eyes open. No one is going to do it for us.
There are a few hundred important issues to look at and most are not pretty.
The good news is that together, and through communicating knowledge, we
can support each other and recognize our power to change any situation!<BR>
<BR>
Many thanks to our readers, contributors, and advertisers. You are the connecting
links of this publication. All communication is appreciated!  <BR>

<B>From Brownfield, TX.,</B><BR>
I recently had the opportunity to view your ad in the June issue of Colony
News. The offer for a current sample of your newspaper sounds great. However,
being incarcerated, the only money-like objects we are allowed to posses
is U.S. postal stamps. I would be happy to send you stamps for payment.
Your publication sounds very interesting and I will be looking forward to
your response.<BR>
<BR>
<B>From Rico, CO.,</B><BR>
We first saw the Planetary Connections newspaper while living in the Findhorn
Community in Scotland, and thought you might like an update for your U.S.
paper regarding the musical tour called, Piano Peace, my friend and I are
engaged in. It has gone quite well. <BR>
<BR>

A friend sent me a copy of Planetary Connections and you have surely gained
my interest. I am incarcerated at the moment as this is where my path of
grace has led during this time of change and enlightenment. I do mesh work
within the system in ways that can only be done from the inside. I do much
in helping to network and make available information in the way of books,
newsletters, magazines, etc. - sent in to me from `outside'. There are many
men who come through here seeking truth and ready for change; who are looking
for answers and ways to change their life to healthy, responsible, loving
patterns -yet do not know how to do so. Most of the reading and learning
materials offered through the prison system only seem to promote the same
dysfunctional beliefs and dogmas that have created much of the problems
in the first place. I look for ways to make the enlightening information
and knowledge that is rapidly growing as we move through this transitional
period of grace. I write to receive publications that are damaged or used
that people might send into us here. I have very little money - only what
I get inhere - so I can't pay much for ads. All that I receive I always
share with others and most all books are placed in our library here, after
they have been passed around a lot. I have seen many &quot;wake-up' and
begin New Paths solely from the books and reading materials - and Love -
sent in from the outside. Would you print the enclosed ad in Planetary Connections
for us and if there is a charge - tell me how much and I will send it to
you, but if it is more than $15.00,I won't be able to do it at this time.
(I work 3 hours a day at 41 cents an hour). (But I work in the kitchen and
I am vegetarian so its grace for me).Also, I write articles, so would you
send me your guidelines if you wish to hear from me. What I write is free
as it is grace and grace cannot be sold. <BR>

Appreciate the subscription and classified ad exchange connection. While
ColonyNews participates in subscription exchange programs with many publications,
I congratulate yourselves on the perceptive idea of promoting each other's
publications. You certainly are enlightened folks when it comes to networking.
Also, I enjoyed your publication very much. With so many publications entering
our office, it is difficult to read them all. However, I took yours to bed
with me and read the entire Paper before retiring. below is reciprocal classified
ad for your next issue.<BR>

<H2>The &quot;Free Energy&quot; Revolution Is Upon Us!</H2>
<IMG SRC="shiuji.gif" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="155" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="5" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"10">Shiuji Inomata's laboratory is in the Japanese Space City of Tsukuba.
Inomata is a senior scientist of 35 years' tenure with the Japanese Government
at the Tsukuba Electrotechnical Laboratory. He has a Ph D., is author of
dozens of peer reviewed papers and is president of the stereotypical Saturday
garage inventor. He has built a version of Bruce DePalma's unipolar generator
(sometimes called the &quot;N-manchine&quot;, connoting the production of
power to the nth degree).The machine in his laboratory is table top and
shows anomalous outputs once it runs beyond a certain threshold of speed.
<BR>
<BR>
Being visited by Dr. Brian O'Leary, en route to India. in February 1994.
Shiuji talked enthusiastically to Brian about a seminar he had just given
before the overflow audience of six hundred leading industrialists, academics,
and governmental scientists. &quot;I believe the people of Japan will support
free energy . he said in mostly understandable English with an endearing
grin.&quot;We have no domestic energy supply . We need it and we're not
suppressing it. Toshiba will spend two million dollars on superconducting
magnets for new unipolar generators (N-machines) that will give us over-unity.
more electrical output than input. Then we can manufacture them. . . Yes!&quot;
They nodded together in a manner exceeding mere courtesy.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Brian O'Leary knew what he was talking about. While most American decision-makers
are &quot;floundering in the backwash&quot; (a favorite John F. Kennedy
quote). denying and suppressing free energy, the Japanese are organizing
themselves to take off. Inomata and several other enlightened and highly
qualified scientists are moving into this area. and almost certainly it
will be only a matter of time before we see Japanese free energy devices
dominating the marketplace. <BR>
<BR>
Inomata's demonstration of his machine, a simple small scale replica of
the invention of Bruce DePalma, an expatriated American. convinced me this
very intelligent and well credentialed scientist was on his way to success
in concert with government, universities. and industry. <BR>
<BR>
Inomata then showed Brian a diagram that immediatly made sense to his own
path to enlightenment. It was a triangle whose apexes represent mass, energy,
and consciousness. It was the one gestalt that was needed to synthesize
in Dr. O'Leary's mind the very simple fact that our current science considers
only the internal and external relationships between mass and energy (immortalized
by Einstein's E-Mc2), while totally ignoring the influences of consciousness
on creativity. The addition of the relationships of consciousness with itself
and with mass and energy adds a new dimension to the linear mass-energy
paradigm and opens new doorways to under standing our greater reality. <BR>
<BR>
Edited from a synopses of the book Miracle in the Void by Dr. Brian O'Leary.<BR>
<BR>
About the author: <BR>
Brian O'Leary, PhD., is a former Apollo scientist-astronaut and Princeton
University Physics Department Faculty Member. He is co-founder of the International
Association for New Sciences and the Institute for New Energy. Miracle in
the Void, Exploring lnner &amp; Outer Space and The Second Coming of Science
comprise a trilogy of O'Leary's recent works on New Science. &quot;The Miracle
in the Void teaches us that we can all empower ourselves to clean our Earth
and save the life of this planet. We have within our grasp the power to
create beautiful new worlds. Science is telling us what is now. based upon
irrefutable experimental, theoretical, and personal evidence. I invite you
to trust the process and to walk with me through the visible into the invisible.&quot;
<BR>
Dr. Brian O'Leary from the conclusion of Miracle in the Void. <BR>

<H2>Music Used To Help Cancer Patients Heal </H2>
Music is said to soothe the savage beast.  Joyce Handler believes it can
also calm the personal demons people find within themselves. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;My music addresses a persons needs for hope, encouragement, support
and comfort,&quot; said Handler, an Upland, CA composer and psychologist
who uses music in her private practice, Healing Art. Increasingly, research
shows that music can do more than start toes tapping. It produces measurable
(unseen) benefits; it energizes. can lower ones blood pressure and can elicit
emotional responses. <BR>
<BR>
Handler recently started using her music to treat cancer patients. but says
it's beneficial in treatment for a number of problems. She has taught people
how to strengthen their self-esteem and develop trust in relationships using
music therapy. <BR>
<BR>
Cancer patients specifically started listening to music for emotional and
physical healing back in 1985. when a music therapy program was started
at University Hospitals of Cleveland in the Ireland Cancer Center. The Robert
and Beverly Lewis Family Cancer Care Center at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical
Center hosted a recent workshop demonstrating music therapy treatment techniques.
Handler led the event. using a synthesizer to pound out floaty New Age-type
melodies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Music therapy is one of the newest and most encouraging forms of complementary
treatment.'' said Martha Osborne, nurse educator at the center. &quot;We
all know how powerful, healing and overwhelming music can be and we hope
to help patients and their families get through the challenge of cancer.&quot;
Music releases many suppressed emotions cancer patients have and gives them
a chance to work through them, Osborne said.<BR>
<BR>
Lee Ehrenberg's cancer is in remission, but she attended the center's workshop
because she loves the music. &quot;I think it can be useful in helping people,&quot;
she said. &quot;I also thought the journaling was very therapeutic.&quot;
(Handler encourages workshop participants to jot down their feelings as
she plays.) Ehrenberg said she uses a variety of outlets including visualization
and meditation to help her battle cancer. &quot;Music therapy is another
way of making use of the things that are around us (to cope),&quot; she
said. <BR>
<BR>
Warren Hawkins agrees. His wife, Dorothy, is a cancer survivor. &quot;My
wife volunteers (at the center) and we do what we can to support (it),&quot;
he said. &quot;I found it very interesting to use the musical approach.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Janet Neil, a vocal coach and accompanist at Cal Poly Pomona said music
is not purely a passive experience. &quot;There very well may be music that
has some power.&quot; she said. &quot;I do believe that music is associated
with strong memory tracers much like certain smells trigger certain memories
for us.&quot; Osborne hopes the techniques discussed in the workshop will
help people battling cancer. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Having~ cancer is... like being dumped from a helicopter into a jungle
and into a maze.&quot; she said. &quot;Listening to music and allowing it
to take over the body in a sensory way can help provide pain relief.&quot;
Handler said people have likened her music to &quot;chicken soup for the
soul.&quot; &quot;I hope it gives people the tools to maintain hope through
the hard times,&quot; she said. &quot;The instrumentals let people feel
the comfort. Music stimulates the right side of the brain but it also cuts
right through to the heart.&quot; <BR>

<H1>Hopi Elder Informs United Nations Of Prophecies </H1>
<BR>
Thomas Banyacya was one of four Hopi spiritual leaders selected by traditional
Elders in 1948 to carry Hopi prophecies to the world. Since then, the elder
from Arizona has traveled throughout the world carrying the message of the
Hopi prophecies and how people can create a positive future. <BR>
<BR>
Three years ago, as the sole remaining Hopi messenger, Banyacya joined nine
other indigenous people to speak before the United Nations General Assembly.
Today, it is worth recalling his message. &quot;Hopi in our language means
a peaceful, kind, gentle, and truthful people. We made a sacred covenant
which includes the responsibility of taking care of this land and life for
(Massau'u, the Great Spirit's) purpose. Our goal is to pray and promote
the welfare of all living beings and to preserve the world in a natural
way.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Hopi leader said the prophecies indicate the world is in its &quot;final
days.&quot; He demanded that an investigation be made to stop the destruction
of native peoples' lives and homelands. He warned against ruining nature
and desecrating sacred sites. Banyacya emphasized that the Hopi center,
in the Four Corners area of the Southwest US, is a Sacred site which has
a special purpose for humankind's future survival. It should be left in
its natural state, he stated. &quot;It should be the mission of your nations
and this Assembly to use your power and rules to examine and cure the damage
people have done to this earth and to each other,&quot; Banyacya exhorted
the Assembly. &quot;It is up to all of us as children of Mother Earth to
clean up this mess before it's too late.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In his address, Banyacya invoked the Hopi prophecies about the consequences
of living out of balance with nature and spirit. Floods, earthquakes, extinction
of animals and birds, climate changes, hail storms, and many damaging hurricanes,
he said, are the loud voices of his ancestors' warnings. The evening of
the native speakers' appearance at the UN, heavy rain, strong winds, and
the worst floods in New York's memory assailed the New York City area. Major
highways were closed, and the UN building's lower subfloors flooded, forcing
a shutdown of its heating and air conditioning.<BR>
Native people attending the General Assembly considered these events more
than coincidental. Thomas Banyacya called on all the participants, including
UN officials, to form a great circle in a symbolic act of prayer. One participant
claimed she had never felt herself to be in such a safe place. Others noted
that no further storm damage occurred in Manhattan after the circle gathered.<BR>

<H2>Oil Giant About To Enter Amazon Territory</H2>
Similar operations by Shell in the 1980's led to the deaths of between 50
and 100 Nahua Indians. <BR>
<BR>
On March 26th, Mobil signed a contract with the Peruvian oil company, Perupetro,
giving it rights to explore for oil in two areas known as Blocks 77 and
78, each occupying 1.5 million hectares. Mobil is the key member of a consortium
which includes Elf and Exxon. The two blocks are located in the southeastern
Peruvian Amazon, in a region known to 19 different Indian peoples.<BR>
<BR>
This area is also renowned for being '&quot;he most biologically diverse
region of the planet&quot;. In the 19th Century the region was swept by
the rubber boom: 95% of the Indian population died at this time through
disease, slavery, starvation, and armed conflict.  <BR>
<BR>
Oil prospecting involves detonating underground explosives at intervals
and analyzing the shock waves for evidence of deposits of oil. Mobil plans
to cut at least 600 km of seismic lines in Block 77, and 400 km in Block
78. Their plans entail setting up a base camp in the Las Piedras basin,
and using 20 helicopters and 600 employees, to crisscross the concussion
area with explosive tests. Apart from the severe disturbance to the wildlife
of the area on which the Indians depend for their food, the tests are bound
to bring them into contact with the Indian people living there. Mobil is
well aware of the consequences and the tragedy that followed Shell's similar
activities nearby in the 80's. <BR>
<BR>
Mobil's contractors will work inside the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, an
area of land set aside for the Harakmbut. The final approval for the creation
of this reserve has been held up by the government so as not to interfere
with Mobil's operations. The Harakmbut Council, an organization of the Harakmbut
peoples within the local Indian organization FENAMAD, have expressed their
&quot;opposition to the entry of Mobil onto their titled areas and in particular
the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Mobil's plans are typical of an accelerating penetration of Indian territories
by oil companies. In Colombia, the U'Wa people are totally opposed to the
entry of Occidental into their reserve and have even threatened mass suicide
if this occurs.<BR>

<H2>Business Trends Revealed For The Next Millennium</H2>
<BR>
What fields will experience Increases by the year 2000 and beyond and what
fields are bad news as we charge toward the next millennium?<BR>
<BR>
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, three out of four workers in
the telephone industry like wirers, telephone operators, installers and
repairers will be out of work by the year 2000.<BR>
<BR>
The big loser will be unskilled and semi-skilled factory workers in manufacturing
including apparel workers, assembly line jobs, and packaging workers. This
is a direct result of increased methods of productivity (using less workers
to perform the same amount of work.)<BR>
<BR>
The outlook for farmers, word processors, machine tool cutters, sewing machine
operators, home child care workers, and computer operators is also on the
decline.<BR>
<BR>
<B>So what's the good news?</B><BR>
Opportunities for paralegals, home health aids, human service workers, computer
engineers, physical therapists, special education teachers, travel agents,
occupational therapists, electronic pagination systems workers, (desktop
publishing) and radiologists will grow at a rapid clip. The buzz word seems
to be health.<BR>
<BR>
Baby Boomers have a huge interest in protecting their health for the next
stage of their quality lives. They want and need information about how to
stay youthful and maintain peak performance. A boom in exercise centers,
personal trainers and a huge boost to the vitamin and health foods business.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the health craze will be offset by indulgence. There is already
a backlash to the &quot;healthy eating&quot; trend. The majority of regular
restaurant goers order calorie laden, rich desserts.<BR>
<BR>
Another trend in the food category is less exotic cuisine and more simple,
old fashioned home cooked meals. American foods and regional cooking is
on the rise. <BR>

<H2>(GWS)-Thanks To Biological Germ Warfare? </H2>
<BR>
Research evidence is accumulating to suggest the Gulf War Syndrome (GWS)
may be the result of genetically engineered germ warfare. That's the view
according to Garth Nicoloson, Ph.D., professor of pathology and internal
medicine. , chairman of the tumor biology department at the M.D, Anderson
Cancer Clinic in Houston, Texas (the largest such facility in the world),
and the author of over 400 scientific papers.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Nicoloson argues that the GWS microbe seems to be the product of combining
a gene from the HIV-AIDS virus with a mycoplasma (a tiny cellular component,
normally harmless, until activated) to produce a new super pathogenic and
infectious microbe not otherwise found in nature.  The genetic engineering
was presumably in the U.S., Nicolson says, then sold with at  least 10 other
biological warfare agents to the Iraqi government between 1984 and 1989.<BR>
<BR>
As many as 6000 U.S. soldiers have already died from this otherwise mysterious
illness, at least I5,000 more are sick from it, family members never in
the Gulf are becoming infected. and miscarriages and congenitally deformed
children are attributed to it as well, says Dr. Nicolson.<BR>
<BR>
Further, GWS symptoms are strikingly similar to chronic fatigue syndrome
on 31 points. With the highest correlation (85%) being aching joints. Dr.
Nicolson hints that the biological-warefare-derived  microbe may be central
to both illnesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Nicolson has published information on
his successfully antibiotic treatment (tetracycline at 100 mg. 2 times daily
for 10 days, although up to 6 courses may be required) for GWS. Dr. Nicolson
contends, based on private sources, that the GWS-HIV mycoplasma microbe
may have been tested on the prison inmate population in Texas.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have possibly uncovered  one of the messiest controversies and
cover-ups since Watergate.&quot; Dr. Nicolson states.&quot; There is a huge
cover-up of immense proportions. A lot of people are not happy about this

<H2>A Visionary Political Process <BR>
That Goes Beyond Left and Right</H2>
It is clear that Washington D.C. is locked into the most adversarial mode
of relating anywhere in the country, Republicans fighting Democrats, the
Mayor fighting the Control Board,  and citizens fighting each other over
every possible issue. So what greater need can there be for a new visionary
leadership that transcends adversarial approaches?<BR>
<BR>
To answer this need. a place of hope and positive vision has recently been
founded right in the very heart of our nations capitol, called, The Center
for Visionary Leadership.<BR>
<BR>
Washington D.C. is very different from any other U.S. city and what is most
unique and attractive is that most residents originally went there with
a strong commitment to create a better world. Many have actually managed
to avoid cynicism. burn-out or corruption. and are still working to hard
to achieve the ideals they believe in.<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to create a place to support those who are doing good work
in Washington D.C.; A place for people to gather that would provide inspiration
and new ideas, here they could meet other like mind and offer a platform
for social innovators.<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Visionary Leadership was created as a new, non-partisan educational
center bringing in a spirit of community and commitment to ethics and spirituality
in public life. Lectures, courses and citizen dialogues are offered in an
environment of heart-felt dialogue with an intellectually stimulating community
of members and friends. Spiritual development, leadership training, and
seminars with visionary leaders from around the country are featured. <BR>
<BR>
Indepth training in the Ageless Wisdom of the East and West through monthly
courses called. &quot;The Science of the Soul&quot;, is offered. Participants
practice the art of Iistening to other points of view, reducing defensiveness
and seeking common ground.    <BR>
<BR>
One Of our main purposes to foster a new political process that goes beyond
left and right.  Recognize there is some truth on both sides of most polarized
issues in our society today. we promote non-adversarial. win-win approaches
to problem-solving for mutual benefit. <BR>
<BR>
We have invited visionary leaders from around the world to serve On our
Advisory Board, Including Humane Society President John Hoyt, founder of
the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Satish Kumar, Director of Schumacher College
in England, Ambassador John McDonald, former Congresswoman Claudine Schneider,
Professor Jeff Fishel of American University, and Marianne Williamson, best-selling
author A Return to Love and A Woman's Worth. Marianne kindly offered to
do a benefit lecture for our Center this spring. Claudine Schneider and
Jim Wallis, author of The Soul of Politics, have also given lectures.<BR>
<BR>
We really need our friends around the country to help bring a positive vision
to Washington D.C. and promote a true spirit of community. Please write
or call for information on how you can get involved as a member. a volunteer
or a supporter. Corinne McLaughlin and Gordon Davidson are co-authors of
Spiritual Politics, and Builders of the Dawn and Co-founders of Sirius,
an ecological village and educational center in Massachusetts started in
1978. Corrine has taught politics at the American University, and Gorden
is the former Executive Director of the Social Investment Forum and the
Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics. <BR>

<H2>PARASITES: The Silent Killer </H2>
<B>Are parasites harming your health? </B><BR>
You may be under the impression that parasites are rather harmless and can
only do severe damage in very exceptional cases. After all, one hardly ever
hears of people becoming blind because parasites have damaged their eyes,
or that parasites have lodged in someone's brain, causing severe mental
and neurological problems. it is very unlikely that you have ever even seen
a parasite. Therefore, why should anyone worry so much about them? <BR>
<BR>
<B>America the clean?</B> <BR>
Many believe that America is a squeaky clean country that has effective
sanitation methods that prevent the spread of parasites. The predominant
misconception is that parasites are a problem for tropical and third world
countries and not or the US. In reality, nothing could be further from the
truth. These freeloaders are the cause of an unknown epidemic that plagues
a great number of people throughout the world, including the US. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Seen and unseen? </B><BR>
Parasites can be microscopic in size or can stretch 30 feet or longer. When
most people think of parasites, they visualize tapeworms. hookworms, roundworms
and flatworms. The centers for Disease Control says that tapeworm infection
in the past 10 years. This is most likely due to the consumption of under
cooked beef. Fleas have been known to carry tapeworms, so it's possible
to get them if you have pets. Hookworms can be contracted from walking barefoot
on infected soil. Roundworms average 6 to I 8 inches in length and can lay
thousands of eggs each day. They can actually block the intestines! Roundworm
infection is abundant in meat-eating cultures. One type of flatworm, a fluke,
can live in the intestines, liver, lungs, or blood. Trichina is a tiny worm
that infects pigs. The larvae. after burrowing into the intestinal wall,
enters the blood vessels. The blood carries the larvae to the muscle fibers
where these worms live and grow. <BR>
<BR>
Although most people think of visible worms when parasites are mentioned,
microscopic parasites are a huge problem. Worms, such as the hookworm, attach
themselves to the intestinal wall and live off the host's blood. Microscopic
parasites do not live off their host as such, but can thrive on processed
foods. and their excretion can cause serious problems within the human body.
The Centers for Disease Control considers Giardia the number one water borne
disease. Who said you can only contract parasites in the mountains? They
have been found in the water supplies of major cities in America. Giardia
is one of the many microscopic organisms that can greatly interfere with
physical and mental functioning. This parasite can coat the intestinal wall,
inhibiting digesting and assimilation.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>How can I get parasites? </B> <BR>
Parasites can be contracted by eating undercooked beef, pork, fish, or other
flesh foods, walking barefoot on infected soil, through sex and casual contact,
being bitten by flies, mosquitoes and animals (mainly in the tropics), eating
unclean raw vegetables, drinking infected water, close contact with cats,
dogs, or other pets, and simply contacting filthy environments through breathing
and touching. There is an increased danger of contacting parasites when
traveling to tropical and/or underdeveloped countries. The rise in immigration,
especially from these areas, also contributes to the epidemic in the US.
In Brazil, American Trypanosomiasis causes 30% of adult deaths. The World
Health Organization categorizes parasites as among the six most harmful
infective diseases in humans. The fact is that parasites outrank cancer
as the number one killer in the world <BR>
<BR>
<B>How can I tell if I have parasites?</B>  <BR>
Determining if you have parasites can be very difficult indeed. This subject
has not received a great deal of attention. and such, accurate testing methods
are still being developed.  However there are some facilities that specialize
in parasitology. There will be an increased demand for effective testing
procedures, especially as the parasite problem gets the attention it deserves.
Recent outbreaks, such as that which has occurred in the water supply in
the Midwest, will only expedite the development of parasitology. The outbreak
mentioned was caused by Cryptosporidia, a microscopic that infected thousands
of people. Some of them died, especially those with weakened immune systems.
This is not the first time something like this has happened. Problems claimed
to be caused by parasites include: hypoglycemia; indigestion; lack of energy;
colitis; back pain; headaches; acne and other skin problems; poor assimilation;
nausea; vomiting; spaciness; weight loss; a felling of fullness in the stomach;
uncontrolled appetite; gas; and much, much more. Some researchers state
that the waste material produced by flukes is extremely carcinogenic and
contributes to the formation of cancer. The waste material from just one
tapeworm is often enough to make a person ill. Microscopic parasites can
also cause arthritis-like symptoms. Some call parasites &quot;The Great
Masqueraders.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Is there a way to prevent parasite infection?</B><BR>
It is impossible to avoid all situations that could lead to a parasite infection.
There are a few basic precautions that can serve as a guideline to follow;<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>Drink clean, pure water. Distilled water is very good. However, there
are many types of purification methods that can produce clean water. Reverse
osmosis, solid carbon block, and other types of systems can ensure that
the water you drink is free from possible contaminants. Contrary to popular
belief, chlorination does not kill all parasites. If you live in the city,
by a filter or purified water from a store.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Always wash your produce, especially vegetables. Food grade hydrogen
peroxide is ideal for scrubbing vegetables, but it must be handled and stored
carefully.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>If you eat some sort of flesh food, make sure that it is thoroughly
cooked.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Follow a through, effective parasite cleansing program.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Maintain a healthy lifestyle. A strong body makes for a great line
of defense against parasites.
</OL>
A consistently poor diet can promote very poor intestinal health, creating
the perfect environment for parasites to live and grow.<BR>

</H1>
<HR>Once you look at the requirements of a good intestinal cleansing and
detoxification program, it's easy to see that no one formula or magic pill
can accomplish it all. We recommend a three-pronged approach. 
<OL>
<LI>Intestinal Corrective 
<LI>Intestinal Detoxifier 
<LI>Intestinal Maintenance 
</OL>
<B><A HREF="forma.html">Intestinal Corrective - Formula &quot;A&quot;</A></B><BR>
This stimulating formula provides both cleansing and healing to the entire
gastrointestinal system. It stimulates peristalsis (the muscular movement
of the colon). It halts putrefaction and disinfects, soothes, and heals the
mucous membrane lining of your entire digestive tract.<BR>
<BR>
This herbal formula also: 
<UL>
<LI>Helps improve digestion 
<LI>Relieves gas and cramps 
<LI>Increases the flow of bile (which in turn cleans the gall bladder, bile
ducts, and liver) 
<LI>Destroys Candida albicans overgrowth 
<LI>Promotes a healthy intestinal flora 
<LI>Destroys and expels intestinal parasites 
<LI>Increases gastro-intestinal circulation 
<LI>Is antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal 
</UL>
<B><A HREF="formb.html">Intestinal Detoxifier - Formula &quot;B&quot;</A></B><BR>
This cleansing and soothing formula is to be used periodically in conjunction
with the <B>Intestinal Corrective.</B> This formula is a strong purifier
and intestinal vacuum. It will draw old fecal matter off the walls of your
colon and out of any bowel pockets. It will also draw out posions, toxins,
heavy metals, and even radioactive materials such as strontium 90. This
formula will also remove over 2,000 known drug residues.<BR>
<BR>
The natural mucilaginous properties of this product will soften old hardened
fecal matter for easy removal and also make it an excellent remedy for any
inflammation or irritation in the stomach and intestines. This formula is
also helpful with irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, and hemmorrhoids.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="formc.html">Intestinal maintenance - Formula &quot;C&quot;</A></B><BR>
This formula restores and maintains regularity. The natural fiber promotes
proper elimination because of its bulking effect in the colon. The undigested fiber works to hold water, which offsets dehydration of the feces,
and helps to increase bacterial flora. These actions will create a softer stool,
decrease straining, and speed up the transit time of the feces through
the large intestine. The formula is also designed to provide maintenance
doses of Paratrol(tm), a proprietary herbal complex that helps control parasite
and Candida infestations.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Frequently Asked Questions</CENTER>
</H1>
With diseases of the digestive tract on the rise, more Americans are realizing
that they need to take a step towards preventive maintenance, New Life
is the product that can help.<BR>
<BR>
About 95% of the people who use New Life experience positive results and
become more aware of their bodies' internal signals. This means they are
more apt to change a few of their daily habits to enjoy better health for
a longer period of time. However, as with any significant health program,
questions arise.<BR>
<HR>Some of the commonly asked questions about Dr. Schulze's New Life Intestinal
Health Program follow:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Can I become addicted to a herbal laxative?</B><BR>
No, it's practically impossible to become addicted to natural herbs. This
program is designed to regulate, cleanse, and maintain normal bowel movements.
In fact, there is no problem with continuing to use Corrective-A indefinitely,
even after finishing the Intestinal Health Program.<BR>
<BR>
<B>What is a normal bowel movement?</B><BR>
A normal bowel movement is soft and unformed, and should occur 2-3 times
a day. This is miles away from the dense, solidly formed movements most
people think are normal, but ARE NOT!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Is it normal to experience gas and bloating?</B><BR>
Yes, the reason you may be experiencing these conditions is because your
bowel is being agitated, and the waste is not exiting. When this occurs,
continue to increase your dose of Corrective-A until you notice a change
in your movement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Are there any food restrictions while taking New Life?</B><BR>
There are no food restrictions while taking New Life, but remember the reason
why you are taking New Life to begin with. It's those eating habits you've
already established that <A NAME="anchor717862"></A>have guided you to New
Life. So what is recommended, is that you be more consciously aware of the
foods you are putting into your system, and make changes accordingly.<BR>
<BR>

<B>Is it normal to have abdominal tenderness?</B><BR>
No. You may experience muscular movement, along with occasional cramping
and aching, but these effects are minimal.<BR>

    <TITLE>Coral Calcium Background</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#b4faff">
<H1>Coral Calcium Background<HR></H1>
It all started in 1979 on the islands of Okinawa and Tokunoshima, off the
coast of Japan, when a British journalist from the Guinness Book of Records,
was given the assignment of interviewing Shigechiyo Izumi, the world's oldest
documented living person, a sprightly 115 year old man in remark-ably good
health. The journalist was astonished by his vitality and the fact that
he had worked until the age of 105. After noticing that most of the islands'
inhabitants were in ridiculously good health and seldom died before age
95, he persuaded Mr. Izumi to submit to a medical check-up.<BR>
<BR>
The results were nothing short of fantastic. How could a person of his age
possibly be so healthy? A team of researchers came to the island to answer
this question and made some amazing discoveries. They found that the water
the islanders drank was different from water found anywhere else in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
These particularlar islands were built up over the years from coral reefs.
When rain falls on the islands, it percolates down through these ancient
coral deposits and picks up minerals and other elements that make it truly
unique. Not only did it contain many essential minerals that made it very
similar chemically to the elements found in the human skeleton, body
fluids, and the amniotic fluid and blood, but it also was very alkaline, with
a pH of 8.6.<BR>
<BR>
After years of research, it was found that just a small amount of these
special coral sands added to just about any liquid would bring it into pH
balance.<BR>
<BR>
Further, they found that it also neutralized any waste products that may
be present in water and added a number of important substances often removed
during treatment at local water plants. Even water of poor quality that
contained impurities such as bacteria, algae, heavy metals, fluoride, and
chloroform left over from the treatment process, representing considerable
health hazards, could also be helped to be brought into balance.<BR>
<BR>
Eleven years ago, the health conscious Japanese government authorized Coral
Bio-Tech Company, Ltd. to mine the coral sand that had collected on the
sea floor around Okinawa. Today, the company has 85,000 employees in Japan
involved in the mining, packaging and distribution of the coral sand to
over four million Japanese who use the product daily.<BR>
<BR>
Coral Bio-Tech, careful not to damage any of the living coral, extracts,
pulverizes and treats this Sango coral sand, which has been enriched with
valuable minerals and trace elements from the sea. The coral is then packaged in one gram packets similar to a small tea bag.
When placed into any liquid, water, juice, coffee, tea, beer or wine, its
high concentration of calcium and magnesium carbonates raises the liquid's
pH level from acidic to alkaline.<BR>
<BR>
But the story didn't end when the world's oldest documented living man finally
passed away at the ripe old age of 121. The product went from Japan to Europe
and now to the United States. Today you can quench your thirst with water
that contains the same properties that helped to give him such a long and
healthy life, Ericssons Alka-Mine Coral Calcium.<BR>

    <TITLE>The Acid/Alkaline Balance</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#b4faff">
<H1>The Acid/Alkaline Balance<HR></H1>
Water is the single most important nutrient for sustaining human life. The
body consists of 70% water, the blood 90%. It is responsible for transporting
nourishment to every living cell and is the key to all bodily functions.
Under normal conditions, the average person requires 1.5 to 2.5 liters of
water a day.<BR>
<BR>
But just how pure is the water you are currently ingesting? The quality
of drinking water, with surface water as its source, is steadily deteriorating
because of pollutants, pesticides and acid rain. Even the ground water we
drink is becoming more acidic.<BR>
<BR>
Water quality can become acidified by bacteria, algae, chloroform  (from
chlorination), nitrates, and heavy metals (cadmium and
aluminum). These pollutants may come from factory discharges, agriculture,
sewer pipes, water mains and acid rain.<BR>
<BR>
Water treatment facilities chlorinate water in order to kill bacteria. But
the pipes that carry the water to you may also be a culprit. The deteriorating
network of water mains  in a majority of the world's cities was most likely
installed 25 to 75 years ago and is probably a primary contributor to acidity
and asbestos release.<BR>
<BR>
Even with a water purification system in your home, your water may be clean
but also &quot;DEAD&quot;.<I> </I>To illustrate the value of balanced water,
at an acid pH level of 6, crabs die. And fish die at a pH of 3.<BR>
The human body has tremendous healing powerer if properly nourished. The
perfect pH balance required to sustain  a  healthy  life  is between 7 and
8.6. By drinking 1.5 liters of water a day treated with a single packet
of coral calcium, one can be helped to maintain a perfect pH level of 8.6.
This can help cleanse the kidneys, intestines and liver while helping to
break down heavy  metals and drug residues in the body. It also contains
various antioxidants that help protect the body against free radicals.<BR>
<BR>
Our bodies are alkaline by design and acid by function. Maintaining alkalinity
is essential for life, health, and vitality. All leading biochemists and
medical physiologists have recognized pH or acid/alkaline balance as the
most important aspect of a balanced and healthy body. They have long known
that the maintenance of an alkaline pH is critical to cellular health.<BR>
<BR>
We live and die at the cellular level. In order to understand pH balance,
it is necessary to realize that all the billions of cells of the human body
are slightly alkaline and must maintain constant alkalinity if they are
to produce acid that gives us energy and function.<BR>
<BR>
Alkalinity is anabolic (builds up) and acidity is catabolic (tears down).
As each alkaline cell performs its task of respiration, it secretes metabolic
wastes, which are acid, the end product of cellular metabolism, but must
not be allowed to build up. The body goes to great lengths to neutralize
and detoxify these acids before they are in a position to act as poisons
in and around the cell, changing the environment of the cell.<BR>

<H1>Personal Results With Coral Calcium<HR></H1>
Early last year, an article was published in <I>BEST </I>Magazine about
a new product that appeared to help a sufferer of rheumatoid arthritis to
feel better. The product? Alka-Mine Coral Calcium. Three months later, a
big box of chocolates and a heartfelt thank you letter arrived at the <I>BEST
</I>health desk from readers Arthur and Marjorie Lee.<BR>
<BR>
Marjorie, 56, had been wheelchair bound for eight years with rheumatoid
arthritis. She'd tried everything from anti-inflammatory pills to gold injections,
but her condition had only deteriorated. Then, after reading about coral
calcium in <I>BEST, </I>she began taking it.<BR>
<BR>
Marjorie reports feeling better, more energetic, and full of confidence
for the future. She believes the product may have helped to improve the
mobility in her muscles and joints, and to stop the muscle spasms. She can
walk without pain and assistance again.<BR>
<HR>After four weeks on coral calcium, Peter Gaibraith, 52, was ready to give up. An osteoarthritis sufferer for 12 years, he has had repeated surgery
on his spine, the vertebrae in his neck and both knees.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've been in agony for as long as I can remember,&quot; he says. &quot;Then
a friend en route from Spain  to America stopped off with us, saying he
had just the thing for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After four weeks, Peter felt no better but his wife insisted he persist.
Two weeks later, he indicated to her that he felt better. She replied, &quot;I've
known that for the past two weeks.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now Peter feels wonderful. He cannot  help believe, whenever he walks, and
especially when he runs, that coral calcium somehow helped him to feel better.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Intestinal Corrective - Formula &quot;A&quot;<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H1>
<B>Therapeutic Action</B><BR>
This stimulating formula provides both cleansing and healing to the entire
gastro-intestinal system. It stimulates peristalsis (the muscular movement
of the colon). It halts putrefaction and disinfects, soothes, and heals
the mucous membrane lining of your entire digestive tract. This herbal formula
also helps improve digestion, relieves gas and cramps, increases the flow
of bile (which in turn cleans the gall bladder, bile ducts and liver), destroys
Candida Albicans overgrowth, promotes a healthy intestinal flora, destroys
and expels intestinal parasites, increases gastro-intestinal circulation
and is antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal.<BR><BR>
<B>Contra-Indications</B><BR>
If pregnant, use only with the guidance of a health care professional.<BR>
If suffering from Colitis or any inflammatory intestinal disease, check
with your doctor.<BR>
If experiencing diarrhea, check with your doctor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instructions For Use;</B><BR>
Day 1: Start with only one capsule of the Intestinal Corrective, during
or just after dinner. This formula will work best when mixed with food.<BR>
<BR>
Day 2: This morning you should notice an increase in your bowel action and
in the amount of fecal matter that you eliminate. The consistency should
also be softer. If you do not notice any difference in your bowel behavior
today (or the difference wasn't dramatic), then tonight increase your dosage
to two capsules. You can continue to increase your dosage every evening
by one capsule until you notice a dramatic difference in the way your bowel
works. It has taken most of us years to create a sluggish bowel, so you
need to be patient for a few days and increase by one capsule each day only.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ingredients</B><BR>
Curacao Aloe (Cathartic, whole leaf), Cape Aloe (Cathartic, whole leaf),
Senna (Cathartic, leaves and pods) , Cascara Sagrada (Cathartic), Barberry
Rootbark (Promotes bile flow, parasite control), Ginger Root (Moves gas
and stimulates the intestines to move fecal matter forward), Garlic Bulb
(Anti bacterial, viral, and fungal, parasite control), African Bird Pepper
(Strong bowel stimulant, helps stop bleeding), Fennel (Promotes digestion).<BR>
<BR>
By the end of the first week you should know what your ideal dosage is.
If not, then remain on this formula alone for an additional week to get
regulated before you go on to the <A HREF="formb.html">Intestinal Detoxifier</A>.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Intestinal Detoxifier - Formula &quot;B&quot;<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H1>
<B>Therapeutic Action</B><BR>
This cleansing and soothing formula is to be used periodically in conjunction
with the Intestinal Corrective (Formula A). The Intestinal Detoxifier is a strong purifier and
intestinal vacuum. It will draw old fecal matter off the walls of your colon
and out of any bowel pockets. It will also draw out poisons, toxins, heavy
metals such as mercury and lead, and even remove radioactive material such
as strontium 90. This formula will also remove over 2,000 known drug residues.<BR>
<BR>
Its natural mucilaginous properties will soften old hardened fecal matter
for easy removal and also make it an excellent remedy for any inflammation
or irritation in the stomach and intestines. This formula is helpful in
irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, and hemorrhoids. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Contra- Indications<BR>
</B>Intestinal obstruction.<BR>
Constipation. Make sure your bowel is working frequently before you begin
this product.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instructions For Use<BR>
</B>Use the <A HREF="forma.html">Corrective Formula</A> until your bowel
is working frequently and easily (usually about 1 week).<BR>
<BR>
Week 2: At the beginning of week two is when you should begin using the
<B>Intestinal Detoxifier. </B>Take this formula 5 times each day beginning
in the morning (for 6 days). One hour after a morning nutritional drink,
mix one level 15cc scoop of Intestinal Detoxifier powder with 6 to 8 ounces
of diluted juice. It mixes best if you shake it in a small jar or mix it
in a blender. Do the same 1/2 hour before lunch, between lunch and dinner
(mid afternoon), 1/2 hour before dinner and one hour before bed, so that
you are consuming a total of 5 level scoops each day.<BR>
<BR>
During or after dinner, take your Intestinal Corrective capsules as usual
- but increase your dosage (the dosage you discovered the first week on
the program) by 1 additional capsule. If you feel a bit bound by the Intestinal
Detoxifier, you can increase your dosage of Intestinal Corrective even more.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ingredients<BR>
</B>Flax Seed (Lubricant. Source of Omega 3&amp;6 oils), Apple Fruit Pectin
(Heavy metal detoxifier. Used at Chernobyl for radiation detoxification),
Bentonite Clay (Absorbs 30-40 times its weight in toxins and fecal matter),
Slippery Elm Inner Bark (Mucilaginous, Detoxifing), Marshmallow Root (Mucilaginous,
Detoxifing), Licorice Root (Mucilaginous, Heals ulcers and herniations),
Fennel Seed (Carminative, Promotes digestion), Activated Willow Charcoal
(Greatest absorber of toxins and chemicals known).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Helpful Hints</B><BR>
It is helpful to drink additional liquid after each dose of Intestinal Detoxifier,
at least 8 more ounces. Drink plenty of pure water, herb teas, and fruit
and vegetable juices during this two week colon cleanse. A good amount is
between 2 to 4 quarts of liquid each day. This makes the program more
effective.<BR>
<BR>
When you have finished with the Intestinal Cleansing and Detoxification
2-week program, it is time to begin <A HREF="formc.html">Intestinal Maintenance</A>.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Intestinal Maintenance - Formula &quot;C&quot;<HR></CENTER>
</H1>
<B>Therapeutic Action</B><BR>
This formula restores and maintains regularity. The natural fiber promotes
proper elimination because of its bulking effect in the colon. The undigested
fiber works to hold water, which offsets dehydration of the feces. It also
increases bacterial flora. These actions will create a softer stool, decrease
straining, and speed up the transit time of the feces through the large
intestine, which is beneficial for conditions of diverticulosis and diverticulitis.
The formula is also designed to provide maintenance doses of <I>Paratrol</I>(tm),
a proprietary herbal complex designed to control parasite and candida
infestations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instructions For Use</B><BR>
When you have finished with the <A HREF="forma.html">Intestinal Cleansing</A>
and <A HREF="formb.html">Detoxification</A> 2-week program, it is time to
begin Intestinal Maintenance. Mix one level 15cc scoop of the formula into
8 ounces of water or juice. After drinking it, drink an additional 8 ounces
of water or juice. Take 1-3 times a day as 
needed. If required to maintain proper bowel movement, <B>continue taking
</B>the Intestinal Corrective at whatever dosage is necessary - for
as long as necessary.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Contra-Indications<BR>
</B>Intestinal obstruction.<BR>
Constipation. Make sure your bowel is working frequently before you begin
this product.<BR>
Consult your physician before using if you have any difficulty in swallowing.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ingredients<BR>
</B>Psyllium Seed Husk, Alfalfa Grass, Oat Bran, Barley Grass, Rice Bran, Carob
Bean, Apple Pectin, Licorice Root, Guar Gum, Peppermint Leaf, Senna, Ginger
root, Acacia Gum, Papain,Carcia papaya, Fig Fruit, Black Walnut Hull, Flax
Seed, Barberry Rootbark, Garlic Bulb.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Continued Good HeaIth</B><BR>
In an ideal world, we would never have to clean and detoxify our colons
again. Unfortunately, the same lifestyle that caused the problem in the
first place will eventually cause it again. As a preventive therapy, it
makes sense to redo the 2-week Intestinal Cleansing and Detoxification program
four times a year - every three months - - along with daily use of the Intestinal
Maintenance formula.<BR>
<BR>
Regular use of this three-part program will help keep your body in optimal
health and vitality for as long as you live.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck and Good Health!<BR>

Madnick is developing. It includes non-polluting fireworks, a 2,000-person

</BLOCKQUOTE>
MASSACHUSETTS, USA - &quot;I use art and technology to create a beautiful,
multimedia spectacle. People come for the spectacle and walk away with the
message we weave through it,&quot; says Jackson Madnick, whose childhood
nickname of The Wizard still fits.<BR>
<BR>
His wizardry engulfs his audiences in multiple dimensions of sight, smell
and sound. Jackson is a science artist and technological showman who creates
illusions with laser beams, giant video screens, high-tech lighting, and
special, low pollution fireworks.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I weave a message of hope, vision, and harmony into the program that's
harmony among people, to reduce ethnic tension and division and environmental
harmony to help save our planet for ourselves and for the children of future
generations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Madnick lives in Framingham, Massachusetts and has produced shows in Rio
de Janeiro, Florida, and throughout New England. He has done productions
in London, Amsterdam, and the U.S. Southwest. His presentations range from
30-second commercials to six-hour, sky and stadium, multimedia shows.<BR>
<BR>
One party was a surprise 50th-birthday celebration for Marti, wife of video
tycoon H. Wayne Huizenga. Four hundred guests attended the six-hour event
in North Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium. Madnick directed a crew of 3,000 to
create the production and special effects. An angel flew into the stadium
singing &quot;The Wind Beneath Our Wings&quot; to bring attention to volunteerism
and the angels who help others. Marti's name was dramatically set alight
by a flaming arrow shot over the audience's heads. This feat won the special
effects highest honor in the country. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I always bring in a small team and work with 300 to 5,000 local production
people, choirs, and dancers. I can choreograph anything and everything,
if it's not nailed down, along with the music,&quot; the 40-something Madnick
declares.<BR>
<BR>
When the mill town of Lawrence, north of Boston, hired Madnick and his colleague
Dr. Jane Hayes to stage the city's New Year's celebration, Madnick's half-hour
production won two national awards. But for Jackson Madnick, who has been
on his own since a teen, the show's success was measured by the way it helped
reunite a town torn apart by racial tension and riots.<BR>
<BR>
Lawrence citizens came forward to help create the show about love, freedom,
dance, brotherhood, and sisterhood. The cast included large groups of children
and a choir of 5,000 local singers. On the City Hall roof, 14 dancers in
fire-proof suits made patterns and shapes with hand-held pyrotechnics. All
this was combined with a giant video and laser show. <BR>
<BR>
Without advertising, the event attracted nearly 40,000 people. &quot;It
was inspiring and goosebump-producing,&quot; remembers Jackson. &quot;I
think everyone involved shared a special, once-in-a-lifetime experience
they will never forget.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For his 1990 Bassmaster's Classic show on the environment and water conservation,
Jackson Madnick received the national GALA Award for best entertainment
concept in North America.This award recognizes significant artistic and
technical achievements in large-scale media events and public celebrations.
Past recipients include world-famous production companies such as Walt Disney
and Radio City Music Hall.<BR>
<BR>
The Bassmaster's Classic in the Richmond Coliseum featured a 30-foot round
waterfall with laser holograms of whales and dolphins, 200 singers and 500
performers. Although it was honored with a Gala award, Jackson most fondly
remembers its impact. &quot;It helped inspire this fishing group to collect
a million signatures to help renew the Clean Water Act that was about to
expire.&quot; <BR>

<P><CENTER><I>Richard Hoagland has studied NASA's own images of Earth's
moon (above) and the planet Mars (below).Could there be a connection between
the equilateral triangle seen in the moon pictures and the pyramids and
famous face of Mars?<BR>
</I><IMG SRC="mars.gif" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="162" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Richard Hoagland, former NASA Consultant and CBS News Science Advisor to
Walter Cronkite, is now presenting an update to the information given in
his beginning synopsis of a journal called The Journal of the Mars Mission
that has led to many more startling visual discoveries.<BR>
<BR>
In September of 1992, a few days after lift-off of the Mars Observer, Richard
Hoagland acquired a lunar atlas compiled by the Space Sciences Laboratory
of North American Aviation, Inc. At first glance each photo resembled the
next-distance and close-up, craters and maria. Then his eye fell to the
south-east corner of page 241, where the crater Triesnecker first appeared
in the collection. One Xerox enlargement later, and Richard knew he had
taken his first step on what was to become the first stage of a new research
project bridging the gap between the Earth, Mars, and now the Moon.<BR>
<BR>
The extraordinary photo revealed an unmistakable image of an equilateral
triangle - the foundation of tetrahedral geometry, the hallmark of hyperdimensional
physics - immortalized in a crater in the center of the Moon. Was it a trick
of light and shadow - as NASA likes to say - or was it real? Armed with
a 486 personal computer, a 1600 dpi scanner and a variety of state-of-the-
art digital photo-processing software - more powerful than all the millions
of dollars in equipment and manpower that NASA had 25 years ago - Richard
began to analyze anew, from his desktop, old photos and negatives from Apollo
10, The Lunar Orbiter and The Surveyor.<BR>
<BR>
On June 2, 1994, at Ohio State University, Richard C. Hoagland, presented
the results of his 2-year investigation, using NASA's own images from the
Lunar Orbiter, Surveyor, and Apollo programs, which show stunning images
of light- reflecting remnants of a vast dome structure over Sinus Medii,
a tetrahedral light pattern of structural components in the crater Ukert,
a complex of identically-sized precisely- aligned double-craters on the
floor of the crater Murchison, suspected to be the north- western edge of
the Sinus Medii dome, and a host of other inexplicable, obviously artificial
constructs on the moon.<BR>
<BR>
The results of Hoagland's astounding visible discoveries, even to the untrained
eye, is continuing and never ending on a course of incredible connection
within our Solar System.<BR>
<BR>
On August 27, 1993 Lars- Jonas Angstrom, head of the Angstrom Foundation
of Sweden, presented the prestigious Angstrom Medal, for the first time
outside of Sweden, for excellence in science, to Richard C. Hoagland in
Washington, D.C. The Board of the Angstrom Foundation decided to award the
medal to Mr. Hoagland for those aspects of the Mars investigation relating
to &quot;hyperdimensional physics&quot;: this area of study is based on
Hoagland's, and his colleagues', successful decoding of a redundant mathematics
and geometry found in a complex of potential artifacts on the planet Mars.

<H1>Sarajevo Women's Conference</H1>
<BR>
Thirty-three women and three men slipped through the ring of the military
emplacement surrounding Sarajevo to attend the second Through Heart to Peace
Conference of Women of the World, held at the end of May this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Through Heart to Peace&quot; is a peace initiative begun by a Croatian
woman, Erna Miocinovic, and a Bosnian woman, Emsuda Mujagic, in 1993, in
conjunction with Hazelwood House, of England.<BR>
<BR>
Participants came from ten countries; the women's ages ranged from twenty-two
to seventy-two. To enter the city, they walked by night from Mount Igman,
just outside Serb lines, through seven miles of mud and water and sniper
fire, in order to show solidarity with the besieged. At the conclusion of
the conference, they brought out with them a thirteen-year- old boy who
had been sent to Sarajevo for a minor operation in 1992 and had been stranded
there without his family for three years. They also brought a book of pictures
drawn by ten-year-old Damir Draguli. My Sarajevo will be printed in Britain
by Hazelwood House, with proceeds to help support the eighteen thousand
Sarajevan orphans.<BR>

Bruno Groning Delegation.</I></CENTER>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bruno Groning Delegation from Germany have returned to their homeland
after a very successful tour teaching what is referred to as, &quot;the
Divine Healing Stream&quot;. This teaching was first brought to Denver,
Colorado, USA from Germany in Sept. 1995, followed by a tour to California
and New York. The tour group of The Circle of Bruno Groning-Friends, and
Denver host, Ron Radhoff, is Peter Arnolds, Wilhelm Trienen, and Frau Grete
Hausler, the woman responsible for bringing the Circle of Bruno Groning
Friends to many communities. On tour Frau Grete Hausler speaks in her native
German language from the depth of her heart about her own healings, and
the many thousands of healings of others. She is interpreted by her friend
and colleague, Wilhelm, and assisted on the tour by her friend Peter. There
are several, &quot;Host- Friends&quot; scattered all over the globe, including,
the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, France, Poland,
Hungary, Rumania and many more, and now including the United States. In
1981 Grete Hausler published her first book on Bruno Groning. She set up
a publishing house of her own so that the book, &quot;Hier ist die Wahrheit
an und um Bruno Groning&quot; could be published.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="bruno.gif" WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="Left" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

The Divine Healing Stream teaching was introduced by a man named Bruno Groning
(1906-1959), born in Germany in 1906. He has been described as a plain man
with wonderful curative powers that led him to become a sensation in the
press in Germany, in 1949, and then he became known all over the world.
Headlines ran through the press: &quot;His word expels the illness&quot;
or &quot;Bruno Groning cures the paralyzed, the blind and the mute...&quot;
People hit by the suffering and poverty of World War II streamed by the
thousands to him to get help and healing. It was reported that Biblical
scenes took place and Mass healings occurred.<BR>
<BR>
However, these events also brought forth strong opposing forces which, like
black clouds, overshadowed the &quot;happenings.&quot; The vast stream of
help seeking people caused displeasure with a few influential public figures.
Prohibitions of speaking and healing, legal procedures, and defamatory campaigns
of the press against Bruno Groning were their means of controlling this
development. These attempts of suppression ended seemingly successful on
January 26th, 1959 when Bruno Groning died.
<H2>The great reversal</H2>
<BR>
Bruno Groning's words are fulfilling themselves: &quot;If it is God's will,
I will continue to help!&quot; For this reason the circle of Bruno Groning-Friends
has been formed to pass on his simple teachings. People are being instructed
how to consciously absorb the &quot;Healing Stream&quot; - a Divine Force
one can feel in one's body. Such experiences lead, step by step, to the
Divine Order which is health, inner harmony, and joy for life.<BR>
<BR>
Today, more and more people meet in the Circle of Bruno Groning-Friends

of my deeds and workings is to lead all people on this earth onto their

Closely following their model in presenting the practice of the Healing
Stream, Bruno Groning had said: &quot;I do not sell the Divine Force!&quot;
the circle solely subsists on voluntary donations and the gratuitous work
of the friends. The practice of the Healing Stream, although spiritual,
is not one of any certain religion or philosophy . It can be practiced by
individuals and is presented in a very simple form that anyone can practice
to achieve results. The Divine Healing Stream, also called, the Divine Energy
Stream works not only in the area of healing, but also in all aspects of
our lives.<BR>

Lower Triglyceride Levels</CENTER>
</H1>
Research indicates that coronary artery disease accounts for 75% of hospital
admissions and 80% of deaths among people with diabetes. And in this group,
elevated triglyceride levels appear to be a particularly ominous risk factor
for heart disease. <BR>
<BR>
Now a new study suggests that chromium supplements may be a simple, inexpensive
means of lowering triglycerides in people with non-insulin dependent (type
II) diabetes. <BR>
<BR>
In the study, reported in Diabetes Care, researchers gave one group of diabetics
200 micrograms of chromium a day for two months. A control group received
an inactive substance. Then, after a two-month &quot;washout&quot; period
of no treatment, the study participants were switched to the opposite agent
for two more months.<BR>
<BR>
The results: In each group, triglyceride levels fell an average of 17% during
chromium treatment and was associated with no side effects and had no effect
on other lipid levels or on glucose control.<BR>
<BR>
For more information on use of Chromium and Chromium Picolonate in triglyceride
and weight reduction, its beneficial use in many other health considerations,
and about how to obtain free samples please call 800-873-1620.<HR><A HREF="../planethm.html">PLANETARY

<H1><CENTER>Electricity May Zap AIDS Virus</CENTER>
</H1>
NEW YORK, USA - Doctors at a well-known New York medical center are using
electrical energy to weaken the virus believed to cause acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Their first test results, they say, are encouraging.
<BR>
<BR>
Zapping the AIDS virus with low-voltage electric current can nearly eliminate
its ability to infect human white blood cells cultured in the laboratory,
according to the first laboratory reports from researchers at the Albert
Einstein School of Medicine. <BR>
<BR>
William D. Lyman and his colleagues found that exposure to 50 to 100 micro
amperes of electricity - comparable to that produced by a cardiac pacemaker
- reduced the infective nature of the HIV virus, which many believe leads
to AIDS, by 50% to 90%. Their experiments, described at the First International
Symposium on Combination Therapies in Washington, DC this year, showed that
the shocked viruses lost the ability to make an enzyme crucial to their
reproduction, and could no longer cause white cells to clump together&oacute;two
key signs of virus infection.<BR>
<BR>
The two men next tested the current on blood samples from people with AIDS.
The researchers envision treating AIDS patients with an s electrical device
or with a dialysis- type machine which could treat an AIDS patient's blood.<BR>
<BR>
Lyman, an AIDS researcher and associate professor of pathology at Einstein,
suggests also that blood banks might use electricity to zap HIV; and vaccine
developers might use electrically incapacitated viruses as the basis for
an AIDS vaccine. A simi-lar technique has been usedused as a treatment for
reducing herpes. - Biomedicine, March 30, 1991.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1994, electronic-resonance machines have been available to consumers
on the open market. One resonance machine was developed by Bob Beck, a California
inventor and researcher who outlined his findings at the Global Sciences
Congress in Denver, CO in August of this year. His research shows that this
machine can be effective in the HIV virus. His tests have also shown successful
and rapid results in neutralizing the viruses which cause herpes, Epstein
Barr and hepatitis. Beck theorizes that the resonance machine &quot;zaps&quot;
viruses, cleansing the blood in about three weeks without harming normal
blood cells. <BR>
<BR>
These machines can be constructed with little expense or expertise by anyone.

Mainstream Recognition</CENTER>
</H1>
<I>AP wire service</I> SEATTLE, USA - Homeopathy recently joined the ranks
of alternative health treatments gaining recognition and greater esteem
in the mainstream medical community. A study published in &quot;Pediatrics&quot;
showed how homeopathic treatment sped the healing up to 25 percent in Nicaraguan
children suffering from accute diarrhea, a major killer. The study, appearing
in the May 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
was the first on homeopathy to appear in an American medical journal. The
study was conducted by epidemiologist Dr. Jennifer Jacobs at the University
of Washington, a practicing homeopath. Dr Jacobs treated half the subjects
with a placebo and the other half with one of 18 homeopathic remedies, which
work on the theory that trace amounts of a substance resembling the internal
disease have curative powers. The group receiving homeopathic atttention
recovered between 15 percent and 25 percent faster than the control group.<BR>

<H1>Bridging Light - Are We There Yet?</H1>
Dear Readers, <IMG SRC="images/en.gif" WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="319" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
Are We There Yet? Not yet, but soon, maybe tomorrow. Anyone who has made
a long trip with small children will remember the plaintive voices calling
out, &quot;Are we there yet?' Like children, we have all been anxiously
scanning the horizon looking for signs that we are THERE! Of course, no
one knows exactly where this &quot;new age&quot;(or, new way) &quot;there&quot;
really is; and that has been a large part of the challenge. <BR>
<BR>
In many parts of the world (including our own) we have heard that there
has not been enough spiritual (or other) leadership being shown. People
have wanted a strong person to lead them and tell them just what is going
on and what is expected of them. Sorry! This is not the way. <BR>
<BR>
Here, by leaders we are not talking about the wonderful facilitators and
networkers who have naturally fallen into helping to gather groups. We are
talking about the people who in the beginning of our journeys have courageously
shared their insights of our future and then to have had thrust upon them
our tremendous expectations to KNOW EVERYTHING! Many times we have made
these leaders accountable to our lives instead of reaching inside, and feeling
the answers to our questions, trusting all will be answered. No wonder that
a few of the so-called leaders of the past have gone bonkers! What a burden!
<BR>
<BR>
The good news is that more and more of us are now collecting the information
for ourselves from our own prayers, meditations, and miraculously, from
each other. (But not so miraculous when you consider that the Indians of
all nations have been doing this for so many thousands of years.) Small
groups (powwows), of world servers (aren't we all?) are forming everywhere,
giving testimony as to what is transpiring from doing their own homework.
People are listening to each other with even greater respect. We now take
into our being what resonates within us and are learning that we can let
go of what does not. In a word it's called, TRUST! <BR>
<BR>
It reminds me of putting together a jigsaw puzzle and putting some pieces
aside for a later time. These pieces just might fit into the whole picture
down the road. By doing this, we give value to each other in the moment
as we weave a network of knowledge that can later complete the whole picture.
From TRUST, these pieces can bridge knowledge or, LIGHT if you will, and
support all of the questions and answers we may have of the future. It is
considering that we are all in this picture together and serving one another.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are we there yet?&quot; No, not yet... it's a continuous journey.
There is no exact destination but if we stay attuned (awake) the rewards
are many along the way. We can look forward to many unusual and interesting
knowledge games to play (filled with real feelings) that take us even further
along our paths. Thanks to Unicorn Ashram for continued support to Planetary

<B>From Dilisboro, NC.,</B><BR>
Though we have never met, the threads of our lives keep intersecting through
the activity of planetary Connections. My own life has been impregnated
with a concept for a worldwide Fellowship since 1976. To this end, I've
started three non-profit corporations whose focus is for spiritual growth,
wellbeing, and self-mastery.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Lightweaver (original creator of planetary Connections) used the
Spiritual Growth Foundation as a vehicle for Planetary Connections in its
earlier years. I helped to proofread two issues of Planetary Connections
during the Summer of 1993. In 1994, when PC was published by HeartPath,
Earle Belle contacted me to distribute PC in this area.<BR>
<BR>
My efforts to establish a world wide Fellowship have been since 1976. I've
lived in six different states trying to understand the alchemy that would
make a worldwide fellowship possible. Twenty years later I have as little
insight into what would contribute to a fellowship of community-based affiliates
worldwide as when this concept first came to me.<BR>
<BR>
Is there some reason the threads of our lives keep intersecting through
planetary Connections? Is it possible that PC can allow space for ideas
on how to link existing Community Light Centers in all communities worldwide?<BR>
<BR>
If this can be a potential feature for Planetary Connections, I would offer
my services as a focal point for a forum to explore a worldwide network
of Light Centers.<BR>

I was so pleased to see you at our last Bruno Groning Healing Circle gathering.
You did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the German delegation
presentations and the mission of the Bruno Groning Circle of Friends.<BR>
<BR>
I see in you two loving people who are very committed to publishing events
and articles of spiritual truth. You two are a great teacher by your example.
Reading your articles of events I attended, i.e., Global Science Congress,
the International Forum on New Science and of course the Bruno Groning presentations,
demonstrate your awareness and the ability to capture the essence of these
events.<BR>
<BR>
You are doing a wonderful service and yes, time is accelerating, for time
and vibrational frequency correlate. Looking forward to seeing you both
soon again. Sending love and healing energy, <BR>

Over the last few years I have been in regular contact with Michael Lightweaver
and planetary Connections, particularly in relation to the twice yearly
Marine Meditation which I organize globally on the Spring and Autumn Equinox.
I share with people around the world on the basis of a &quot;gift of Love&quot;
some beautiful meditations given to me by an energy known to me as<BR>
I am enclosing a tape containing two of those meditations along with a couple
of the appropriate crystals (you are asked to hold a piece of the appropriate
crystal in your left hand to commence the meditation) as a gift of Love
to you. Earth Mother began as a group of six but is now down to a group
of two, and our physical Centre closed last year, but we are determined
to continue our work in the field of energy based healing, meditation, and
participation in the growing global circle of LOVE and HARMONY I embrace
you with the Rainbow of my Love.<BR>

I'm happy to hear that Planetary Connections has fallen into the hands of
another person who sounds very aware and knows the publishing trade. I'll
shortly put into a nutshell a little of our background: we are an international
team of people who see the changes happening upon earth. We want to help
support humanity through it's crisis, working to galvanize people into taking
actions that will help them to ride as gently as possible through these
times. To prepare people and communities for change and help reconstruct
those that are already in the midst of some sort of upheaval. Our sister
school is now in Germany and we are soon to have an intermediate student
exchange program.<BR>

I enclose my first check to subscribe for the last four issues. When I get
these then I'll resubscribe for more. It's what I've been looking for. I
am involved with a program of farmstead cultural activities. These activities
began December 12, 1972 and continue until now. I am 81 and farm with Jersey
cows, make pure yogurt, do natural healing, take folks in for natural nutritious
meals, and, I have a wild life preserve. I am excited at having this new
news.<BR>

We acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your Planetary Connections. You
will be happy to know that we have placed your interesting newspaper in
our Lodge Library for the use of aspiring seekers on the path. It is always
a joy to exchange philosophical literature for the enlightenment of mankind.
We take great pleasure in forwarding herewith the following which we sincerely
trust will be useful to you. We are all &quot;Centers of Light&quot; and
as such, must be in contact to form the great Network of Light which is
spreading all over the world. We are of the opinion that each religion in
its pure mystical aspect is essentially universal in outlook and broadly
based on spiritual freedom. What is necessary and vital is to transform
and divines the inner heart of man, so that inter-religious understanding,
cultural integration and spiritual unity can be fostered for the benefit
of all.<BR>

I have several things to send you that are what I consider &quot;good news&quot;
assuming that its still the purpose of &quot;our&quot; paper. I have not
seen an issue for many months. I have not created the time for writing my
report on the recent gathering of &quot;The Grandmothers&quot; at Biosphere
in Tucson, AZ which was a joyous and spiritually moving Commitment by many
wise women. That will be my next submission. I want to write more but I'm
still compiling my latest book: &quot;ONLY YOU are the HEALER&quot;. I also
contribute monthly to Chris Griscoms publication: &quot;The Flower Lover&quot;.
I would like a copy of your latest Planetary Connections if possible. Thank
you for your great work!<BR>

<H1>Tourists Walking On Canopy May Save Rain Forest In Ghana</H1>
Swinging through the forest a Ghanaian tour guide walks across a swinging
rope bridge in Kakum National Park, Ghana. Standing hundreds of feet above
the floor of lush forest, Mansa Orraca-Tetteh, a 36 year old native Ghanaian
who now lives in Virginia, says that she's seen enough trees to last her
a life time.<BR>
<BR>
By the end of her lifetime, the tropical trees and wild animals of West
Africa's rainforests may no longer be in sight.<BR>

"3">The upper Guinean Forest that covers part of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia
Sierra Leone and Guin is one fifth its former size. &quot;These places are
just becoming little fragments in a sea of land completely altered by humans,&quot;
said John Oates, a zoologist and anthropology professor at City University
of New York who studied primates at Kakum National Park, one of those fragments.
&quot;If we're not careful, Kakum would be the only place left with any
protection.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kakum is a 145 square mile sanctuary in the southwestern corner of Ghana,
where forest elephants, monkeys, and elusive bongo antelopes roam among
more than 800 species of birds and butterflies, reptiles and amphibians.
What may save it is tourism.<BR>

and assistance from private American conservation and tourism groups, Ghana
has turned the forest into a tourist attraction just 18 miles from its impoverished
seaside cities.<BR>
<BR>
If successful, it will be a remarkable achievement for West Africa, which
has never been able to compete with the big-game reserves of eastern and
southern Africa.<BR>
<BR>
War, poverty and lack of education have destroyed much of the once-lush
environment of West Africa. The cutting of timber, a crucial foreign currency
earner in the region, has led to the ruin of forests. Years of civil war
in Liberia and Sierra Leone have decimated animal populations.<BR>
<BR>
Ivory Coast, named for its once-flourishing elephant population, can barely
support a game park. A joint venture with South Africans failed after the
investors, angry over what they viewed as disinterest from the Ivorian government,
pulled out and left the antelopes they had imported to be killed by poachers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;West African wildlife is seen with a very utilitarian perspective;
everything is eaten and the poaching preserves are enormous,&quot; said
Mari Omland of Conservation International, a Washington based group providing
technical support to the Ghanaian government.<BR>
<BR>
Omland believes Kakum can become a major tourism site that protects the
environment while providing jobs in one of Ghana's poorest regions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I believe West Africa is really sort of the new opportunity in Africa
for wildlife viewing,&quot; she said in a telephone interview. &quot;Kenya
is still a very spectacular experience to be able to do wildlife safaris
there... but the place is really overrun by tourists.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kakum opened last year, and in April and it inaugurated the only tree-top
walkway through an African rain forest, a vertigo-inducing, swinging bridge
that winds through the trees at heights reaching 140 feet. Park officials
hope for 21,000 visitors by year's end and revenue of $40,500 from admission
fees - about $3.00 for foreigners and 50 cents for Ghanaians.<BR>
<BR>
But the economic benefits go far beyond that. The nearby Cape Coast area,
known for its historic slave castles and dramatic scenery, is hoping increased
tourism and new hotels will translate to $5.7 million in annual revenue
and create hundreds of jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Visitors can spend days in the park before spotting the timid forest animals,
one reason the developers added the tree walkway. &quot;We needed to have
realistic expectations. We know we wanted to have something other than the
wildlife that people would demand,&quot; said Chuck Hutchinson, technical
advisor in Kakum for the Midwest Universities Consortium for International
Activities. &quot;Even if people don't see animals, they're happy that they've
come.<BR>
<BR>
They may glimpse a pack of elephants hiding amid the tropical trees or spot
the skittish bongo antelope with zebra like stripes. Sadly, Oates said,
he found no trace of the endangered red colobus monkey and white-collared
mangabey found only in western Ghana and neighboring Ivory Coast.<BR>
<BR>
Kwame Aduyaw Sasah, one of Kakum's guides, hopes that by explaining the
value of the forest he grew up around, he can help save it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;South Africa is all about big game and hunting,&quot; Kwame said.
&quot;Here it's all equatorial. It's all about getting people to respect
and understand our environment.<BR>

<H1>David Thibodeau Gives Statement Before Joint Committee on Waco </H1>
<IMG SRC="images/david.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="280" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">M.R. CHAIRMAN, on February 28, 1993, the world witnessed a vulgar display
of force set against a community of people living in a large home on the
barren prairie lands of Texas. One hundred men dressed in black with fully-automatic
weapons, that initially were reported to be set for two round bursts, attacked
and fired into a building containing a majority of women and children. The
evidence of the pattern and the amount of the holes passing through the
sheet rock walls indicated other than just a two round burst. The video
taken from behind the BATF lines indicated not that the BATF were being
ambushed as, initially reported, but that they were on the set of a RAMBO
movie. BATF agents are seen standing up behind cars, that if they were in
danger, they would be kneeling behind. The agents were also depicted shooting
indiscriminately into the second story of the building, where the women
and the children were. <BR>
<BR>
The helicopters in the back were firing indiscriminately into the building
as well, according to eyewitness testimony. The roof of the tower was riddled
with bullet holes shot from the air. After the shooting stopped, five of
my closest friends, people whom considered family, were dead, not to mention
the five Alaskan Malamute dogs gunned down by the BATF as they stood barking
in a penned up area toward the front of the building helpless to protect
themselves. I would say the child abuse began when the BATF murdered the
children's dogs, while the kids, cowering under the upstairs beds, listened
in horror as their pets cried out in pain and anguish from the ATF slaughter
of the animals. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/before.gif" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="164" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Three or four eye witnesses I spoke with claim the BATF shot first into
the building. The trials in San Antonio indicated that vital evidence was
not entered in. The twin steel doors at the front, one David Koresh had
in his hands when he attempted to greet the BATF, were riddled with bullet
fire coming from the outside into the building. One door was entered into
evidence by the prosecution, while the other door the prosecution claimed,
&quot;must have disintegrated in the fire.&quot; There is a curious lack
of any video tape taken from the BATF surveillance house across the street
on the day of the raid. It's obvious that something is being hidden from
the public. I find it surprising with the amount of agents on the scene,
the largest raid in law enforcement history, that at least one camera was
not functioning to record the early segments of this raid. <BR>
<BR>
There was no trust between the people inside and the FBI from the onset.
The rift between the FBI negotiators and the tactical commanders did nothing
but create a disharmony as opposed to a trust needed in such a volatile
situation. Despite all the biased press reports David Koresh was coming
out! The Seven Seal manuscript was the zenith of his life and not allowing
him to finish it after having been promised truly did bring about one of
the saddest days in American History. If I didn't get to see the tanks come
into our living room, blocking passage ways and knocking down stairs, causing
the building to be knocked off its foundation shaking it like it were some
large earthquake, I never would have believed this was the land I grew up
in, the country I loved, The United States of America. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/after.gif" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="164" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">&quot;We're not going to fire into the building&quot;, the speakers
exclaimed as four hundred ferret rounds, as big as a coke can, were fired
into the building. One of those ferret rounds hit Jimmy Riddle in the side
of the head. Barrel after barrel of the liquid CS gas were sprayed into
the building, enough to debilitate a number of the people, if not all of
the people. The crime scene had already been destroyed by the tanks previously
so why not just tear the building apart, causing an oxygen flow system in
the building as well as a fire hazard. The area around the building had
been cleared as if a fire break were being created. The fire trucks were
held at the check points till the fire virtually consumed the building.
The plane flying above the building was armed with an Infra-red camera recording
the events, and finally, I want to know, why was Parkiand Memorial Hospital
called at 6:00 a.m. the morning of April 19, by the FBI, and asked, &quot;how
many beds are available in your burn unit&quot;. It seems grossly negligent,
if not criminal. The FBI could prepare enough to ask the hospital about
the availability of beds in their burn unit, but not have a tank equipped
to fight a fire. <BR>
The saddest part of all is the claim Janet Reno and the FBI made over and
over, the children, we will do nothing to endanger the children. It is my
testimony that the children would have been much better off with out the
Government concern and intervention Had the BATF talked with the sheriff
Jack Harwell, or come to the property in peace when David had invited them
out, this whole thing could have been avoided. It takes a brave public servant
that believes in the rights of all people of this nation to go to the door,
knock, present a search warrant, and proceed from there. This phenomena
of the &quot;dynamic entry&quot;, shows nothing but cowardice and fear,
strength in numbers, and power in oppression. Not the America I remember,
or one I wish to live in with my family in the pursuit of happiness. Sincerely,<BR>

<H2>Romancing The Great Stone &amp; Secrets Of Alchemy</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/gold.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="193" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">David Hudson has referred to himself as being a dirt farmer. He began
as a dirt farmer and then became a miner of gold and silver. He had never
read a word about alchemy until he began testing a by product from the mining
of gold and silver. The by-product was a mysterious fine white powder. Many
laboratory analyses failed to determine the content of this white powder.
Finally, when he took his samples to chemists and metallurgists at the University
of Moscow, the analysis revealed about 95% pure gold and in other samples
95% rhodium iridium. By synchronicity David was given the Time-Life volume
entitled The Secrets of Alchemy. This book discussed the search by the alchemists
for the white powder gold and its incredible promise of obtaining the secrets
of immortality, eternal youth, and enlightenment!<BR>
<BR>
The white powder form of gold is described in the Bible, in the Keys of
Enoch, and in Nostradamus's prophecies as the ORME Tree or as Manna. The
white gold powders are said to repair the cellular DNA. By using it, brain
function is increased from the common 10% up to 100% consciousness with
the ability to realize our full potential. It is said to literally bring
us into our light bodies.<BR>
<BR>
In the Israel and Hebrew traditions the high priests of Melchizedek were
called the righteous kings. The powder taken by these people enabled them
to see the future and the past and to enjoy telepathic communication with
animals, man, and angels or aliens. These high priests who lived a monk-like
existence are referred to as the Essenes. The Essenes had life spans of
800-1000 years. They dressed all in white and were the healers, and the
miracle workers. They were the original high priests who had the knowledge
of making the manna, or white powdered gold.<BR>
<BR>
These monk-like people had no business trade. but they had a foundry. Among
the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls recovered was a copper scroll listing 26 tons
of gold and 46 tons of silver as present in the community. and a tremendous
amount of precious metals! With the metallurgical foundry they produced
the elemental materials and fed them to select people who went through initiations
in order to perfect themselves. They were said to have angels or light beings
living in their community.<BR>
<BR>
Many people agree now that John the Baptist, Mother Mary, Christ, and the
Disciples were all Essenes. The Gnostic Gospels state, Mary was raised as
a high priestess, and she was fed the White Dove.&quot; The aichemical symbol
for the purified white gold powders was a white feather or a white dove.
Mary was chosen to carry the Davidic blood line and was fed the material
and became a light being.<BR>
<BR>
The Davidic blood line is traced through the D'Anjou family and branched
into the House of De Guise and De Lorraine down to Marie Antoinette Von
Hapsberg de Lorraine. In the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, the family lineage
is greatly detailed.<BR>
<BR>
In the Hebrew tradition the king is simply the advisor, the one who shares
wisdom. This goes back to the tradition of the Hebrews as the Meichizedek
prophet kings of great wisdom. The prophesy is that a descendant of this
family, a latter day David, will plant the golden tree of life that brings
about the millennial kingdom, the ORME Tree. <BR>
It has been said that this knowledge would come back in the end times when
there would be a nation of high priests, not an elect high priesthood, and
wood be available to everyone. To partake of it, it is said that you can
reach a state of perfection where you can literally ascend and take your
physical body with you. You can reach the point like in the Hebrew Book
of Enoch where it says, Enoch ascended by partaking of the white drops.<BR>

<H2>Russian Scientists Astound Westerners With ESP Studies</H2>
<IMG SRC="images/petersberg.gif" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="318" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">RUSSIA - A party of 16 English people who attended the
June 1995 Study of Consciousness and the Physical Universe conference in
St. Petersburg said that the Russians revealed far more than expected about
their research into extrasensory phenomena in the physical world.<BR>
<BR>
As reported by Keith Wakelam in the August 1995 Network magazine, eminent
scientists such as Dr. Anatoly Akimov revealed &quot;an unexpected&quot;
depth of spiritual awareness in the analysis of how computer logic, even
fuzzy logic, differed from the working of the human mind and brain.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Beyond our physical concepts of space/time electromagnetic and gravitational
fields there had to be something like a Life Field, which was not physical
yet which impinged on our space,&quot; reports Wakelam. Russians methodically
investigated classical science, quantum mechanics, pseudo-science and religious
beliefs, Wakelam says, to arrive at the idea of a Torsion Field which produces
spin in the real world.<BR>
<BR>
Similar to an electrical charge creating a magnetic field, this torsion
field spin conveys information at speeds exceeding light, and thus is viewed
by Russian scientists as being responsible for ESP phenomena. In revealing
the intricacies of their research, the scientists spoke of a Torsion Field
Computer which could employ the torsion field to explain the human link
to nature, to heal and to solve global problems.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Gennady Shiphov continued to develop the idea of a Torsion field with
his talk on the paradigm of the physical vacuum and the problem of Super-consciousness.
It involved the existence of sub-physical levels at which the Torsion field
operates thus requiring a change in our ideas of four-dimensional space/time.<BR>
<BR>
Alex Muscovsky spoke to the conference about paranormal, telekinetic, and
precognitive events. He described the universe as a multitude of scenarios,
depending on volition, the movement possible scenarios related to movement
of consciousness.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Evgeny Bondarenko talked about special measuring devices which had been
developed for testing Psi interactions and how these gave information on
how the brain radiates ultra-short impulses. With this and other knowledge
the Russians have developed practical instruments were used in recent earthquakes
to detect people buried alive in the wreckage. Some 39 people were located
in this way, Wakelam reports.<BR>
<BR>
Anthony Akimov delt with the ESP potential associated with structures. In
crystalline structures, for example, the crystal lattice could act as a
resonator for Torsion field experts. People within a pyramid shaped structure
of accurately shaped crystalline stone could experience alteration of blood
lymph and cell fluids due to the enhancement of the Torsion field, with
potentially damaging effects over long periods, Wakelam reports.<BR>
<BR>
The group of 16 from England later enjoyed a post conference tour of the
St. Petersburg area. Reprinted from Network <BR>

<H2>Parks Or People - Conservation and Native Peoples</H2>
Most Western conservationists still tend to a romantic, Eurocentric conception
of nature as an empty, unspoiled wilderness, separate from and uncontaminated
by humanity. This idealization is an inevitable response to the dehumanizing
effects of industrial society and the attractions are obvious. The 'wilderness'
becomes a place of refuge for urban people and it appeals to the conscious
of corporations wishing to prove their own 'green' credentials. In this
view, the indigenous inhabitants of these 'wildernesses' are at best an
inconvenient disruption of the great romantic myth, at worst a menace to
be repelled by barbed wire and guns.<BR>
<BR>
The world's tribal peoples are outraged that western conservationists think
they can manage their lands better than they can. They are angry that their
land is regarded as a 'pure', unspoiled wilderness rather than a place where
people have lived for generations. Ruby Dun Stan is Chief of the Nklap'mux
people from the Stein Valley in British Columbia, Canada, who are campaigning
against logging. She knows that the wilderness concept insults the Indians'<BR>
intelligence and has done nothing to protect them from the loggers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I never thought of the Stein Valley as a wilderness. My Dad used to
say, :that's our pantry.&quot;... But some of the white environmentalists
seemed to think if something was declared a wilderness, no one was allowed
inside because it was so fragile. So they have put a fence around it, or
maybe around themselves.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The sinister implications of the wilderness approach to conservation are
not lost on the native populations of countries like Canada and Australia,
for whom 'discovery' by white settlers meant land theft and death. From
the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia was deemed 'terra nullius'
empty land by the British, giving the colonists carte blanche to dispose
of the land and its peoples as they pleased. This was only overruled by
the Australian High Court in 1992, in a decision with profound implications
for facing eviction from their lands, calling their home wilderness in 'terra
nullius' in green wrapping paper.<BR>
<BR>
Conservationists and loggers might seem strange bedfellows, but they often
share a disrespect for the rights of tribal peoples. Like logging and mining,
wilderness conservation has meant driving people from their lands by repression
and deceit. But conservationists use the language of environmental concern.
They are 'aware', they tell us, of their 'responsibility' for the land,
although they rarely admit that efforts were fiercely resisted by tribal
peoples. Politicians use conservationist language to sound virtuous. Call
anything &quot;sustainable' these days and it is bound to raise cheers all
around.<BR>
<BR>
Forced resettlement of tribal peoples to make way for national parks and
game reserves is costly and inefficient. Quite understandably, it gives
rise to anger and resistance, as well as destroying indigenous patterns
of agriculture, hunting and land ownership. Most important of all, however,
it is a gross and intolerable violation of human rights.<BR>
<BR>
All too often, conservationist resettlement programmers are a convenient
cover for more sinister agendas of forced 'assimilation'. The Vedda, Sri
Lanka's last remaining aboriginal inhabitants, were evicted from the Nadura
Oya National Park in 1983 as part of the Mahaweli Development Program. A
predominantly hunter-gatherer people, they were forced to become rice cultivating
peasants. This has caused confusion and mayhem in Vedda society. One small
group who refused to leave the forests was continuously harassed by officials
and police. Their presence on their ancestral lands become 'illegal', as
did their entire way of life because hunting, and the gathering of honey,
plants or roots (all of which are fundamental to Vedda survival) were against
park regulations.<BR>
<BR>
When tribal peoples are 'allowed to remain' in national parks, they are
frequently presented as exotic species to be 'conserved', provided that
they play by the rules. In Botswana, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve was
set up to protect the 1,000 'Bushmen' and 300 Bakgalagadi people living
in the desert, as well as they changed their way of life, adopting small
herds of cattle and using 'non-traditional' weapons for hunting, conservationists
claimed that they were endangering wildlife and threatened to expel them.
The government changed its plans to resettle the 'Bushmen' and Bakgalagadi
after Survival launched an international campaign on their behalf, proving
that the real damage to the Kalahari came from large-scale cattle ranching,
diamond mining and tourism.<BR>
<BR>
Lately, it has become fashionable for conservationists to talk about 'consulting'
local people and to acknowledge the 'role' of indigenous peoples in managing
protected areas. This looks good on paper, but they are hardly an adequate
substitute for land ownership rights and self determination. In practice,
the conservation movement has subjected tribal peoples to state or corporate
control. It has violated their rights and, for the most part, failed in
its own objective of environmental protection. How long will it be before
conservationists start slogans like 'Pandas Not People'?<BR>

<H2>Russia &amp; US Developes Resonance Technology For Health</H2>
In medical practice, it is fairly common for a conventional therapy not
to produce the desired result even after prolonged treatment. Even more
radical methods, such as surgery, often fail to achieve a curative effect
because of a high degree of risk and/or postoperative complications. Extremely
fruitful, in this context, have been approaches based on the idea of biological
resonance.<BR>
<BR>
Losif Blinkov, Dr. Sc. (Med.), born in Moscow and graduate of the Sechenov
First Moscow Medical Institute, has been practicing for over 32 years in
the fields of general therapy, hepatology, gastroenterology, and clinical
pharmacology. He has been a researcher for over 25 years. In recent years
he has developed 12 original diagnostic and therapeutic devices such as
the resonance machine, which has defied conventional therapy.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Blinkov is a permanent member of the Commission on Medicinal Preparations
of Natural Origin, which is under the Pharmacological Committee of the Ministry
of Health of the Russian Federation. Since January of 1994 he has been a
member of the International Information Academy. <BR>
The conception of establishing resonance with various structures of the
body, including entire organs, has been confirmed by amazingly rapid favorable
clinical effects. Resonance electromagnetic therapy is applied to the skin
and the current level is fixed below the value at which the chosen mode
causes unpleasant sensations under the electrodes. The electrodes were first
smeared with Vaseline, vegetable oil, or some other oil that does not irritate
the skin. <BR>
According to Dr Blinkov, the use of the resonance machine has made it possible
to cancel the previously prescribed therapies for cases of migraine, acute
pneumonia, afflictions of the nervous system (lumbosacral radiculitis, facial
paresis, acute inflammatory radiculitis), acute myocardial infarction, and
acute gout. In cases of infectious allergic bronchial asthma, drug dosages
have been slashed. Electroresonant stimulation has also obvious advantages
over conventional therapy in cases of skin and mucous membrane ulcers, crus
and knee injuries, vertebral basilar insufficiency, and acute exudative
pleurisy, says Dr. Blinkov. <BR>
Resonance electromagnetic stimulation makes it possible to: (1) improve
the general condition of a patient and enable him/her to feel better (steady
medicinal therapy is continued); (2) considerably reduce the doses of his/her
pharmacological preparations (especially toxic ones); (3) cancel inefficacious
methods of treatment, but with supporting electrostimulation continuing
for a lengthy period, and (4) achieve a complete recovery. <BR>
Dr. Blinkov also reports that the investigations carried out have enabled
him to develop optimal modes of resonance electromagnetic therapy for 75
different ailments. Aura-Z Volume 2, number I, 1994.<BR>
Note: The electromagnetic Resonance Machine developed by Dr. Blinkov is
of the same science that has been developed by Dr. Bob Beck, residing in
California, USA. (see Planetary Connections Autumn Issue #11 &quot; <A HREF="../iss11/zap.html">Electricity
May Zap Aids Virus</A>&quot;) Dr. Bob Beck continues his research and his
tests have shown successful and rapid results in neutralizing the viruses
which cause herpes, Epstein Barr, and hepatitis. An incredible continuous
testing has been done with patients having the Aids virus. Every 21 days
since October of 1995 he has had 100% successful spontaneous remission occurrences
with those completing the research test.<BR>

</H2>
Hyssop is a true alternative to drugs. While people have been searching
for health in far away places With strange sounding names, for a health
panacea, two research Universities one in Nevada the other in California,
have found compounds in Hyssop Extract (Hyssopus Officinalis) that have
strong anti-HIV activity This was reported by Herb for Health Magazine,
page 16, March 1996. Hyssop has also been found to be beneficial for many
other illnesses including Arteriosclerosis, Hypoglycemiah. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>The Amazing History of Hyssop</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
From the greatest story ever told, the greatest book ever written, the number
one best selling book in the world, The Bible, comes one of the most versatile
and useful herbs, Hyssop.<BR>
<BR>
Since the dawn of man's history Hyssop has been used in more ways than any
other herb. It was used to cleanse and purify humans and sacred places and
came to be the symbol of cleansing and purification. The word Hyssop stems
from the Greek or Hebrew &quot;Azob or Bzob&quot; which means &quot;Holy
Herb&quot;. It is so strong that through history it has been used for many
purposes - according to the bible, it was used to treat Leprosy (Leviticus
14:49-56): Yet it is so gentle it will pamper the most delicate skin.<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing its properties for purification, David wrote, &quot;purge me
with Hyssop and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.&quot;
Moses used this herb as his secret weapon to free and protect his people
from all harm. Solomon in his songs and proverbs praised the Hyssop that
&quot;springeth out of the wall.&quot; Finally as Jesus hang on the cross
and said, &quot;I thirst&quot;, Rut to his lips were Hyssop and vinegar.
(St. John 19:29)<BR>
<BR>
Tibetan priests offered Hyssop to their deities during sacred services,
and Persians used a concoction of Hyssop as a lotion to help give a fine
color to the skin. Pliny remarked on its effect on one's mind and taste,
and the Indians used it to benefit cavities and the tissues of the body
while alleviating bruises and soothing cuts and wounds.<BR>
<BR>
Hyppocrates, the Father of Medicine, used it. Culpepper recommended it as
an &quot;Inflammation wash&quot;, to take away black and blue marks, as
an expectorant of tough phlegm and a respiration aid. Discorides and Joseph
Miller recommend it and Bankes Herbal speaks of its various beneficial uses.<BR>
<BR>
Certain herbalists hold that Hyssop will help promote digestion and it is
also said to have a tonic effect on the blood. Being a vegetable herb Hyssop
is now served by many chefs in our country, in salads and other ways (Time:
May 9, 1988). For more information on hyssop check out the book <B><A HREF="http://www.bestbooks.com/hyssop.html">&quot;Hyssop

</H2>
Lillie of Oxnard, CA., suffered with Hepatitis &quot;C&quot; for 2 years.
she gave herself shots for 6 months for Diabetes as ordered by her Doctor.
She wound up in the hospital with a blood sugar of 895. When she got out
of the hospital, she started taking the Biblical Herb Hyssop she got from
Hyssop Enterprises in Hollywood, Ca. Within 12 days her blood sugar was
down in the 80's (normal). She returned to the hospital and they released
her, telling her not to take any shots or pills, and to come back in 3 months
for a checkup. Her Doctor said, &quot;You are the first patient I have ever
seen that didn't need to take pills before getting off insulin!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A well known cartoonist in Los Angeles, Ca. awoke one morning, upon getting
out of bed he lost his balance and fell. Trying to stand again, he found
he had lost the use of the right side of his body. His wife called it a
stroke and said, &quot;he would not be going to a hospital because she felt
he would wind up cripple for life like most people she had known. She gave
him this biblical herb Hyssop and the next morning he seemed to be back
to normal. Three days later he played 18 holes of golf.. This same cartoonist
had been going to his same doctor for years but could not get rid of his
kidney stones. After taking hyssop for a while his doctor was unable to
find his kidney stones.<BR>
<BR>
Another young lady in Chicago had been treated for MS for some 8 years,
was doing very well with alternative treatment, but was in a lot of constant
pain. After only three days on this wonder herb she got her life back. She
is now married and living an active normal life free of pain.<BR>
<BR>
In October of 95 Alice of Plushing N.Y. sent me a note illuminating my knowledge
on MS Exacerbation, she wrote, she over came Exacerbation within 3 to 4
days without any worsen of her condition as is normal with hospital stay
of one to three months.<BR>
<BR>
The last article I received was a letter from a lady who fell, broke her
tail bone and took only hyssop for the pain, she said it was successful
in eliminating her pain without drugs. <BR>

Mr. Southall should know - 30 years ago his herbal research helped cure
him of HYPOGLYCEMIA that had doctors baffled! His cure came even before
doctors knew what to call his disorder. His work gives him tremendous satisfaction,
using simple, clean, smooth-tasting herbs to get a head start on 21st Century
Health. His book shows us how easy it is to become self empowered, to take
control of your life and health, by using a common-sense approach to diet
and by taking advantage of a magnificent powerful herbal heritage of healing.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, The International Biographical Center in Cambridge, England nominated
Mr. Southall as an International Man of the Year for 1992-93 and included
him in the 11th edition of the International Who's Who of Intellectuals.<BR>

(Received 9  April 1990: revision accepted 16 August 1990)<BR>
<BR>
<B>SUMMARY</B><BR>
<BR>
Crude extracts of dried leaves of Hyssop officinalis showed strong HIV activity
as measured by inhibition of syncytia  formation.  HIv reverse transcriptase
(RT). and p17 and p24 antigen expression, but  were non-toxic go the uninfected
Molt. 3 cells.  Either extracts from direct extraction (Procedure 1). after
removal of tannins (Procedure 11).  or from  the residue after dialysis
of the crude extract (Procedure 11). showed activity. Methanol extracts,
 subsequent to ether chloroform and chloroform ethanol extractions,  derived
from procedure 1 or 11.  but 111, also showed very strong anti-HIV activity.
 In addition, the  residual  material  after methanol extractions  still
showed strong activity.  Caffeic acid was identified  the ether extract
of procedure 1 by HPLC and UV spectroscopy  Commercial caffeic acid showed
good antiviral activity in the RT assay and high to moderate activity in
the syncytia assay and the p17 and p24 antigen  expression  Tannic acid
and gallic acid, common to other  teas, could not  be identified in our
extracts.  When commercial  products of these two acids were tested in 
our  assay systems,  they showed high to moderate activity against HIV1
Hyssop officnalis extracts contain caffeic acid,  unidentified tannins,
and possibility a third class of  unidentified higher molecular  molecular
weight compounds that exhibit strong anti-HIV activity, and may be useful
in the treatment of patients with AIDS.<BR>

panacea, two research Universities one in Nevada the other in California,
have found compounds in Hyssop Extract (Hyssopus Officinalis) that have
strong anti-HIV activity This was reported by Herb for Health Magazine,
page 16, March 1996. Hyssop has also been found to be beneficial for many
other illnesses including Arteriosclerosis, Hypoglycemiah. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>The Amazing History of Hyssop</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
From the greatest story ever told, the greatest book ever written, the number
one best selling book in the world, The Bible, comes one of the most versatile
and useful herbs, Hyssop.<BR>
<BR>
Since the dawn of man's history Hyssop has been used in more ways than any
other herb. It was used to cleanse and purify humans and sacred places and
came to be the symbol of cleansing and purification. The word Hyssop stems
from the Greek or Hebrew &quot;Azob or Bzob&quot; which means &quot;Holy
Herb&quot;. It is so strong that through history it has been used for many
purposes - according to the bible, it was used to treat Leprosy (Leviticus
14:49-56): Yet it is so gentle it will pamper the most delicate skin.<BR>
<BR>
Recognizing its properties for purification, David wrote, &quot;purge me
with Hyssop and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.&quot;
Moses used this herb as his secret weapon to free and protect his people
from all harm. Solomon in his songs and proverbs praised the Hyssop that
&quot;springeth out of the wall.&quot; Finally as Jesus hang on the cross
and said, &quot;I thirst&quot;, Rut to his lips were Hyssop and vinegar.
(St. John 19:29)<BR>
<BR>
Tibetan priests offered Hyssop to their deities during sacred services,
and Persians used a concoction of Hyssop as a lotion to help give a fine
color to the skin. Pliny remarked on its effect on one's mind and taste,
and the Indians used it to benefit cavities and the tissues of the body
while alleviating bruises and soothing cuts and wounds.<BR>
<BR>
Hyppocrates, the Father of Medicine, used it. Culpepper recommended it as
an &quot;Inflammation wash&quot;, to take away black and blue marks, as
an expectorant of tough phlegm and a respiration aid. Discorides and Joseph
Miller recommend it and Bankes Herbal speaks of its various beneficial uses.<BR>
<BR>
Certain herbalists hold that Hyssop will help promote digestion and it is
also said to have a tonic effect on the blood. Being a vegetable herb Hyssop
is now served by many chefs in our country, in salads and other ways (Time:
May 9, 1988). For more information on hyssop check out the book <B><A HREF="http://www.bestbooks.com/hyssop.html">&quot;Hyssop
Superior Healing Power&quot;</A>.</B><BR>

<P><B>Awaken The Warrior</B><BR>
Success in meeting life's challenges is directly related to your relationship
with the warrior. It is the warrior's energy that initiates action, takes
risks and defines boundaries. Awakening your inner warrior empowers you
to break through the barriers (old habits, limiting beliefs, unconscious
patterns) that stop you from reaching your personal and professional goals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Step Into Power</B><BR>
Awakening the Warrior Within is an intensive workshop offering a unique
combination of awareness exercises, communication skills and self-defense
techniques. The program's focus is on the development of the inner warrior
and the workshop is designed for individuals committed to achieving mastery
in life.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Claim Autonomy</B><BR>
Dawn Callan founder of Awakening the Warrior Within, has devised a sophisticated
and efficient self-defense program that attunes each participant to their
inner power and awakens the application of that power into decisive action.
During the workshop you learn simple and effective physical techniques that
enable you to experience the warrior's self-protective qualities and maximize
your potential as a human being.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Transform Core Issues</B><BR>
Accessing the warrior's qualities (strength, courage, will, commitment)
empowers you to transform the conditions in your life that need changing
(corruption, tyranny, a bad marriage, an unfulfilling lifestyle, an unsatisfying
career). Viewed in this way, your inner warrior is a great ally and trusted
friend.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Self Defense</B><BR>
Throughout the workshop participants learn self-defense skills that enable
them to disarm an attack. Techniques include: hand strikes, kicks, use of
sound and breath, recognizing danger signals, knowing when to strike, trusting
one's instincts, defining boundaries, identifying the primary and secondary
targets of the body, defense on the ground upper and lower body combinations,
what to do if you &quot;freeze&quot;, making the first strike count, how
to stay focused and basic survival skills.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Rite of Passage</B><BR>
The twenty four hour program culminates in a realistic combat experience
that serves as a warrior's rite of passage. Through the experience of this
initiation, participants meet their warrior<BR>
in a mature and life-enhancing way. The results are enduring and transformational.
Participants learn to : 
<DL>
  <DD>Define boundaries 
  <DD>Disarm an attack 
  <DD>Overcome fear 
  <DD>Act with 100% commitment Increase personal power 
  <DD>Renegotiate old traumas

<I>of Personal</I> <I>Safety</I> <I>and</I> <I>Inner</I> <I>Security. </I>Published

<BR>
These Codes encourage individuals to live impeccably with more joy, more
choice, and more peace. A path not without risk, but not without rewards.
Living by the Warrior Code will enrich dally llving on your own terms. 
<OL>
  <LI><B>Pay attention.</B> Stay in the present. Its the only place anything
is really happening. 
  <LI><B>Take responsibility. </B>This is your life, take it back. Either
you get to own it, or you blame someone or something else for it. 
  <LI><B>No kvetching. </B>No whining, no sniveling - it takes you out of
the present and lets you abdicate responsibility. 
  <LI><B>Don't take any shit.</B> It's very bad for one's self-esteem to
take any abuse. Stand up to your tyrants, both internal and external. The
cost is too great not to. 
  <LI><B>Do it anyway.</B> Hard choices temper our strength and our integrity;
they make the difference between a life of mediocrity and a life of excellence.
  <LI><B>Don't quit. </B>Look at what stops you, at where you give the effort
up. That is the edge between becoming a victim or a warrior. 
  <LI><B>Keep your agreements.</B> A warrior is only as good as his or her
word. The way we build self-trust and trust in others is by making and keeping
agreements. 
  <LI><B>Keep your sense of humor.</B> Otherwise what's the point? Humor
helps us to stretch beyond ourselves and our own limits. 
  <LI><B>Love one another.</B> Otherwise where's the meaning? It's the way
we remember we're not alone in this universe. 
  <LI><B>Honor your connection to Source.</B> There is a force in the universe,
greater than ourselves, that creates us, sustains us, provides for us, cares
for us, guides us, and loves us. It speaks to us from within. Trust it.

<H2>Here's what people are saying about Awakening the Warrior</H2>
<DL>
  <DT>&quot;This work will take you to the brink of your greatest fear and
draw you through it to a side of tremendous empowerment.&quot; 
  <DD>Dr. Linda Peterson Ph.D. 
  <DD>University of Nevada Medical School<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;I am the author of five published books and one video of the
subject of street self defense. As an instructor on survival myself, I see
your course as a solution to a serious system glitch. I have never before
seen the 'warrior' awakened so effectively without massive trauma.&quot;
  <DD>Marc MacYoung 
  <DD>Glendale, CA<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>This course was the most helpful life-changing experience I have had
in such a short amount of time. I will not ever have to be a victim in any
circumstances: on the street, at home, at work, or in relationship.&quot;
  <DD>Judy Bayens M.A. 
  <DD>Community Counseling &amp; Personal Growth Ministry, Grand Rapids,
MI<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;I have owned my own business since 1983. After the workshop
I broke the elusive six figure barrier I had not been able to reach.&quot;
  <DD>Lyn Pfaelzer 
  <DD>Pfaelzer Communications, CA<BR>
<BR>
  <DT>&quot;At the interview (for a new job) I was able to draw upon the
knowledge and insights from this workshop. I'm now Director of P.R. and
advertising for RE/MAX of Michigan. My employer said one of the key factors
to hiring me was that he sensed I would not be afraid to stand up to him
when it was necessary... nor let anyone else back me into a corner.&quot;

<H2><CENTER>What is Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy?</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>The Bodywork</H3>
Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy (VHMT) is a leading edge bodywork that
restores one to the fluidity that is their birthright. It is massage therapy,
providing touch techniques and distinctions that help a person live in their
body as a liquid process, freeing pain as we have known it.<BR>
<BR>
VHMT works with the physical structure to free up tensions and stresses
which have been held in the body from our past. This reawakening of the
nervous system restores circulation to injured areas, moves energy and emotions
to help in the letting go of chronic pain or stiffness.<BR>
<BR>
TheVHMT techniques and distinctions serve to align, loosen and connect the
body so that tensions can reverberate free. Even beginning students can
sense and feel vibrations travel throughout the volume of the body as these
old pains and hurts release. Special sensitive stretching, rebounding, and
torquing are some of the techniques helping clients to become aware of where
they have been holding. <BR>
<BR>
Practitioners and recipients alike begin to feel their energy move deeply
and also feel enhanced circulation of their basic metabolic fluids flowing
again to once rigid areas. Listen to people's body rhythms and frequencies,
and learn how to do a clothes-on massage therapy that is rhythmic and sensitive
like playing a fine tuned violin or guitar. 
<H3><BR>
Fluid Consciousness - A Complete Awakening</H3>

VHMT includes new distinctions of awareness in thinking, speaking, walking,
standing and sitting that allow for fully connected and communicative bodies.
These concepts are: <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Fluid Body Model&reg;</B> - A body of knowledge where we experience
being in our bodies in a whole new way, acknowledging and honoring the fluid,
evolving processes that we are. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dis-ease as a Strategy&reg; </B>- A self-responsible way of thinking
that allows us to access self-healing and growth.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Language of Healing&reg; </B>- A way of speaking responsibly about
our bodies and lives, so that when we speak, we are causing and accessing
healing and transformation to happen.<BR>
<BR>
Students are trained in technique as well as specific observational skills
that allow healing to become readily accessible. A VHMT practitioner knows
how to sense and trust their intuition, as well as how to ask appropriate
questions of themselves and their clients to promote healing now. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What people say about VHMT:</B><BR>
&quot;Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy helped to awaken parts of my body
that I didn't know were sleeping.&quot; -client<BR>
<BR>
&quot;VHMT is energizing because the techniques release the most 'congested'
areas of the body first.&quot; -client<BR>

<H2>Courses Offered:</H2>
<H3>Level I: Allowing vibrations to flow through liquid bodies</H3>
<BR>
<B>VHMT I</B> is a 40-hour program of hands-on training in the basic massage
techniques for table, chair and floor bodywork and includes coaching skills
to assist people in becoming fluid and moving tensions from deep within
their bodies. Students learn how to stand and sit in new liquid ways and
bring these behaviors to their everyday lives. Light energy work is introduced
for finer vibrational sensing. Graduates of Level I achieve a basic understanding
of distinctions in self-responsibility and how language affects our physiology.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Distinctions of VHMT Level I:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>Vibration/Vibrating Bodies 
  <LI>The Fluid Body Model: Liquid Standing and Sitting 
  <LI>Intuition/Feeling 
  <LI>The Language of Healing 
  <LI>Disease as a Strategy/Body Stories 
  <LI>The Energy Pattern/Segmental Bodywork 
  <LI>Techniques 
  <LI>Bodywork in a Chair 
  <LI>Bodywork on the Floor 
</UL>
<H3>Level II: Clearing emotional interferences from your past </H3>
<B><BR>
VHMT II</B> is further development in fluid consciousness, as well as specific
bodywork for clearing tensions from the rib, neck, and spinal areas. This
course includes more detailed and intricate finger work and techniques for
feeling, hearing, and seeing vibration and clearing those interferences.
Students slow down and become more sensitive to working with their client's
issues, willingness to heal, and emotional release. Fluid walking is learned
to further assist in the removal of stress vectors for a living experience
of the new liquid consciousness. The Holistic Model is introduced to support
people's physical, emotional, and spiritual growth and development.<BR>
<B><BR>
Distinctions of Level II:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>Innate Intelligence/Willingness/Readiness 
  <LI>Prayer/Higher Consciousness 
  <LI>The Holistic Model 
  <LI>Finer Tuned Finger/Hand Work 
  <LI>Emotional Release and Clearing/What Happened? 
  <LI>Use of Metaphors 
  <LI>Rib Release, Spine, Neck and Shoulder Bodywork 
  <LI>Liquid Walking 
</UL>
<H3>Level III: Clear interference and bring forth a new body</H3>
<BR>
<B>VHMT III </B>students develop observational and coaching techniques to
awaken more of the seen and unseen nervous systems of their <BR>
body's, including the chakras, etheric body and aura. Alignment of the hips
and pelvis is taught to further encourage the restoration of the power base
and to free interferences. Through the use of movement, visual and sound
sensing, and refined light energy work, Level III opens people up to new
levels of grounded consciousness. Because of the amount of emotional healing
available in this course, the Central Channel is brought forth as a new
energy pattern tool for life transformations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Distinctions of Level III:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>Advanced Liquid Standing Bodywork 
  <LI>The Central Channel 
  <LI>Refinement of Vibrational Sensing

  <LI>Hip and Sacrum Release 
  <LI>Auras/Nadis/Miasms 
  <LI>Trance and Shamanic Frequencies 
  <LI>Trauma and Shock Physiology 
  <LI>Past Life Emotional Release 
</UL>
<H3>Level IV: Ride the waves of your own coherent spin patterns. Align with
earth and space!</H3>
<BR>
<B>VHMT IV </B>With the dolphins as guides, playful use of sonics and frequencies
will be used to free chronic stresses or behaviors, especially based in
gestation, birth and childhood. Both your physical and energy bodies will
be soothed and aligned more with your original essence pattern and connection
to the energies of the earth. Distinguishing resonance areas of affliction,
greater sensing and feeling of our cellular wavelengths will be practiced.
Special focus will be on healing sessions cleansing shock waves and trauma
from pre-natal, peri-natal and natal experiences. Holographic understanding
is one of the results of this training.<BR>
<BR>
<B>(The distinctions of Level IV are in development.)<BR>
<BR>
With each level, the practitioner's skill deepens in the Fluid Body Model,
The Language of Healing, and Disease as a Strategy.<BR>

<p>This site is designed to help you explore the financial possibilities
of your future; to help you learn more about what steps you can take now to
ensure you reach your longer-term financial goals, sooner.

<P>Here, at the newest addition to the site, The Life Planning Centre,
you can take stock of your own personal wealth and evaluate your plans
towards managing it. The Life Planning Centre is all about helping you
develop solid financial plans, with your future in mind.

<P>Be sure to also visit the Mutual Fund Centre to check out latest
fund performance figures or calculate your own mutual fund investment
profile.  And with  RRSP season just around the corner, perhaps the
time is right to visit the RRSP Centre to review what your maximum 1996 contribution should be.

may not be as big a step, budget-wise, as you may think.</H2>  Depending on interest
rates and the price of the home, mortgage carrying costs can be approximately about the same amount as rent.

<P>Some people overestimate the costs of home ownership and delay buying when they could
pursue their dream right now. Fact: in 1996, 25% of current renters can
afford to buy a starter home.

<P>A good first step in acquiring a home is to compare the costs of renting
vs. home ownership. With today's modest <A HREF="numbers.html">interest rates</A> and a plentiful supply
of houses for sale, in all price ranges, conditions are very favourable
for house shopping.

	Financial information can seem like a completely different
language to many. This area makes it easier to understand. How much can
someone spend for a new home? What level of debt load can be
handled comfortably? How much of a down payment can be made? Is there enough money left over to cover other expenses?
<P>The picture is probably much brighter than you may have imagined.

	The Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) lets a first time buyer withdraw up to $20,000
from RRSPs for a home purchase. The withdrawn amount must be repaid within
15 years, subject to a minimum annual repayment that is 1/15 of the amount
withdrawn. If the full $20,000 is withdrawn, the minimum annual repayment
is $1,333. If less than the minimum is repaid, the balance is added to the
taxpayer's income.

<P>Over time, homes usually appreciate in value. After 25 years (or whatever
amortization period chosen) the house is paid for, free and clear. The renter
has no equity after 25 years and has paid thousands of dollars in rent.
What's worse, the renter must keep paying.

<P>

<P>Home ownership is a way to accumulate wealth because a portion of every
mortgage payment reduces the debt and adds to the owner's equity in the home.

<LI>Weekly or bi-weekly payments (as opposed to monthly) can save thousands
of dollars in interest. Each payment contributes to whittling down the mortgage
principal and adding to home equity.
<P>
<LI>Prepayment is a wise route to mortgage savings. Prepayment privileges
accelerate paying off mortgage principal.  Take advantage of them - perhaps
by using your annual tax refund to repay a portion of your mortgage.
<P>
<LI>Increase your payment and save. You can do this once a year
on any regular payment date, by any amount up to a maximum of double the
regular monthly payment.</B>
<P>
<LI>Save at renewal time. Just ask these questions:</B>
<ul>
	<LI>"What would my prepayments be if I shortened the amortization period?"</B>
	<LI>"What would I save if I pay my mortgage weekly or bi-weekly?" (You'll save on interest)</B>
	<LI>"How many extra payments can I make at no additional cost?"
</ul>

<P>

<LI>Save through mortgage portability. The current rate, term, and mortgage
amount can be ported to your new home after the sale of your existing home.  If borrower meet the normal lending criteria, they can: 
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Take the existing mortgage interest rate and loan amount when purchasing a new home. 
<LI>Increase the loan amount and blend the two rates. 
<LI>Stay in the existing home and increase the loan amount by blending the two rates. 
<LI>Sell the current home to a purchaser who, in turn, can increase the loan amount and blend the two rates. 
</ul>
<P>

<P>This benefit applies for the remaining term of a mortgage or five years,
whichever is less. 

<P>
<LI>Choose a shorter amortization, a 20 year amortization rather than 25.
 The slightly higher payment can reduce interest costs substantially.<P>

	CMHC may insure the mortgage on a home against default for up to 95% of
the lending value of the house. Therefore, people who qualify for First Home Loan Insurance only need a 5% downpayment.
	<P>
		<P>Eligible borrowers include anyone who:
<UL>
<LI>Buys a home in Canada intending to occupy it as his/her principal residence,

<LI>Has not owned his/her principal residence at any time during the last five years, or

<LI>Has more than one co-buyer, only one of whom is a first time home buyer.

</UL>

<P>Buyers under First Home Loan Insurance can use up
to 35% of their gross family income for payments of mortgage principal and
interest, property taxes and heating. A buyer's total debt load (including
consumer loans, etc.) cannot exceed 40% of the gross family income.

	<P>
	<P>Thanks to reduced down payments, home ownership has moved from a dream
to a reality for the many Canadians who can afford monthly mortgage payments,
but who are having trouble saving for a down payment. 

<P>

<P>Thousands of Canadians that had been renters for years have been able
to get into homes of their own, thanks to the new 5% minimum down payment.
In April, 1994 a survey of Canadians who bought a home with less than 10%
down showed that almost 72% would not have been able to purchase their home
without the FHLI program.

<P>

<P>Offered under the provisions of the National Housing Act, FHLI allows
first-time buyers to purchase a home, either new or existing, with a down
payment as low as 5% of the purchase price. 

<P>

<P>People who insure a mortgage loan with CMHC  pay an application fee and
a premium. The application fee ($75 -$235) covers the costs incurred by
CMHC to review the application.  The premium is based on the loan amount.

<BR>
The sooner the mortgage is paid off, the more money is saved. It's that
simple.

<P>

<B>TD's RAPID PAYDOWN</B>* 
<BR>
This feature makes it easier than ever to pay off a mortgage quickly.
Once a year, a lump sum payment of up to 10% of the original loan amount
can be made. Or the monthly payment can be increased by up to double the regular monthly payment, each year during the term of the mortgage.  If it is too difficult to maintain the higher payment, it can be decreased to the original amount. Or the mortgage can be repaid
in full, providing the rate is at least 2% below the current interest rates for a term equal to the remaining term of the mortgage.  As well, TD offers weekly and bi-weekly payment frequencies which help in paying down your mortgage faster.

<P>

<B><A NAME="port">Portability Plus</A></B>
<BR>
With the Portability Plus* feature, provided the normal lending criteria
are met, people can: 

<UL>
	<LI>Take the existing mortgage interest rate and loan amount a long
when purchasing a new home. 

	<LI>Increase the loan amount and weight the two rates. 

	<LI>Stay in the existing home and increase the loan amount by weighting
the two rates. 

	<LI>Sell the current home to a purchaser who, in turn, can increase
the loan amount and blend the two rates. 
</ul>
<P>

<P>This benefit applies for the remaining term of the mortgage or five years,
whichever is less. 

<P>

<B><A NAME="prequal">Convenient Pre-qualification</A></B>
<BR>
The last thing anyone needs to worry about is a conditional offer or obtaining 
last minute financing on the home. TD will help you calculate your mortgage affordability
and pre-approve a mortgage before you start hunting. That way, you will know exactly what you can afford and you will make offers with full confidence.


<P>

<B><A NAME="insure">Low Cost TD GreenPlan Mortgage Insurance</A></B>
<BR>
Chances are, buying a home is the largest investment anyone makes. Homes
can be protected with TD GreenPlan Mortgage Insurance. With this program,
the mortgage balance is paid in full in the event of death, terminal illness
or accidental dismemberment. 

<P>

<B><A NAME="value">Value Based on Quality and Service</A></B>
<BR>
TD is committed to offering the best mortgage options, along with advice
that guides home buyers in the right direction. TD makes home financing
simple to understand, and easy to live with. 

<P>

<B><A NAME="home">TD Home Advantage Mortgage Benefits</A>:</B>
<BR>
TD Home Advantage Mortgage customers receive many benefits:

<UL>
	<LI>Mortgage service from any branch, over the phone or in the comfort
of one's home with a visit from a TD mobile Mortgage Manager. 

	<LI>TD's &quot;Let's Talk Mortgages&quot; newsletter with helpful
tips on paying a mortgage down faster.

<P>When you have some extra money, it's wise to repay your mortgage and save
on interest charges. The One-Year Open Mortgage allows for a payment at any time to reduce the principal of your mortgage
without administration costs or prepayment charges. The interest rate is
fixed over the term. Should interest rates come down during the year, the
mortgage can be re-negotiated at any time, for a nominal renewal fee.</TD></TR>

<P>This is a fixed rate mortgage has a fixed-rate so the interest rate won't change during

<P>

<P>The TD EQUITYBUILDER Conventional Mortgage is subject to appraisal costs
and legal fees.
A minimum 10% of the 25% must be from your own sources; the balance of 15%
may be obtained through secondary financing. Indeed, we can lend up to a
maximum of 75% of either the appraised value or purchase price of the property,
whichever is less. This is a mortgage with a fixed rate so your interest
rate doesn't change for the duration of your term. And because the down
payment is at least 25%, in most cases there are no mortgage insurance fees
to pay (saving you even more money).

<TD VALIGN="CENTER"><H2 ALIGN=LEFT>If interest rates are steadily declining, the right mortgage may be
a variable rate mortgage where interest rates are set at the 1st of each
month to match the prevailing rates.</H2>

<P>

<P>There is a minimum down payment of 30% (15% of this may be obtained
through secondary financing). We can lend up to a maximum of 70% of either
the appraised value or purchase price of the property, whichever is less.
Appraisal and legal fees apply. <BR>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<P>This mortgage has a 5-year term, with interest compounded monthly.
Payments remain the same each month; if rates drop from the previous month,
more money is put towards the principal balance (which pays off the mortgage
faster). Should interest rates rise, more is paid towards interest.
If the interest rates increase so that the monthly payment does not cover
the interest, (and the outstanding principal balance ultimately exceeds
75% of the value of the home), the mortgage becomes due and payable. At
that point, there are several options: 

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A lump sum payment can be made against the outstanding principal
balance to repay the shortfall (thereby reducing the loan-to-value ratio
back to 75%).

<LI>Conversion to a fixed rate mortgage to prevent losing any
more equity.

<LI>The property can be re-appraised to determine if the current equity status meets the minimum equity requirement. If it meets our guidelines, then no adjustment is necessary. If rates are low, a small fee allows conversion to a fixed mortgage. 

</ul>
Repayment options are also flexible:

<ul>

<LI>Partial repayments are allowed at any time without charge,
as long as they are made on the regular monthly payment date. 

<LI>The mortgage can be repaid in full during the first two  years
for a small administrative fee. 

<LI>From the third year on, it becomes an open mortgage, so the
balance may be repaid  in full at any time without charge. <BR>

<P>If you run a small business and your computer is often tied up, you may simply
want the convenience of a quick call to a <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/bl_com.htm">phone
menu system</A>.  A service like this lets you select specific account and loan
information and faxes you the details.  You don't need to wait on callbacks, and
you can check in when it's convenient for you: day or night.

<P>On the other hand, maybe you require the same information on a regular basis
to manage your cash flow.  In this case, you might want to consider a <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/faxlink.htm">fax
service</A> that delivers detailed information on your overall cash position: at
the day and time you prefer.

<H4>Computer Access</H4>

<P>This is the next step up -- and it's the step that really interests a lot of
business people.  Whether you own a small company or run a multi-million dollar
division, accessing account information with your computer can save you staff
time, cut administrative costs and improve your company's ability to forecast and
manage cash flow.

<P>With this type of service, you can <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">browse your
account on-line</A> and view customized reports, or you can download reports,
statements and raw data, which you can import into your accounting software to
save data-entry and reconciling time.

<P>Electronic Data Interchange uses a standardized format to transmit business
data between computers.  It allows two or more trading partners to exchange
information that would have previously been sent via paper documents and manual
methods -- eliminating paperwork, duplicate key-punching and time-consuming
manual administration of such things as inventory control, just-in-time delivery
and financial transactions.

<P>If your company has an <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">EDI program</A>
in place to administer inventory control, you're already prepared to take
advantage of this technology to receive account information and data.

<P>And if you're not running this type of program, don't worry.  Some services
include <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/bizwin.htm">specialized
software</A> which gives you user-friendly access to data using a standard modem
on your PC.

<H4>Assess Your Needs</H4>

<P>Some services allow you to <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/filelink.htm">download
files</A> containing current account balances and activity to your PC or
mainframe. You may be able to use the actual data with your company's accounting
software.

<P>Other products provide <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">real-time
access on-line via your PC</A>, customized reports, current foreign exchange
rates and more.

<H2>Improving Account Management Through Effective Consolidation</H2>

<P>Transferring funds from one account to another, one branch to another -- and even from one financial institution to another -- is faster and easier to control these days, thanks to electronic access and interbank networks.

<P>These methods allow same-day consolidation, give you more effective use of funds (earning more interest and reducing borrowing costs), and free your staff from unproductive tasks.

<P>One of the easiest things you can do to get started is set up <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/ats.htm">automated transfers</A> between different accounts.  Maybe you need to maintain a payroll account on a just-in-time basis, keep an operating account at a constant balance, or ensure deposits are quickly transferred to your main account.  Just instruct your bank to maintain balances (including zero-balances) or transfer prescribed amounts at certain times, and your funds work more efficiently, without the time-consuming drudgery.

<P>Of course, not all transfers are predictable.  If you find you need to direct individual transfers, it's faster and easier to have a service which allows you to do this <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">on-line</A>.

<P>Shifting money among existing accounts is one thing.  But if you're dealing with offices, retail operations, or salespeople across the country, maintaining accounts everywhere is a costly solution.  Fortunately, some services allow you to gather deposits from bank branches where you don't have an account.

<P>Here's an example.  A salesperson in the field receives payment directly from a client.  Rather than mailing in the cheque, he simply deposits it at the next bank he happens across, and has it transferred to your main account.  The service might be available at <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cts.htm">any branch</A> of a financial institution, or even more conveniently, at any branch of <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cmm.htm">any financial institution.</A>

<P>If you have a number of offices across the country with their own operating accounts and control over those accounts, you face some unique challenges.  To maximize interest earned and reduce interest paid, you could take advantage of <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/mas.htm">mirror accounting.</A>

<P>With this method, you maintain balances in operating accounts to allow divisions or subsidiaries to manage their own funds, but the funds are actually considered pooled in your concentration account.  That means your total balance is used to calculate interest and borrowing rates -- which maximizes your investment returns and minimizes your borrowing costs.  <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/iar.htm">interest allocation</A> ensures individual divisions or branches pay or receive their appropriate interest, including that on inter-entity lending.  All this activity is complex to track, and a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cbr.htm">reporting service</A> which provides account activity and balance information of all groups is essential for effective mirror accounting.

<H2>How Smoother Reconciliation Can Lead to Better Cash Flow Management</H2>

<P>Cheque reconciliation can be complicated and time-consuming, and if you do it manually, you risk inaccuracies.  Of course, neglecting it doesn't help.  To solve this problem, you should reduce the manual busywork as much as possible, so that your staff only needs to deal with outstanding entries and can concentrate on more productive tasks.  Here are a few solutions for small, medium and large businesses.

<P>If you're currently running a PC-based accounting system like Bedford, Simply Accounting, or DacEasy, you can get <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/macdwn.htm">software</A>  which does everything but file away your cancelled cheques.  The software allows you to download your account information and then performs an automatic reconciliation to the data in your accounting package.  it saves you the time and risk of error involved in re-keying, and it can even automatically post entries for interest, services fees, etc.

<P>Similar add-ons are available for <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/macdwn.htm">more advanced accounting packages</A>, like ACCPAC Plus&reg;.

<P>And if you'd prefer to take the entire load off your staff's shoulders, you can <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/crs.htm">outsource</A>  your reconciliation.  Your bank hangs on to your cleared cheques, sorts them, segregates disbursements by product line, division and dozens of other categories, and sends you computer-accurate reconciliation statements and reports for each (as well as the cheques).

<H2>The Challenge of Improving Receivables Performance</H2>

<P>Good cash flow forecasting and minimal outstanding receivables are essential for any successful business.  With electronic cash management services, you can improve your company's performance in these areas, save borrowing costs, increase your interest earned, plan more effectively and free up staff time.

<P>Of course, the first line of defense is firm, friendly, but progressively more insistent followups on slow or delinquent accounts.  But there are even more effective ways to ensure predictable deposits, and eliminate cheque endorsing and deposit preparation.

<P>Start with RECURRING client payments you know are coming but you don't always see immediately.  Based on your advance instructions and your client's authorization, banks can set up programs to <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundin.htm">automatically collect these funds</A> from any financial institution in Canada.

<P>It gives you better cash flow forecasting -- not to mention cash flow -- and saves staff the invoicing and processing time they'd normally spend.

<P>That takes care of predictable, recurring payments.  There are also ways you can get less regular payments, such as purchases normally invoiced and collected through the mail.

<P>If you have large, primary buyers, who routinely make electronic payments, you can collect these even if you're don't have an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) program of your own.  The bank takes over, allowing your <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">client to pay via EDI</A> to your account, and updating you through fax or computer.

<P>And you can speed up the processing of cheques from smaller or one-time clients, too.

<P>Instead of waiting for cheques to reach your accounts receivable department with the stack of regular mail, processing the cheques manually, and trying to post deposits by day-end, you can opt for services that take it off your hands.

<P>If you have receivables collected by offices or agents across the country, you can set up deposit collection services which don't require accounts everywhere.  Your agents make deposits at <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cts.htm">branches of your bank</A> or at <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cmm.htm">any financial institution</A>.  

<P>Some services allow you to set up <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/lockbox.htm">post office boxes</A> in the U.S. and throughout Canada.  Your clients mail payment to the PO box, and the money's in your account the day it arrives.  You receive detailed reports itemizing the deposits by client and amount.

<H2>How Effective Management of Accounts Payable Can Strengthen Business Performance</H2>

<P>Electronic banking can help you make prompt payments without the staff time and the manual work of actually cutting cheques.

<P>If you have an <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">EDI program</A> in place, you can begin to make electronic payments very quickly.  You simply send instructions to the bank, and the bank automatically credits your supplier's account through the banking system, and advises them of the payment via EDI or hard copy.

<P>Recurring payments can take up a lot of unnecessary staff time that could be better spent elsewhere.  <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundout.htm">Automatic payment services</A> take the processing of payroll, dividends, pension and investment interest off your shoulders.  You give the bank advance instructions, and the bank withdraws funds from specific accounts and transfers it to the payee's account at any financial institution in the country.  The payee can be either an individual or a company.

<P>To make same day payments to suppliers in North America and beyond, you can use your personal computer to deliver <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/rapwire.htm">wire intructions.</A> This type of service saves you phone or fax time, gets funds there faster, and should allow you to send last-minute and post-dated payments with the same convenience.

<P>If you're dealing with a number of suppliers in the U.S., you may not always want to wire funds.  Yet some U.S. suppliers may be unwilling to accept US$ cheques drawn on a Canadian bank, as they expect clearing delays.

<P>You could set up a clearing account at a U.S. bank.  But that usually requires maintaining a balance in another financial institution (and possibly incurring borrowing costs) or constantly wiring funds to the account.


<P>To avoid this, you can set up a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/uscd.htm">special clearing account</A> connected to your U.S.$ account in Canada.   You don't need to maintain a balance, since your Canadian bank will electronically transfer funds to cover each day's clearings.

<P>You can also get <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/f_trade.htm">letter of credit</A> information from your bank, which verifies it and passes it on in a matter of hours, saving you paperwork and time.

	<P>

	Most people also have other forms of debt: car loan,

student loan, credit card payments. The total debt load should be manageable

because income has to sustain regular living expenses too.

	<P>

	The <A HREF="navigate.html">Mortgage Navigator</A> and <A HREF="afford.html">Mortgage Calculator</A> will help figure out comfortable

levels of borrowing and repayment.



<P>



<P>Generally, a monthly mortgage payment can be about 30% of gross monthly

income (income before tax). For instance, if income is $60,000 a year, monthly

gross income is $5,000 ($60,000 divided by 12). So monthly mortgage payments

of $1,500 ($5,000 x .30) are about right.



<P>



<P>A manageable mortgage payment can also be determined by calculating Gross

Debt Service Ratio (GDS) and Total Debt Service Ratio (TDS). 



<P>



<P>GDS looks at the ratio between gross annual income, and the annual carrying

costs of a mortgage, plus taxes, utilities and 50% of condominium fees,

if applicable. To meet the GDS qualification, annual carrying costs should

not exceed 32% of gross annual income.



<P>



<P>TDS examines the ratio between gross annual income and total annual debt

costs. These costs include: mortgage payments, taxes, heating, and payments

on any other debts owed, such as personal loans, credit card debts and others.

To meet the TDS qualification, total annual debt costs should not exceed

37% of gross annual income.

The larger the downpayment, the smaller the amount being borrowed. Less borrowed
means less to pay back.  Paying back the mortgage faster will  lower
the total interest charges.  For example, with a larger down payment, a borrower may be able to afford a shorter amortization period, or be able to cut the monthly payment costs and enjoy more disposable income.

	A financial buffer should be kept in case of cash emergencies, home repairs, or other unexpected events. Monthly take-home pay should also comfortably
cover living expenses such as food, clothing, insurance, gas, car repairs,
holidays and other debts.

<P>

Everything seems to cost more than expected; from paint, wallpaper and
curtains to general upkeep and property taxes. Ask a real estate agent to
help estimate some of these additional costs for houses in your preferred area.

<LI><A NAME="Whatis"><B>What is the Home Buyers'
Plan?</B></A> <BR>
The Home Buyers' Plan is a program established by the federal
government that allows an individual to withdraw up to $20,000 from their
RRSPs to buy or build a qualifying home. The withdrawn amounts aren't included
in income, and the RRSP issuer will not withhold tax on these amounts.
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="Can I participateHow"><B>Can I participate? How?</B></A>
<BR>
Anyone who owns an RRSP in their own name can participate in the Home Buyers'
Plan. However, funds may not be withdrawn from a locked-in RRSP. </LI>

<P>To participate, an amount is withdrawn from an RRSP using Form T1036.
The form must be completed for each withdrawal made. The forms are obtainable at Income tax offices. After completing Areas I and II of Form T1036, it is given to the
RRSP issuer, who will not withhold tax from the funds requested. </P>

<P>Next, the borrower must certify that they meet or intend to meet a number
of conditions. </P>

<UL>
<LI>The request for withdrawal from the RRSP must be made in the year in which you are participating by December 31.</LI>

<LI>The borrower must not have previously participated in the Home Buyers'
Plan. </LI>

<LI>The borrower must be a resident of Canada. </LI>

<LI>The borrower must enter into a written agreement to buy or build
a qualifying home, before October of the following year. </LI>

<LI>The borrower has to be considered a first-time home buyer. </LI>

<LI>The borrower must intend to occupy the qualifying home as his/her principal
place of residence. </LI>
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="What is the maximum amount I"></A><B>What is the maximum amount
I can withdraw from my RRSP under this plan? Can I withdraw more than once?</B>
<BR>
The maximum withdrawal is $20,000.  If you request to withdraw more than one amount from your RRSPs in a given year, and you receive one amount in that year, and another amount in January of the following year, you are considered to have received both amounts in the first.  However, if you receive the other amount after January 31 of the following year, you must contact your tax services office to determine if that amount qualifies under the Home Buyer's Plan.</LI>

<LI><A NAME="What exactly is a firsttime home buyer"></A><B>What exactly
is a first-time home buyer?</B> <BR>
Under the Home Buyers' Plan a person is considered a first-time home buyer
if, at any time during the period beginning January 1, 1993, and ending
31 days before the withdrawal in1997, she or he did not own a home occupied as
a principal place of residence. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="How does this apply if I'm married"></A><B>How does this
apply if I'm married?</B> <BR>
If married at the time of a withdrawal, people are not considered first-time
home buyers if, at any time during the period beginning January 1, 1993,
and ending 31 days before a withdrawal is made in 1997, a spouse owned a
home while both partners occupied it during the marriage (it must be the
spouse's principal place of residence). Therefore, sometimes only one spouse
can participate in the Home Buyers' Plan. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="I just bought a condominium"></A><B>I just bought a condominium.
Is that considered a home?</B> <BR>
For the purpose of the Home Buyers' Plan, a home is a housing unit, or
a share of a co-operative housing corporation (the share must entitle the owner to possess and have an equity interest in a housing
unit owned by the corporation). If a share was previously acquired that
provided someone with only a right to tenancy, he or she may still be considered
a first-time home buyer. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="What does the government consider"></A><B>What does the Federal government mean by the phrase &quot;entered into a written agreement to buy or build
a qualifying home&quot;?</B> <BR>
If someone participates in the Home Buyers' Plan, they have
to buy or build a qualifying home before October 1st of the year following
the participation. If the home is bought or built alone or with other individuals,
that is considered to be a qualifying home. If a qualifying home is being
built, it is considered &quot;built&quot; on the date it becomes habitable.
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if someone does not buy"></A><B>What happens
if someone does not buy or build a qualifying home?</B> <BR>
If a qualifying home indicated on Form T1036 is not bought or built, you
can: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>cancel participation in the Home Buyers' Plan , or; </LI>

<LI>buy or build a different home, called a replacement property, before
October 1 of the following year. </LI>
</UL>

<P>A replacement property has to meet the same conditions as a qualifying
home. Another Form T1036 does not have to be completed. Just send a letter
to the taxation center setting out your name, address, and social insurance number,
as well as details of the replacement property. In addition, that person
must certify in the letter that the replacement property is intended to
be occupied as a principal place of residence no later than one year after it is
bought or built. </P>

<P>If the $20,000 maximum allowed under the Home Buyers' Plan is already
withdrawn, no further withdrawals to buy or build the replacement property
can be made. </P>

<P>Extensions - If you do not buy or build the qualifying home you indicated
on Form T1036 (or a replacement property) before October 1, of the following
year, you still may be considered to have met the deadline if you meet
either of the following two conditions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>you had a written agreement in effect before October 1st of the year
following your entry into the plan, to buy or build a qualifying home or
replacement property, and you buy or build the property no later than one
year after that deadline, that is, before October 1, two years after your
entry. </LI>

<LI>in addition, you have to be a Canadian resident until you buy or build the property; or you are building your home and you have already (prior to October 1, the first year following) paid an amount at least equal to the total of your withdrawals to the contractors or suppliers (with whom you deal at arm's length) for materials for the home being built, or towards its construction.
</LI>
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="I intend for my house to be my principal"></A><B>I intend
for my house to be my principal place of residence. Is there a minimum
time I have to live in the house?</B> <BR>
When you withdraw an amount from your RRSP, you have to certify on Form
T1036, &quot;Applying to Withdraw an Amount Under the Home Buyers' Plan&quot;,
that you intend to occupy the qualifying home as your principal place of
residence no later than one year after buying or building the home. Once
you occupy the home, there is no minimum period of time that you have to
live there. Note that the term &quot;occupy &quot; in this context means to
inhabit or to live in. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="Do I have to pay back"></A><B>Do I have to pay back the money
into the RRSP?</B> <BR>
Yes. You must repay the amount you withdrew under the Home Buyers' Plan
over a period of no more that 15 years. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="What is the repayment schedule"></A><B>What is the repayment
schedule?</B> <BR>
Each year you must repay 1/15 of the total amount you withdrew until the
full amount is repaid to your RRSP. For example, if you participate in
the Home Buyers' Plan in 1996, your repayments begin in 1998, and end in
2012. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="How will I make the repayments"></A><B>How will I make the
repayments?</B> <BR>
To make a repayment under the Home Buyers' Plan for 1998, you have to contribute
to your RRSP for 1998 by no later than March 1, 1999 (you do not have to
contribute the repayments to the same RRSP from which you withdrew the
funds). You may then designate all or part of these contributions as a
repayment under the Home Buyers' Plan for 1998. To make this designation,
you file the 1998 version of Form T1037 with your 1998 return. If you are
not required to file a return for 1998, submit a copy of Form T1037 to
your taxation office by April 30, 1999. </LI>

<P>If you want to make a repayment before 1998, use the 1996 or 1997 version
of Form T1037. </P>

<P>Not all contributions made to your RRSPs can be designated as a repayment.
To determine which contributions you can designate, complete form T1037.
</P>

<P>If you do not have an RRSP deduction limit for 1998, you can still contribute
to your RRSP and designate the amount you contribute as a repayment under
the Home Buyers Plan for 1998.

<LI><A NAME="Do I always have 15 years to pay it back"></A><B>Do I always
have 15 years to pay it back?</B> <BR>
There are special repayment rules if the participant: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>dies </LI>

<LI>becomes a non-resident, or </LI>

<LI>reaches the age of 71 </LI>
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="Can you claim an RRSP deduction"></A><B>Can you claim an RRSP
deduction for amounts you designate as a repayment?</B> <BR>
An amount you designate as a repayment under the Home Buyers' Plan is not
considered to be an RRSP contribution. You cannot claim a deduction for
this amount on your return. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if you repay less"></A><B>What happens if you
repay less than the amount you should repay? <BR>
</B>If you designate an amount that is less than the amount you should
repay, you will have to include an amount on line 129 of your income tax
return. The amount you include in your income is equal to the amount you
should repay, minus the amount you designate as a repayment for the year.
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if you repay more"></A><B>What happens if you
repay more than the amount you have to repay?</B> <BR>
If you repay more than the amount you have to repay, the balance you have
to repay to your RRSP for subsequent years is reduced. Because your balance
is reduced, the amount you have to repay in each subsequent year will also
be less. </LI>

<P>You divide the balance to be repaid by the number of years remaining
in your repayment period to calculate the amount you have to repay for
subsequent years. 

<LI><A NAME="What happens to the plan when I die"></A><B>What happens
to the plan when I die?</B> <BR>
If a Home Buyers' Plan participant dies, the legal deceased's representative must
include, in the deceased's income for the year of death, the total of all
amounts that remain to be repaid. </LI>

<P>If at the time of the participant's death there is a surviving spouse
who is a resident of Canada, the surviving spouse can elect, jointly with
the deceased's legal representative, to make the repayments under the Home
Buyers' Plan and to not have the income inclusion rule apply for the deceased.
The amount that remains to be repaid is then treated as if it was an amount
withdrawn under the Home Buyers' Plan by the surviving spouse at the time
of death and has to be repaid to the surviving spouse's RRSPs. If, at the
time of death, the surviving spouse is also a participant, the amount would
be added to the surviving spouse's unpaid balance. </P>

<P>To make a joint election, a letter signed by both the surviving spouse
and the deceased's legal representative should be attached to the deceased's
return for the year of death. The letter should state that an election
is being made to have the surviving spouse continue making repayments under
the Home Buyers' Plan and to not have the income inclusion rule apply for
the deceased. </P>

<P>The election can be made if any of the following situations apply: </P>

<UL>
<P>at the time of death, only the deceased was participating in the Home
Buyers' Plan; </P>

<LI>at the time of death, only the surviving spouse was participating in
the Home Buyers' Plan (this can happen if the deceased spouse had applied
to participate but had not yet received an amount from his or her RRSP
at the time of death) or </LI>

<LI>both spouses were participating in the Home Buyers' Plan at the time
of death, and their repayment periods are identical. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Generally, if a surviving spouse who was not participating in the Home
Buyers' Plan elects to continue making the repayments for the deceased
spouse, the surviving spouse is considered a participant and cannot subsequently
make a withdrawal from any RRSP under the Home Buyers' Plan. 

<LI><A NAME="What happens to the Plan if I become a non-resident?"></A><B>What
happens to the Plan if I become a non-resident?</B> <BR>
If someone ceases to be a resident of Canada after a qualifying home is
bought or built, the balance of the funds withdrawn under the Home Buyers'
Plan have to be repaid before the date income tax is filed for the year,
or no later than 60 days after that person ceased to be a Canadian resident,
whichever date is earlier. If that person does not make the repayment by
this deadline, they have to include the amount not repaid in income for
the year that they became a non-resident. The amount is included in income
for the period they were resident in Canada. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="What happens to the Plan when I reach"></A><B>What happens
to the Plan when I reach 71 years of age?</B> <BR>
Since people cannot continue to hold an RRSP after the year in which they
reach age 71, they will not be able to repay your withdrawals made under
the Home Buyers' Plan. In the year anyone reaches the age of 71, they can
choose to repay the unpaid balance under the Home Buyers' Plan. Otherwise,
the outstanding amount has to be included in income for the following year
in which that person turns 72. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="If I dont participate this year"></A><B>If I don't participate
this year, can I participate in a later year?</B> <BR>
Even if someone does not participate in the Home Buyers' Plan this year
because they are not considered a first-time home buyer, they may be able
to participate in the Home Buyers' Plan in a later year. </LI>

<P>For example, if in 1992 either spouse sold the home occupied as the
principal place of residence and neither spouse owned a home while it was
occupied as a principal place of residence after that date, participation
in the Home Buyers' Plan is still open in 1997. If the home in 1993 was
sold participation may be open in 1998, or if the home was sold in 1994,
participation may be open in 1999. </P>

<P>If any of these situations apply, contact an income tax office for information
about participating in the Home Buyers' Plan in 1997 or later years. 

<LI><A NAME="I already participated in the program once"></A><B>I already
participated in the program once. Can I participate again? <BR>
</B>No. Once someone has participated in the program once, they no longer<BR>
qualify as a first time home buyer. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="Who do I contact"></A><B>Who do I contact if I have any other
questions?</B> <BR>
If help is still needed, call, write, or visit the General Inquiries service of any Revenue Canada income tax office or talk to your personal banker at TD Bank. </LI>

<P>Find information on how to complete an income tax return in the income
tax guide. The guide is available by mail, or at any post office, or from
at any income tax office. Your TD Branch should also have copies. </P>

	First, define a target neighbourhood based on factors such as average
housing cost, transportation, distance to work, proximity to schools, daycare,
recreation facilities, shopping, health care, etc.

<P>

Next, find a fit with a real estate agent who is active in the target
neighborhood. Which agent actively makes sales calls, keeps people informed
of sales or listings in that area, or leaves flyers and newsletters?



<P>Interview agents from different companies and assess their presentations.
Are they prepared? Do they have special affiliations or packaged discount
programs where clients save on mortgage costs, on moving costs or on household
purchases for a new home? Are they working for you? Work with a real estate
agent with whom there is good chemistry, and who offers excellent service
and value.

<FONT SIZE="+1">It's important to stay within your budget. Overextending yourself financially
is easy to do and should be avoided at all costs. Before falling in love
with a potential new home, obtain a pre-approved mortgage. A pre-approved
mortgage helps keep home buyers, especially first time buyers,  within their
price range.         </FONT>

	<P>To determine affordability, the GDS ratio looks at how much cash is available
each month. It includes factors like mortgage payments, taxes and heating.
Our maximum GDS ratio is 32%, and 35% if it's a CMHC insured mortgage.


<P>Another helpful measure when determining financing is to estimate carrying
costs with the Total Debt Service Ratio. The maximum TDS ratio is 37% (40%
if it's CMHC insured) including items covered under GDS plus all other financing
obligations.


<P>If these ratios are near the maximums, a complete budget analysis to
determine what is affordable can be done.


<P>This pre-qualifying stage is also the time to find out about the differences
between conventional mortgages and high-ratio, insured mortgages. First time
buyers can ask about special programs like the 5% down payment allowed under
the &quot;First Home Loan Insurance Program&quot; sponsored by Canada Mortgage
and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and the federal government's &quot;RRSP Home
Buyers' Plan&quot; which allows home buyers to use funds from a RRSP to purchase a home.


<P>A pre-qualification meeting with your TD personal banker can be treated
as a fact-finding mission to go over closing costs. For example: land transfer
tax, legal fees and other disbursements. A good rule of thumb is to budget
about 3% of the purchase price for closing costs. People who
buy new homes from builders, pay 7% GST on the purchase price.


<P>Once the mortgage is pre-approved, the interest rate is frozen for 60 days (90 days on
new home construction). If interest rates drop home buyers get the lower rate but
if they rise in the marketplace, the home buyer still receives the frozen
rate. There is no obligation to actually obtain a mortgage through the bank
that prequalifies the home shopper. Pre-qualification is a service offered
by the bank at no cost. It is wise to continue &quot;rolling over&quot;
your pre-qualification certificate if you don't find a home within the 60-90
day timeframe. Talk to your TD personal banker.<BR>

<A NAME="convent">A "Conventional mortgage"</A> is a loan for no more than 75% of
the appraised value or purchase price of the property, whichever is less.
A &quot;High ratio mortgage&quot; is usually for more than 75% of the appraised
value or purchase price. This type of mortgage is often referred to as an
NHA mortgage because it is granted under the provisions of the National
Housing Act and must, by law, be insured through CMHC or CEMICO for which the borrower
pays the insurance premium, application, legal and property appraisal fees.

<P>

<A NAME="closed">"Closed"</A> means a mortgage which is for a fixed term and with fixed
conditions.  A closed mortgage usually offers a lower interest rate than
an open one. An &quot;Open&quot; mortgage may be of the same term, but any
amount of principal may be paid off at any time, without penalty.

<P>

<A NAME="fixed">A "fixed rate"</A> mortgage carries the same interest rate for the
entire term. It allows homeowners to budget precisely for any term selected,
from six months to ten years. A &quot;variable rate&quot; mortgage is tied
to an underlying interest rate, like the prime lending rate, and rises or
falls with the market.

<P>

<A NAME="short">A "short term</A>" mortgage is usually for two years or
less. &quot;Long term&quot; is generally for three years
or more. Short term mortgages are appropriate when someone believes interest
rates will drop come renewal time. Long term mortgages are suitable when
current rates are reasonable and borrowers want the security of budgeting for
the future. This may be important for first time home buyers. The key is
to feel comfortable with your mortgage payments.

<P>

<A NAME="special">Specialty</A> mortgages are also available, such as the unique TD Multi-Rate Mortgage which divides a mortgage up into as many as five parts, each with
its own rate and term. Part of the mortgage can be short term with the balance long term. Payment frequencies can also vary so you can pay one
part bi-weekly and the other part weekly for example.

	<P>Amortization periods (the time it takes to repay a mortgage) run from
five to twenty-five years. Every time mortgage principal is re-paid, even
a small amount, it reduces the amortization period. Less total interest is paid
the shorter the amortization period.

<P>

<P>Paying weekly or bi-weekly instead of monthly shaves as much as eight
years and $63,000 off a $100,000 mortgage amortized over 25 years.

<P>

<P>The <A HREF="afford.html">Mortgage Calculator</A> reviews the options, and shows how much money you can save with various payment scenarios.

<P>

<P>Another factor to consider is &quot;portability&quot; or the right to transfer the remaining mortgage to another qualifying property, without charge. This can be a major advantage if the existing mortgage rate is below current market rates.

<P>

<P>People should also look at mortgage life insurance, especially where
two incomes are involved. The cost is low and can be incorporated into the
regular payments. The mortgage balance will be paid in full (the maximum
varies with different financial institutions) in the event of death, terminal
illness, or permanent disability.<BR>

	<P>
	It's essential to involve a lawyer before signing an Offer to Purchase a home.  The Offer
becomes a legal Agreement of Purchase and Sale once signed by both the buyer
and seller. The lawyer should read the Offer carefully and review it with
the potential buyers. Once signed and accepted, the lawyer orders a series
of title and off title searches from various municipal offices. This is to ensure the vendors
have not been sued and have paid all their realty taxes, hydro, water and
gas bills and that there be no old mortgages or liens on the property once
ownership changes.



<P>The lawyer also drafts a series of closing documents, and reviews the
closing documents drafted by the vendor's lawyer, since both lawyers participate
in this process.



<P>The bank and the lawyer coordinate and draft the appropriate mortgage documents.
The lawyer notifies the property tax offices as well as the utility offices
that there is a new owner as of the closing day.



<P>A few days before closing, the purchaser visits the lawyer's office to
sign the closing documents. At that time, a certified cheque is needed for
the balance of the closing funds (Purchase price plus closing funds less mortgage advance). The lawyer pays the relevant parties on the purchaser's behalf (land transfer to the government, balance owing to the vendor etc.) Part of the cheque covers the lawyer's fees and disbursements. The lawyer receives the mortgage funds directly from the bank and pays them out to the vendor.

	<P>
	As soon as the real estate agent draws-up  the Agreement of Purchase and Sale between
the buyer and the seller (setting out the final price and all the conditions
of sale), the buyer should come back to the TD Mortgage specialist with
their Pre-Approved Mortgage Certificate and with the following items:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A copy of the accepted Agreement to Purchase and Sale and an up to date land survey.

<LI>A salary letter from the buyer's employer.

<LI>Self-employed individuals need financial statements for the
past two years as well as personal income tax returns.

<LI>Confirmation that the down payment came from one's own resources
(i.e. bank statements or a gift letter).

<LI>A list of all assets and debts along with bank account numbers.

<LI>A copy of the real estate listing if buying an existing home.

<LI>Condominium financial statements, if applicable.

<LI>If buying a home to be constructed, a copy of the building
plans and specifications, the land survey and the agreement with the
builder.
</UL>
</table>
<P>

<P>Once the application is complete, TD can confirm what the interest rate
will be. The rate is guaranteed for 2 months (3 months on new construction).
During that time, should rates drop, the buyer receives the lowest rate
for the initial term selected. Of course, the mortgage is subject to final
approval; TD has to complete a property appraisal and obtain a credit bureau report on the buyer.

<P>

<P>Once the TD Home Advantage Mortgage is approved, the buyer's lawyer makes
the necessary searches, checking to make sure the tax and utilities are
paid on the property, and obtaining a land survey if the vendor does not
have one. The buyer is advised of any property taxe or land transfer taxes
to pay. The buyer should make sure there is sufficient money to cover these
costs in addition to legal fees. 

<P>

<P>After approval, the bank provides the buyer's lawyer with a package which
includes mortgage approval, mortgage documents, and instructions. A few
days before closing, the buyer is expected to give the lawyer the funds
required to complete the transaction, and sign the mortgage documents. On
closing day TD sends a cheque, representing the mortgage advance, to the
lawyer, who then goes to the registry office and registers the mortgage.

<P>

<P>This complete, the buyer gets the keys.<BR>

<HR>


<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>When Bob and Dave met as guides on a white water rafting operation in BC, they knew right away they'd make great partners.  Both had spent years travelling North America and abroad to tackle new adventure and outdoor sports.  Both had earned their keep acting as guides and instructors, but nearing 30, both were looking for a more stable opportunity.  

<P>Within a year, they'd started FreeFall Adventure Tours -- a specialized travel agency which books adventure-oriented tours across North America for customers from Vancouver and the surrounding region.

<P>Launched on a shoestring budget and a network of contacts across the continent, FreeFall set up shop in a tiny office in Vancouver's trendy Kitsilano district.  Their specialized approach and expert advice soon established them in this niche.

<P>After two years in operation, they'd reached sales of $3 million.  But margins in the business are low, and they sometimes felt they were still operating on a shoestring.  To reach their goals, the partners decided to aggressively expand the business.  They began booking a variety of new tours from operators overseas and planned on opening a new Toronto office to reach the large untapped market in Ontario.

<P>But on the brink of this successful expansion, the partners had second thoughts.  Maybe they were moving too quickly.  Just as they'd carefully equip themselves before embarking on a climbing expedition or setting out into white water, they felt they could do more to prepare themselves for the growth already barrelling down on them.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>The company faced two major challenges:
<OL>
<LI>Ensuring timely cash flow and accurate cash flow projections.
<P>
<LI>Ensuring smooth dealings with their numerous U.S. suppliers.
</OL>
<P>Forecasting cash flow, which had always been a challenge for FreeFall, would be further complicated with the addition of a Toronto office.  Because of this, the partners had decided that all booking and banking would be handled from the Vancouver office.  Now, they needed to streamline delivery and reporting of bookings/payments from the Toronto office into their headquarters.

<P>This effective cash flow management was essential.  Paying bills on time was key to getting discounts -- and better profits -- on tours the company booked.  That could only be managed with timely cash flow and the ability to track it on a daily basis.  

<P>The other issue the company hoped to address was how to improve their dealings with U.S. suppliers, something that had already posed some unique banking challenges.  Small U.S. operators (raft river tours, heli-skiing operators, rock-climbing camps) had complained that cheques drawn on FreeFall's US dollar account in Canada took too long to clear -- in some cases a week and a half.  At least one operator refused to accept anything other than bank drafts, and the bookkeeper typically had to purchase these in person.

<P>To complicate matters further, the company's single bookkeeper was already overworked and couldn't handle additional duties.  The owners wished to devote all resources toward expanding the business; that is, they gave sales and marketing a higher priority than administration.  Charged with finding a solution, the bookkeeper turned to the bank for help.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We helped FreeFall equip themselves for their new venture, by helping them accomplish more -- faster -- without increasing bookkeeping staff.

<P>To ensure deposits from the Toronto office were in the main account as quickly as possible, we set up an <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cts.htm">automatic transfer service</A>.  The Toronto office would simply prepare daily deposits, drop them into a convenient <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/nds.htm">night depository box</A>, and fax individual sales receipts to Vancouver as they were paid.

<P>The deposit would be credited to the Vancouver account that day , and the Vancouver office would receive reports (EDI) which referenced individual cheque amounts to the sales receipt number.

<P>To effectively track and manage the cashflow, the bookkeeper needs a constant, accurate view of deposits and cleared cheques.  To ensure this, account balance and activity data would automatically arrive on the office <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/faxlink.htm">fax machine</A> first thing every morning.

<P>With these services, the bookkeeper could count on smooth cashflow, and had a clear idea of what was currently in and could be expected in the account.  Paying bills on time and getting tour discounts would be an easy task.

<P>To solidify relations with U.S. suppliers, we introduced the bookkeeper to a service that allows the company to issue cheques normally on their US$ account in Canada -- but the cheques now bear a New York banking address and "MICR" encoding that enables <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/rrca.htm">fast processing</A> through the US Federal Clearing System. 

<P>Many of these services would slash the time that might be devoted to deposit preparation and cash flow tracking.  But the bookkeeper found even more time to devote to more important issues by automating other duties.

<P>Payroll, which could take half a day, would only take a 10-minute phone call every two weeks.  FreeFall would confirm their payroll information over the phone, and employees' pay would be transferred directly to their accounts.  The bank would produce all necessary records and statements.

<P>The bookkeeper would even be able to pay expenses like utility bills <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/bl_com.htm">over the phone</A>. 

<P>And once she'd entered data on their in-house accounting software, reconciliation would be easy.  A <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/easyrec.htm">software package </A> from the bank would automatically reconcile the bank account activity with her entries.  The tedious work disappears, and she simply follows up on outstanding entries.

<P>Since the business was expanding and overseas bookings were becoming more numerous, we also introduced FreeFall to another software solution.  This enabled them to initiate wire payments from their personal computer, ensuring <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/rapwire.htm">prompt payment to overseas</A> suppliers and saving time. 

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>When the bookkeeper returned with her plan, the owners realized they could move forward confident they were well prepared.

<P>The plan helped keep their administration costs low, while making their bookkeeper a more effective member of the team.  She's no longer frantically overworked, and has the time to plan financial transactions more strategically.

<HR>


<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>GreenEarth Coalition is a small non-profit organization with annual of just under $100,000 .  With modest origins as a local environmental club, GreenEarth has moved to national environmental campaigns, and steadily increased both membership and revenue over the last eight years.

<P>Despite their successes, GreenEarth organizers found it difficult to control the organization's cash flow, and were spending increasing time and energy on financial dealings.  They realized it was important to plan properly for their next stage of growth.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>With revenues coming strictly from (often unpredictable) membership donations, GreenEarth was operating under extremely tight cash-flow restrictions.  And the sheer amount of clerking and bookkeeping work involved in this type of operation was too much for the existing bookkeeping staff, even when supplemented by the occasional volunteer.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We set out to design a solution that would help GreenEarth simplify their current financial system and make it more efficient.  At the same time, we wanted to provide the flexibility necessary for future growth.

<P>Since revenue will continue to come from members, it was important to provide a solution that facilitated continuous, regular donations by the GreenEarth membership.

<P>We instituted an easy  method of <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundin.htm">automating their donations</A>.  This service helped GreenEarth with higher, more regular donations, and made cash flow more predictable.

<P>We also implemented a PC-based <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">banking service</A>, to help GreenEarth staff monitor their account balances and activity, without leaving their office.  Money Monitor allowed them to move funds easily between accounts, giving them better control over their finances.  This turned out to be a great solution, as their bookkeeping staff now automatically received statements every month.

<P>We took more pressure off the bookkeeping staff with an automated payroll system.  Now, payroll simply took a single phone call every two weeks.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>After implementing the solution, GreenEarth realized:
<UL>
<LI> Greatly improved cash flow, both in regularity, and in volume
<LI> Greater control over their various bank accounts and banking reconciliation
<LI> More time for their staff to concentrate on other duties, while still staying on top of the financial side of GreenEarth
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Conner Variety, Inc. operates a variety store in Toronto with annual sales of just over $300,000.  Family owned and operated, the stores have been passed down from generation to generation, and each shop maintains a certain old world charm that appeals to neighbourhood customers.

<P>Most of Conner Variety's sales come from traditional variety store products, such as soft drinks, milk, bread, magazines and cigarettes.  But recently, proprietor Jim Conner successfully integrated a deli operation into the store.  The deli produces and sells homemade baked goods and prepared foods for the burgeoning market of young families moving into the neighbourhood.

<P>Its success prompted Jim to test and introduce new products regularly.  But taking on this new endeavour left him with less and less time to deal with necessary banking duties.  

<P>And when other variety stores approached him to supply them with homemade foods, Jim decided it was time to reexamine his banking habits.  He hoped to streamline his duties, so he could concentrate more on expanding his business, and he wanted to find out how the bank could help with his expansion.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Jim and his bank account manager identified a few key areas Conner Variety should tackle:
<UL>
<LI>Reduce the time spent on transactions.  Jim went to the bank every day during business hours.
<P>
<LI>Reduce overall banking costs
</UL>

<P>Jim's main problem was his reliance on his local bank.  Since the bank's hours were nearly identical to his stores', Jim took time away from business every day to make deposits, get account information and transfer money between accounts.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>After examining his banking habits, Jim's account manager set up a flat-fee banking package which gave him bank-machine/PIN access to his business account.  This freed Jim from banking hours, and he makes fewer visits since he can now use the phone for account updates, interim statements, bill payments and fund transfers.  Jim also deposits daily cash receipts in a convenient <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/nds.htm">night depository</A> , knowing it will be credited to his account the following morning.

<P>Jim worried that the system might not be able to accommodate his needs as his business grew, but the account manager assured him that the bank would be capable of delivering new banking services by fax or computer.

<P>Jim also consolidated all his business accounts in a new current account designed specifically for small business.  The new account earns daily interest on any surplus account balances.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>These small business banking services helped Jim:
<UL>
<LI> Streamline Conner Variety's banking duties
<LI> Reduce service fees
<LI> Earn interest on the surplus balances in his accounts
<LI> Save time
</UL>
<P>And the credit services allowed Jim to relax, knowing he could quickly and conveniently get credit when he needed it most.

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Lower Mattawask Mutual is a small farm mutual insurance firm established in Northeastern Ontario in 1927.  They've always prided themselves on prudent use of funds, and their substantial reserves combined with low property insurance rates have attracted business beyond their original base of farmers: now a majority of their business comes from rural property owners and hobby farms.

<P>The company offers farm and home packages through a few dozen regional brokers in Northern Ontario, and brokers are now approaching them from further afield.

<P>Among brokers, they've earned a reputation as a very modern company.  Their computer capabilities are quite sophisticated, and they recently moved into a "smart" one-story head office in the hamlet of Lower Mattawask, which is fancifully modelled on a pioneer log cabin.

<P>So it surprised new members of the board of directors when they discovered North Mattawask continued to collect premiums using methods not much more advanced than the ones they would have used in '27.

<P>Lower Mattawask's staff is small (policy holders often know most of the staff on a first-name basis), and the increased sales strained the accounting department.  In keeping with a long tradition of fiscal responsibility, the Board decided it was time to explore more efficient cash management methods before hiring new staff.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Lower Mattawask Mutual receives roughly $200,000 in payments directly from policy holders every month.  Traditionally, a few hundred cheques arrived through the mail, payments were entered manually into the company's computer system, and deposits were prepared manually.

<P>That took a lot of manpower, and since policy holders sometimes made errors in their payment amount, it resulted in time-consuming corrections.  Late payments led to policy lapses and additional time-consuming followup. 

<P>To further complicate the department's duties, the company accepts post-dated cheques, which needed to be set aside.  And since the nearest bank is 25 miles from the hamlet, daily deposits were often out of the question.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>To get payments in faster, ensure more accurate deposits and reduce accounting staff, we suggested two complementary systems.

<P>First, the Mutual implemented electronic <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundin.htm">payments directly from policy holders' bank accounts</A>.  On customers' authorization, policy payments are withdrawn from their accounts and deposited directly to Lower Mattawask's account.  The company downloads electronic data to their accounts receivable system and automatically updates customer account balances.

<P>This eliminates customer errors in payments, the problem of late payments, and the hassle of monitoring post-dated cheques.  It's also more convenient for customers. 

<P>However, some customers prefer to write checks as before.  For these customers, Lower Mattawask <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/lockbox.htm">provides a new address</A>.   The bank collects payments received here and deposits them directly to the Mutual's account.  As with direct electronic payments, Lower Mattawask receives a computer file with the deposit reports, which automatically updates their customer account information.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>The new Board helped Lower Mattawask Mutual manage their growth without increasing the accounting department.  In fact, since they'd now slashed tedious duties, including regular trips to town to visit the bank, two members of the staff were able to spend half their time developing more  time to better serve their clients.

<P>Of course, these improvements also ensure income is now in the bank much faster, allowing Lower Mattawask to maximize their investment earnings.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Injector Systems Inc. is a Canadian manufacturer of fuel injector hosing.  The $20 million/year company is located in Ontario, and sells to independent and chain-operated garages in Canada and the U.S through regional sales offices.

<P>The company had been in operation for 15 years, when the president saw a major growth opportunity in supplying high-quality OEM parts to dealerships of a major North American car manufacturer.  To prepare, the company set up a state-of-the-art inventory-tracking system, which uses bar coding and a sophisticated EDI program to ensure just-in-time delivery.  Injector Systems passed an initial assessment by the car manufacturer and was ready to begin a trial period leading to supplier certification.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>While they were poised to become an accredited supplier, Injector Systems recognized they were just one of many suppliers being audited.  They hoped to improve their competitive position by making financial dealings with the automaker fast and seamless, and provide the right allocation of technical staff to ensure the automaker's confidence.

<P>This prompted a closer look at ways to streamline their financial accounting procedures.  It turned out that the accounting/payroll department consumed an above-average percentage of their total operating budget, and it quickly became clear the company could hire new staff elsewhere by trimming the fat here.  Among the issues they identified were:
A rough analysis of the types of activities performed by the department revealed that close to 50% of the time was spent on tedious "clerking" duties.  For example, accounts payable manually issued more than 500 cheques a month, not including payroll.

<P>Payroll was managed on an in-house system, which took care of contributions and deductions, but cheques needed to be cut manually.  This system was linked to their computer accounting system, allowing for some automation of reconciliation, but other payments and receivables had to be sorted, segregated and checked manually.

<P>And the constant balance/banking activity data required by head office was obtained through time-consuming phone calls.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We tackled the inefficiencies by expanding on their existing automation capabilities to meet their growing needs.

<P>To give Injector Systems an edge on the competition, we recommended they add the ability to originate <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">EDI data and payments</A> as well as receive them... to get more mileage out of the investment they'd already made in EDI.  Now, in addition to using EDI for inventory tracking, Injector Systems could receive payments from the manufacturer electronically.  This was a pre-requisite for preferred suppliers.

<P>It also provides the first of many automated accounting methods that would cut Injector Systems accounting budget in half.

<P>With EDI payments now possible, funds could be transferred directly to suppliers' bank accounts without the need to prepare checks.

<P>Next, we streamlined payroll and eliminated the need for a separate payroll account.  The department now provides an <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundout.htm">electronic data transmission</A> from their accounting system to their bank.  This service automatically withdraws money from Injector Systems operating account and deposits the correct amount into each employee's bank account.

<P>The company also slashed reconciliation time and effort.  Injector Systems already entered issued payments on their accounting software.  They now export this file from their system and transmit it to the bank, which performs an <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/crs.htm">automatic reconcilement</A> by comparing their data with the actual bank data.  The bank provides detailed reports on payables by office and product division.

<P>Finally, Injector Systems accounting people can now go on-line via personal computers to get up-to-the-minute data on balance and banking activity, collections data, and other banking services.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>The automaker was not only pleased with Injector Systems EDI capability, but with the emphasis the company had placed on quality by hiring new quality assurance technicians.

<P>After passing the six-month trial with zero defects and flying colours, Injector Systems was accredited as the primary supplier of fuel injection hosing.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Future-Byte is a privately owned Canadian distributor of PC components with sales in excess of $30 million.  Riding the phenomenal growth of the PC market, Future-Byte has grown rapidly at home and in the U.S.

<P>For tax reasons, they've established a U.S. subsidiary, and they maintain a U.S. account for their substantial U.S. dealings.  They pay overseas suppliers from this U.S. account. 

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Future-Byte found that dealing with both a U.S. and Canadian bank complicated their financial dealings and management of their funds.

<P>They also found it difficult to forecast cash flow when importing parts from overseas suppliers, since they were at the mercy of fluctuating foreign exchange rates.

<P>And they needed to get financial information faster so they could improve overall efficiency.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We immediately suggested the client consolidate their funds with a Canadian bank.  This method allowed for a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/usbbs.htm">U.S. domicilied account</A> and a Canadian domiciled account. 

<P>We helped them arrange a much lower flat-fee pricing structure, reducing their cost per transaction.  We also showed Future-Byte how they could earn interest on surplus balances in their current accounts.

<P>And Future-Byte worked directly with an FX trader to set up a contract forward, a sophisticated hedging technique which protects them against foreign exchange fluctuations.

<P>To help cash flow even further, we helped Future-Byte set up a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/lockbox.htm">new address</A> to receive payments from U.S. clients.  Checks received at this address are automatically deposited that day.

<P>These days, the office computer has become a much more important tool in the company's financial dealings.  

<P>Future-Byte can now direct <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/rapwire.htm">the wiring of funds</A> directly from their office computer, and these dealings automatically use the rate agreed on in their contract.  This also reduces the cost of manually processing a wire payment at the branch.

<P>We also suggested a service which allows Future-Byte immediate on-line access to, and analysis of, their account status in both the <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/usbbs.htm">U.S.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">Canada</A>.

<P>And the company now finds it easy to <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/f_trade.htm">issue letters</A> of credit through their PC. 


<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>After making these changes, Future-Byte realized:
<UL>
<LI>Savings of approximately $5000 in the first year in overall banking costs.
<LI>Improved control over financial information and transactions.
<LI>More confidence and better projections when it came to foreign exchange rates.
</UL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Virtualtech started as a computer game software developer, but in the ten years since Gail Stuart shipped her first few freeware disks, the company has expanded, acquiring two new wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Virtualtech International now includes:
<UL>
<LI>Animtech, a computer graphics/animation producer for film and television
<LI>Meditech, a creator of simulators for medical operations
<LI>Virtualtech, the original games company.
</UL>

<P>The three companies originally located close to ready markets, and they've remained in these distant offices.  Virtualtech operates from Fredericton, NB, the medical simulator manufacturer works from Montreal, PQ, and the animation producer has offices in Toronto, ON and Vancouver, BC.

<P>The accounting department head has suggested that the company could be making better use of the funds in those accounts.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>Each subsidiary operated independently.  They maintained their own bank accounts and had arranged for their own lines of credit locally, each office providing security and paying interest at bank rates.  With the operating requirements of these businesses, short term financing had become a problem.

<P>Each subsidiary could invest any excess funds for short terms, but head office felt they could make better use of this money and maximize interest if they could consolidate all funds on an ongoing basis.  But they couldn't simply maintain zero balances at each subsidiary, as each needed control over its own income and expenses.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We helped Virtualtech set up a system by which all funds were pooled in their concentration account in Fredericton, yet each subsidiary had <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/mas.htm">control over "their" funds through</A> their branch as always.

<P>Now, when one subsidiary needs short-term financing, it can often simply borrow from another which has available funds.  While the company maintains a borrowing facility with the bank, this greatly reduces borrowing costs by keeping many of them within the company.  

<P>Inter-entity borrowing also means each individual company no longer needs to maintain its own line of credit.  And since the money is now held in one concentration account, Virtualtech can maximize its investment earnings.  

<P>The bank automatically tracks and calculates <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/iar.htm">inter-entity borrowing costs and interest</A>.   And each subsidiary is credited for the interest earned on its portion of the total funds invested in the corporate account.

<P>To track all this activity, Virtualtech uses an on-line system to access daily activity from all accounts.  And each subsidiary has access to their banking information only (at not extra charge).
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>This package has solved problems for head office and all the subsidiaries.  Virtualtech has realized a substantially better return on investment of their cash, and they've slashed short-term financing costs.  Each subsidiary finds it much easier and cheaper to access funds as necessary.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>One World Fashions began as a small importer of upscale costume jewellery and fashions from India, Africa, the Orient and the Middle East.  The company initially sold to retailers, but soon decided it could increase its profits by opening a few retail operations of its own.  In its first year of operation, it opened five retail boutiques in malls in five of Canada's top cities.  Within two years, it had 15.  Two years later, 95.  In its most recent year, it opened another 50 stores.  Its sales now total $150 million/year.

<P>The rapid expansion put a strain on One World's operations, and the success the owners saw as a reward for years of hard work ended up chaining them to their desks.  They now spent more late nights at the office putting out fires than when they first began.

<P>The increased business also increased their importing activity, placing a lot of pressure on their import manager to ensure timely delivery of goods from a variety of suppliers.

<P>The owners realized their administrative efficiency hadn't kept pace with their growth; they were using small business methods to run a rapidly expanding operation.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>When they consulted with their bank representative, she quickly zeroed on areas they could improve.

<P>Her first question was why they were maintaining an individual operating account for every retail outlet.  Each store's operating line requirements were minimal, and even something like local newspaper advertising or direct mail could be paid through head office.  It turned out their accountant had originally advised they open the accounts to allow for the transfer of the stores' daily deposits.

<P>While the deposits from each store were consolidated, deposit reports weren't as detailed as One World would prefer.  Since the reports lumped all deposits in a single total, showing only which accounts had contributed -- not how much -- there was no way of identifying deposits from different stores.

<P>Payroll had also become a massive chore.  With each store employing an average of five part-timers and one manager, their total staff exceeds 1000.  But the payroll department used the same techniques they'd used when the company had only five stores:  store managers submitted handwritten timesheet summaries, which were manually entered on a payroll system at head office.  Cheques were issued manually and distributed by courier to each store... a costly and cumbersome exercise.  The payroll department had ballooned with each new expansion; instead of treating the cause and revamping the system, they'd treated the symptom with more staff doing more work.

<P>On the import side, they found they were wiring more funds and issuing more letters of credit every day.  This now took up an inordinate amount of the import manager's time, leaving less time to coordinate timely delivery and provide the company's customs broker with proper information.  Delayed shipments to stores and increased customs charges resulted.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>Since individual retail outlets could operate without an individual account
(rental payments and payroll were handled from head office), One World could
eliminate those unnecessary accounts.  The solution was a bank service which
allowed each store to make a deposit at their local branch, and immediately
transfer those funds to the company's corporate account in Winnipeg.  The service
delivers <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/cts.htm">daily reports showing individual deposits</A> by each store and branch
deposit location. 

<P>An on-line <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/moneymon.htm">balance reporting service</A> allowed the company to
access account data at any time through their office computer.  That meant more
accurate cash flow forecasting, which made the import manager's job easier.  They
could also inquire on the details of incoming wire payments deposited to their
account to see who had sent the payment.

<P>We also helped One World Fashions automate payroll payments and eliminate the
time-consuming, tedious work of cutting more than a thousand cheques every two
weeks.  With the data on the company's payroll system, One World Fashions now
directs the bank to <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundout.htm">credit employee accounts</A> with direct deposits. 

<P>Automation also freed up the import manager's time, by allowing him to
<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/rapwire.htm">initiate wire payments</A> and <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/f_trade.htm">letters of credit</A> from his
personal computer, rather than processing them manually.


<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>As they implemented these solutions, the company realized how close they'd come to overburdening themselves.  With the new, streamlined procedures we helped them implement, they were poised to consolidate and effectively manage their recent expansion, and look to further expansion.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>Bio Industries has sold medical imaging workstations and supplies in the U.S. for five years.  Their foray into the global market began with Canada, which they initially considered similar to just another American state.  They soon discovered differently.  While Canada represents a large potential market, the added layers of decision-making at government-funded hospitals made the sales process more involved than they were accustomed to.

<P>This meant they had to keep their sales costs as low as possible to keep profits at an acceptable level.  And the solution was creation of a "virtual" Canadian branch office.

<P>For tax reasons, it was essential to establish a Canadian address, but this branch office would house only minimal staff to handle phone inquiries, while all administration and treasury would continue to be handled from the the company's U.S. head office.  Resources in Canada would be better focused on the salespeople, who were outfitted with mobile offices so they could effectively stay out in the field most of the time while still having the support to efficiently service their customers. 

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>The company needed a way to smoothly implement financial transactions in Canada, that would both seamlessly integrate with their U.S. banking operations and provide fast and accurate reporting on all Canadian transactions.

<P>Canadian salespeople earned salaries and commissions, and were to be paid in Canadian dollars.  The difference in currency and tax remittance information required by provincial authorities complicated things further.

<P>And in addition, while many hospitals submitted electronic payments, some mailed in cheques.  The company felt that if Canadian hospitals were to mail cheques to the U.S. it would take far too long to a) receive the cheques and b) clear them through the Canadian bank.

<P>The company had developed a Canadian pricing structure in Canadian dollars, and needed to be able to receive and process these funds.

<P>Bio Industries turned to the bank to zero in on the most effective method of implementing their Canadian expansion while maintaining knowledge, control and operational efficiencies.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We created a "virtual" accounting department for Bio Industries.  One that could be used to receive Canadian customer payments and distribute payroll to Canadian salespeople.

<P>All Canadian account activity is consolidated on a daily basis and linked into Bio Industries existing U.S. multi-bank reporting system, providing easy access to previous day transaction information as well as tracking capability to help generate a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/filelink.htm">complete financial picture</A> of the Canadian operation.  Now the company simply monitors the cash flow in their Canadian account, and when transfers are required, wire funds to the account.

<P>Concerning payroll needs Bio Industries pays Canadian employees from the Canadian account based on instructions from U.S. office.  The company's payroll department <!--<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/payroll.htm">-->uses a PC-based system<!--</A>-->
 to electronically submit names and amounts, leaving Canadian source deduction and documentation to the bank. 
 
<P>This allows the hospitals to pay in Canadian funds.  Canadian accounts receivable <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">arrive electronically</A> or through daily pickups and deposits from regional post office boxes.  The bank electronically transmits detailed reports on which payments are received from which client.  

<P>Funds are consolidated into an interest-bearing account at the end of each day.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>Bio Industries has achieved success in Canada, without the expense and complication of opening a full-fledged Canadian branch office.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q1">Background</A></H3>

<P>In the last 30 years, Kate Bismark and Associates had slowly expanded operations of their employment services from their Atlanta headquarters, opening offices in major cities across the U.S. and Canada.  The most rapid expansion occurred within the last five years, and coverage of North America was virtually complete.  With more than $500 million in annual sales, the firm is considered to operate one of the biggest temporary employee networks in U.S.

<P>Kate Bismark still runs the company she founded with a firm hand, taking an active role in most of the company's strategic decisions.  The 61-year-old president is well-respected in the industry for her vision and canny judgement, but she's the first to admit her insistence on involvement in every management decision has delayed some advances.  At times, that lack of agility has threatened the company's competitiveness.

<P>Payroll is a prime example.  Until recently, the company maintained dual mail-based payroll systems in both the U.S.A. and Canada.  They'd explored other options in the past but were unsatisfied.  Now, the new payroll head faced a number of challenges and had presented a strong case for an overhaul.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q2">Issues:</A></H3> 

<P>The company recognized the redundancy inherent to maintaining two distinct payroll systems, and planned to move to a centralized payroll processing system in Atlanta.  But by itself, this would only concentrate many of the problems in a single office.

<P>The mail-based system still carried inherent problems:

<P>The manual processing of recurring payments to a vast network of temporary employees was a considerable expense.

<P>The tremendous differences between U.S. and Canadian income tax processing requirements meant the company needed to maintain two distinct processing channels under the manual system.  So they'd realize no real economy-of-scale by centralizing their processes.

<P>Managing employees expectations had become a public relations challenge.  Workers didn't know when their paycheques would arrive, and Personnel had to constantly deal with irate employees. 

<P>Management's wish list included streamlined payments and a fully integrated system that merged Canadian and U.S. account information.  They wanted an easily managed reporting process which delivered timely and actionable information.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q3">Solution:</A></H3>

<P>We determined that Canadian payroll could be streamed from the U.S. payment system and directly managed through a comprehensive and fully automated payroll system in Canada.

<P>The Canadian payroll system allows Kate Bismark and Associates to <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/fundout.htm">electronically transfer funds</A> to their Canadian workforce, and it automatically submits regular tax payments and complete tax <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">remittance documentation electronically</A> to the Federal Treasury department. 

<P>Using the company's <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/twi.htm">treasury workstation interface</A>, the company can now merge reports on Canadian account activity with reports on U.S. account activity, providing consolidated reports of all company disbursements.

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="q4">Results:</A></H3>

<P>The company significantly improved both cost performance and personnel acceptance with implementation of the direct payment payroll system.

<P>They accomplished their goal of establishing a streamlined process that reduced costs by eliminating manual handling, distribution fees and cumbersome cheque issuance.

<P>Further, employees indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the service.  Payments arrived faster and more conveniently.

<H2><CENTER>Introduction To RRSPs<BR></CENTER>
</H2>
An RRSP is a <A HREF="regs.htm">Canadian government regulated program</A>
that encourages people to save for their retirement years. RRSPs have special
tax benefits that defer current income tax and potentially accelerate the
accumulation of savings. They are available to the public through chartered
banks, trust companies, and other selected financial institutions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>You should consider an RRSP if:<BR>
</B>
<UL>
  <LI>You want to supplement your retirement income so that you can maintain
your lifestyle after you retire. 
  <LI>You anticipate fluctuations in your income because of maternity leave,
a return to school, or a career change. 
  <LI>You want to reduce your income tax this year, or you want to earn
tax sheltered investment income on your savings. 
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>It Pays To Plan For Your Future<BR>
</H2>
At TD we're committed to offering you a wide range of RRSP products which
can be tailored to your retirement financial needs. Our RRSP specialists
have put together this site to help maximize your savings and assist you
in choosing the right TD RRSP for your personal goals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If you have any questions, please call or drop by any TD Bank branch.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>FOUR IMPORTANT REASONS FOR A TD RRSP</H3>
<H4>1. A TD RRSP is a Safe, Smart Way To Invest</H4>
Today, more than ever, you must save wisely in order to ensure a worry-free
future for you and your family. Just about anyone can contribute. If you
are employed, self-employed, receive net rental income, or maintenance and
alimony payments, pay income tax, and will be 69 years of age or less on
December 31, 1997, you can build a potentially larger retirement income
and pay less tax now, by contributing regularly to a TD RRSP. In fact, a
TD RRSP could make the difference between "just getting by" and having the
financial resources you need for an enjoyable, fulfilling retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Tax-deductible contributions and tax-sheltered income are the two main reasons
it pays to invest in a TD RRSP instead of an unregistered plan or many other
investments.<BR>
<H4>2. The Money You Invest is Tax-Deductible</H4>
Every eligible dollar you contribute to a TD RRSP reduces your taxable income
by one dollar. That means you can cut your tax bill dramatically. For example,
if your marginal tax rate is 40% and you contribute $2,500 to your TD RRSP,
your taxable income will be reduced by $2,500 - a tax saving of $1,000.
<BR>
<H4>3. The Income Earned is Tax-Sheltered</H4>
The income earned by your TD RRSP is tax sheltered for the entire life of
your plan and is automatically reinvested in your plan, year after year.
You don't pay taxes on income earned in an RRSP (as you must pay on interest
and dividend earnings on other savings or investments) until you withdraw
the funds. That's why your TD RRSP savings grow so much faster. <BR>
<H4>4. TD RRSP Savings are Readily Accessible</H4>
The money in your TD Daily Interest RSP is just as accessible as it would
be in a similar, but unregistered investment. In an emergency, you can withdraw
funds from a <A HREF="savings.htm">TD Daily Interest RSP</A> simply by asking
and paying the applicable withholding tax.<BR>

<P><B>1. </B><A NAME="q1"></A><B>What is an RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
An RRSP is a <A HREF="regs.htm">Canadian government regulated program</A>
that encourages people to save for their retirement years. RRSPs have special
tax benefits that defer income tax and potentially greatly accelerate the
accumulation of savings. They are available through chartered banks, trust
companies, and other selected financial institutions.<BR>
<BR>
Contributions to an RRSP can only be made by individuals with &quot;earned
income&quot; taxable in Canada, which includes salaries, self-employment
income, alimony, and net rental income (but does not include income from
pensions or investments). Revenue Canada issues statements to individual
taxpayers with their &quot;Notice of Assessment&quot; informing them of
their RRSP contribution limit for the following year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. </B><A NAME="q2"></A><B>Why do I need an RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
The maximum annual pension a Canadian would get today from Canada Pension
Plan is just over $8,000. Canada's senior population will increase 6% by
2010 and more than double by 2026, putting immense pressure on government
programs. You can't rely on Government Pension Plans for your retirement
income alone. An RRSP will help you maintain your standard of living when
you retire.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to this, your taxable income will be reduced each year by the
amount of the eligible contribution. So, the more you contribute, the less
income tax you'll pay in the year that you make the contribution.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q3"></A><B>3. What is my maximum tax-deductible RRSP contribution?</B><BR>
<BR>
How to <A HREF="regs.htm">calculate your maximum RRSP contribution for 1996</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The Notice of Assessment that you received from Revenue Canada after filing
your 1995 tax return stated the amount of your 1996 maximum contribution.
If you have not received this notice or need to double check the amount,
simply call your Revenue Canada Local District Taxation Office. The number is available in the blue pages of your phone book.<BR>
<BR>
Please note, if you are self-employed, employed and are not a member of
an employer-funded Registered Pension Plan (RPP) or Deferred Profit Sharing
Plan (DPSP):<BR>


<BR>
Your 1996 RRSP contribution limit is 18% of 1995 &quot;Earned Income&quot;
to a maximum of $13,500, plus any unused contribution room carried forward
from 1995.<BR>

</UL>
<P>If you are a member of an employer funded RPP or DPSP:<BR>

<UL>Your 1996 RRSP contribution limit is 18% of your 1995 earned
income to a maximum of $13,500 minus the Pension Adjustment reported by
your employer (found in box 52 of your 1995 T4 slip), plus any unused contribution
room carried forward from 1995.<BR>

</UL>
<P><B></B><A NAME="q4"></A><B>4. What's the deadline for an RRSP
contribution that is deductible for the 1996 tax year?</B><BR>
<BR>
You have until March 1, 1997 to contribute to your RRSP. Once this date
has passed RRSP contributions are only deductible against your taxable
income of 1997 or any subsequent year.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q5"></A><B>5. What is a spousal RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
The more taxable income you have, the higher your tax bracket. You should,
therefore, consider allocating future taxable income as evenly as possible
between you and your spouse - commonly known as the &quot;income splitting&quot;
opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
You are entitled to put all or part of your allowable annual and carried forward RRSP contribution
eligibility into an RRSP in your spouse's name. This may lower the combined income tax
you and your spouse must pay each year when you withdraw your RRSP eligibility savings
during retirement.<BR>
<BR>
As the contributor to a spousal RRSP, you benefit from the tax deduction
while building a retirement nest egg for your spouse. Amounts withdrawn
from a spousal RRSP will be considered part of your spouse's taxable income,
provided you have not contributed any amount to a spousal plan in the current
year or the two preceding years. A spousal RRSP is most beneficial in a
situation where the planholder (spouse) would otherwise have little retirement
income while the contributing spouse would have a significant amount of
income.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q6"></A><B>6. At what age should I begin contributing to my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
Start your RRSP NOW. Contribute as much as you can afford, as soon as you
can. Even modest regular contributions can build over the years into a significant
retirement nest egg. Revenue Canada now makes it easy to know how much you
can contribute tax-free to your RRSP's each year. For your 1996 limit, simply
refer to your 1995 Income Tax Notice of Assessment. The advice on this Notice
includes both the maximum amount which you may contribute in 1996 based
on your 1995 earned income, plus, any unused contribution room carried forward
from previous years.<BR>
<BR>
It pays to start your RRSP NOW. The sooner you start, the more you'll have
when you retire.<BR>
<BR>
If you invest $500 a year for 40 years starting today, you will accumulate
more than twice as much as the person who waits 20 years, and then
invests $1,000 a year for 20 years. The total amount invested is the same,
but look at the difference in results.<BR>
<BR>
Total RRSP fund after 40 years of $500 annual contributions equals $106,805.<BR>
Total RRSP fund after 20 years of $1,000 annual contributions equals $43,865.<BR>
<BR>
Example is based on a constant 7% rate of return in order to illustrate
the advantages of tax-sheltered savings. Because actual interest rates fluctuate,
the amounts shown do not necessarily represent the value you would actually
accumulate in an RRSP.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q7"></A><B>7. Does it make a difference if I contribute regularly
to my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
Contributing weekly, biweekly or monthly is an excellent way to budget for
your RRSP contribution. Making regular contributions not only avoids the
last minute scramble for a large, lump sum contribution, but, as the example
in question 8 below highlights, you'll also earn more tax-sheltered interest
than you would waiting until next year ($84,260 more).<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q8"></A><B>8. Is there any problem with always waiting until the
last minute to contribute to my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
It's a sound strategy to contribute early in the tax year. Contributing
at the earliest possible date rather than waiting for the deadline can make
a big difference because your savings generate more compound interest. The
difference really adds up!<BR>
<BR>
You should contribute early.<BR>
<BR>
Your savings generate more compound interest if you contribute early in
the tax year.<BR>

<UL><B>Three people contribute $13,500 a year @ 7% compounded annually:</B><BR>

<BR>
Example is based on a constant 7% rate in order to illustrate the advantages
of tax-sheltered savings. Because actual interest rates fluctuate, the amounts
shown do not necessarily represent the value you would actually accumulate
in an RRSP.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q9"></A><B>9. I didn't maximize my RRSP last year. Is there anything
I can do?</B><BR>
<BR>
If you don't contribute the maximum amount allowable to your RRSP in any
year, you can carry the unused portion forward indefinitely. Any
amounts &quot;carried forward&quot; should be reflected in the statement
provided by Revenue Canada with your &quot;Notice of Assessment&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q10"></A><B>10. Are GICs the only thing I can have in my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
At TD, you have available to you a wide variety of RRSP's including:<BR>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="gen_disa.htm">TD Daily Interest Savings RSP</A> 
  <LI><A HREF="gen_gic.htm">TD GIC RSP</A> 
  <LI><A HREF="gen_mf.htm">Mutual Fund RRSP</A> 
  <LI><A HREF="gen_sd.htm">Self Directed RRSP</A> 
  <LI><A HREF="gen_trst.htm">Managed RRSP</A> 
</UL>
<P><B></B><A NAME="q11"></A><B>11. What is the foreign content limit
for RRSPs?</B><BR>
<BR>
You can have up to 20% of your RRSP's book value in foreign content. The
book value of your plan is the actual cost of the holdings in your RRSP,
not the RRSP's worth. If you currently hold more than one RRSP, the limit
applies to each plan individually. If you hold exactly 20% foreign content
in your RRSP you will be penalized if you sell a non foreign content holding,
or if one of your foreign mutual funds pays and reinvests a distribution, as this will cause you to exceed the 20% foreign content limit.
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q12"></A><B>12. What kind of investments can I hold in my Self-Directed RRSP?<BR>
</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Common and preferred shares of Canadian corporations listed
on any Canadian and many foreign stock exchanges. 
  <LI>Fixed-income securities including bonds, debentures, strip bonds and
notes: 
  <UL>
    <LI>issued by a corporation which has shares listed on a Canadian
stock exchange; 
    <LI>issued by a Canadian government (federal, provincial, municipal);
    <LI>guaranteed by the Government of Canada.
    <LI><BR>

  </UL>
  <LI>Many foreign shares and fixed-income securities. 
  <LI>Canadian and Provincial Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Canada Savings Bonds and Provincial Savings Bonds. 
  <LI>Term Deposits, GICs, savings accounts and cash in Canadian currency.
  <LI>Options to purchase eligible securities. 
  <LI><A HREF="noloadmf.htm">Mutual funds.</A> 
  <LI>Mortgages.
  <LI>
</UL>
<P><B></B><A NAME="q13"></A><B>13. To be safe, should I hold only
<A HREF="gen_gic.htm">GICs</A> in my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
GICs provide you with a fixed return for a fixed period of time with minimal
risk of loss of captial; but the long term growth potential above inflation
is marginal. Generally, it is better to have a more diversified and balanced
portfolio in your RRSP, including equity and fixed income investments.<BR>
<BR>
You should choose investments which will meet your financial objectives
in terms of the risk or safety of the principal, income, growth, and liquidity.
This is your retirement nest-egg in which you are investing, so take the
time to investigate the different types of RRSPs. Consult your personal
banker or investment advisor, who can help you make the right investment
choice. <BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q14"></A><B>14. Is the administration fee for a <A HREF="gen_sd.htm">self-directed
RRSP</A> deductible?</B><BR>
<BR>
As a result of the March 6, 1996 Federal Budget administration fees for <B>self-directed</b> RRSP are no longer tax deductible.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q15"></A><B>15. Should I pay down my mortgage or put money into
my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
The answer to this question is dependent upon your age. If you are close
to retirement, then the benefit of the RRSP, outside of reducing income
tax, is minimal. So paying down your debt in this instance is a better solution.
Otherwise, normally it is better to choose the RRSP, due to the benefits
of compound interest over time. A good solution to this dilemma is to put
money into your RRSP, and pay down the mortgage with the tax refund it provides
you.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q16"></A><B>16. Does it make sense to borrow money for my RRSP
contribution?</B><BR>
<BR>
Your RRSP contribution could be the most important investment you make every
year. So even if you haven't got cash on hand now, it pays to borrow with
an RRSP loan. Don't miss the opportunity. The effect of missing a single
$1,000 contribution at age 29 is a $14,974 reduction in the net value of
your RRSP by the time you reach age 69 (based on a 7% annual rate of interest
and assuming you do not carry forward this contribution to a future year).<BR>
<BR>
If you're short of funds, borrowing can be a sensible solution.<BR>
<BR>
The benefits of borrowing $1,000 to contribute - based on 1 year loan:<BR>
<BR>
Borrow $1,000 and contribute proceeds to RRSP - $1,000<BR>
<BR>
Return on RRSP Investment for 1 year at 7% - $70<BR>
<BR>
Repay loan over 12 months at $86 per month - $1,044<BR>
<BR>
Net Gain - $26<BR>
<BR>
Rebate from income tax - $408<BR>
<BR>
NET BENEFIT - $434<BR>
<BR>
As you can see, the net benefit of borrowing to contribute $1,000 to your
RSP is $434.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Note: This example assumes that your RRSP earns 7% interest compounded
annually, you have a marginal tax rate of 40%, the loan interest rate is
8% compounded monthly, the loan is repaid in 12 equal monthly installments,
and that a tax refund is received halfway through the year and reinvested
in an unregistered account at 7% compounded monthly.<BR>
While this example is based on a tax refund that is saved in an unregistered
account, it makes good sense to invest your income tax refund in your RRSP
so it can earn tax-sheltered interest. Or you can use it to pay off your
RRSP loan early with no penalty.<BR>
<BR>
</I><A NAME="q17"></A><B>17. Can I deduct the interest as with any other
investment loan? </B><BR>
<BR>
No.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q18"></A><B>18. Can I withdraw money from my RRSP?</B><BR>
<BR>
Although an RRSP is more effective as a long-term investment, you may withdraw
all or part of it (subject to the terms of the investment you choose), should
something unforeseen happen. Of course, you may pay taxes on the money you
withdraw. But the important part is that your money is available if you
need it. Withholding taxes apply on funds withdrawn from an RRSP except
when funds are transferred from one RRSP to another directly, or when funds
are transferred to approved post-RRSP investments such as <A HREF="rrif.htm">Retirement
Income Options (RIO)</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q19"></A><B>19. What is the over contribution limit?</B><BR>
<BR>
There may be years when you have more available cash for your contribution
than others. If your annual contribution exceeds your contribution limit,
RRSP regulations permit an over-contribution balance totalling not more
than $2,000. This allowance can be used by aggressive investors to maximize
contributions and future investment returns.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q20"></A><B>20. What is a carry forward?</B><BR>
<BR>
If you don't contribute the maximum allowable to your RRSP in any year,
you can carry the unused portion forward indefinitely. Any amounts
&quot;carried forward&quot; should be reflected in the statement provided
by Revenue Canada with your &quot;Notice of Assessment&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="q21"></A><B>21. What happens to my RRSP when I die?</B><BR>
<BR>
The value of your RRSP may be transferred to a surviving spouse on a tax-deferred
basis, if directed by Designation of Beneficiary or by Will. Otherwise,
the value of your RRSP at the date of your death is taxable as income.<BR>
<BR>
Special provisions apply, depending on who is named as beneficiary. You
should consult your District Taxation Office or legal and tax advisors for
more specific information.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>How to calculate your maximum RRSP contribution for 1996</CENTER>
</H2>
<P>The Notice of Assessment that you received from Revenue Canada
after filing your 1995 tax return stated the amount of your 1996 maximum
contribution. If you have not received this notice or need to double check
the amount, simply call your Revenue Canada Local District Taxation Office. The number is available in the blue pages of your phone book.<BR>

<H4>Please note, if you are self-employed, or employed and are not
a member of an employer-funded Registered Pension Plan (RPP) or Deferred
Profit Sharing Plan (DPSP):
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>Your 1996 RRSP contribution limit is 18% of 1995 &quot;Earned
Income&quot; to a maximum of $13,500, plus any unused contribution carried
forward from 1995.
  
  
</UL>
<H4>If you are a member of an employer funded RPP or DPSP:</H4>
<P>Your 1996 RRSP contribution limit is 18% of your 1995 earned
income to a maximum of $13,500 minus the Pension Adjustment reported by
your employer (found in box 52 of your 1995 T4 slip), plus any unused contribution carried forward from 1995. <BR>

<H4>Carry forward</H4>
<UL>If you don't contribute the maximum allowable to your RRSP in
any year, you can carry the unused portion forward indefinitely.
Any amounts &quot;carried forward&quot; should be reflected in the statement
provided by Revenue Canada with your &quot;Notice of Assessment&quot;.
</UL>
<H4>$2,000 lifetime over contribution limit
</H4>
<UL>If after receiving your statement from Revenue Canada, you find
that you've made contributions which are more than your contribution limit,
there is a &quot;safety net&quot;. Over contributions can remain in your
plan without penalty as long as the excess balance is $2,000 or less. Unclaimed
contributions, including excess contributions made after 1990, may be claimed
in a later year.
</UL>
<H4>Lump sum transfers
</H4>
<UL>Lump sum transfers to an RRSP from another RRSP, DPSP or RPP
held elsewhere are permitted if funds are transferred directly between plans.
In addition, a Retiring Allowance may be transferred directly to an RRSP
without income tax deduction at source for years of service up to and including
1995. This information is provided as a guide only. For detailed information
on exact limits for Retiring Allowance transfers, please contact your Revenue
Canada District Taxation Office or your tax advisor. Revenue Canada also

<H4>Withdrawing from your RRSP
</H4>
<UL>Although an RRSP offers potential for long-term tax deferral,
you may withdraw all or part of it (subject to the terms of the investments
you choose), should something unforeseen happen. Of course, you may pay
taxes on the money you withdraw. But the important part is that your money
is available if you need it. Withholding taxes apply on funds withdrawn
from an RRSP except when funds are transferred from one RRSP to another
directly, or when funds are transferred to an approved post-RRSP investments
such as <A HREF="rrif.htm">Retirement Income Options (RIOs)</A>.
</UL>
<H4>Your savings are ready when you retire
</H4>
<UL>You can accumulate retirement savings in your RRSP up to December
31st of the year you turn 69, at which time it must either be converted into an approved form of retirement income such as a <A HREF="rrif.htm">Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) or Annuity</A> or cashed in.

It's important, therefore, that you arrange for the purchase of a RRIF or
an Annuity with your RRSP funds prior to December 31st of the year you turn
69 - otherwise, the full amount of your plan will become taxable as income.

<center><h2>TD Daily Interest Savings RSP</h2></center>
<ul>
<li><p>Flexibility and competitive rates.</p>
<li>Tiered interest rate structure, with rates that increase as your savings build:

<ul><p>A  savings rate is earned on the first $5,000.<br>
A higher rate on the amount in excess of $5,000 up to $25,000.<br>
An even higher rate on the amount in excess of $25,000 up to $60,000.<br>
A competitive rate of interest on the portion that is in excess of $60,000.<br>
</ul></p>
<li><p>Rates that reflect current market trends.</p>
<li><p>Interest calculated on the daily balance and paid  monthly.</p>
<li><p>No minimum deposit or term commitment.</p>
<li><p>Flexibility of knowing your money is available when you need it.</p>
<li>You can also choose between passbook and statement to keep track of your records.
</ul>

<p>
<b><h3>Investment tip to keep in mind</h3></b></p>
<ul>
If you have a number of savings account RRSPs at various financial institutions including one or more TD Bank branches, you should consider consolidating them into one TD Daily Interest Savings RSP.  TD's competitive tiered rate structure pays a higher rate of interest on a higher balance.  <br>Keep in mind RRSP contributions made by your spouse to a plan in your name cannot be consolidated in a TD RSP with contributions made by you.  <br>As well, vested pension plan funds transferred to an RRSP which must be administered as "locked-in" funds to a specific age, cannot be consolidated with other RRSP contributions.

<H1>1996 RRSP  Contribution Deadline
 - <BR>March 1, 1997</H1>
<H2>Have you made your 1996 RRSP contribution yet? At TD, we can help make it easier</H2>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+1><I> The March 1 deadline for making your 1996 RRSP contribution will be here before you know it. Whether you're facing a last minute scramble to put together your annual contribution or you've faithfully made regular contributions throughout the year and only want to 'top up' your plan, at TD, we're here to help make it easier</I></font><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*">.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">If</font> you're just starting to think about your 1996 RRSP contribution, you're not alone. Despite the best of intentions, millions of Canadians still wait until the last minute to contribute to their RRSPs.
<P>
 At TD, we know how stressful the last minute rush to beat the contribution deadline can be. But, like you, we also know how important it is to reduce your taxes now while saving for your retirement. We're here to help make it easier with a wide range of options and services.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Contributions in person or by phone</h2></font>
 If you have a few minutes, simply drop by any TD branch. You'll find a knowledgeable RRSP Specialist who can answer any questions you might have and assist you with your retirement savings plan.
<P>
 If you can't do it in person, simply pick up the phone. You can make your RRSP contribution by calling 1-800-668-RRSP (7777) at any time of the day or night, seven days a week. You can make contributions to your TD Daily Interest Savings RSP or purchase a new TD GIC RSP without ever leaving your home or office. 

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>RRSP loans at prime</h2></font>
 Even if you don't have the cash on hand now, it can pay to borrow all or part of the amount you need to make your maximum contribution. For example, if you borrow $1,000 to invest in your RRSP which earns five per cent interest, at the end of a year, you will have $1,050 in your RRSP. It will cost you $1,033 to repay the loan at six per cent interest with equal monthly payments over the same 12 months, so you are already $17 ahead. Plus, you receive an income tax rebate of $400, assuming your marginal tax rate is 40 per cent. 
<P>
Based on the interest rates and marginal tax rate assumed above, you would save a total of $417 by borrowing the $1,000 for your RRSP and paying the loan back over the year.
<P>
We can quickly and easily arrange a TD Pre-Approved RRSP loan, at our prime rate. Simply call any TD branch. 

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Guaranteed to grow</h2></font>
 Our TD GIC RSP and our TD Daily Interest Savings RSP are two plans that are guaranteed to grow. Your contribution earns interest from the day it's invested in a TD Daily Interest Savings RSP. Our TD GIC RSP lets you take advantage of higher interest rates to build your retirement savings. During RRSP season, we offer several variations on standard GICs so that you have the widest possible choice of investment options. These are described in more detail under <A HREF="#SpecGICs">"Special TD GICs"</a>.

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Automatic withdrawals </h2></font>
 We can help ensure that you don't run into deadline pressure again with our TD Personal Transfer Service<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*">, a simple way to ensure regular contributions to your TD RRSP. Decide how much you want to contribute to your RRSP and how often - every week, bi-weekly or monthly. With TD Personal Transfer Service, we'll automatically make withdrawals from the TD account of your choice and transfer the money into your TD Daily Interest Savings RSP. You'll earn interest on your RRSP contribution from the day you make it.
<P>
You'll enjoy the convenience even more come February when you don't have to scramble to meet the annual RRSP contribution deadline.

	<TD>It's never too late to invest in an RRSP. As long as you have qualified earned income or unused contributions you can carry forward, you can contribute to an RRSP until Dec. 31 of the year in which you turn 69. Even if you're retired, you may have savings left over after expenses. Putting these into an RRSP can reduce taxes and generate a welcome tax refund.<P>

<H1>Helpful hints</h1>
<A NAME="CalcRRSP">
<H2> How to calculate your 1996 maximum RRSP contribution limit</H2>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">T</font>he more you contribute to your RRSP, the more you can save in taxes this year. It's as simple as that. So it's always a good idea to make the maximum contribution to your RRSP. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>The 1996 contribution limit</h2></font>
 The 1996 maximum RRSP contribution is $13,500. To determine your maximum RRSP contribution limit:
<ul>
  <li>calculate your earned income for 1995
  <li>multiply it by 18%
  <li>subtract any Pension Adjustment as shown on your T4 slips
</ul>
 You may contribute that amount to a maximum of $13,500 for 1996. The maximum contribution limit for 1997 is also $13,500.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Check your Notice of Assessment</h2></font>
 It's also a good idea to check your Notice of Assessment from Revenue Canada to confirm your calculations and determine if you have any unused contribution room from previous years. If you do, and you have extra money, you can still take advantage of the tax deductible contribution. The unused portion of your contribution room can be carried forward indefinitely. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>If you're turning 69, 70 or 71 in 1997</h2></font>
 The March 6, 1996 Federal Budget lowered the age limit for converting RRSPs to a qualified retirement income from 71 to 69, effective January 1, 1997. If you're turning 69, 70 or 71 next year, you must collapse your RRSPs by December 31,1997.

	<TD BGCOLOR="#FFCC99">When investing in GICs, a good way to diversify is by staggering the maturity dates. For example, rather than buying one TD GIC RSP for $5,000, buy five TD GIC RSPs valued at $1,000 each with maturity dates staggered a year apart. By selecting a variety of terms, you can obtain a good average rate of return and some money will become available every year to reinvest at new rates.<P>

<H1>Introducing TD GIC PLUS</h1>
<A NAME="Growth">
<H2>Growth Without the Risk</h2>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">If</font> you like the returns the stock market can offer but worry about the safety of your investments, TD GIC PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> could be your ideal investment vehicle.
<P>
 With TD GIC PLUS, you reap the rewards when the stock market goes up and your investment is exposed to absolutely no risk if the market goes down. Your principal is protected, no matter how the market performs. 
<P>
 As with all TD GICs, TD GIC PLUS offers a guaranteed annual rate of interest for the full term you select - either three or five years. If the stock market, based on the TSE 100 Index&#134;, generates greater returns than the guaranteed interest rate, you're paid the greater amount. It's a no-risk way to enjoy the higher returns that longer term investments in the stock market have historically provided.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Here's how it works</h2></font>
 Suppose you purchase a $1,000 TD GIC PLUS in December, 1996. Assume the guaranteed interest rate is 3% for a five-year term and the Opening Index Level for the TSE 100 Index is 300. 
<P>
 Your investment matures in December, 2001. Assume the Closing Index Level is 495, representing a total increase of 65% or an annualized return of 10.54%. Because that is greater than the guaranteed rate of 3%, your return will be based on the growth in the TSE 100 Index. On your original investment of $1,000, your return would be an annualized rate of 10.54%, or $650! The value of your TD GIC PLUS at maturity would be $1,650.
<P>
 The Opening Index Level is established at the close of business, two business days after you purchase your investment. The Closing Index Level is established at the end of the three- or five-year term of your TD GIC Plus. We average levels at monthly intervals during the final year of the term to protect you from any sharp declines in the market right before your investment matures.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2> Low minimum investment</h2></font>
 You can take advantage of TD GIC PLUS even if you have only limited funds to invest. The minimum investment is just $500 for registered investments and $1,000 for non-registered investments. 
<P>
 While TD GIC PLUS makes an excellent investment for your RRSP, it can be purchased any time of the year, not just during the RRSP season. If you would like more information about this innovative new investment option, drop by any TD Bank branch or call us at... <P>

Each year thereafter, you are required to repay 1/15 of the total amount you withdrew until the full amount is repaid to your RRSP.<P>

<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+1><I>L'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance du 1<sup>er</sup> mars pour verser votre cotisation REER de 1996 va arriver plus vite que vous ne le pensez ! Que vous tentiez de rassembler le montant &agrave; la derni&egrave;re minute ou que vous ayez cotis&eacute; r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement tout au long de l'ann&eacute;e et vouliez compl&eacute;ter votre r&eacute;gime- &agrave; la Banque TD, nous sommes l&agrave; pour vous faciliter la t&acirc;che<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*">.</i></font>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">Si</font> vous commencez tout juste &agrave; y penser, sachez que vous &ecirc;tes en bonne compagnie. Malgr&eacute; les meilleures intentions, des millions de contribuables attendent encore &agrave; la derni&egrave;re minute pour cotiser &agrave; leur REER.
<P>
 &Agrave; la Banque TD, nous savons combien cette course contre la montre peut &ecirc;tre stressante. Mais nous savons aussi, tout comme vous, &agrave; quel point il est important de r&eacute;duire votre fardeau fiscal actuel tout en &eacute;pargnant pour votre retraite. Nous sommes l&agrave; pour vous faciliter la t&acirc;che gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une vaste gamme d'options et de services.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Cotisez en personne ou par t&eacute;l&eacute;phone</h2></font>
 Si vous avez quelques minutes, passez &agrave; une succursale TD. Vous y trouverez un sp&eacute;cialiste comp&eacute;tent en mati&egrave;re de REER qui r&eacute;pondra &agrave; toutes vos questions et vous aidera &agrave; planifier votre &eacute;pargne-retraite.
<P>
 Si vous n'avez pas le temps de passer nous voir, vous pouvez aussi nous appeler! Il suffit de composer le 1 800 387-1500, 24 heures sur 24, sept jours sur sept, pour cotiser &agrave; votre RER Compte d'&eacute;pargne &agrave; int&eacute;r&ecirc;t quotidien TD ou pour ouvrir un RER CPG TD- sans quitter votre domicile ou votre bureau.

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Pr&ecirc;ts REER au taux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel</h2></font>
 M&ecirc;me si vous n'avez pas l'argent en main, il peut &ecirc;tre avantageux d'emprunter la totalit&eacute; ou une partie du montant dont vous avez besoin pour verser votre cotisation maximum. Par exemple, si vous empruntez 1 000 $ pour investir dans un REER qui vous rapporte 5 % d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, vous aurez 1 050 $ dans votre REER &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e. Il vous en aura co&ucirc;t&eacute; 1 033 $ pour rembourser le pr&ecirc;t &agrave; un taux de six pour cent- soit douze paiements mensuels &eacute;gaux effectu&eacute;s la m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e- et vous aurez un surplus de 17 $. De plus, vous aurez profit&eacute; d'une &eacute;conomie d'imp&ocirc;t de 400 $, sur la base d'un taux marginal d'imposition de 40 pour cent. Ainsi, vous aurez &eacute;pargn&eacute; 417 $ au total en empruntant 1 000 $ pour votre REER et en remboursant le pr&ecirc;t au cours de l'ann&eacute;e.
<P>
 Il est facile d'obtenir rapidement un pr&ecirc;t RER TD pr&eacute;approuv&eacute; &agrave; notre taux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel. Il vous suffit d'appeler &agrave; une succursale TD.

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Croissance garantie</h2></font>
 Notre RER CPG TD et notre RER Compte d'&eacute;pargne &agrave; int&eacute;r&ecirc;t quotidien TD sont deux r&eacute;gimes &agrave; croissance garantie. Dans le cas d'un RER Compte d'&eacute;pargne &agrave; int&eacute;r&ecirc;t quotidien TD, votre cotisation produit des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &agrave; partir du jour o&ugrave; elle est vers&eacute;e &agrave; votre r&eacute;gime. Quant au RER CPG TD, il vous offre des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s pour accumuler votre &eacute;pargne-retraite. Durant la saison des REER, nous vous offrons plusieurs variantes des CPG standard, ce qui vous donne acc&egrave;s au plus grand choix possible de placements. <A HREF="#SpecialGICs">Voyez tous les d&eacute;tails</a>.

<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Retraits automatiques</h2></font>
 Nous pouvons vous aider &agrave; &eacute;viter la pression de derni&egrave;re minute gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre Service de virements personnels* TD, un moyen simple de verser des cotisations r&eacute;guli&egrave;res &agrave; votre REER TD. Il vous suffit d'&eacute;tablir combien vous voulez verser &agrave; votre REER et &agrave; quelle fr&eacute;quence- chaque semaine, toutes les deux semaines ou chaque mois. Avec le Service de virements personnels TD, nous effectuons automatiquement le retrait du compte TD de votre choix et nous virons les fonds &agrave; votre RER Compte d'&eacute;pargne &agrave; int&eacute;r&ecirc;t quotidien TD. Vous obtenez de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sur votre cotisation REER &agrave; partir du jour o&ugrave; vous la versez.

 Vous trouverez cette option bien pratique en f&eacute;vrier : plus de course de derni&egrave;re minute pour verser votre cotisation REER &agrave; temps !<P>

<H1>Conseils pratiques</h1>
<A NAME="CalcRRSP">
<H2> Comment calculer votre plafond de cotisation REER pour 1996</H2>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">P</font>lus vous cotisez &agrave; votre REER, plus vous &eacute;conomisez d'imp&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e. C'est aussi simple que &ccedil;a. Alors, c'est toujours une bonne id&eacute;e de cotiser le maximum &agrave; votre REER.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Le plafond de cotisation pour 1996</h2></font>
 La cotisation REER maximum pour 1996 est de 13 500 $. Pour d&eacute;terminer votre plafond de cotisation, proc&eacute;dez comme suit :
<ul>
  <li>prenez votre revenu gagn&eacute; en 1995
  <li>multipliez-le par 18 %
  <li>soustrayez le facteur d'&eacute;quivalence tel qu'il appara&icirc;t sur vos relev&eacute;s T4
</ul>
 Voil&agrave; le montant que vous pouvez verser en 1996 jusqu'&agrave; concurrence de 13 500 $. Le plafond restera &agrave; 13 500 $ pour 1997.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>V&eacute;rifiez votre avis de cotisation</h2></font>
 Il serait opportun aussi de v&eacute;rifier l'avis de cotisation &eacute;mis par Revenu Canada pour confirmer vos calculs et voir si vous avez des cotisations inutilis&eacute;es d'ann&eacute;es pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes. Dans ce cas, et si vous avez de l'argent disponible, vous pouvez encore profiter de la d&eacute;duction d'imp&ocirc;t. La portion inutilis&eacute;e d'une cotisation peut &ecirc;tre report&eacute;e ind&eacute;finiment.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Si vous atteignez l'&acirc;ge de 69, 70 ou 71 ans en 1997</h2></font>
 Le budget f&eacute;d&eacute;ral du 6 mars 1996 annon&ccedil;ait que l'&acirc;ge limite pour convertir un REER &agrave; un revenu de retraite admissible passerait de 71 &agrave; 69 ans &agrave; compter du 1er janvier 1997. Si vous atteignez l'&acirc;ge de 69, 70 ou 71 ans l'an prochain, vous devrez fermer votre ou vos REER au plus tard le 31 d&eacute;cembre 1997.

	<TD>Lorsque vous placez dans des CPG, vous pouvez diversifier vos placements en alternant les dates d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.

En choisissant une vari&eacute;t&eacute; de termes, vous pouvez obtenir un bon taux de rendement moyen, sans compter qu'une partie de vos fonds sera disponible chaque ann&eacute;e pour &ecirc;tre r&eacute;investie &agrave; de nouveaux taux.<P>

<H1>Voici l'option TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"></h1>
<A NAME="Growth">
<H2> De la croissance sans risque</H2>
<FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+4 FACE="ARIAL">Si</font> vous aimez les rendements qu'offre le march&eacute; boursier mais souhaitez maintenir des placements s&ucirc;rs, le certificat TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> pourrait s'av&eacute;rer le v&eacute;hicule de placement id&eacute;al pour vous.
<P>
 Avec le TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*">, vous profitez des effets d'un march&eacute; boursier &agrave; la hausse sans exposer votre placement &agrave; un risque en cas de baisse du march&eacute;. Votre capital est prot&eacute;g&eacute;, quelle que soit la performance du march&eacute;.
<P>
 Tout comme les autres CPG TD, le TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> offre un taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t annuel garanti pour le terme s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;, soit trois ou cinq ans. Si le march&eacute; boursier, selon l'indice TSE 100&#134;, produit de meilleurs rendements que le taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t garanti, vous recevrez ce montant plus &eacute;lev&eacute;. C'est un moyen sans risque de profiter de rendements sup&eacute;rieurs &agrave; ceux enregistr&eacute;s traditionnellement par les placements &agrave; plus long terme sur le march&eacute; boursier.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Voici comment &ccedil;a fonctionne</h2></font>
 Supposons que vous achetiez un placement TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> de 1 000 $ en d&eacute;cembre 1996. Supposons aussi que le taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t garanti est de 3 % pour un terme de cinq ans et que l'indice d'ouverture duTSE 100 soit de 300.
<P>
 Quand votre placement arrivera &agrave; &eacute;ch&eacute;ance en d&eacute;cembre 2001, et si on suppose que l'indice de cl&ocirc;ture est de 495, vos fonds auront augment&eacute; de 65 % au total, soit un rendement annualis&eacute; de 10,54 %. Comme ce rendement du TSE 100 est sup&eacute;rieur au taux garanti de 3 %, c'est donc celui qui sera retenu pour le calcul de votre rendement. Ainsi, sur votre placement de 1000 $ au d&eacute;part, vous aurez obtenu un rendement annualis&eacute; de 10,54 % ou un profit de 650 $ ! La valeur de votre TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> sera donc de 1 650 $ &agrave; &eacute;ch&eacute;ance.
<P>
 L'indice d'ouverture est &eacute;tabli &agrave; la fermeture des bureaux, deux jours ouvrables apr&egrave;s l'achat de votre placement. L'indice de fermeture est &eacute;tabli &agrave; la fin du terme de trois ou cinq ans de votre TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*">. Nous calculons la moyenne &agrave; intervalles mensuels durant la derni&egrave;re ann&eacute;e du terme pour vous prot&eacute;ger contre une chute du march&eacute; qui pourrait survenir juste avant l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de votre placement.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#336600"><H2>Placements minimums peu &eacute;lev&eacute;s</h2></font>
 Vous pouvez profiter d'un TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> m&ecirc;me si vous avez tr&egrave;s peu d'argent &agrave; placer. Il suffit de 500 $ pour effectuer un placement enregistr&eacute; et de 1 000 $ pour un placement non enregistr&eacute;.
<P>
 Bien que le TD CPG PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*"> constitue un excellent placement pour votre REER, vous pouvez en acheter un en tout temps, pas seulement durant la saison des REER.

<H2>TD GIC PLUS<IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/CR.GIF" ALT="*" ALIGN="top"></H2>

Lets you benefit from stock market upturns and protects you from
any downturns.  You receive a guaranteed annual rate of interest
for a full 3 or 5 year term, and can earn a bonus interest payment
based on the performance of the TSE 100 Index<A HREF="#TSE"><sup>&#134;</sup></a>. If the
TSE 100 Index goes up during the term of your investment, you
can benefit from this increase.  If on the other hand, it goes
down, you receive the guaranteed interest payment.  In other words,
with TD GIC PLUS you are protected no matter which way the market
goes.
<P>
<H3>6 Reasons to Invest in TD GIC PLUS</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Safety of Principal.
<LI>Guaranteed Interest Plus Potential for More.
<LI> Security of a Longer Term Investment.
<LI>Investment Flexibility.
<LI> Choice of Purchase Dates and Terms.
	<UL>TD GIC PLUS can be purchased at any time during the year, not just RRSP season.  And, depending on your investment requirements,
you can choose the term that best suits your needs -- either 3
or 5 years.</ul>
<LI>Low Minimum Investment Required.
	<UL>The minimum is just $500 for registered investments, and $1,000 for non-registered investments.</ul>
</ol>
<P>

<H3>Here's an example of potential earnings available</H3>

Let's say you purchased a $1,000 TD GIC PLUS on January 2, 1997.
 Suppose at that time the guaranteed interest rate was 2.25%,
the term you selected was 5 years and the Opening Index Level
for the TSE 100 was 359.47.  By the time your investment matures,
in January, 2002, the Closing Index Level is 580, which represents
a  total increase of 61%, or an annualized return of 10.0%.  Since
this 10.0% is greater than the guaranteed interest rate of 2.25%,
your return will be based on the growth in the TSE 100.

<P>Budgeting is an essential life skill.  With an overall picture of exactly
where money comes from and where it goes, you control your finances.  

<P>Here, you'll find model budgets designed to reflect the day-to-day financial needs you may have at various stages of life.  Check the profiles below for the best fit.

<P><B><A HREF="../student/stbud.html">Student Essentials</A></B>.  As a student
you have relatively simple financial needs. But with plenty of fixed expenses it can be tough to keep a balanced budget every month. Your main budgeting goal might be to
put money worries aside so you can concentrate on studies.  

<P><B><A HREF="start.html">Starting Out</A></B>.  Whether you're single or
in a relationship, choices are plentiful now and
responsibilities are mostly manageable.  Still, financial independence and saving
for a home are goals worth working toward and developing  a solid budgeting approach can definitely help you get there sooner.

<P><B><A HREF="nest.html">The Nest Egg Family</A></B>.  This can be a rollercoaster
stage of life:  great highs with the thrills of raising a family, but some dips when facing the challenge
of balancing income and expenses.  One huge expense can be managing a mortgage.  Stir in
children, cars, and vacation plans and you can appreciate how budgeting can add stability
to finances.

<P><B><A HREF="retire.html">Retirement Planning</A></B>.  Many people enjoy their
best years now.  Expenses are down and income is up or steady.  Since it's not far until
retirement, budgeting can help you develop a system for living comfortably on a
fixed income.  It also helps free up money today, to invest for the future.

<H2>Student Budget Planner</H2>

<P>Student life is usually light on cash, but heavy on expenses. 
Some expenses you just can't avoid, like tuition fees, books, and
rent.  Some get a lower priority like entertainment, clothes and
vacations.  Students who think "budget control" seem to get more
out of life.

<P>Then there's the problem of hanging on to money.  Even when
you've got a job, you've got to handle cash well to have money
when you need it ... like when the bills do turn up.  There are
ways to make every penny go further.  Start with a budget, so you
know where to find those pennies.

<P>Working with a budget is one of those life skills it's great
to be able to count on.  The student budget breakdown you should
<A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/pers/student/budget.pdf">download</A>
from this site can help you organize your income and expenses. (Please note the budget form is in Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) format (.pdf) so you will need Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) to read it. If you do not have Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM), you can <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/main.html">download it</A> from
from Adobe Systems Incorporated.)

<P>You can then use the Student Budget Calculator below to work out how you might reach the savings target you set for yourself.  You can juggle the figures as often as you need!

<P>It will help you get comfortable with managing  your income
and day-to-day expenses.  It'll help you get through school, and
it's also a skill you can use your whole life.

<P>When you're establishing a household, you face major expenses.  On the
other hand, your income is building too. Like most people, you probably want a home of your own.  Your down payment is
accumulated a dollar at a time.  One of the best ways to free those dollars up is by keeping track of
your finances through a budgeting process.

<P>The budget planner you can <A HREF="start.pdf">download</A> from this site can help you organize your income and expenses. (Please note the budget form is in Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) format (.pdf) so you will need Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) to read it. If you do not have Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM), you can <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/main.html">download it</A> from
from Adobe Systems Incorporated.)

<P>Use the calculator below to evaluate ways to better achieve your savings targets.

<P>Financially speaking, this can be a challenging time.  Clothes,
bikes, summer camp ... it all adds up.  Plus, many families' financial goal is to own a
home of their own.

<P>A mortgage is probably the largest debt you'll ever have, but your home can also
become the largest asset you own.  As long as you can carry it
comfortably, it helps you in many ways.  It can be a nest egg that you build equity
in over time.

<P>You can also build your financial security in other ways with regular RRSP contributions and
automatic savings deductions to help you finance your children's
college or university education.

<P>For many people, these are prime financial years.  Time to relax and enjoy
life.  Your home may be paid for, or nearly so.  Debts are low, and your income is
stable or even rising.

<P>You're able to afford the time for travel and hobbies.  Maybe
pursue an educational interest that may have been dropped when you were busy focusing on your family and building your career.


<P>Even now, being able to set a budget and stick to it is a useful skill to develop. It can be especially helpful in preparing for retirement, when you will be managing expenses within a fixed budget.

<H2><A NAME="q1">What is a mutual fund?</A> </H2>

<P><B>A</B> mutual fund is an investment that pools money from many individuals and invests it according to stated objectives. Professional managers make investment decisions on behalf of fund investors, buying and selling securities such as money market instruments, bonds and stocks. When you purchase units of a mutual fund, you become a part owner of all the securities held by that fund.
 

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q2">Why do people buy mutual funds?</A></H2> 

<P><B>F</B>or the average investor, mutual funds are a convenient and affordable way of gaining access to investments that would otherwise be available only to large institutions or the wealthy. Because they typically hold 50 to 100 different securities, mutual funds offer a degree of diversification that would be difficult to achieve on your own. These investments are selected by experienced professionals who devote themselves exclusively to tracking the markets, analyzing securities and implementing a consistent investment strategy.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q3">What types of funds are available?</A></H2> 

<P><B>M</B>utual fund investors can choose funds that invest in money market instruments, bonds or stocks, both domestic and international. While there are hundreds of choices, each mutual fund will fall into one of the three main asset classes: money market for safety, bonds and mortgages for income or stocks for growth.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q4">Who should buy mutual funds?</A></H2> 

<P><B>M</B>utual funds have a place in almost any portfolio. They offer a range of investment objectives that can satisfy a variety of investment needs from establishing a basic emergency reserve to saving for a vacation, a down payment on a house, education or retirement. Depending on your personal circumstances and tolerance for risk, there is likely a mutual fund or combination of funds that is right for you.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q5">How much do I need to start?</A></H2> 

<P><B>M</B>inimum initial investments are typically $500 to $5,000 for a regular investment account and $100 to $500 for RRSP accounts. For Green Line Mutual Funds, the minimum initial investment is $2,000 for a regular investment account and $100 for an RRSP account. The minimum subsequent investment is $100 for both types of accounts. 

<P>These minimum amounts are waived if you enrol in a regular investing program, such as TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan. Under the Plan, you invest a minimum of $25 per Fund at regular intervals up to a minimum of $2,000 per Fund. The amount you select is automatically deducted from your bank account and invested in your mutual fund.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q6">Where can I buy mutual funds?</A></H2> 

<P><B>M</B>utual funds are sold through registered representatives in banks, trust companies, stockbrokers, discount brokers, financial planners and insurance companies in Canada.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q7">What is the net asset value per unit?</A></H2>

<P> <B>T</B>he price you pay for a unit or receive when you sell a unit is called the "net asset value per unit." The net asset value per unit is determined at the end of each business day by taking the closing market value of all the securities in the portfolio minus the fund's liabilities and dividing this figure by the total number of units outstanding. Except for money market funds, which are managed to maintain a fixed unit price, the net asset value of a mutual fund will fluctuate daily according to changes in the value of the individual securities.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q8">What is a "load"?</A></H2>

<P><B>A</B> load is a sales commission charged on mutual funds that are distributed through stockbrokers or financial planners. A front-end load is charged when you purchase your units, while a back-end load is charged when you sell your units. Front-end loads are often negotiable and average around 4%. Back-end loads start around 6% and decline to zero if you hold your units for a number of years, usually six or seven. No-load funds are sold directly to investors and no sales commissions are charged. These funds are typically sponsored by banks and trust companies. 

<P>The load structure is determined by the method of distribution and does not reflect the level of service you receive with your investment. You will get the same service buying directly from the fund company as you would if you purchased your fund through an agent.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q9">What is the management fee?</A></H2> 

<P><B>T</B>his is a fee that is paid to the fund manager out of fund assets for managing the portfolio and providing administrative services.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q10">What is a prospectus?</A></H2> 

<P><B>A</B> prospectus is a legal document that outlines important information about a fund, such as management fees and sales charges, the fund manager, investment objectives and strategies, tax considerations, how the fund operates and risk factors. You should read the prospectus before investing to get the facts you need to make an informed investment decision.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q11">What kind of risk is involved with mutual funds?</A></H2> 

<P><B>I</B>n investing, the element of risk can vary substantially. A general rule of thumb is that the higher the potential return, the higher the risk. This is known as the "risk/return trade-off." In mutual fund investing, volatility (the degree to which a fund fluctuates in price) and return will depend on market trends, the securities held by the fund and the investment strategy employed by the manager. In general, a fund that aims to achieve a high level of growth will be more volatile than one whose objective is to preserve the original capital. On the other hand, a growth fund will likely earn a higher return over the long term than a money market fund.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q12">How do I minimize risk?</A></H2> 

<P><B>A</B> basic principle of sound investing is to diversify your portfolio over a range of investments. Diversification reduces risk and enhances the potential for growth by spreading investments among the three main asset classes: money market for safety, bonds and mortgages for income and stocks for growth. Because investment markets tend to move independently of one another, positive performance in one asset class can help offset negative performance in another, reducing volatility in the long-term.

<P>TD's Wealth Allocation Model is an easy-to-use guide that can help you select the best mix of investments according to your personal circumstances and tolerance for risk. It's available free of charge at this web site, at any TD branch or by calling our Toll-Free Hotline at 1-800-268-8166.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q13">How do I compare different funds?
</A></H2>

<P><B>W</B>hile past performance is no guarantee of future growth, annualized returns are often used to compare funds and the quality of their management. Most major daily newspapers publish mutual fund performance tables each month for  periods ranging from one month to ten years or more.

<P>Comparing a fund with its peers is a good way to evaluate performance. Mutual fund tables make it easy by grouping similar funds together and including averages for each category. The ability to consistently outperform its peers is one sign of a good-quality fund. Conversely, you should avoid funds that have consistently returned below-average results over three or more years.

<P>To make a fair comparison, it is important to recognize that all funds in one category are not the same. For example, some Canadian equity funds are managed conservatively, while others aggressively pursue growth. One fund manager may emphasize value, while another may actively trade positions at different times in the market cycle. If in doubt, find out from the fund company or the prospectus what the fund's investment objectives are and how the fund is managed. While some performance numbers can be very attractive, you may discover that the fund's investments are too risky for you.

<P>The same holds true for funds in different categories. Money market funds will generally have lower returns than growth funds, but there is minimal risk to your investment.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q14">Are mutual funds insured?</A></H2> 

<P><B>S</B>ince mutual funds qualify as securities and not deposits, they are neither guaranteed nor insured. However, fund managers and the funds themselves operate under strict securities regulations. For example, mutual funds are owned by the unitholders and are separate legal entities from the companies that operate them. Securities legislation also requires that mutual fund assets be held by a custodian.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q15">What about taxes?
</A></H2> 

<P><B>M</B>utual fund units held in RRSPs are exempt from tax. For units held in non-registered accounts, you must include in your taxable income any net income and net taxable gains paid to you each year by your mutual fund, whether these amounts are received in cash or reinvested in additional units. You may also realize a taxable capital gain or allowable taxable loss upon the sale of your units.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q16">What is dollar-cost averaging?</A></H2> 

<P><B>D</B>ollar-cost averaging is a simple strategy that builds wealth while averaging out the cost of your units. By investing a set amount at regular intervals, you automatically buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. While this technique doesn't guarantee a profit or protect against a loss, it usually results in a lower average unit cost over time. 

<P>To help you take advantage of dollar-cost averaging, most mutual fund companies offer regular investing programs or pre-authorized purchase plans. Under these plans, the amount you select is automatically deducted from your bank account at regular intervals and invested in the fund.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q17">What is foreign content?</A></H2>

<P><B>R</B>evenue Canada permits Canadians to invest 20% of the book value (original cost) of each RRSP account in eligible securities and property situated outside of Canada. Revenue Canada charges a penalty of 1% per month of the book value on amounts exceeding your allowable limit. The penalty is charged by the institution with which you hold the RRSP and is payable to Revenue Canada.

<P>Foreign content generally includes shares of foreign corporations and bonds, debentures and mortgages issued by foreign governments, corporations or individuals. Rather than holding foreign investments directly, many investors prefer the convenience of mutual funds. Not only do global mutual funds qualify as foreign content, but domestic mutual funds that are 100% RRSP-eligible may also invest up to 20% of their assets in foreign investments. By carefully selecting their funds, investors can therefore increase foreign exposure without exceeding the foreign content limit. 

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="q18">How do I get started?</A></H2>

<P><B>S</B>ince everyone has different needs and goals, making a wise choice depends on understanding where you are now and where you hope to be tomorrow. So before you invest in a mutual fund, you should ask yourself three basic questions:

<UL>
<LI>What financial goal am I trying to achieve?
<LI>How long do I have to reach this goal?
<LI>How much risk can I tolerate along the way?
</UL>

<P>Building a portfolio according to your personal circumstances and investing goals is easy with our on-line Wealth Allocation Model. Take a few moments to answer these questions and watch the Wealth Allocation Model create a customized portfolio for you. The Wealth Allocation Model is also available from any TD branch or by calling the Toll-Free Hotline at 1-800-268-8166.

<H2>Will you have <i>enough</I> to retire?</H2>

<P>Retirement ranks as a primary financial goal for almost every Canadian.  Some of us look

forward to it, some of dread it - but few of us are adequately prepared.  To avoid the very real

possibility that you may outlive your money, it makes sense to start planning now.



<P>Experts estimate that you will need 60% to 80% of pre-retirement income to maintain your

current standard of living after you stop working.  Those with few debts will fall in the low

range; those with expensive hobbies or travel plans may need much more.



<P>Although some form of government benefits will likely be available, we can no longer count

on the government to support us in retirement.   If you have a company pension plan, don't

assume that it will cover all of your retirement needs, either.  If you have changed jobs frequently

or have been out of the workforce during your career, you may not receive a full pension at

retirement.  For most Canadians, roughly half of their retirement income will have to come from

personal savings.



<h3>How Much Will You Need?</h3>

Savings is a lot easier when you know exactly how much you need to set aside to reach your

goal. <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/calc/rrspcalc.html">Complete the

following worksheet to see how much you will need to save.</a>  If you

require assistance completing the worksheet, please contact an Investment Specialist at your TD

Branch or call your regional <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM-rsplmt.html#hot"> Toll-Free Investment

Hotline.</a>



<h3>Reach Your Goal</h3>

An effective strategy for reaching your annual retirement savings goal is to invest smaller

amounts on a regular basis.  Simply divide the annual amount into monthly or weekly

investments and enroll in TD's<font size=-1>+</font size> Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan.  Your

investment will be automatically deducted from your bank account you designate and invested in

your choice of 31 Green Line No-Load Mutual Funds.  You can change the amount, Fund and

frequency of purchase at any time.



<P>With a Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, your money gets working for you sooner, and you

don't have to worry about finding a lump sum near the deadline.  For more information, visit your

TD Branch or call your regional <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM-rsplmt.html#hot">Toll-Free Investment

Hotline.</a>



<P>If you haven't started preparing for retirement, don't put it off any longer.  Setting up a plan

and sticking to it may require some discipline, but that's a small price to pay for making sure

don't outlive your money.

<P>
<B>Economic Outlook</B> 
<BR>August data for retail sales and industrial production indicated modest gains in economic activity in the United States during the summer. The gradual lessening of price pressures provides some leeway for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to ease short-term rates. However, given the recent gains in both retail sales and industrial production, and the Federal Reserve&iacute;s own view that economic activity is expanding, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is unlikely to change its stance on monetary policy at its meeting on September 26.
<P>
The revival of U.S. motor vehicle sales and production bodes well for Canada's automotive manufacturing sector. With its heavy reliance on exports to the U.S., Canada's economic activity is expected to pick up in late 1995. A small rebound in Canadian housing starts and rising sales of existing homes in August are also encouraging. Despite the stronger housing data, Canada's composite leading indicator declined in August for the fourth consecutive month. However, the size of the decline was smaller than during the May to July period.
Inflation continues to be under control. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.1% in August. The year-over-year change edged up to 2.7%, but remains within the Bank of Canada's target range. 


<P>
<B>Interest Rates</B>
<BR>Slow growth and low inflation indicate a move toward lower interest rates in Canada, but such a move is unlikely amid the pre-referendum financial market turbulence. Canadian money markets and the dollar are starting to experience some of the expected volatility as concerns mount over the Quebec referendum. Until the referendum is over, the Bank of Canada will focus on supporting the dollar and moderating the strong upward pressure on short-term yields without triggering a recession. In contrast, U.S. short-term rates remain relatively stable ahead of the September 26 FOMC meeting.

<H2>Understanding Performance</H2>



<H3>Rate of return and yield are  two common measures of mutual fund performance. But by

themselves, they say little about your investment.<BR>



<I>Here is what to look for when evaluating your funds.</I></H3>



<UL>

     <LI><A HREF="#q1">Long-term performance</A>

     <LI><A HREF="#q8">How Green Line Funds Rank</A>

</UL>



<P><B>U</B>nit values and returns are two of the most easily accessible statistics available

about a fund. These figures are published regularly in major daily newspapers, are featured in

advertising and, for Green Line Funds, are available here at <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/perfor/">Fund Performance</A> as well as from

your TD Branch, regional Hotline and TeleAccess. Returns are quoted for periods ranging from

one month to ten years. Although they are based on past results and are not an indicator of future

performance, returns generally reflect the quality of management and can provide some useful

insights for investors.

<HR>



<A NAME="q1"><H3>Long-term performance -</H3></A>

<P><B>S</B>teady performance over the long term means that the fund manager is able to

deliver consistent performance under most market conditions. The ability to minimize losses in

down markets is more important to long-term success than being a high flyer in bull markets. For

this reason, be sceptical of funds with erratic long-term records because it may take years to

match average returns. On the other hand, don't be unduly influenced by low returns over

short-term periods of less than one year. Any number of factors could affect your investment.

More meaningful is performance over a full market cycle - at least five years.



<HR>

<A NAME="q2"><H3>Comparing similar funds -</H3></A>

<P><B>F</B>or a better idea of relative performance, compare a fund with its peers. Mutual

fund tables group similar funds together and include averages for each category. The ability to

consistently outperform its peers is one sign of a good-quality fund. 



<P><B>T</B>o make a fair comparison, it is important to recognize that all funds in one

category are not the same. For example, some Canadian equity funds are managed

conservatively, while others aggressively pursue growth. One fund manager may emphasize

value, while another may actively trade positions at different times in the market cycle. If in

doubt, find out from the fund company or the prospectus what the fund's investment objectives

are and how the fund is managed. While some performance numbers can be very attractive, you

may discover that the fund's investments are too risky for you.



<HR>

<A NAME="q3"><H3>Benchmarks -</H3></A>

<P><B>A</B>nother way to assess a fund is to compare it with an appropriate benchmark. A

benchmark is a major index that tracks the performance of a specific market and is considered to

be the average for that market. For instance, if your equity fund performed better than its

benchmark, you would say that your fund had above-average performance or outperformed the

market. 

<P><B>A</B> number of benchmarks

are listed in the business sections of major daily newspapers and also appear with performance

tables. For accurate comparisons, make sure that both the fund and the index take full

reinvestment of distributions into account and that they cover identical performance periods.

<HR>

<A NAME="q4"><H3>Volatility ratings -</H3></A>

<P><B>A</B> fundamental principle of investing is the higher the risk, the higher the potential

return. This is why returns in some categories will fluctuate more dramatically than returns in

others. For example, an aggressive growth fund will likely have more ups and downs than a

government bond fund. To help investors evaluate risk, mutual fund tables often include a rating

system for volatility. Other technical measures are standard deviation and beta. 



<P><I><B>Standard deviation</B></I> reflects the degree to which returns have fluctuated

around their average in a given period. The higher the percentage, the greater the variability in

returns and therefore, the higher the risk. With respect to bonds and bond funds, standard

deviation is the degree to which a change in interest rates has affected prices. Standard deviation

is usually based on returns for the previous three years, but shorter periods are also used.



<P><I><B>Beta</B></I> is a measure of risk relative to the stock market. The market index is

considered to be the generally accepted standard with a beta of 1.0. Therefore, if a mutual fund

has a beta less than 1.0, it had a below-average volatility compared with the market over a given

period. Conversely, a beta greater than 1.0 indicates that the fund was more volatile than average. 



<P><B>O</B>nce you have an understanding of the historical and relative performance of

various mutual funds, your main concern will be how your own portfolio is performing. Numbers

can be useful, but equally important are your financial goals, tolerance for risk and timeframe

when evaluating your investments.

<HR>

<A NAME="q5"><H3>How Returns are Calculated</H3></A>

<H4>Total rate of return -</H4>

<P><B>t</B>he change in the unit price of a mutual fund over a specific period, including the

reinvestment of any distributions. 



<H4>Average annual compound rate of return -</H4>

<P><B>t</B>he change in the unit price of a mutual fund over a specific period, including the

reinvestment of any distributions, divided by the number of years in the  period. Because this

figure shows the average return per year for the period, it is useful for gauging typical

performance over time.



<H4>Yield - </H4>

<P><B>S</B>ince money market funds generally have a fixed unit price of $10, their day-to-day

returns are expressed as yields. The yield on an investment is the amount of annual income

divided by the price. Money market funds are required by securities regulators to publish two

yields, current yield and effective yield. Current yield is the average daily earnings for the past

seven days converted to an annual rate. Effective yield is the annualized rate assuming weekly

compounding of income.

<P>







<H2>it's about time ...</H2>



<P><I><B>I</B>s now a good time to invest in stocks? What about bonds? Money market



instruments? Many investors are asking these questions because they are concerned about poor



returns in 1994 and about today's uncertain markets. Rather than letting one tough year influence



your investment decisions, now is a good time to step back and take a look at time. You will



likely find that as long as your current investments match your long-term goals there is little



reason to worry about short-term fluctuations.</I>

<HR>



<H3><A NAME="q1">RELATIVE VOLATILITY OF ASSET CLASSES</A></H3>



<P>Successful investors think long-term because they know that stock markets, bond markets



and even money markets can be volatile in the short-term. As economies move through each



stage of their respective cycles, some investments will perform better than others, producing the



regular swings we see in the graph below. Over the long-term, however, time tempers this



volatility by smoothing out the ups and downs.







<P><CENTER><H3>Relative Volatility of Asset Classes</H3>



<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/SP95cht1.gif">



<BR><B><I>Time tempers short-term volatility</I></B></CENTER>







<P>There is no question that markets have been negatively impacted recently, but for long-term



investors this represents a buying, not a selling, opportunity. For example, if you had bought a



stock or equity investment in 1974 - the lowest point in the equity market in the last 30 years -



and held onto it for 20 years, your annualized return as of December 31, 1994 would have



averaged 12.6% per year.







<HR>



<H3><A NAME="q2">THE RISK/RETURN TRADE-OFF</A></H3>



<P>Investors willing to accept the greater volatility of stocks have traditionally earned the



highest returns after inflation, followed by bonds and money market instruments. During 1994,



interest rates rose more than expected, resulting in money market instruments outperforming



stocks and bonds for the first time in several years. Historically, the money market has barely



beaten inflation. 



Including 1994 returns, stocks are still way ahead of the cost of living.







<P>Even though stocks have produced the greatest returns, we do not recommend investing



exclusively in stocks. Professional money managers have found that a diversified portfolio that



includes stocks for growth, bonds and mortgages for regular income, and money market



instruments for safety, captures much of the growth associated with the stock market, but with



less volatility than an all-stock portfolio. Because different assets perform well at different times



in the economic cycle, positive performance in one asset class helps to offset negative



performance in another.







<P><CENTER><H3>The Risk/Return Tade-Off</H3>



<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/SP95cht2.gif">



<BR><B><I>More volatile in the short-term, stocks significantly outperform in the



long-term.</I></B></CENTER>



<HR>







<H3><A NAME="q3">PREDICTING INTEREST RATES IS DIFFICULT</A></H3>



<P>When you purchase a fixed-income investment you forego some of the potential for higher



long-term performance and better inflation protection for the certainty of a regular stream of



income. You are also making a critical timing decision. By locking into a fixed-income



investment, you are betting that interest rates will not rise during the term and that interest rates



will be the same or higher when your investment matures. Chances are you'll be wrong, simply



because predicting interest rates is a difficult if not impossible task, even for the experts.



<P>Each month for twelve months, 100 pension fund managers were asked to predict the



direction of interest rates for the following month. In the following graph, those who thought



rates would rise were charted above the centre line. Those who thought rates would fall were



charted below the centre line. Each month, the group that correctly predicted the interest rate



movement was coded blue, while the group that was incorrect was coded yellow. The red line



shows how interest rates actually moved. As you can see, not only were these experts divided in



opinion, but as many were wrong as right.



<P>What can you do to avoid the interest rate trap? The solution for many investors interested in



locking in returns is to stagger the maturities of their investments. This limits exposure to interest



rate fluctuations because only a portion of the total investment is renewed at a time.



<P><CENTER><H3>Predicting Interest Rates is Difficult</H3>

<H3><A NAME="q4">TIMING ISN'T EVERYTHING</A></H3>



<P>It is natural to think about trying to &quot;time the market&quot; and get out of certain



investments until market conditions improve. But this strategy will only work if you time your



exit, as well as your re-entry, perfectly. When a market turns upward, it often moves quickly and



sharply and if you're not right there, you'll lose out on most of the gains.



<P>In the next graph, an investor followed a buy-and-hold strategy. He invested



in a portfolio of TSE 300 stocks in 1982 and sold it in 1994 for an annualized



return of 9.5%, comparable to the 34-year annualized return for stocks of



9.94%.



<P>Let's consider the returns if he attempted to time the market by selling out and buying back in



at various times. For example, if he missed just the best 10 days out of the 3,027 trading days in



the period, his return would drop to 5.8% per year. By missing the best 20 days, his return would



be 3.7% and by missing the best 30 days, his return would be 2.1% annually, comparable to



inflation. Although he participated in all the bad days as well as all the best days, by buying and



holding, the investor earned a much higher return in the end.

<HR>







<H3><A NAME="q5">GLOBAL MARKET PERFORMANCE</A></H3>



<P>Most investors can appreciate the benefits of diversifying among stocks, bonds and money



market instruments, but it is important to remember that geographic diversification also has a



place in every portfolio. The reason is straightforward. Canada is a mature economy that will



continue to grow, but not at the high levels seen in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s.



Other global economies and their corresponding stock markets are now growing at much faster



rates than ours. With Canada representing just 2% of the world stock market, it makes sense to



capture this growth by diversifying internationally.







<P>This chart shows the average annual return in Canadian dollars of several stock markets



around the world. RRSP investors can take advantage of these global opportunities by investing



up to 20% of the book value (original cost) of their RRSPs in eligible foreign securities.



TD's&Yacute; Wealth Allocation Model can help you take advantage of global growth by



recommending the best mix of funds for your investment portfolio.

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/ppp.htm">THE



PRE-AUTHORIZED PURCHASE PLAN</A> AT WORK</A></H3>



<P>Regular investing is a simple yet effective way to build wealth over time. With our



Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan (PPP), you can make regular contributions for as little as $25 per



Fund deducted from your bank account. 



<P>The PPP allows you to employ a strategy known as &quot;dollar-cost averaging.&quot; By



investing a set amount at regular intervals, you automatically buy more units when the price is



low and fewer units when the price is high. This technique doesn't guarantee a profit or protect



against a loss, but it usually results in a lower average cost per unit and ensures you never have to



worry about timing your investments.

<P>



<H2> Make your RRSP work harder for you</H2>



<H3>Smart strategies for securing your retirement<BR><I>Here is what to look for when

evaluating your funds.</I></H3>



<UL>

     <LI><A HREF="#q2">Consider Mutual Funds</A>

     <LI><A HREF="#q3">Get Time on Your Side</A>

     <LI><A HREF="#q4">Finding the Cash</A>

    </UL>



<P><B>B</B>y now most people are well-acquainted with the importance of contributing to an

RRSP. But many make the mistake of only thinking about the immediate benefits - they rush out

at the last minute just to get the tax deduction. Retirement may seem a long way off, but smart

investors know the harder they get their RRSP working for them now, the more money they'll

have at retirement, when every dollar counts.



<HR>

<A NAME="q1"><H3>Select the right mix of investments - </H3></A> 



<P>The right investments in your RRSP can make a big difference. For example, an investor

who contributes $5,500 a year to an RRSP with an average annual compound rate of return of 8%

can expect to have $271,826 at the end of 20 years. Increase the return by just 2% to 10% and the

investment grows to $346,514.



<P> How do you increase your return without risking your life's savings? For most investors the

solution is diversification. Diversification reduces risk and enhances the possibilities for growth

by spreading investments among the three main asset classes: money market for safety, bonds for

regular income and stocks for growth. 



<P> By carefully blending asset types, professional investors have found that they can combine

some of the desirable characteristics of each asset class while smoothing out the risks. For

example, a portfolio with a strategic mix of stocks, bonds and money market instruments can

capture much of the growth associated with the equity market, but with less volatility than an

all-stock portfolio. Because investment markets move independently of one another, positive

performance in one asset class can help offset negative performance in another, reducing overall

volatility in the long term.



<P> The asset mix you choose will largely depend on your age, your investment timeframe and

your tolerance for risk. For those nearing retirement, it could mean a variety of income-producing

securities that will preserve capital. For those in their early earning years, it could be a

combination of stocks for growth and fixed-income investments to balance risk.



<HR>

<A NAME="q2"><H3>Consider mutual funds -</H3></A>

<P>Mutual funds are an ideal way to build a portfolio with investments in all three asset classes.

Because mutual funds invest in a large pool of securities and are professionally managed to

achieve specific objectives, they provide instant diversification. Investors also like mutual funds

because they are a more affordable and convenient method of building a portfolio than by trading

individual securities. 



<P> The Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds makes investing even easier. TD's Wealth

Allocation Model can eliminate much of the guesswork by creating the optimal mix of Funds

tailored to your individual investment goals and personal needs. The Green Line Family has a

full range of 31 Funds to meet the needs of virtually every investor. Each Fund has a clear

investment objective and is managed by a team of proven investment professionals. There are no

sales charges and it's easy to switch between Funds as your investment goals and personal needs

change.



<HR>

<A NAME="q3"><H3> Get time on your side -</H3></A>



<P> Having a properly diversified portfolio will go a long way toward achieving your retirement

goals, but using time to your best advantage can boost your return even more. One way to

maximize your return is to contribute as much as you can as early in your working life as you

can. 



<P> Natalie, age 23, contributes $100 per month to an RRSP until age 31 (9 years), then stops.

Ted, who waits until age 31 to start his RRSP, contributes $100 per month until age 65. At an

average annual compound rate of return of 8%, guess who has more at age 65? For an investment

of $10,800, Natalie will accumulate $236,800, while Ted will have $229,400 for an investment

of $42,000.



<CENTER><H3>Start Early and Invest Often</H3><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/W95cht1.gif"><BR>

<B><I>Even a small amount, if set aside on a regular basis, <BR>will accumulate much faster

than you could imagine.

</I></B></CENTER><P>

This example illustrates the power of tax-sheltered compounding within an RRSP. Another way

to take advantage of compounding is to make your contribution early in the year. For example, if

you make your 1995 contribution in January 1995 rather than wait until March 1, 1996, your

contribution will have an extra 14 months to grow. Over the long term, this could translate into

thousands of additional dollars as the example below illustrates.



<CENTER><H3>Investing Before The Deadline Pays Off</H3><BR>

<IMG SRC="gifs/W95cht2.gif"><BR>



<I>The sooner you begin investing, the more you will accumulate.</I></CENTER>

<HR>

<A NAME="q4"><H3>Finding the cash -</H3></A>



<P>Making your RRSP contribution in January is sound advice, but for most of us it can be

difficult finding the cash so soon after the holidays. One alternative is to contribute smaller

amounts regularly throughout the year. Your contribution will grow tax-free longer and it saves

you having to find a lump-sum at the deadline. TD offers a convenient Pre-Authorized Purchase

Plan that allows you to systematically invest as little as $25 per Fund. 



<P> Another strategy is to borrow either your full contribution or an amount to &quot;top

up&quot; your contribution to your maximum allowable limit. Over the long-term the interest

cost may be worth it in terms of tax savings and compound growth. To ensure you don't miss a

valuable contribution, TD offers RRSP loans at low prime rates. Simply talk to your local branch

staff, who will take care of the necessary paperwork in one easy discussion.



<P><B>Diversification and tax-free compounding are two simple ways to get the most out of

your RRSP. Is your RRSP working as hard as it should for you? </B>

<P>

<H2>Are you an anxious investor?</H2>

<P><B>S</B>tock market volatility, concerns about Canada's political stability, daily changes in

economic indicators, and contradictory reports on the future of the Canadian and world

economies, all make it difficult to be a confident investor.



<P>However, it's easy to forget that we have experienced volatile periods before and that it's

typical of the cyclical nature of the Canadian economy. During uncertain times it can be useful to

take a step back and see how economic indicators have behaved over time. When you do this, a

pattern repeating every four to seven years emerges. This pattern is called the interest rate and

business cycle. 



<P>When you examine the phases of the cycle closely, you can gain a sense of

where we are today. This knowledge may put you in a better position to assess

your investments and give you confidence that your long-term financial goals can be

achieved.



<P>The business cycle has two basic phases: expansion and contraction. The peak

is the period just before an expansionary phase changes course. The expansion and

contraction periods are not necessarily uniform in length and they have

occasional changes of momentum and direction. It is these bumps along the way

that make it difficult to assess our position in the cycle on a daily basis.

<HR>

<H3>Contraction</H3>

<P>As the economy starts to contract, interest rates usually begin a sustained fall, triggering a

rise in bond prices and a decline in stock prices. An extended period of contraction is called a

recession. Our most recent recession began in 1990 and ended sometime late in the Fall of 1991.  

<P>The evidence of a recession is all too familiar to us. There's a decrease in the number of jobs

and hence higher unemployment. With fewer people working, consumers have less to spend and

usually limit spending to necessities. Those who are working reduce their spending. They worry

they may be the next to become unemployed. This domino effect can continue.  Decreases in

consumer demand lead to reductions in production and the potential for further job losses. In a

recession, the economy is often said to be on a &quot;downward spiral.&quot;

In a period of decreasing economic activity, income funds, such as mortgage and bond funds,

tend to do well. This is because as interest rates fall, the value of these income-based funds rises.

<HR>

<H3>Expansion</H3>

<P>During an expansion, share prices rise in anticipation of increased earnings from increased

economic activity. Bond prices decline as interest rates increase. This phase in the business cycle

is often called a recovery. Growth funds tend to do well in an expansionary period. 

<P>Quite often, a recovery begins and we don't realize it for some time because there are few

recognizable economic signs that this has happened. A decrease in the number of people

unemployed and an increase in consumer and business spending can be the signs pointing to a

recovery.

<CENTER><H2>The Perfect Business Cycle</H2>

Economics move in cycles. It is very difficult to know where we are in the cycle.<BR>

<B>The solution = Balanced Investing</B><BR>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/F94cht1.gif"></CENTER>

<P>A recovery can &quot;gather momentum.&quot; For instance, increased consumer spending

supports increased production. Increased production can result in jobs being created. These

factors all boost consumer confidence and encourage continued spending, perhaps now for big

ticket items such as major appliances or cars.

<P>This upward trend has seemed tentative to many observers in our current recovery. Many

analysts attribute this to the widespread economic restructuring, which accompanied the last

recession and the longer time it is taking for consumers to feel confident that it is, indeed, behind

us.

<HR>



<H3>Diversification</H3>

<P>It is only in retrospect that we can be certain what happened to the economy. This underlines

the importance of diversifying your investments. If one asset class is not performing well, other

asset classes in your portfolio likely will be. We know the economic cycle will repeat itself; we

can't be as definite about what the timing of it will be.

<HR>

<H3> TD's Wealth Allocation Model</H3>

<P>We believe that one of the best ways to establish a balanced portfolio, most appropriate for

you, is to use <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM.html">TD's Wealth

Allocation Model</A>.  TD's Wealth Allocation Model can help you create the optimal mix of

money market, income and growth investments for your mutual fund portfolio. With a balanced

portfolio you will be prepared to benefit from any phase in the business cycle.

<H2>Top RRSP Strategies</h2>

<P>It's never too soon to start thinking about your RRSP. Here are eight proven ways to help you

achieve a successful retirement.



<p><h3>1. Start Early</h3>

To get the most out of tax-free compounding, contribute as much as you can as soon as you can

in your working life. Once you've opened an RRSP, make it a habit to contribute as early as you

can in the year. By making your contribution in January instead of waiting until the end of

February of the following year, your money has an extra 14 months to grow tax-free. This can

translate to thousands of additional dollars over time.



<P>For example, if you invest $3,500 at the beginning of each year, you'll accumulate $289,549

over 25 years, assuming an 8% annual compound rate of return. By waiting until year-end, your

savings drop to $267,358 - a difference of $22,191.



<p><h3>2. Invest Often</h3>

Investing small amounts on a regular basis can grow much faster than you could imagine. It's also

a manageable way to make your RRSP contribution.  For example, an investment of just $25 a

week at any annual compound rate of return of 8% will grow to $19,923 in 10 years, $64,237 in

20 years and $162,979 in 30 years.



<p><h3>3. Stay Invested</h3>

It's tempting to time the markets by switching in and out of various investments as market

conditions change.  But this strategy will only work if you time your exit, as well as your

re-entry, perfectly. When a market turns upward, it often moves quickly and sharply - if you're

not there, you'll lose out on most of the gains.



<p><h3>4. Contribute the Maximum</h3>

By contributing your maximum allowable limit, you'll get the greatest tax benefit now and reap

the rewards of compound growth at retirement.  



<P>If you need help making this year's contribution, consider TD's Future Plan.  You take out a

loan at prime rate with The Toronto-Dominion Bank and, if you choose, invest it in your Green

Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds RSP. Like a regular RRSP loan, your payment schedule

is based on one year. However, instead of repaying the principal in one year, you have up to 10

years to repay it. Each month you pay the accrued interest on the loan, while the monthly amount

that would have gone toward repayment of the principal is invested in your RRSP through a

Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan.



<P>Instead of relying on loans to fill the gap, a better long-term solution is to plan now for next

year by enrolling in TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan. You can invest as little as $25 per Fund,

automatically deducted from your bank account on a regular basis - weekly, monthly, quarterly or

with your pay cheque.  It's a painless way to save and you avoid scrambling for a lump sum

contribution at the last minute.



<p><h3>5. Increase Foreign Content</h3>

By Investing globally, you have access to 97% of the world's growth opportunities that lie

beyond our borders. And since foreign markets, economies and currencies rise and fall in

different cycles, a globally diversified portfolio is usually less volatile than one invested in a

single country. Take advantage of these benefits by increasing the foreign content in your RRSP. 

Although the foreign content limit is 20% of the book value (original cost) of your RRSP, we

recommend that you invest 18% to allow room for distribution.



<p><h3>6. Consolidate Your RRSP</h3>

Managing your total portfolio is easier when your investments are consolidated into a single

account. Record keeping is simplified because you only receive one statement, and holding all of

your investments in one plan allows you to take full advantage of foreign content.



<P>If you already hold mutual funds, fixed income investments or money market instruments in

separate accounts or plan to include them in your portfolio, consider the <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/prodserv/prod/tdasm2b.htm">TD* Asset Accumulator

Account.</a> You can hold almost every type of investment except stocks and corporate bonds,

and you have access to expert advice from our Investment Specialists at any TD Branch, <A

HREF="mailto:funderman@tdbank.ca">E-mail us</a> or by calling our <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM-rsplmt.html#hot">Toll-Free Investment

Hotline.</a>



<p><h3>7. Open a Spousal RRSP</h3>

With a spousal RRSP, one spouse contributes to a plan in the other spouse's name. The

contributor gets the tax deduction while the planholder owns the assets. Spousal RRSPs help to

equalize income and reduce the total amount of tax paid in retirement. Take advantage of the

spousal option with a Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds RSP.



<p><h3>8. Diversify Investment Types</h3>

One of the best ways to reduce risk and enhance return potential is to diversify your assets among

money markets instruments for safety, bonds and mortgages for income and stocks for growth. 

Investing globally will add currency and geographic diversification.



<p> If you already have a diversified portfolio, now is a good time to review and if necessary,

rebalance your investments. Since personal circumstances and market values of investments can

change, it's wise to review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually. This ensures that your

investment strategy is on track and your money is working as had as it can for you.<br><br>

<P>Building or rebalancing your portfolio is easy with TD's<font size=-2>+</font size> Wealth

Allocation Model. This three-step guide will help you find the best mix of investments for your

personal circumstances and tolerance for risk.

<CENTER><H1>SAVING FOR YOUR<br>CHILD'S EDUCATION</H1></CENTER>
<HR><CENTER><H4><I>Although the cost of education may seem daunting, fortunately, 
time is on your side if you start preparing for your child's education now.</I></H4></CENTER>
<HR><P><B>O</B>ne year at a typical Canadian university can cost between $5,000 and
$7,000 when you factor in tuition, books, room, board and other expenses. Apply that to a
four-year program for a total of $20,000 to $28,000. And those are today's costs. Assuming a
modest three-percent inflation rate over the next 15 years, the total tab could run you from
$31,000 to $44,000 for each child. And that doesn't even take into account the likelihood of
further tuition fee hikes by the government.
<P><B>O</B>f course, scholarships and financial aid help many families, but there are no
guarantees that your child will qualify. Families should be careful not to rely too heavily on
student loans either. Borrowing is costly and can burden recent graduates with heavy debts just
when they are trying to establish themselves financially. While the reality is that many parents
end up financing the bulk of their child's education, the good news is that by planning ahead you
can meet the high costs of educating your child starting with as little as $25 a week.

<UL><UL><UL><P><B>S</B>mall amounts invested regularly can grow to a significant<BR>
amount over time.</UL></UL></UL>
<HR><H3>Start early and invest often</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he best way to build education savings is to put time to work and harness the
power of compounding. Since many parents do not have the resources to make a sizable lump
sum investment when their children are young, a better alternative may be investing small
amounts regularly. You may be surprised to find that an investment of just $25 a week can grow
to $37,652 by the end of year 15 (assuming an 8% annual compound rate of return).
<HR><H3>Investment strategies</H3>
<H4>Registered Education Savings Plans</H4> 
<P><B>R</B>egistered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) are a popular way to save for higher
education. RESPs allow you to contribute up to $2,000 per year per child (the 'beneficiary') for
21 years to a maximum of $42,000. Although contributions are not tax-deductible, earnings
accumulate tax-free until withdrawn. At that point, any income earned is taxed in the hands of
the student, who will likely have a much lower tax rate than the contributor.
<P><B>W</B>hile the original capital can be withdrawn without penalty, investment earnings
must be used for post-secondary education. You can designate as many beneficiaries to the plan
as you like and change, add or remove them at any time. An RESP must be terminated no later
than 25 years after it is opened. If the funds are not used for educational purposes, you lose the
tax benefits and any earnings must be donated to a post-secondary institution of your choice or
used for post-secondary scholarships.
<H4>Scholarship Trust</H4>
<P><B>A</B> second type of education savings plan is the scholarship trust. This plan operates
more like an 'insurance fund'. Earnings from all contributions are pooled into one large fund,
which pays out scholarships for eligible children as they progress through post-secondary
education. With this type of plan, you may 
get more or less than your pro-rata share of the pool. Scholarship trusts often have restrictions,
however. If your child does not go on to higher education within the time limit, your interest
earnings are normally kept in the pool for the benefit of other planholders. There may also be
restrictions on changing beneficiaries. 
<P><B>I</B>n general, with both RESPs and scholarships trusts, the more flexible the better.
Shop and compare because the precise terms of the plan, including administration charges,
close-out fees and withdrawal penalties may vary from plan to plan.
<H4>Trusts</H4>
<P><B>T</B>raditionally used by wealthy families to shelter income, family trusts are formal
trust agreements set up through a lawyer. Although certain preferential tax provisions were
eliminated in the 1995 Federal Budget, the significant advantages of income-splitting remain. 
Under income attribution rules, you pay tax on any interest or dividend income, while any capital
gains 
are attributed to your child.
<P><B>O</B>ne of the simplest ways to save for education is through an informal trust. With
this arrangement you open a regular investment account &quot;in trust&quot; - you do not have
to name a beneficiary. You retain ownership and control of the funds and can access them at any
time for any purpose. There is no limit to the size of the contributions you make or the kind of
investments you hold and you are never penalized if your child does not attend post-secondary
education.
<P><B>I</B>nformal trusts can also take advantage of income attribution rules. Consequently,
mutual funds whose investment objective is to maximize long-term growth and minimize
short-term income are popular choices for this type of account. For parents who invest payments
from the Canadian Family Allowance system on behalf of their child, there is no income
attribution at all. It is important to keep records that trace the receipt of the funds back to these
programs.
<P><B>O</B>nce your child reaches age 18 - the legal age of majority - you have the option of
re-registering the account to your child's name. From that point, all income, including interest
and dividends, is attributable to the child. When your child needs the money, a convenient
monthly withdrawal plan can be set up to cover regular expenses.
<H3>Getting started</H3>
<P><B>S</B>aving for your child's education is easy with the Green Line Family of  No-Load
Mutual Funds. The Green Line Family has a full range of  Funds, each with a clear investment
objective and  managed by a team of proven investment professionals. There are no sales charges
and no account set-up or administration fees.
<P><B>T</B>D's Wealth Allocation Model can eliminate much of the guesswork by creating
the optimal mix of Funds tailored to your investment timeframe and tolerance for risk. Once you
have completed the Wealth Allocation Model, it's simple to set up a regular investment program
with our Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan. The Plan lets you invest in regular instalments (weekly,
bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly) - with as little as  $25 per Fund automatically deducted from
your bank account.

<CENTER><H1>TD'S PRE-AUTHORIZED<BR>PURCHASE PLAN</H1></CENTER> <HR><CENTER><I><B>The downpayment on a new home. Your children's education. Generous retirement income. A trip around the world. Any savings goal may be realized quickly and easily with the help of a TD Mutual Fund Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan.</B></I></CENTER>
<HR><P><B>C</B>onsider the case of Janet and John, both of whom wanted to save money for their retirement. When she was 23, Janet began setting aside $25 every week. She continued to do this until she turned 31. At the end of those nine years, her principal totaled $11,700. In addition, let's assume each year she earned an average annual rate of 8% on her investment and will continue to do so until she reaches age 65.
<P><B>J</B>ohn, on the other hand, didn't begin investing until age 31. That year he invested $25 per week and he plans to continue investing this amount each week until he turns 65. By the time he reaches retirement, he will have invested $45,500 and he, like Janet, will earn an average annual rate of 8% on his investment for each of the 35 years.
<P><B>A</B>t first glance, these figures suggest that, by age 65, 
John will have accumulated significantly more than Janet. In fact, John will retire with $250,401; Janet with $253,067. (It's worth noting, though, that if Janet continued her $25 per week plan straight through 
to age 65, she'd end up with a total of $531,263!) 
<P><B>T</B>he story of John and Janet demonstrates two important lessons about accumulating wealth:
<CENTER><H3>Start early</H3>
<I>The sooner you begin investing, the more you will accumulate.</I>
<H3>Invest often</H3>
<I>Even a small amount, if set aside on a regular basis, will accumulate much faster than you imagine.</I></CENTER>

<HR><H3>The Plan</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan offered by TD's Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds is simple, straight forward and extremely flexible. No matter what your financial goals, it's a plan that can work for you. And, best of all, it's accessible to every investor because it can be tailored to fit virtually any budget. 	
<P><B>T</B>he Plan allows you to set aside a specified amount at regular intervals. In the case of Janet and John, they chose to invest on a weekly basis. You can invest as often as you like - quarterly, monthly, weekly or in sync with your pay schedule. Just provide us with either a cancelled cheque or your savings account number, the payment frequency, the amount to be invested into your mutual fund account, your investment choice and then leave the rest to us. It's like paying yourself first, for your future's sake. 
<HR><H3>Affordability</H3>
<P><B>Y</B>our plan is designed specifically to meet your needs. Select whatever investment amount is most comfortable for you - even as little as $25 per Fund. You can, of course, choose to increase or decrease the amount at 
any time. And, with the Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, 
the $2,000 initial minimum purchase requirement ($100 for RRSPs) does not apply.
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/ppp2.gif" ALT="Affordability Table"></CENTER>

<HR><H3>Choice</H3>
<P><B>W</B>ith 31 Funds to choose from, it's easy to tailor your Plan to your exact needs. TD's Green Line Funds offer a broad range of global and sector Funds in addition to a solid core of traditional money market, income and growth Funds.

<HR><H3>Flexibility</H3>

<CENTER><H1>RETIREMENT<br>PLANNING</H1></center> <HR>
<CENTER><H4><I>Retirement ranks as a primary financial goal for almost every Canadian. 
Some of us look forward to it, some dread it - but few of us are adequately prepared. 
Even if your retirement is years away, you can benefit 
from a review of the basics.</I></H4></CENTER>
<HR><H3>What will you need tomorrow?</H3>
<P><B>E</B>xperts estimate that you will need 60% to 80% of pre-retirement income to maintain your current standard of living after you stop working. Frugal types with few debts will fall in the low range; big spenders with travel plans may need much more. Once you make a rough projection of your annual retirement income, the next step is to determine how long you are likely to need it. As life expectancies continue to rise, men who retire at age 65 can expect to live nine more years, while women who retire at the same age can expect to live another 16 years. And whether you intend to leave an estate behind for your loved ones or gradually spend all of your retirement savings, don't forget inflation. Even at Canada's current low rate of 2% annually, the purchasing power of a dollar will be reduced to $0.74 after 15 years.
<HR><H3>What do you have now?</H3>
<P><B>T</B>ake a look at your retirement resources, starting with your company pension. Look at your last statement or contact your employee benefits department for an estimate of your retirement benefits. And don't overlook money accumulated in voluntary programs like Registered Retirement Saving Plans (RRSP) and profit-sharing plans. Another important source of retirement income is your government benefits, like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), and Old Age Security (OAS). 
<HR><H3>Filling the gap</H3>
<P><B>I</B>f you are like most Canadians, the retirement income you receive from your pension and government benefits will amount to roughly half of what you are going to need. The remainder will have to come from personal savings, perhaps supplemented with part-time work. As a general rule, it is wise to assume that your personal investments will have to generate at least one-third of your retirement income. Accumulating that nest egg may require some belt-tightening, but chances are you will get there faster if you follow these three rules:
<HR><H3>1. Start early and stay invested</H3>
<P><B>M</B>oney accumulates substantially if you stash it away and leave it alone. (The term used for this is &quot;compounding&quot;.) If you save $2,000 at the beginning of each year starting at age 25, you will end up with $404,141 (before taxes) when you are 60 - assuming your investment earns an average annual compound rate of return of 8%. By the same token, if you don't start until age 35, you will accumulate $172,702. Delay the start date until you are 45 and you will end up with just $65,500.
<HR><H3>It's never too early to start</H3>

at a compound rate of return of 8% per annum</CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/rrsp1.gif" ALT="Compound Rate of Return Graph"></CENTER>
<P><B>T</B>o harness this growth, you must invest regularly and stay invested for the long-term. Although some may be tempted to withdraw their investment at the first sign of trouble, smart investors know that markets follow cycles and historically, the trend has been upward. They accept short-term fluctuations in their investment and use a &quot;buy-and-hold&quot; strategy to build wealth.

<HR><H3>2. Minimize the tax bite</H3> 
<P><B>W</B>herever possible, let your money grow tax-deferred. For most Canadians, this means taking advantage of an RRSP. RRSPs can play an important role in building retirement assets. Since contributions lower your taxable income, you'll pay fewer taxes now...and your money will compound tax-free as long as it is invested. 
<HR><H3>3. Invest wisely</H3> 
<P><B>W</B>hile no one should accept more risk than he or she can tolerate, retirement assets should be concentrated 
in investments with relatively high long-term growth potential. No investment is risk-free, but you can minimize your exposure by spreading your savings 
across different investments. 
<P><B>T</B>o be truly diversified, most financial advisers recommend investing in a mix of the three main asset classes: money market for safety, bonds for regular income and stocks for growth. By carefully blending asset classes, you can combine some of the desirable characteristics of each class and reduce the overall risk. 
<P><B>M</B>any investors understand this important concept, but have difficulty putting theory into practice on their own. To be properly diversified in individual investments can take a fair amount of money, not to mention the commissions you have to pay. If you don't want to rely on others for recommendations, you will have to put in the time to research and analyze your choices and monitor their performance.
<HR><H3>Consider mutual funds</H3>
<P><B>I</B>f you are looking ahead to retirement, you may want to consider investing through mutual funds. They offer professional management and broad diversification at a very reasonable cost. While mutual funds are ideal RRSP investments, you can also use them to build assets outside your RRSP. Either way, by purchasing a relatively small number of funds, you can create a diversified portfolio designed for your individual needs and risk tolerance.
<HR><H3>Getting started</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds makes investing in mutual funds easy. TD's <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM.html">Wealth Allocation Model</A> can eliminate much of the guesswork by creating the optimal mix of Green Line Funds for a portfolio tailored to your individual needs. With our convenient Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, you can build wealth systematically with as little as $25 a month per Fund.
<P><B>I</B>f you haven't started preparing for retirement, don't put it off any longer. Setting up a plan and sticking to it may require some discipline, but that's a small price to pay for making sure you don't outlive your money.

<CENTER><H1> DIVERSIFICATION</H1></CENTER> <HR>
<CENTER><B><I> Diversification - the financial equivalent of putting eggs into a
number of baskets - is a fundamental principle of prudent investing.</I></B></CENTER>
<HR>
<P><B>I</B>t's best looked at as a way of hedging your bets - of offsetting one
investment's weaknesses with another's strengths. For most investors, this means
divvying up a portfolio into basic categories like stocks, bonds and cash. But
it's not simply a matter of throwing eggs into various baskets indiscriminately.
Since each asset class behaves differently over time, it's possible to create a
portfolio geared to your individual needs if you choose your categories
carefully. To appreciate how diversification works, you should consider three
basic concepts:

 <HR> <H3> 1. Performance</H3>

<P> <B>L</B>et's look at average annual compounded returns for stocks, bonds and
cash-equivalents - the primary investment choices for most investors - over the
last 35 years.
<BR><BR> 
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/divers1.gif" ALT="Average Annual
returns chart
"></CENTER><BR>

<P> <B>S</B>tocks, the growth engine of the financial assets lineup, turned in the
best performance with average annual returns of 9.94%. Bonds - the investment
of choice for those seeking current income - weren't too far behind at 8.58%.
Cash-equivalents delivered 7.84%. So, all things being equal, why wouldn't an
investor simply pick the best performing category and pour the money in? The
answer is risk.

<HR> 
<H3> 2. Volatility
 </H3>

<P> <B>I</B>t's unwise to look at an investment's potential return without
considering it's volatility - the possibility that an investment will change
in value. Stocks, while they unquestionably climb the highest, will
occasionally stumble along the way - sometimes for prolonged periods. (As
measured by the TSE 300 Composite Index, stocks have produced negative annual
returns 9 times in the last 34 years.) Bonds are generally more stable, but
their prices rise and fall in response to changing interest rates.
Cash-equivalents like T-Bills and money market funds have the virtue of more
stable prices, but at times their returns will barely keep pace with inflation.

<HR><H3> 3. Correlation</H3>
<P> <B>S</B>o each asset class has its own virtues and vulnerabilities. The good news
for investors is that they prosper or languish in different cycles. What this means for investors is that in the long run there isn't a high
degree of correlation between the performance of stocks, fixed-income investments
and money market instruments. As a result, a portfolio invested in a blend of all
these categories will see some winners and some losers, but over time it will
tend to have less volatility than an investment in a single asset category.


<HR><H3> An Example</H3>
<P> <B>T</B>his chart shows the growth of a dollar from 1960 to 1994. Stocks, bonds and
T-Bills performed pretty much in line with expectations, with stocks delivering
the most growth, followed by bonds and T-Bills. But look at the growth of the
&quot;Balanced portfolio&quot; - a blend of all three asset classes. This hybrid
investment, shown below, achieved 83% of the all-equity portfolio's growth, but
with only half of the volatility. Of course, this particular asset mix wouldn't
be right for all investors, but it's a good example of how a combination of
investments can achieve a desired result over the long-term.

ALT="Growth of a Dollar Graph"></CENTER>
<HR>

<H3> Diversifying Within 
Asset Categories</H3>
<P> <B>D</B>iversification can be significantly enhanced when you mix and match within
each asset class. For equities, this may mean balancing blue chips with small
companies, adding foreign stocks to an all-domestic portfolio, and spreading the
investment over a range of sectors or industries. In the bond category, a mix of
corporate, government and mortgage-backed securities might be appropriate...and
you'll want to buy issues with varying maturities and yields.
<HR>
<H3> The Role of Mutual Funds</H3>
<P> <B>F</B>or the average individual, achieving this kind of diversification would be
challenging and costly. Mutual funds - which are professionally managed,
inherently diversified, and easy to buy and sell - are an ideal way to create a
personalized and diversified portfolio. You can invest across a broad spectrum of
securities and asset classes by selecting only a handful of funds. Or you can
even purchase units of a single fund that invests in several asset categories
according to predetermined objectives.
<HR>
<H3> Your Portfolio</H3>
<P> <B>T</B>here's no one-size-fits-all diversification formula. The right mix of assets
depends on investor's time horizon, growth expectations and risk tolerance. It's
also important to remember that while diversification reduces risk, it doesn't
prevent loss or guarantee a profit. However, it's probably the most important
step you can take on the road to financial security.

<HR>
<H3> TD's Approach To Diversification</H3>
<P> <B>T</B>D's Wealth Allocation Model - a three-step program developed to help
investors create an optimal mix of stock, bond and money-market mutual funds -
can help you create a diversified portfolio suited to your individual financial
profile. To obtain a copy just stop by any TD branch or call our Toll-Free

<CENTER><H1> DOLLAR-COST<br> AVERAGING</H1></CENTER> <HR>
<CENTER><B><I>The stock market has been rising steadily. You stay on the sidelines
until you're convinced that the trend is going to last. Then you invest. But
shortly after you take the plunge the market heads south. As your investment
decreases in value, you finally decide to cut your losses and
sell.</I></B></CENTER>

<H4><I> Does this scenario sound familiar? If so, you're following an approach
which almost guarantees that you'll buy near market highs and sell near market
lows - a sure formula for losing money. Isn't there a better way?</I> </H4>

 <HR> <H3> The Wisdom of 
Systematic Investing</H3>

<P> <B>I</B>nstead of investing all your money at one time (and then agonizing about
whether the market will turn against you), many experts suggest investing a set
amount of money on a regular basis - quarterly or monthly, for example -
regardless of what's happening in the financial markets.

<P> <B>T</B>his approach is called dollar-cost averaging. The term sounds complex but
the idea behind it is quite simple. When prices rise, your fixed dollar
investment buys fewer units of a given security; when prices fall, your fixed
dollar amount buys more units. This technique doesn't guarantee a profit or
protect against a loss, but it usually results in a lower average cost per unit
over time.


<HR> 
<H3> 
How It Works
 </H3>

<P> 
 <B>L</B>et's say you decide to invest $100 per month in a hypothetical mutual fund.
In January the fund is offered at $20 per unit, so your $100 investment buys 5
units. In February, the fund's unit price declines to $10. At this bargain price
your $100 goes a lot farther, netting 10 units of the fund. By May, however, the
fund stages a comeback and climbs to $30 per unit. At this price, your $100
investment buys a modest 3 1/3 units. At the end of the period in question you've
purchased 30 units at an average price of $16.67. However, the average market
price was $19 a unit. Dollar-cost averaging resulted in a lower average cost per
unit. (See table below)

<H3> Don't Re Ruled By 
Your Emotions</H3>
<P> <B>I</B>t's important to remember that dollar-cost averaging doesn't prevent losses
during down markets. And it doesn't boost returns in rising markets. The approach
is best viewed as a discipline for separating your emotions from the investment
process. Instead of trying to time the markets, moving money in and out in
response to fear or greed, you invest on the installment plan. And over the long
haul, simply being in the market can be far more important than when you get in.
By investing systematically, you're able to take advantage of the long-term
benefits associated with ownership of securities.


<HR><H3> What Investments 
Should I Choose?</H3>
<P>
<B>D</B>ollar-cost averaging works with almost any type of security. Some investors use
the approach for purchasing individual stocks and bonds, but the costs associated
with buying small amounts of these securities are relatively high - and it's
difficult to create a diversified portfolio with only a handful of issues. That's
why dollar-cost averaging is often used to buy units of stock and bond mutual
funds, which offer diversified portfolios and professional management at a very
reasonable cost.

<HR><H3> 
Getting Started</H3>
<P> <B>T</B>o get started you need to make two basic decisions: &quot;How much should I
invest?&quot; and &quot;How often should I invest?&quot; The amount you should invest is
something you can only determine by looking at your income and expenses, overall
investment objectives and risk tolerance. Since a systematic investment program
requires regular unit purchases, you should definitely consider your ability to
invest through thick and thin before committing to a set amount. As for
frequency, monthly or quarterly investing is probably the most popular, while
many investors time purchases to coincide with the frequency of their paycheck.
Annual or semi-annual investments won't address short-term volatility, but will
lead to the benefits of dollar-cost averaging over the long term.

<HR>
<H3> It's Automatic</H3>
<P> <B>T</B>he easiest way to put dollar-cost averaging to work for you is to make the
process automatic. With TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, you can make
arrangements to periodically transfer a fixed amount from your bank account to
the Green Line Mutual Fund of your choice.

<P>



<H2>Price Sensitive</H2>

       

<I>When you evaluate the

performance of different asset classes, there are more factors to consider than just price.

</I>



<P><B>S</B>ome investors evaluate the performance of all their assets, whether they are

stocks, bonds or Treasury Bills (T-Bills), using the same performance measure - price change.

There's more to it. Let's take a look at the total rates of return achieved by various asset classes

and how these returns should take into account not only price changes, but also the income

generated and relevant fluctuations in currency values.



<P>Some investments are similar to having money in a bank account. They give a

specified return, or income, on the money invested. T-Bills, T-Bill funds and

money market funds are all examples of liquid investments with little risk. The

only way to evaluate this type of investment, is to review the income (as shown

in illustration 1) because there are no changes to the price of T-Bills (<A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/product/moneymar/index.htm">TD's

Money Market Funds</A> are managed to maintain a steady unit price). The total return

on investment equals the income your investment earns.



<P>If you invest in short-term income investments in currencies other than the Canadian dollar,

any changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to this currency will impact your total

return. This income and the capital amount will both be impacted by currency fluctuations.



<HR><CENTER>Illustration 1<BR>

          <H2>T-Bill Investing</H2>

          <IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/F94cht3.gif"><BR>

          <B>This chart illustrates the annual returns since 1980<BR> for an invesment in

Canadaian 91-day T-Bills<BR> as shown by the ScotiaMcLeod 91-Day T-Bill Index.

          </B>

     



</CENTER>

<HR>

<P>T-Bills and money market funds can generate high income returns when interest rates are

high. However, historically they generate relatively low returns when compared to stocks and

bonds. While you get the security of a low risk investment with regular interest income, you do

not get the potential for capital appreciation that investments in stocks and bonds can provide.



<P>The total return on a bond or bond fund is a combination of income and the change in its

price relating to the potential for capital gain and loss. While the price of a bond can fluctuate,

the income component remains relatively regular because it is an income-based investment.



<HR><CENTER>Illustration 2<BR>

          <H2>Bond Investing</H2>

          <IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/F94cht4.gif"><BR>

          <B>This chart shows the annual returns since 1980<BR>of the ScotiaMcLeod

Universe Bond Index which is <BR>comparable to diversified Canadian bond funds.

          </B>

</CENTER>

<HR>

<P>As illustration 2 shows, since 1980 bonds have provided an income flow averaging about

10%. There are no years when bonds have not provided a positive total return, even in years

where there has been substantial decreases in bond prices, such as in 1981 and 1987. With some

notable exceptions (e.g. 1982) it is income, not price changes, that comprises most of a bond or

bond fund's total return. 



<P>Bond prices move in relation to interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices move

lower. Bonds are often a good way to diversify your long-term holdings because bond prices are

historically less volatile than stock prices and for some increase in risk, bonds have a potential

for greater return than an investment in T-Bills or money market funds. However, while bonds

are a lower risk investment than stocks, they have less potential for long-term growth or price

increase than stocks.

<HR><CENTER>Illustration 3<BR>

          <IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/F94cht4.gif"><BR>

          <B>This graph shows the annual returns since 1980<BR> of the TSE 300 Total

Return Index which is <BR>comparable to diversified Canadian equity funds.

          </B>

     

</CENTER>

<HR>

<P>Like bonds, the total return you receive from stocks has two components - the change in the

price of a share and the income or dividend paid from the company's annual profit. As with

bonds, the price of a share can represent a capital gain or loss. Unlike T-Bills and bonds, there is

a lower flow of income from stocks. However, as illustration 3 shows, even when share prices

and/or total returns decreased, the TSE 300 never ceased to provide shareholders with income.

This is quite remarkable considering the severity of the last recession. 



<P>Currency fluctuations indirectly impact some Canadian stocks. For instance, any company

with a significant export market, or income from outside of Canada must cope with fluctuations

in the relative value of the Canadian dollar. The success in dealing with currency fluctuations

affects overall performance and is reflected in the total return the shares generate.



<P>But the majority of the total return from stocks depends on price changes. This is what gives

stocks greater potential for gain but also greater volatility and hence greater risk. Historically,

stocks have generated a higher rate of return than most other financial assets.



<P>Calculating the total return on global investments means adding a third factor to bond and

stock calculations - currency fluctuations.



<P>The potential gain in global markets can be very significant. These economies can have

tremendous growth and the increase in the value of share prices can be further enhanced through

increases in the relative value of currencies (<A HREF="#il4">illustration 4</A>). These

markets also are the riskiest ones in which to invest - with rapid growth can come instability. As

well, the income component from global stocks is usually lower than TSE 300 stocks and given

the volatility of these markets - especially the emerging markets -  the regularity of income flow

cannot be assured.

          </B>

     

</CENTER>





<HR>





<P>While these investments have a potential for greater gains than domestic money market

investments, bonds or stocks, they are decidedly more volatile. They are best suited to investors

prepared to take high risks in return for the potential of high gain. More conservative investors

may find these investments suitable in measured proportions to add geographic breath to their

portfolio.



<P><B>Make sure you are comfortable with how your investment will be earning its return.

</B>



<P>Depending on the asset class, price may be only one of two or three considerations in

calculating the total return of an investment. With T-Bills and money market funds, it is likely

not a consideration at all.



<P>In addition to the total return, you should consider what a specific investment contributes to

your total portfolio in terms of your long-term financial strategy. For instance, in a balanced

portfolio, you can enjoy the benefits of earning regular income and also take advantage of the

greater potential return from investments with a higher risk. In other words, you can benefit from

price changes and income while reducing your total investment risk - all at the same time.

<CENTER><H1>REBALANCING YOUR PORTFOLIO </H1></CENTER>

 <HR>

<CENTER><H4><I>Experts estimate that asset mix accounts for up to 80 per cent of a

portfolio's return over the longer term. In other words, the percentage of investments allocated to

different asset classes is far more important to overall performance than the selection or timing of

individual securities. </I> </H4></CENTER>

<HR>

<H3>Finding the Right Balance</H3>

<P><B>T</B>he reason for diversifying your portfolio is simple. No single investment performs

well under all economic conditions. By spreading your investments among safety, income and

growth assets, both in Canada and abroad, you can reduce the impact that one poor performer

may have on your portfolio. At the same time, your returns will likely be higher than if you had

invested only in the safest of assets.



<P><B>T</B>he goal of any asset mix decision is to provide the highest expected return for a

given level of risk. The proper asset mix for you will depend on your age, investing time horizon,

income and tolerance for risk. But it doesn't stop there. Ongoing monitoring and rebalancing are

essential to keeping your investment strategy on track.

<HR>

<H3>Staying in Balance</h3>

<P><B>R</B>ebalancing means adjusting your portfolio's investments back to your target asset

mix. It is part of a sound, long-term investment strategy because it helps you maintain a portfolio

that fits your specific objectives and tolerance for risk.



<P><B>T</B>here are two main reasons why your portfolio may need to be rebalanced:

<OL>

<LI>Investments have variable rates of growth.

<LI>Your investment objectives or personal circumstances can change.</OL>



<P>For example, Susan is interested in diversifying her portfolio but is unsure what to do next.

With TD's  Wealth Allocation Model *, she was able to find the best asset mix and select the

appropriate investments for her portfolio. After completing the brief questionnaire, she identified

her investment objectives and tolerance for risk. The following illustration outlines the steps she

took to rebalance her portfolio.

<HR>

<H3>Rebalancing Example</h3>

<center><table border=3 align=center width=75%><tr><td valign=top>

<P><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/prev1.gif"></td>

<td valign=top>

<p><b>A</b>lthough each asset class is represented in Susan's portfolio, the markets have

changed their value over time and she wants to further diversify her investments, perhaps by

adding some global exposure. Susan's answers to the Wealth Allocation Model questionnaire

resulted in a point score that corresponds to the Income & Moderate Growth Investor Profile and

Asset Mix. She decided to rebalance her portfolio as suggested in the model portfolio. 

<br><br></td></tr>



<tr><td valign=top>

<p><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/prev2.gif"></td>

<td valign=top><p><b>T</b>o rebalance her portfolio, Susan sold $500 of the Canadian Money

Market, $7,000 of the Mortgage and $2,000 of the Canadian Equity Funds and bought the

following Funds: $2,000 Mortgage-Backed, $2,000 Canadian Government Bond, $1,500 Global

Government Bond, $1,000 Dividend, $1,200 Blue Chip Equity, $1,000 North American Growth

and $800 Global Select. Result: Susan's new asset mix is better suited to her age, investing time

horizon, income and tolerance for risk. Her investments are more diversified to take advantage of

global opportunities and reduce overall risk in her portfolio.</td></tr></table></center>

<br><br>

<HR>

<H3>Why Rebalance?</h3>

<P><B>A</B>s economies move through each stage of their respective cycles, some

investments will perform better than others. For instance, an expanding economy will create

healthy corporate profits and rising stock prices, but a corresponding rise in interest rates will put

a damper on bond prices.<br><br>



<center><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/perfec1.gif"></center>



<P><B>T</B>hese types of changes can distort your asset mix so that it no longer reflects your

original plan. You may end up taking on more risk than you're prepared to handle. Or, you may

be missing out on higher return potential. With a properly balanced portfolio, you'll end up with

a

more efficient portfolio and be prepared to benefit  from any phase in the business cycle.



<p><b>S</b>imilarly, as time passes, your objectives or circumstances can change. By

rebalancing to your target asset mix, your portfolio remains consistent with your personal goals.

For example, you may be nearing retirement and want to reduce risk by shifting some growth

assets to more income-producing investments. 



<p><b>W</b>hen rebalancing, you have two options. You can either take profit from the top

performers (sell high) and buy more of the lower performers (buy low) or make additional

contributions to the classes that are underrepresented.<BR><BR>



<center><IMG SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/realign1.gif"></center>



<p><b>I</b>deally, you want to lock in your gains and buy the next winner while it's still

relatively inexpensive. Rebalancing does not imply market timing, but is a prudent investment

strategy designed to take advantage of changing market trends. It is an excellent way to

maximize

returns within the risk level of your portfolio.

<HR>

<H3>Rebalance Regularly</h3>

<P><b>R</b>egular rebalancing allows you to benefit from market movements and ensures that

your portfolio is in line with your goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. You should review and

if necessary, rebalance your portfolio at least annually or when faced with goal or lifestyle

changes. For example, saving for a down payment on a house might cause a shift to more liquid,

less risky assets. The birth of a child often prompts parents to start a long-term education savings

plan in higher growth investments. 



<p><b>A </b>sudden change in market conditions should not affect your target asset mix.

Many nervous investors think about reducing their stock exposure after a market downturn.

Instead, you should maintain your original plan if it remains consistent with your goals. Changes

to your asset mix should be made to meet your needs, not because of short-term market

fluctuations.



<P><b>Y</b>our quarterly Green Line * Mutual Funds account statement is designed to help

you monitor your investments. It shows how your portfolio is performing against your stated

investment objectives and tells you when it's time to rebalance.

<P>

<H2>Sure-fire investment strategies</H2>

                 

<P><B>R</B>egular investing simply means that you invest smaller amounts at regular

intervals, no matter what's happening in the markets. Affordable and convenient, this disciplined

approach can help reduce risk and build wealth over time. But regular investing doesn't have to

stop there. For those who prefer to take a more active role, here are three variations on this

proven approach to long-term investing:

<HR>

<H3>PROGRESSIVE DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING</H3>

<P>At its most basic, dollar-cost averaging involves investing a set amount at regular intervals,

for example $100 at the beginning of each month. You automatically buy more units when prices

are low and fewer units when prices are high. This technique doesn't guarantee a profit or protect

against a loss, but it usually results in a lower average unit cost over time.



<P>Progressive dollar-cost averaging is a more advanced version designed to accelerate savings

and combat the effects of inflation. With this strategy, you periodically increase your regular

contribution by a set percentage, for example 5% every year. Your investment compounds faster

and you keep ahead of inflation.



<CENTER><H3>Progressive Dollar-Cost<BR>Averaging Plan</H3>

$100 per month invested in the TSE 300 Total Return Index and increased 5% each year for 20

years<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/SU95cht1.gif"><BR>

At the end of 20 years, the total amount invested is <BR>$39,679. The ending value is $107,947

for overall growth <BR>of $68,268 or 10.44% per year.</CENTER>



<HR>

<H3>VALUE AVERAGING</H3>

<P>This strategy uses the value of your investment to determine the amount you contribute. For

example, say you can set aside $100 per month. The first month you invest $100. Because unit

prices fluctuate, you find that by the second month, the value of your fund has risen to $105. The

amount you invest in the second month will be $95, bringing the total value of your investment

to $200. On the other hand, if your investment falls to $185 during the second month, your third

investment will have to be $115. Value averaging is an efficient way to achieve your goals

because you invest more when prices are low and less when prices are high.



<CENTER><H3>Value Averaging Plan</H3>

$100 per month invested in the TSE 300 Total Return Index and adjusted for fluctuating

values.<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gifs/SU95cht2.gif"><BR>

At the end of 20 years, the total amount invested is <BR>$23,751. The ending value is $78,432

for overall growth <BR>of $54,681 or 10.77% per year.</CENTER>

<HR>

<H3>CONSTANT-RATIO</H3>

<P>This method uses a balanced approach to investing. First, you decide the mix of funds and

the amount to invest. For example, if your investor profile is "Income and Moderate Growth"

according to our Wealth Allocation Model, your asset mix would be 40% growth, 55% income

and 5% money market. Your first investment is divided according to this ratio. Your next

investment will depend on how the ratio changes over the period. If the price of the equity fund

rises, you will need to invest more in the other two funds to maintain the 40-55-5 split. By

dividing your investment among several funds, you can reduce the volatility of your portfolio

while averaging out the cost of your units.

<CENTER><H3>Constant Ratio Plan</H3>

$100 per month invested each month for 20 years, adjusted to maintain an<BR>asset

mix of 40% equities (TSE 300 Total Return Index), 55%<BR>bonds (ScotiaMcLeod

<H3>GETTING STARTED</H3>

Whether you are looking for worry-free investing or more active involvement, consider our

convenient <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/ppp.htm">Pre-Authorized

Purchase Plan</A> (PPP). Investments can be as low as $25 per Fund, automatically deducted

from your bank account at the frequency you select - weekly, monthly or quarterly. 

You may increase or decrease the amount or frequency at any time, making this Plan ideal for

progressive dollar-cost averaging. Taking advantage of value averaging or the constant-ratio plan

is just as easy. You can set a minimum amount and then "top up" your investment when

necessary with a quick call to your regional Investment Hotline.

<CENTER><H1> TAX INFORMATION FOR<br>MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS</H1></CENTER> <HR><CENTER><H4><I>Tax planning is an important, but often overlooked, 
part of any investment strategy. 
Here's a look at the key tax issues affecting mutual fund investors.</I></H4></CENTER>
<HR><H3>Tax treatment of distributions</H3>
<P><B>M</B>utual funds pass on their net income to unitholders in the form of distributions. Depending on the type of fund you hold, you could receive interest, dividends, capital gains or foreign income. Each year, administrators of mutual funds issue T3 receipts, Relev&eacute; 16 receipts in Quebec, which identify the type and amount of income you report on your tax return. 
<P><B>W</B>hen investing in mutual funds, keep in mind how different levels of taxation can affect your investment:
<UL>	
<LI>Interest is fully taxable.
<LI>Dividends from Canadian corporations qualify for the dividend tax credit.
<LI>Capital gains are 75% taxable; 75% of capital losses can be used to offset capital gains. (The $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption was eliminated February 22, 1994.)
<LI>Foreign income is fully taxable; foreign taxes paid on this income may qualify for the foreign tax credit or may be deductible from income.
</UL>
<P><B>M</B>utual funds distribute interest and dividend income at least once per year and many do so quarterly. Capital gains are normally distributed at the end of the year. You are required to report distributions as income whether they are paid in cash or reinvested to purchase additional units.
<P><B>D</B>istributions for mutual funds held in tax-sheltered plans, such as RRSPs and RRIFs, are tax-exempt. However, when you withdraw money from these plans, it is fully taxed as regular income, regardless of its origin.
<HR><H3>Capital gains</H3>
<P><B>M</B>utual fund investors can earn capital gains two ways. First, the fund can generate capital gains by selling investments in the portfolio at a profit. These capital gains are paid to you as distributions and are reported on your T3/Relev&eacute; 16 receipt.
<P><B>T</B>he second way to earn capital gains is through the sale of your mutual fund units. Because unit values rise and fall over time, you have the potential to realize a capital gain (or loss) from the disposition of your units - this includes both redemptions and transfers between funds. Mutual fund companies are required to report redemptions and transfers for each account to Revenue Canada on form T5008. Although you receive a copy for your files, the T5008 is not a tax receipt and does not have to be included with your tax return.
<P><B>Y</B>ou do not have to report capital gains for funds held in RRSPs, nor will you incur capital gains on funds that maintain a constant unit price (e.g. money market funds). For all other funds, it's up to you to calculate and report the capital gains you realize on your transactions. 
<P><B>B</B>ecause capital gains are calculated on the average cost of your units, one of the biggest favours you can do for yourself is to keep your mutual fund statements.
<HR><H3>Example of an average cost calculation</H3>
<P><B>T</B>his example assumes an initial purchase of 1,000 units at $10 per unit, a reinvested distribution at $12 and a subsequent purchase at $14. All units are later sold for $15 per unit.

<P><B>R</B>emember to include reinvested distributions in the average cost calculation. If you don't, your cost figure will be inaccurate.
<hr><H3>Registered Retirement Savings Plans</H3>
<P><B>N</B>o discussion of tax would be complete without mentioning the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). One of the last tax shelters available to Canadians, contributions are tax-deductible and 
grow tax-free until withdrawn. 
<H4>RRSP Facts</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Your contribution limit is 18% of prior year earned income minus any 'pension plan adjustments' plus unused contribution amounts from 1991 onward, to a maximum of $14,500 for 1995, and $13,500 for 1996. Your limit appears on the Notice of Assessment you receive after you file your tax return.
<LI>You may contribute to your RRSP until the end of the year in which you turn 71. At that time, you can withdraw the RRSP in a lump-sum, purchase an annuity or roll it over to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF).
<LI>You can invest up to 20% of the book value (original cost) of your RRSP in eligible foreign securities.
<LI>You are allowed to make a cumulative lifetime, penalty-free overcontribution of $8,000. Commencing in 1996, the overcontribution limit will drop to $2,000. Transitional phase-in rules will be introduced for tax payers who currently exceed the new limit.
<LI>Withdrawals from an RRSP are subject to withholding taxes at the following rates:

<CENTER><H1> THE POWER OF<br> COMPOUNDING</H1></CENTER> <HR>
<CENTER><B><I>"Compounding interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all
time".</I></B></CENTER>

<H4><I> That's what Albert Einstein is believed to have said about this basic
investment principle. And while compounding may not be quite as impressive as
Einstein's theory of relativity, investors who understand how compounding can
help build wealth have already taken an important step toward achieving their
long-term financial goals.</I> </H4>

<HR> <H3>What Is Compounding?</H3>

<P> <B>C</B>ompounding describes what happens when you systematically reinvest gains
produced by an investment. For fixed-income securities, this means using interest
payments to buy more bonds. For stocks, this means using dividends to buy
additional shares. For mutual funds, this means reinvesting income, dividend or
capital gains distributions in additional units. Over time, as you keep plowing
your profits back into your investment, you earn gains on your gains - in effect,
<I>compounding</I> the growth rate.
<HR> 
<H3> An Example </H3>

<P> 
<B>L</B>et's say you invest $100 at 10%. During the first year, your investment earns
$10 and your investment will grow to $110. During the second year, that $10 will
earn an <I>additional</I> $1...and that extra $1 is the compound interest. It may seem
somewhat insignificant at first, but the benefits of compounding become rather
substantial when harnessed to the power of time.

 <HR> 
 <H3> Putting Time To Work For You</H3>

<P> 
 <B>C</B>ompounding has a snowball
effect; it starts out rather modestly then gathers momentum. This illustration
shows the growth rate of an initial investment of $10,000 at an 8% rate of return
compounded annually. In year 1, the additional capital accumulation is only $800.
During the 10th year, however, the investment earns an additional $1,599 in
interest. And during the 25th year it earns an additional $5,073. And look what
happens after 30 years: the initial $10,000 investment has increased ten-fold -
to more than $100,000.
<HR>
 <H3>Growth of a $10,000 Investment Compounded Annually at 8%</H3>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/compd1.gif" ALT="Compunding Interest graph"></CENTER>
<UL><UL><P><B>T</B>otal income earned at the end of
30 years: $100,627 minus the initial investment <BR>of $10,000 = $90,627.</UL></UL>

<HR>
<H3> The Alternative</H3>
<P><B>T</B>o see just how powerful compounding
can be, let's look at the same investment without compounding's beneficial
effect. Starting with an initial investment of $10,000 at the same 8% annual rate
of return, if you take your annual gains in cash each year - without reinvesting
them - you'll net $24,000 in interest income over 30 years. So the value of the
total investment would be $10,000 plus $24,000 or $34,000. $34,000 vs $100,627 -
that's the power of compounding.

<HR><H3> Simple vs Compound Interest</H3>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/compd2.gif" ALT="Simple vs Compund Interest Graph"></CENTER>

<HR><H3> Seeking Higher Rates
of Return</H3>

<P> <B>T</B>he growth of an investment is also influenced by differences in
the rate of return. Let's take our hypothetical $10,000 and invest it at varying
compounding rates for 20 years. What seem like negligible differences in the
annual rate of return can have a big impact down the road. For example, an
increase of only one percent - from 8% to 9% - boosts the ultimate value of our
$10,000 investment from $46,610 to $56,044 after 20 years. 
<HR>

$10,000 Investment for 20 Years at Various Rates of Return</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/compd3.gif" ALT="Future Value of a
$10,000 Investment for 20 Years at Various Rates table"></CENTER>

<HR>

<P> <B>O</B>f course, in the real
world of investing we can't simply choose rates of return from a table. Seeking
greater returns generally means accepting a higher level of risk. But with a long
holding period to compensate for the effects of short-term volatility, investors
should consider investments with the greatest potential for growth, given their
personal risk tolerance level. 

<HR><H3>Three Basic Rules</H3>
<P> <B>C</B>ompounding doesn't work
overnight. Indeed, it's best described as a way to get rich slowly. But
compounding will go a long way toward helping you achieve your financial goals if
you follow these simple guidelines:

<UL>
<LI><I>Don't ignore risk, but do seek
investments with relatively high long-term potential.</I>
<LI><I>Stay invested</I>. Some
investment programs are designed for people who want current income or a cash
cushion for unexpected needs. But if you're setting money aside for events in the
future (such as retirement or college tuition for a young child), try not to raid
the cookie jar.
<LI><I>Start investing as early as you can</I>. Even small amounts, if
invested long enough, can grow to substantial levels.</UL>

<CENTER><H1> YIELD VERSUS<BR> RATE OF RETURN</H1></CENTER> <HR>

<H4><I>There are many ways of looking at the performance of an investment, 
but yield and rate of return are among the most useful. 
When making a decision about financial products, 
it's important to use the right yardstick.</H4></I>
<HR><H3>Yield</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he terms yield and rate of return are both used to describe the performance of an investment. Of the two, yield is slightly narrower in scope; it generally measures earnings from invested capital. Stated simply, yield gauges how much future income an investment generates relative to its price. A bond which costs $100 and pays $5 a year in interest yields 5%. A stock with an average price of $25 that pays out $1 a year in dividends has a yield of 4%.  
<HR><H3>Rate of return</H3>
<P><B>R</B>ate of return - sometimes referred to as total return - takes a larger view of investment performance. This statistic measures the annual return on an investment including interest or dividends plus capital appreciation. Let's say you pay $100 for a bond which pays $5 per year in interest, then sell it one year later for $110. The yield on the bond was 5% but the rate of return was 15%, since your initial investment netted $15 ($5 in interest plus $10 in capital gains) by 
year's end.   
<HR><H3>Sorting it out</H3>
<P><B>Y</B>ield is essentially a forward-looking statistic; it gives you an idea of how an investment is expected to grow if present conditions don't change. Rate of return looks at the past, measuring the actual performance of an investment based on how much money you started and ended with. Providers of financial products are obliged to use these terms carefully to describe the performance of the investments they offer to the public. 
<HR><H3>GICs</H3>
<P><B>G</B>uaranteed investment certificates (GICs) usually quote a fixed interest rate instead of a yield. Even though investors probably choose these products 
on the basis of their anticipated yield, a GIC's interest rate, price and maturity date are - in most cases - all fixed. That means there won't be any surprises in the future; a GIC guarantees a specific rate of interest on invested capital over the life of the investment.	 
<HR><H3>Money market funds</H3>
<P><B>M</B>oney market funds invariably publish both yield and rate of return when reporting performance to the public. (By law, these funds cannot quote a rate of return unless yield is provided as well.) Rate of return, the backward-looking measurement, describes a money market fund's past performance. As for yield, Canadian securities regulators recognize two types: current yield and effective yield. Current yield is a snapshot of the present, showing the average earnings on all the securities held by the portfolio for the last seven days converted to an annual rate. Effective yield - an assessment of what you might actually receive by investing in a money market fund - shows the current yield and recognizes the added benefit of weekly compounding.
<HR><H3>Stock and bond mutual funds</H3>
<P><B>R</B>ate of return is the only mandated performance statistic which must be used to measure stock and bond mutual funds. In other words, it's relatively easy to see where these funds have been, but much harder to project where they're going. Unlike GICs or money market funds, the prices of stock and bond funds go up or down on a daily basis, making it difficult to anticipate future yield levels with any degree of accuracy.    
<HR><H3>Using the yardsticks</H3> 
<P><B>I</B>f you want to compare various GICs, you needn't look too far beyond their quoted interest rates - choosing the rate and term that you find most attractive. When comparing one money market fund with another, you should consider both historical rate of return and yield to get the best picture of overall consistency. As for stock and bond mutual funds, rate of return is a useful but limited evaluation tool. A fund's past performance can give you an idea of how far a fund has come, but it doesn't tell you how much volatility it encountered along the way or how it will behave in the future. If you do evaluate funds on a rate of return basis, be sure it's an apples-to-apples comparison - one that includes only funds of the same type (balanced, international, government bond, etc.)  
<HR><H3>Which investment is right for me?</H3>
<P><B>E</B>ven if you understand the difference between yield and rate of return, you'll still have to assess your personal goals and risk tolerance to make appropriate investment choices. But whether you seek maximum growth or relative safety, you probably shouldn't limit yourself to only one type of investment. A diversified portfolio containing a mix of stocks, bonds and short-term instruments, is generally less volatile than a single-asset investment.  
<P><B>T</B>hat's why TD has designed the Wealth Allocation Model. This simple, three-step program can help you create a strategically blended portfolio of stock, bond and money market funds that's geared to your individual needs and outlook.

But from a global perspective, Canadian stocks represent a relatively small slice of the investment pie. In fact, Canada's share of global equity capitalization currently stands at 2% - which means that 98% of the world's growth opportunities lie beyond Canadian borders.

<P><H4>Superior Growth Potential</H4>
<P><B>H</B>istorically, foreign stocks have tended to outperform their Canadian counterparts. 
This has been especially true in recent years as Canada has weathered a sustained economic slump. For the ten years ending December 31, 1993, average annual returns from most other industrialized nations have exceeded those achieved by the Canadian stock market.

<P><H4>Greater Diversification</H4>
<P><B>J</B>ust as it makes sense to spread your investment portfolio across many individual securities and industries, it's also wise to spread risk across international borders. Since foreign economies and markets rise and fall in different cycles, a globally diversified portfolio is usually less volatile than one invested in a single country.

<P><I>Over the past 20 years, a 70/30 mix of Canadian and Foreign stocks produced the highest return for the risk taken. The most appropriate mix for you will depend on your own individual circumstances.</I> 
<HR>	  
<P><H3>What are The Risks?</H3>
<P><H4>Currency</H4>
<P><B>W</B>hen you buy foreign securities, your dollars are converted into the currency of the country where the stock is issued; when you sell, the home country currency is converted back into Canadian dollars. This means that any movement in exchange rates affects the value of your foreign holdings. When the Canadian dollar rises relative to a foreign currency, your foreign holding is worth fewer Canadian dollars and the value of your investments falls. Conversely, when the Canadian dollar weakens, your foreign holdings rise in value. The constant fluctuation in exchange rates adds considerable short- and long-term volatility to a portfolio of foreign securities.

<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/library/gifs/global3.gif" ALT="Impact of Currency Fluctuations table"></CENTER>
<H4>Political & Economic Influences</H4>
<B>I</B>nternational stock prices are affected not only by cyclical changes in local and regional economies, but also by political and social developments. Large scale events like the collapse of communism, German reunification and the GATT agreement can influence stock markets in many regions and nations. On a smaller scale, localized social or political changes can dramatically undermine investment values in less-developed countries.
<H4>Information</H4>
Foreign companies are not subject to the same regulatory and accounting standards that apply to Canadian firms. This makes it difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons when analyzing a company's earnings, revenues, book value or other investment criteria.
<HR> 
<H3>How Can An Investor Get Started?</H3>
<P><B>H</B>igher returns, greater diversification...but increased risk. That's the thumbnail sketch of global investing. And that's why most investors who venture into foreign markets want an experienced guide at the helm. Mutual funds - with their professional management and broad diversification - are an excellent way for individual investors to address the risks and rewards of international investing. As with domestic funds, there's usually a global fund to meet a variety of investment objectives and risk tolerances. 
<H4>Broadly Diversified</H4>
<P><B>G</B>lobal funds invest in any country in the world. International funds invest in all countries except Canada and the U.S. These funds are typically diversified over many regions, countries and companies and offer the highest degree of unit price stability. As a rule, fund managers will gradually shift country allocations in response to changing circumstances such as rising or falling economic growth.
<H4>Regional or Single Country</H4>
<B>R</B>egional funds invest in a specific area of the world such as Europe, the Far East or North America. Single Country funds invest in the stocks of one country like Japan or Spain. While regional and single country funds offer only modest diversification (and therefore increased risk), they are capable of relatively high annual returns.
<H4>Specialized</H4>
<P><B>F</B>unds in this category are invested in accordance with a specific objective or investment approach. An Emerging Market fund, for example, might invest in the stocks of rapidly industrializing countries in Southeast Asia or Latin America. Specialized funds tend to be highly volatile but can achieve annual returns far above average.
<HR>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<B>T</B>o determine how much of your portfolio to invest internationally, you'll need to consider your specific financial goals, time horizon and tolerance for risk. TD's Wealth Allocation Model - a three step program developed to help investors create an optimal mix of stock, bond and money market mutual funds - can help you determine what portion of your investment portfolio should be invested abroad.

<CENTER><H1>INDEX FUNDS</H1></CENTER> <HR>
<CENTER><H4><I>Designed to mirror the performance of major benchmark indexes like the TSE 300 and  S&P 500,
index funds offer broad diversification and steady returns at low cost.</I></H4></CENTER>

<HR>
<H3>What is indexing?</H3>
<P><B>I</B>ndexing is an investment approach that attempts to match the returns of a specific stock or bond index. The portfolio manager tries to match the results of the target index by holding all or in the case of very broad indexes, a representative sample, of the securities in the index. There is no attempt to outperform the index by using traditional &quot;active&quot; money management techniques that make bets on individual stocks or industry sectors.
<P><B>T</B>he underlying assumption of indexed management is that financial markets are efficient over the long term, making it virtually impossible for active managers to consistently outperform market averages. For this reason, indexing has long been popular with corporate pension fund managers who seek steady returns through a conservative, low-risk investment strategy.
<P><B>T</B>o replicate an index as closely as possible, portfolio managers rely heavily on computer-based technology. Sophisticated trading programs and strategies are used to adjust or rebalance portfolios to reflect changes in the composition of the index being tracked and to handle cashflow of the fund.

<HR>
<H3>Diversification</H3>
<P><B>A</B>n index by definition represents the widest possible exposure to an economy or marketplace. 
<P><B>I</B>ndexes exist for all the major asset categories - Treasury Bills, bonds and stocks - in both domestic and foreign markets. For example, the TSE 300 Composite Index, the most commonly selected equity benchmark in Canada, provides the broadest available representation of corporate Canada. Diversification among asset classes and geographic regions can contribute to reliable performance over the long term by smoothing out market ups and downs.
<HR>
<H3>Low cost</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he costs of investment management are considerably less for index funds than for actively managed funds. Management fees are reduced because securities are selected by computer analysis and expensive research is not required. Index funds also tend to incur lower trading costs because there is less portfolio turnover.
<HR>
<H3>Performance</H3>
<P><B>A</B>s you might expect, index funds rank near the middle 
when compared with similar funds over the long term. Relative performance improves after fees are deducted because of the lower costs associated with indexed management.        
<P><B>I</B>ndex funds rarely duplicate the performance of the benchmark exactly. Although costs are low, these funds do incur expenses, which will cause some variance in returns. 
<P><B>T</B>he difference may also lie in the investment technique used to track the index.                                            
<P><B>I</B>ndex funds tend to underperform actively managed funds during market declines and outperform them during market advances. Because index funds are fully invested, their managers do not have the flexibility of using cash as a defensive measure. Unlike active managers, index managers cannot move out of equities into the safety of cash during a market correction. On the other hand, index funds will never miss an upturn because their managers were sitting on the sidelines.
<HR>
<H3>Portfolio techniques</H3>
<P><B>Replication</B> - The portfolio holds the same securities as the benchmark index in the same proportions. The portfolio behaves exactly like the index it mirrors.
<P><B>Optimization</B> - The portfolio holds a smaller basket of securities that behave in the same manner as the index. Optimization can be more efficient than replication because minimized transaction costs generally offset the greater variability in returns.
<P><B>Sampling</B> - Sampling is used for bond portfolios, where the mathematical characteristics of bonds make it difficult to cost-effectively duplicate an index. Instead, all bonds in the index are divided into &quot;cells&quot; according to coupon, duration, credit quality 

<HR>
<H3>Index funds and your portfolio</H3>
<P><B>I</B>ndex funds are a cost-effective way to participate in a broadly diversified portfolio and offer consistent long-term performance. They are ideal as a balance against the volatility of actively managed funds and they provide relative predictability in uncertain markets. With index funds, you always know how your investment is doing - open up a newspaper on any day and if the market is up, 
so is your fund.
<HR>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<P><B>T</B>he Green Line Family of Mutual Funds includes three index funds: Green Line Canadian Index Fund, Green Line U.S. Index Fund and Green Line Canadian Government Bond Fund. The Canadian Index Fund uses replication to track the TSE 300 Total Return Index, while the U.S. Index Fund uses optimization to track the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Total Return Stock Price Index and the Canadian Government Bond Fund uses sampling to track the ScotiaMcLeod Government Bond Index.

<CENTER><H1>MUTUAL FUND<BR>INVESTING</H1></CENTER> <HR>
<CENTER><H4><I>For the average investor, mutual funds are a way of gaining access to investments that would otherwise be available only to large institutions or the wealthy. 
But before putting your money to work in a fund, it's wise to have a good understanding of the basics.</I></H4></CENTER>

<HR>
<H3>What is a mutual fund?</H3>
<P><B>A</B> mutual fund is an investment that pools money from many individuals and invests it according to stated objectives. Professional managers make investment decisions on behalf of fund investors, buying and selling securities such as stocks, bonds and money market instruments.
<P><B>W</B>hen you purchase units of a mutual fund, you become a part owner of all the securities held by that fund. The unit price is calculated at the end of each business day by taking the closing market value of all the securities in the portfolio, subtracting all liabilities and dividing this figure by the total number of units outstanding. The unit price will therefore fluctuate daily according to changes in the value of the individual securities and the number of units outstanding.
<P><B>A</B>ny income earned by the fund - which may include interest, dividends or capital gains - is passed on to investors on a proportional basis. This means that investors who own only a few units get the same return per dollar as investors who own thousands of units.

<HR>
<H3>Why do people buy 
mutual funds?</H3>

<P><B>Professional investment management.</B> Few 
people have the time or resources to stay abreast of financial trends while evaluating individual stocks and bonds. With a mutual fund, you gain access to professional managers who devote themselves exclusively to tracking the markets, analyzing securities and implementing an investment strategy.
<P><B>Diversification.</B> A basic principle of sound investing is to diversify your portfolio over a range of investments. This risk-reduction technique reduces the impact that one poor choice can have on your portfolio. Mutual funds typically hold about 50 to 100 different securities. The average investor would find it both difficult and expensive to assemble a portfolio of that size.
<P><B>Affordability.</B> Minimum initial and subsequent investments for a mutual fund can be as low as $25 if you open a pre-authorized purchase plan. Under a pre-authorized purchase plan, you invest a set amount at regular intervals (weekly, monthly or quarterly). The amount you select is automatically
deducted from your bank account and invested in your mutual fund. Pre-authorized purchase plans can be tailored to fit virtually any budget and are a simple way to build wealth over time.
<P><B>Liquidity.</B> You have access to all or part of your money whenever you need it. You can buy or sell units on any business day. Of course, when you sell your units, the price will be based on the current market value, which may be more or less than the purchase price.
<P><B>Convenience.</B> Mutual funds make it easy for you to keep track of your money. Not only can you follow daily closing prices in almost any newspaper, you'll also receive useful information about your investment on a regular basis. This includes detailed financial statements and quarterly updates on changes in fund holdings and other investment data. 
<P>Most firms offer hotline services that provide account information, fund prices, performance returns and market updates. Some firms even allow you to buy, sell and transfer units over the telephone. In addition, most fund companies make the investment process even more convenient by offering automatic investment and withdrawal programs, which allow for direct transfers to and from your bank account on a regular basis.
<P><B>Flexibility. </B>If your fund is part of a &quot;family&quot; of funds, you have the option of moving some or all of your money from one fund to another as your needs change or new opportunities arise. 
<P><B>RRSP-eligibility.</B> Mutual funds are an excellent way to take advantage of the benefits of tax-sheltered investing. Many domestic funds are 100% RRSP-eligible, while most international funds are eligible for the 20% foreign content limit. Mutual funds are also an ideal financial planning tool. As retirement approaches and your need for portfolio stability increases, you can gradually shift to more conservative funds.
<HR>
<H3>Types of funds</H3>
<P><B>W</B>hatever your reasons for investing, chances are there's a mutual fund or combination of funds that meets your needs. Some funds aim for maximum safety, others seek high levels of current income, still others are designed for long-term growth. Mutual fund investors can choose funds that invest in stocks or bonds, domestic or international securities, blue chip firms or small cap growth companies. While choices abound, each mutual fund will fall into one of the four basic categories:
<P><B>Money market funds</B> offer maximum safety, but relatively low returns. They typically invest in short-term, high-quality securities such as Treasury Bills, bankers' acceptances and commercial paper. Unlike other types of funds, money market funds are managed to maintain a fixed unit price. For this reason, money market funds are a good place to put money you will need in the relatively near future.
<P><B>Income funds</B> provide regular interest income 
by investing in fixed-income securities such as government or corporate bonds, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. As a rule, income funds have a greater potential for return than money market funds, but their value will 
fluctuate inversely with interest rate movements. Income funds are a good choice for investors seeking regular income and some potential for capital appreciation.
<P><B>Growth funds</B> provide the potential for higher returns by primarily investing in common stocks. While common stocks have historically been more volatile in the short-term than other types of financial assets, they have provided superior long-term investment returns and a better hedge against inflation.
Growth funds can play an important role in helping investors build wealth over time. Some growth funds are broadly diversified across many regions or industries, while others focus on a single country or industry. Some growth funds are even designed to mirror a well-known index, for example, the TSE 300 Composite Index.
<P><B>Hybrid funds</B> - also known as balanced or asset allocation funds - invest in a strategic mix of stocks, bonds and money market instruments. The fund managers often change the mix as market and economic conditions change. These funds appeal to investors who prefer a simple, &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; approach to mutual fund investing.
<HR>
<H3>Evaluating a fund</H3>
<P><B>Track record.</B> When looking at a particular fund, it's wise to ignore performance returns of less than three years. Even the best-managed funds are subject to short-term market risk; that is, they can fluctuate widely month-to-month or year-to-year. For a better picture, look instead at the fund's long-term track record, going back at least three and preferably five years.
<P><B>M</B>ake sure that you compare the fund to other funds in its category. A sign of a good-quality fund is its ability to outperform its peers in good
times and in bad. And remember, even though performance is an important tool for comparing and evaluating funds, it only looks at the past. No matter how well or how poorly a fund has done in the past, future performance cannot be predicted or guaranteed.
<P><B>Prospectus.</B> Everything you need to know about a mutual fund - management fees, investment objective and other important information - can be found in its prospectus. The prospectus is a formal, written offer to sell securities. Before buying a fund, read this document carefully to understand what the fund is trying to accomplish and whether its objectives match your own.
<P><B>Costs.</B> All charges and expenses associated with owning a mutual fund are described in the prospectus. Expenses, which include management fees and other operating costs, are paid directly from a fund's assets. Charges, which may include a commission or &quot;load&quot; for broker-sold funds, are paid by the investor. No-load funds are sold without any upfront or back-end sales charges.
<P><B>&quot;Know Your Client&quot; information.</B> By law, mutual fund sales representatives must ask investors for basic information about their 
financial status, investment objectives and investment knowledge. While this process may seem intrusive, it is intended to ensure that an investor's best interests are being served and to prevent inappropriate mutual fund choices.

<HR>
<H3>Understanding the risks</H3>
<P><B>I</B>n investing, the element of risk can vary substantially. A general rule of thumb is that the higher the potential return, the higher the risk you must assume. This is known as the &quot;risk/return tradeoff.&quot; 
<P><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/product/gifs/matrix2.gif">
<P><B>I</B>n mutual fund investing, volatility and performance will depend on market trends, the securities held by the fund and the investment style of the manager. Except for money market funds, which are managed to maintain a stable unit price, the net asset value of a mutual fund will fluctuate according to market conditions.
<HR>
<H3>How do I get started?</H3>
<P><B>S</B>ince everyone has different needs and goals, making a wise choice depends on understanding where you are now and where you hope to be tomorrow. So before you invest in a mutual fund, you should ask yourself three basic questions:
<P><B>W</B>hat financial goal am I trying to achieve?<BR>
How long do I have to reach this goal?<BR>
How much risk can I tolerate along the way?<BR>
<P><B>A</B>nswering these questions will help you determine the fund or funds best suited to you. To help you manage the selection process more easily, TD&Yacute; has designed the Wealth Allocation Model        *, a three-step guide that can help you create an appropriate blend of stock, bond and money market mutual funds for your acceptable level of risk.

<H2> Canadian Index Fund & U.S. Index Fund</h2>



<P><B>I</B>ndex funds have one clear goal: to match the performance of a particular market

index. This is accomplished through professional investment management expertise and

sophisticated computer technology.  The underlying assumption of indexed management is that

financial markets are efficient over the long term, making it very difficult for &quot;active&quot;

managers to consistently beat the market averages.



<P>The Green Line Family offers two funds that track major stock market indexes. The

Canadian Index Fund tracks the TSE 300 Total Return Index, while the U.S. Index Fund tracks

the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Stock Price Index. Both are the most widely followed

indexes in their respective markets.



<P>Both Funds offer broad diversification, historical above-median returns and low costs. The

indexes consist of stocks of major companies, which typically have a record of solid earnings and

regular dividend payments. These Funds also have lower management fees, since expensive

investment research is not required.



<P>Available only in US dollars, the U.S. Index Fund also offers currency diversification. This

can reduce your exposure to declines in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. The Fund is

eligible for the 20% foreign limit of your RRSP.

<H2>Investing for Success
</H2><P><B>Mutual funds have an important role to play in helping investors</B>
achieve their financial goals. Yet many people use mutual funds unwisely.
They own too many or too few. They buy on impulse and sell at the first hint
of trouble. The result? A portfolio based on whims rather than needs.
<P><B>T</B>hat's why TD has taken a close look at mutual fund investing.
And that's why we've developed an approach that looks beyond trendy funds
and impulse purchases. TD's disciplined, needs-driven selection process is
designed to help you create a diversified yet manageable mutual fund
portfolio--one that matches your investor profile.

<H3><I><A NAME=q2>A Balanced Approach:</A></I>
</H3><H3>Finding the Right Investment Mix
</H3><P><B>P</B>rofessional investors have found that by carefully blending
investment types, they can combine some of the desirable characteristics
of each asset class. For example, a portfolio with a strategic mix of stocks,
bonds and money market instruments can capture much of the growth associated
with the equity market but with less volatility than an all-stock portfolio.
A different asset mix could be created to satisfy the investor who seeks
income without sacrificing long-term growth potential.

</H3><P><B>B</B>efore you can build for the future, you must understand the
past. Look at the chart below to see how a dollar invested in stocks, bonds, GICs and money market instruments (i.e., Treasury Bills) has performed for
investors over time.

<H3><I>MONEY MARKET</I>
</H3><P><I>stable prices, lowest returns</I>
<P><B>S</B>hort-term fixed income investments offer maximum protection of
capital. But they have also generated low historical returns compared with
stocks and bonds. That's why cash-equivalents are an appropriate choice for
very conservative investors or for those who will need their money within
a relatively short period of time.
<H3><I>BONDS</I>
</H3><P><I>attractive returns, lower risk</I>
<P><B>B</B>onds have produced attractive returns over time. And because bonds
pay interest at regular intervals, they're favored by investors who desire
current income. But the price of bonds and other fixed income investments
like mortgages--while not usually as volatile as stocks--do move up and down
inversely with interest rate changes.
<H3><I>STOCKS</I>
</H3><P><I>biggest growth potential, highest risk</I>
<P>Historically, stocks have generated the highest rate of return compared
with most other financial assets. This makes stocks the logical choice for
investors seeking long-term growth. But stocks are also subject to the greatest
risk. As markets and economies change, stock prices can move up or down
dramatically.
<P><HR>
<P><I><B><A NAME=w2>How can I create a balanced portfolio?</A></B></I>
<P><B>S</B>uccessful investing requires commitment, expertise and resources.
Few individual investors have the time or the inclination to follow the markets,
scrutinize individual issues and keep abreast of the flood of financial
information. That's why more and more Canadians are using mutual funds to
build a balanced portfolio.
<P><I><B><A NAME=w3>What is a mutual fund?</A></B></I>
<P><B>A</B> mutual fund is an investment that pools money from many individuals
and invests it according to predetermined objectives. Under the guidance
of professional investment managers, most mutual funds invest in stocks,
bonds, money market instruments or a combination of these investments. When
you put money in a fund you receive units--each of which represents proportional
ownership of all the securities held by the fund plus any capital gains and
dividend or interest income those securities may produce.
<P><I><B><A NAME=w4>Why do investors like mutual funds? </A></B></I>
<P><B>M</B>utual funds give small investors easy access to investment services
that are otherwise available only to large institutions and the very wealthy.
These benefits include:
<UL><P><B>DIVERSIFICATION</B>
<P><B>H</B>olding a limited number of securities can be risky; if one issue
performs poorly, the total investment may suffer. Most mutual funds reduce
this risk by holding a large pool of securities--far larger than most investors
could amass on their own.
<P><B>PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT</B>
<P><B>F</B>ew of us want to take on the time-consuming chore of deciding
which of the many available stocks and bonds will make good investments.
Mutual funds are guided by professional advisers who devote themselves
exclusively to tracking the markets, analyzing securities and implementing
a consistent investment strategy.
<P><B>AFFORDABILITY</B>
<P><B>T</B>he minimum initial investment for a mutual fund is well below
what it would cost you to build a reasonably diversified portfolio on your
own. Many mutual funds are sold on a "no-load" basis, which means that there
are no costs to buy, sell or transfer within a fund family.
<P><B>CONVENIENCE</B>
<P><B>M</B>utual funds reduce much of the paperwork associated with investing.
Detailed annual reports and periodic statements make record-keeping a relatively
simple matter.
<P><B>FLEXIBILITY</B>
<P><B>I</B>f you invest with a company offering a family of funds, it's easy
to switch between funds as your investment goals and personal needs change.
</UL><P><HR>
<H3><I><A NAME=q3>What Distinguishes TD's Green Line Family of Mutual
Funds?</A></I>
</H3><P><B>T</B>here is no shortage of investment choices for mutual fund
investors. When selecting a mutual fund provider, it makes sense to consider
firms which offer significant benefits.
<P>Consider The TD Mutual Fund Advantage.
<H3><I>A Proud Lineage</I>
</H3><P><B>W</B>ith a long tradition of service to individuals, businesses,
communities, financial institutions and governments, TD maintains a network
of 1,000 retail branches and offices across the country and offers the largest
family of mutual funds sponsored by a Canadian bank. TD Bank is the parent
of TD Asset Management Inc., the trustee, manager and distributor
of the Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds.
<H3><I>Proven Management Skills</I>
</H3><P><B>T</B>oronto Dominion Asset Management (TDAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Toronto-Dominion Bank, provides investment management services for the
Green Line Family of Mutual Funds. With approximately $5.5 billion of mutual
funds under management, TDAM meets the needs of both individual and institutional
investors. Where appropriate, TDAM works with outside investment advisers
such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Asset Management
Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. who provide specialized investment
advice for some Green Line Funds.
<H3><I>Very Low Cost</I>
</H3><P><B>A</B>ll of TD's Green Line Mutual Funds are sold on a "no-load"
basis, which means there is no up-front sales charge, no back-end sales charge
and no account set-up fee. As a result, 100% of your initial investment goes
to work for you.
<P><B>A</B> 2% redemption fee applies to the North American Growth Fund,
the Science &amp; Technology Fund and the Global Funds if you sell or transfer
your units within 90 days of purchasing them.
<H3><I>Low Minimum Investments</I>
</H3><P><B>T</B>he minimum initial purchase is $2,000 for Investment Plan
accounts and only $100 for RSP accounts. If you choose to take advantage
of TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, you may make regular payments as low
as $25 per Fund and bypass the initial minimum purchase requirement.
<H3><I>Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan</I>
</H3><P><B>M</B>any people worry about investing at the wrong time (just
before a market decline). One way to reduce unit price volatility is through
a systematic investment approach known as dollar-cost averaging. By investing
a fixed dollar amount in a mutual fund on a regular basis, you purchase more
units when prices are down, fewer units when prices are up. Over time, this
can result in a lower average cost per unit, smoothing out some of the peaks
and valleys caused by market fluctuation.
<P><B>T</B>his disciplined approach to savings also means you won't put off
important investment decisions until another day. Thanks to the power of
compounding, even small amounts invested regularly can become significant
savings over time.
<P><B>Y</B>our in-branch Mutual Fund Representative or Hotline Account Manager
can help you take advantage of TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan to
systematically invest as little as $25 in any of the Green Line Funds.
<H3><I>Full Range of Funds</I>
</H3><P><B>T</B>he Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds offers a full
range of investment choices, including opportunities for global exposure.
Each Fund within the TD Family addresses a specific investment objective
or strategy, including safety of principal, income and growth.

Model</I></B> </A>is a simple yet effective approach to investing. It eliminates
much of the guesswork associated with building a personal portfolio. Working

to create an optimal mix of investments geared to your own needs and objectives.
<H3><I>The Wealth Allocation Model defines a series of logical steps</I>
</H3><P><B> </B>
<OL><LI><B></B><B><I>Determine Your Investment Objectives</I></B> &#160;Using
the Wealth Allocation Model questionnaire, you'll look at key variables affecting
investment selection: your age, investment time horizon, annual income and
risk tolerance. Your answers to these questions will result in a point score.
<P>
<LI><B><I>Identify Your Investor Profile &amp; Asset Mix</I></B> &#160;Your
point score will determine an Investor Profile and a suggested Asset Mix
of Money Market, Income and Growth investments. Conservative investors will
be most comfortable with Money Market and Income investments. Risk-tolerant
investors will want to consider a larger proportion of Growth investments.
<P>
<LI><B><I>Build a </I><I>Diversified Portfolio</I></B> &#160;Complete the
Wealth Allocation process by selecting individual investments for each asset
classification. If you wish, you may use the pre-structured portfolios we've
designed for both RRSP or non-RRSP accounts...or you may create a customized
portfolio according to your own judgement and preferences. A third choice
is to invest in the Green Line Balanced Income Fund or Balanced Growth Fund,
both of which are actively managed to maintain a strategic asset mix.
</OL><P><HR>
<H3><I><A NAME=q5a>Why Asset Allocation Is So Important?</A></I>
</H3><H3>Performance
</H3><P><B>M</B>any investors believe that investment performance depends
primarily on picking individual securities or jumping in and out of the markets
at opportune times. However, according to a number of studies, asset selection
produces more than 70% of a portfolio's return. In other words, the most
important decision is not which stocks or bonds to pick, but whether to pick
stocks or bonds, and in what proportion.
<H3>Diversification
</H3><P><B>T</B>here are times when stock prices move up as bond prices move
down. And vice versa. Similarly, there are periods when corporate bonds may
outperform government bonds; when international stocks outshine domestic
issues; when small companies grow faster than larger firms. This lack of
correlation can work to an investor's advantage. Since markets do not move
in tandem, a portfolio invested in a variety of asset types tends to be much
less volatile than one invested in a single type.
<H3>Financial Planning
</H3><P><B>A</B> multi-asset investment portfolio can be customized to meet
the specific needs of virtually every investor--from fence sitters to the
ultra-aggressive, from young adults to retirees.
<H3>Putting Asset Allocation to Work
</H3><P><B>I</B>n today's quickly moving financial markets, a single asset
investment may be exposed to substantial volatility. TD's Wealth Allocation
Model can help you create a mutual fund portfolio based on your specific
risk tolerance, financial objectives and time horizon. To obtain your copy
of the Wealth Allocation Model, just stop by any TD Branch or phone our
<A HREF="#q7"><I>Toll-Free Hotline</I></A>.

of additional benefits and services including:

are generally subject to foreign content rules and purchases cannot exceed
20% of the book value of your mutual fund account.

<H2>Update from TD Asset Management</h2>

<h3>An interview with Barbara Palk, CFA </h3>



<P><B>I</B>ncreasing numbers of institutional investors in major global markets, notably the

U.S. and the U.K. have incorporated indexing as a key management technique for large portions

of their portfolios. Now one of the fastest growing investment styles in Canada, indexing is a

reliable, low-cost alternative available to mutual fund investors. Since the mid-1980s, the

Indexing Team at TD Asset Management has be recognized as a pioneer of indexed management

in Canada. We met with Barbara Palk, Managing Director, Institutional Investment Management.



<P><B>Q.</B> What is indexing?

<P><B>A.</B> Indexing is an investment approach that aims to match the returns of a specific

stock or bond index by holding all or a representative sample of the securities in the index.

Historical evidence suggests that financial markets are basically efficient over the long term; so

there is little to be gained from market timing or seeking out undervalued securities. Indexing

provides a low-cost, performance-based solution, either on its own or in conjunction with other

investment management styles.



<P><B>Q.</B> How do you match an index?

<P><B>A.</B> We combine technology with quantitative an investment expertise to match an

index as closely as possible. In the Canadian Index Fund we use replication - the portfolio holds

the same securities in the same proportions as the TSE 300. In the U.S. Index Fund we use

optimization - the portfolio holds a smaller basket of securities that behave in the same manner

as the index. Optimization can be a more cost-effective technique for very large indexes, like the

Standard & Poor's 500.



<P><B>Q.</B> What are the advantages of index funds?

<P><B>A.</B> Because an index is considered to be the average for the market it represents,

index funds provide broad diversification and consistent long-term returns. Costs associated with

index funds are lower - management fees are reduced because securities are selected by computer

analysis and expensive research is not required. Index funds also tend to incur lower trading costs

because there is less portfolio turnover.



<P><B>Q.</B> What type of investor invests in index funds?

<P><B>A.</B> Index funds appeal to many types of investors. Risk-averse investors like the

broad diversification and corresponding lower volatility. Broadly diversified investors like them

for the same reasons and use them as a core portfolio holding. Market timers who strategically

move money in and out of different asset classes like the 'pure' returns, undiluted by sector,

security or industry bets. Tax-sensitive investors like the lower portfolio turnover, which

generates fewer capital gains. Active/passive investors like to balance their actively managed

funds with a core holding of index funds.

<H2> Questions & Answers</H2>



<A NAME="q1"><P><B>Q.<I> Last year I completed the <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM.html">Wealth Allocation Model</A>, but

now the percentages of the Funds I hold in my portfolio look a lot different than the Model. What

should I do?</I></B><BR></A>



<P><B>A.</B> Minor variations in the percentages or the "weightings" of the Funds in your

portfolio are to be expected simply because most unit prices fluctuate daily. Over the course of a

year, however, weightings could vary significantly due to the relative performance of the

individual funds, reinvestment of distributions or any purchases or redemptions you have made.  



<P>To maintain the proper mix of Funds, we recommend that investors review their portfolios at

least once a year. First, review the questionnaire to see whether the asset mix of your portfolio is

still appropriate for your financial situation and tolerance for risk. 



<P>If your investor profile has changed and you would like to change your asset mix, all you

have to do is calculate the current market value of your portfolio and then allocate the Funds

according to the percentages in your new portfolio. 



<P>If your investor profile has not changed, you may wish to make some adjustments to bring

your Funds in line with the recommended percentages. Simply calculate the current market value

of your portfolio and the weightings of each Fund. Compare these figures with the model

portfolio.



<P>You should consider adjusting your portfolio if any of the weightings have changed

significantly (e.g. 5% or more in either direction). You can do this by transferring amounts from

overrepresented Funds to underrepresented Funds or by adding new cash to the underrepresented

Funds.   



<P> If you have any questions about your asset mix or require assistance calculating the value of

your portfolio, please contact your TD Mutual Fund Representative, <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mail.htm">E-Mail</a>  or call our <a

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM.html">Toll-Free

Investment Hotline.





<HR>

<A NAME="q2"><P><B>Q. <I>Can mutual funds be held by a minor?

</I></B><BR></A>



<P><B>A.</B>Mutual funds cannot be held directly in the name of a minor. Buying a mutual

fund is considered entering into a contract. Minors generally cannot enter into contracts and

cannot therefore enter into a mutual fund on their own behalf. However, an account can be

opened in the name of the parent or legal guardian in trust for a child. Investment decisions are

made by the adult or trustee. The name of the child is not specified on the account unless a trust

agreement has been drafted that specifies the account as a "trust fund" for the child.

<H2> Questions & Answers</H2>

<P><B>Q. <I> What should I know about foreign content in my RRSP?</I></B>



<P><B>A.</b> Since foreign economies and markets rise and fall in different cycles, a globally

diversified portfolio is usually less volatile than one invested in a single country. This is a major

benefit to having foreign content in your RRSP. There is another good reason too. Canadian

stocks represent only 2% of global capital equity. In other words, 98% of the world's growth

opportunities are waiting for us outside of Canada. 

The maximum allowable foreign content for each RRSP mutual fund account you hold is 20% of

its book value. Unfortunately, Revenue Canada will not allow you to combine individual RRSP

accounts for this calculation. In terms of your RRSP, foreign content generally includes shares of

a foreign corporation or a bond, debenture or mortgage issued either by a foreign company or by

an individual not resident in Canada. Foreign content is often held indirectly by investing in a

RRSP eligible mutual fund that holds foreign content investments.

The following calculation will identify the dollar amount of foreign content investments you can

add to your RRSP account: 



<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM-rsplmt.html">To calculate your

foreign content RRSP limit</A>



<P>At TD we have eleven funds that qualify as foreign content funds and provide investment

opportunities outside of Canada. Refer to <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/WAM/WAM.html">TD's Wealth Allocation Model</A>

for tips on how they can be added to your portfolio.

<P>It is important that you don't exceed the maximum 20% limit as there is a penalty of 1% per

month of the book value of the amount in excess of your limit. The penalty is charged by the

institution with which you hold the RRSP and is payable to Revenue Canada. The penalty

percentage is set by Revenue Canada.

<P><B>Q. <I>   Now that I'm working, I have some money to invest in a RRSP. Where do

I start?

</I></B>



<P><B>A.</B>   If you've just started investing in a RRSP, the most important

thing you can do is keep investing. TD's Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan gives you a

way to make regular contributions to your RRSP. All you have to do is provide us

with either a canceled cheque or your bank account number, the payment frequency,

the amount to be invested into your mutual fund account, and your investment

choice. The amount you set aside can be as little as $25 per fund and you can

invest as often as you like: monthly, weekly or in sync with your

pay schedule. Where you invest is best determined by your long-term investment

goals and your strategy for achieving them. Investing in a balanced fund is a

good place to start. TD's Green Line No-Load Mutual Funds offers two balanced

funds: the <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/product/balgrow/balinc/index.htm">Balance

Income Fund</A> and the <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/mutual/product/balgrow/balgrow/index.htm">Balanced

Growth Fund</A>. Our Balanced Funds

are managed portfolios of money market, income and growth investments. As well,

they provide global opportunities within the allowable RRSP foreign content

limits.

<H2>TD's "Women in the Know" Seminars</H2>



<P><B>I</B>n response to increased interest from our female clients, TD Asset Management is

proud to offer "Women in the Know*", a nationwide series of seminars on the fundamentals of

financial planning and investing in mutual funds. An industry first, the seminars have been a

resounding success, indicating a great demand for financial management geared to women.



<P>"Women today have special financial needs and should be aware of the investment

alternatives available to them before developing an investment strategy," says Janice Book,

Managing Director and founder of the program. "The changing role of women in the workplace,

the needs of single mothers, the implications of the difference in male and female mortality, and

women's retirement patterns all must be considered when developing a personal financial plan."



<P>"Too many women avoid investment because they are intimidated by the language and are

uncomfortable in a financial environment. "Women in the Know" eliminates the intimidation

factor by focusing on the fundamentals of money management in an easy and straightforward

way."



<P>"Women in the Know" offers an effective three-step strategy for taking control of your

financial future. The seminars cover basic investment topics such as types of investments, the

business cycle, mutual funds and RRSPs. Armed with this knowledge, you are shown how to

assess your financial status using a cash in/outflow worksheet and a net worth statement. Next,

with TD's unique Wealth Allocation Model, you develop a portfolio of mutual funds suited to

your investment goals and personal needs.



<P>Our seminars will take place across the country over the next year. If  you would like to

attend, please call the "Women in the Know" Toll-Free Investment Hotline at 1-800-268-8166 to

reserve your seat.

<H2>Saving the planet starts at home.</H2>

<P>At times, the desire to renovate your home goes beyond simply
making it more comfortable for yourself and your family. These
days, people are also recognizing the importance of making their
homes more energy efficient in order to save energy and our planet's
resources.

<P>That's why there are now local initiatives committed to protecting our environment through better energy
efficiency; you may find one in your community.
Financial institutions also realize the importance of this
effort, and some have created special environmental home loan
options -- loans designed specifically to make it easier for you
to make your home more energy efficient.

<P>Take a look around your house with an energy-concious eye:
you'll see there are lots of ways you can renovate to make it
more comfortable and more efficient. This kind of renovation
will also shrink your heating and cooling bills, and add real
value to your home. All it takes is a plan and the money to make
it happen.

<P>If you live in Ontario, find out more about <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdgreen.html">

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2>
<B>Toronto, February 14, 1997</B>
<P>
<B>U.S. financial markets were heartened this 
week by the release of several economic indicators</B>, 
showing that the U.S. economy is expanding at a 
moderate rate in the first quarter of 1997.  Industrial 
production was flat in January, following substantial 
gains in the previous two months, as a weather-related 
increase in utilities output was offset by a decrease in 
manufacturing output.  The rate of industrial capacity 
utilization edged down to 83.3 per cent in January from 
83.5 per cent in December, and  remained well below the 
recent peak of 84.9 per cent reached in late 1994. 
<P>
<B>Evidence emerged this week suggesting that 
the pace of U.S. consumer spending growth during 
the winter months may not have been as vigorous as 
initially believed</B>.  Retail sales rose by a respectable 0.6 
per cent in January, but excluding sales at automotive 
retailers (which tend to be volatile), sales rose by a 
relatively modest 0.4 per cent.  In addition, there was a 
significant downward revision to sales growth in 
December, to 0.3 per cent from the initially-reported 0.6 
per cent.  The revision implies that the second estimate of 
growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth 
quarter of 1996 may be lower than the advance estimate 
of 4.7 per cent, suggesting that the U.S. economy 
entered 1997 with slightly less momentum than 
previously thought.
<P>
<B>U.S. investors were particularly pleased by 
this week's report of an unexpected 0.3 per cent drop 
in the producer price index (PPI) for finished goods 
in January</B>.  The year-over-year rate of increase 
decelerated further, to 2.5 per cent from 2.8 per cent in 
December.  The core PPI (excluding food and energy) 
was unchanged from December, and remained only 0.6 
per cent above its year-earlier level.  The favourable PPI 
data, combined with the recent marked appreciation of 
the U.S. dollar, should help to restrain inflationary 
pressures at the consumer level in coming months.   <B>Also 
pointing to a favourable inflation outlook was the 
report on productivity and costs for the fourth 
quarter of 1996.</B> Year-over-year growth in total 
business productivity (measured by output per hour 
worked) accelerated during the fourth quarter, to 1.2 per 
cent, in line with the rapid pickup in economic activity.  As 
a result, growth in unit labour costs decelerated to 2.4 per 
cent, from over 3 per cent in the third quarter, despite of a 
moderate acceleration in compensation per hour.   The 
sharp drop in U.S. bond yields late this week suggests 
that<B> investors interpreted the latest data to mean that 
an increase in U.S. short-term interest rates is 
unlikely at the March FOMC meeting. <BR>
	Increased consumer spending activity in 
Canada was evidenced by Canadian economic data 
released this week</B>.  New motor vehicle sales rose by a 
healthy 5.1 per cent in December, the fifth consecutive 
monthly increase.  Sales of existing homes in Canada, 
although down modestly in January compared with 
December, remained more than 50 per cent above their 
year-earlier levels.  The buoyant resale market, 
combined with a nearly 30 per cent drop in inventories of 
new and existing homes in 1996, will reinforce the recent 
recovery in new construction activity.  This was 
supported by a significant increase in new housing starts 
in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
145,000 units.   The improved demand for housing and 
motor vehicles in recent months is consistent with a 2.2 
percentage point rise in the Conference Board's index of 
consumer confidence in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
<P>
Next week, <B>investors will be focus their 
attention on the Canadian federal government's 
1997 budget, to be brought down on Tuesday.</B>  In spite 
of being well ahead of schedule in reducing its deficit for 
the current fiscal year ending on March 1, the 
government has indicated that no adjustments will be 
made to the very conservative official deficit targets for 
the following two years ($17 billion and $9 billion 
respectively).  Although financial markets might prefer a 
more aggressive attack on the deficit, the fact that this 
budget will continue along a path of steady deficit 
reduction based upon prudent economic assumptions 
will likely win favour with both domestic and international 
investors. 
<P>
<B>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:  </B>
<P>
Money market yields in both Canada and the United 
States eased during the week.  The decline was very 
modest at the short end of the yield curve, but more 
pronounced at the one-year maturity, which 
benefitted from the rally in the North American bond 
markets.  The negative spread between Canadian and 
U.S. yields widened slightly on 3-month treasury bills, 
to -228 basis points at Thursday's close from -225 a 
week earlier, and more significantly at the one-year 
maturity, to -214 basis points from -201.  The 
relatively greater decline in Canadian yields seems to 
reflect investors' anticipations that Canada's federal 
government budget, to be presented on February 18, 
will show faster-than-expected progress  in reducing 
the federal budget deficit.

<P>
<B>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:  </B>
<P>
U.S. bond markets came under some pressure from 
the Treasury's quarterly refunding operations early in 
the week, as the 3-, 10- and 30-year bond auctions 
were received with little enthusiasm.  However, once 
the auctions were completed on Thursday, the market 
rallied strongly. The yield on the 30-year government 
bond declined by 13 basis points over the week, to 
close at 6.63 per cent on Thursday, and dropped 
another 9 basis points in early trading today, in 
response to the softer-than expected U.S. inflation 
and production data.  Canadian bonds outperformed 
their U.S. counterparts by a wide margin, in 
anticipation of a bond-benevolent budget.  At 
Thursday's close, the negative spread between 
Canadian and U.S. 10-year bonds widened to -14 
basis points from -4 a week earlier, and the positive 
spread on long-term bonds shrank from 35 basis 
points to 24.
<P>
<B>CANADIAN DOLLAR:  </B>
<P>
The Canadian dollar lost about .25 US cents against 
the U.S. dollar in the first part of the week, touching a 
low of 73.71 US cents on Wednesday, but rebounded 
smartly on Thursday, to close at 74 US cents.  The 
temporary decline seems to have resulted more from 
another surge in the value of the U.S. dollar vis--vis 
the major overseas currencies than from any inherent 
weakness in the Canadian dollar.  Although the 
Canadian dollar has slipped against its U.S. 
counterpart during the last three weeks, its 
trade-weighted index has risen slightly above the high 
reached last November.

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2>

<B>Toronto, February 7, 1997</B>
<P>
<B>Economic data released in the United States 
this week showed little sign that the robust 
economic performance in the fourth quarter of 1996 
carried over into the early part of 1997.</B>  U.S. non-farm 
payrolls rose by a solid 271,000 in January, above the 
average monthly gain of 234,000 net jobs recorded in the 
fourth quarter.  Nonetheless,<B> the report</B> <B>was received 
positively by the U.S bond market,</B> as investors 
focused their attention on other aspects of the release.  
The stronger-than-expected rise in employment in 
January was accompanied by a significant 0.7 hour 
decline in average hours worked per week, which 
resulted in a decrease in total hours worked during the 
month.  The year-over-year rate of growth in average 
hourly earnings remained unchanged in January, at 3.8 
per cent.   In spite of the healthy U.S. employment gain in 
January, a substantial increase in the labour force 
pushed the unemployment rate up slightly, to 5.4 per 
cent.  The strength in labour-force growth, which 
accelerated to 2.2 per cent in January on a 
year-over-year basis (almost twice the pace of adult 
population growth), has helped to hold the 
unemployment rate relatively steady in recent months.  
<P>
<B>Data from the National Association of 
Purchasing Management (NAPM) pointed to less 
rapid growth in manufacturing activity in January</B>.  
The total NAPM index fell to 52.0 in January from 53.8 in 
December, but remained above the 50.0 level which 
indicates expansion in the sector.  Particularly positive for 
financial markets was a sharp drop in the supplier 
deliveries sub-index (an indicator for potential 
inflationary pressures watched closely by the Fed), to 
48.5 from 51.6 in December.     
<P>
Amid recent indications that price and wage 
pressures remain relatively subdued, <B>the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to 
leave U.S. short-term interest rates unchanged</B> at its 
February 4-5 meeting.  The announcement was widely 
expected by investors.  The Fed, however, likely 
maintains its bias towards tightening, given that the risks 
of rising inflation have not receded.         
<P>
<B>A disappointingly small rise in Canadian 
employment in January was not inconsistent with 
improving trends in the Canadian labour market</B>.   
Total employment in Canada rose by only 5,000 persons 
in January, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.7 
per cent.  Nonetheless, almost 100,000 net new jobs 
have been created since the beginning of the fourth 
quarter 1996, and virtually all gains were in full-time 
employment.   The strong job growth in the 
October-January period was largely concentrated in 
community, business and personal services and in 
construction, partly reflecting the recent strength in the 
Canadian housing market.    
<P>
Although the faster pace of Canadian economic 
expansion since the summer of 1996 should translate 
into continued impressive job growth over the coming 
months, the near-term outlook for manufacturing 
employment is less upbeat.  The Quarterly Survey of 
Business Conditions in manufacturing (conducted in 
January) showed that manufacturers plan to leave 
employment levels relatively unchanged in the first 
quarter of 1997.  Nevertheless, the report was otherwise 
positive.  Manufacturers, feeling less concerned about 
inventory levels than previously and more satisfied about 
the flow of new orders, plan to increase production in the 
first quarter.  This suggests that the pace of economic 
activity in Canada will remain healthy over the next few 
months. 
<P>
<B>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:  </B>
<P>
For the week ended Thursday, Canadian and U.S. 
short-term interest rates remained virtually 
unchanged.  North American debt markets rallied on 
last Friday's economic reports of strong growth and 
contained inflation in both countries.  Canadian debt 
markets were also strengthened by the 
announcement of a February 18 Federal budget, 
which focused attention on the considerable progress 
that has been made in Federal budget deficit 
reduction.  The market gains were short-lived and by 
Thursday's close the yields on Canadian 3-month 
T-bills had returned to 2.88 per cent.  In the United 
States, Friday's rally was extended by the NAPM 
report on Monday that the pace of growth in the 
manufacturing industry was slowing to a more 
moderate pace.  Nevertheless, investor nervousness 
in advance of this Friday's U.S. employment report 
caused U.S. T-bills to give up much of their earlier 
gains.  
<P>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="FE7AT05.gif"  ><BR></B>
<P>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="FE7AT04.gif"  ><BR></B>
<P>
<B>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:  </B>
<P>
North American bonds rallied this week, 
outperforming money market instruments and causing 
yield curves to flatten.  In addition to favourable growth 
reports, Canadian bond prices rose in reaction to a 
report in the winter issue of the Bank of Canada 
Review which stressed that the existing output gap 
would allow robust growth while maintaining a low rate 
of inflation.  For the week ended Thursday, the yield on 
Canadian 30-year bonds declined by 20 basis points. 
In the United States, bond markets did not react to the 
conclusion of the FOMC meeting,  that left interest 
rates unchanged. Instead, bond prices lost some of 
their earlier gains as investors focused on this Friday's 
employment report and supply pressures from the 
U.S. Treasury quarterly refunding operation. Despite a 
stronger-than-expected employment report this 
morning, North American bond yields moved lower in 
early trading.   
<P>
<B>CANADIAN DOLLAR:  </B>
<P>
The Canadian dollar strengthened early in the week 
ended Thursday in reaction to the report of strong 
economic growth in November 1996.  The dollar was 
also supported by a favourable economic outlook in 
the Bank of Canada Review and the announcement of 
a Federal budget.  Investors realized some profits on 
Thursday, causing the dollar to lose a quarter of a US 
cent and close at 74.09 US cents.  The U.S. dollar 
continues to rise against the Japanese yen and the 
German mark.  Investor nervousness, in advance of 
the G-7 meeting of financial ministers and central 
bankers this Saturday, appeared to be calmed by 
repeated comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Robert Rubin that the Clinton administration believes 
a strong U.S. dollar is in the U.S. national interest.

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2>
<B>Toronto, January 31, 1997</B>
<P>
<B>The advance report on U.S. gross domestic 
product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 1996 
indicated that economic growth strengthened 
considerably</B>, to an annualized rate of 4.7 per cent from 
2.1 per cent in the third quarter.  A major contributor to the 
robust fourth-quarter expansion was an appreciable 
improvement in the U.S. deficit on international trade in 
goods and services, as exports rebounded strongly 
following a decline in the third quarter and imports 
increased at a slower rate.  <B>Growth in final domestic 
demand quickened,</B> to 2.8 per cent from the very 
sluggish 1.7 per cent in the July-September period, but 
remained well below the pace of more than 4 per cent 
recorded in the first two quarters of 1996. In the fourth 
quarter, an acceleration in consumer spending more 
than offset a marked slowdown in business investment 
growth.   
<P>
The GDP data, while indicating that the U.S. 
economic expansion was more vigorous than 
anticipated in the fourth quarter, also confirmed that U.S. 
price increases remained in check.  <B>The rate of 
inflation, as measured by the chain-weighted GDP 
deflator, actually slowed, </B>to 1.8 per cent in the fourth 
quarter from 2.0 per cent in the third quarter<B>.</B> 
<P>
<B>Good news on U.S. inflation was also 
provided in the report on employment costs,</B> 
released on Tuesday.  The year-over-year increase in 
the employment cost index accelerated only slightly in 
the fourth quarter of 1996, to 2.9 per cent.  Growth in the 
wages and salaries component of the index inched up to 
3.3 per cent, but the rise in benefit costs remained below 
2 per cent.  The moderate rise in compensation costs, 
combined with  estimated labour productivity growth of 
about 1 per cent, implies an average increase in unit 
labour costs of around 2 per cent.  This is hardly enough 
to push consumer price inflation above its current rate of 
around 3 per cent.      
<P>
Other U.S. economic indicators released this 
week were mixed<B>.  New orders for durable goods</B> <B>fell 
</B>by 1.7 per cent in December, matching the decline in the 
previous month.  <B>Sales of existing homes</B> <B>continued 
to trend downwards</B>, falling by a further 3.5 per cent in 
December.  While this suggests that the rapid rise in 
personal indebtedness may be starting to restrain 
demand for big-ticket items, U.S. consumers remain 
upbeat.  This is evidenced by a rise in the Conference 
Board's index of consumer confidence in January, to its 
highest level since mid-1989.
<P>
<B>The near-term outlook for U.S. monetary 
policy is still uncertain. </B> Although the favourable news 
on price and wage inflation strengthens the case against 
a tightening in U.S. monetary policy at the February 4-5 
FOMC meeting, the Fed will be anxious to see more 
convincing evidence that U.S. economic growth has 
moderated to a more sustainable pace.  In the meantime, 
the U.S. bond market will continue to fear the worst.
<P>
<B>The report on Canadian real GDP at factor cost 
for November suggests that Canada's economic 
expansion gained momentum in late 1996</B>. Real GDP 
at factor cost rose by 0.5 per cent in November, and in the 
first two months of the fourth quarter, it rose by 3.8 per 
cent (annualized rate) above the third-quarter average.  
Although gains in November were led by a rebound in 
automotive production following the end of the strike at 
GM Canada, the rise in total output was broadly based.  
Consumer purchases of motor vehicles and of furniture 
and appliances continued to gather strength in 
November, in line with the low level of Canadian interest 
rates and the pickup in the housing market.   
<P>
The only other major economic indicator released 
in Canada this week was the <B>report on industrial 
product prices</B>.  The industrial product price index rose 
by 0.4 per cent in December, but remained 0.5 per cent 
below its year-earlier level.  Excluding petroleum and 
coal products, the year-over-year decline was 1.6 per 
cent.  The weakness in industrial product prices 
restrained Canadian corporate profit growth in 1996.  
However, the outlook for a stronger global economic 
expansion in 1997 should provide a more favourable 
environment for industrial product prices this year.
<P>
<B>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:  </B>
<P>
Developments in Canadian and U.S. money markets 
diverged this week.  Tuesday's report on 
fourth-quarter-1996 U.S. employment costs 
indicated that wages continued to rise, but the rate of 
increase was less than many investors had feared.  As 
a result, speculation that the Federal Reserve would 
raise short-term interest rates at the February 4-5 
FOMC meeting receded, and U.S. short-term interest 
rates eased.  Continued strength in the U.S. dollar also 
helped push yields on U.S. T-bills lower.  In Canada, 
profit-taking following the recent rally in the Canadian 
dollar led to slightly higher yields on Canadian T-bills.

<P>
<B>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:  </B>
<P>
North American bond markets rallied during the week 
ended Thursday, following the release of the U.S. 
Employment Cost Index and a 
weaker-than-expected report on U.S. orders for 
durable goods on Wednesday.  The absence of 
controversial remarks about current monetary policy 
by Fed Chairman Greenspan, when speaking before 
the Senate Finance Committee, and the report of 
higher U.S. jobless claims on Thursday also 
supported bond prices.  With the exception of U.S. 
30-year Treasury bonds, the yields on U.S. debt 
instruments declined from week-earlier levels.  
Canadian bonds moved in tandem with U.S. 
Treasuries, with yields on all maturities declining 
slightly.  This morning, the report of strong 
fourth-quarter-1996 economic growth in the United 
States failed to depress North American bond 
markets.  A lower-than-expected increase in the U.S. 
price deflator reassured investors that inflation 
remains subdued. 
<P>
<B>CANADIAN DOLLAR:  </B>
<P>
The Canadian dollar lost ground on Wednesday and 
Thursday, as investors chose to take some profits 
following a modest rally early in the week.  Although 
the Canadian dollar closed at 74.22 US cents on 
Thursday, below its week-earlier close of 74.35 US 
cents, the dollar stayed well above its 3-month low of  
72.67 US cents.  The U.S. dollar remained strong this 
week, as low interest rates in Europe and Japan 
continued to support capital flows into the United 
States. Concern over the financial difficulties of 
Japanese banks and the health of Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin also gave support to the U.S. dollar. The 
U.S. currency did, however, lose some ground against 
the German mark late in the week in reaction to 
comments by the Bundesbank that the recent decline 
of the mark against the U.S. dollar would end soon.

<H2>Weekly Digest of Economic and Financial Developments</H2>

<B>Toronto, January 24, 1997</B>
<P>
Only one major U.S. economic indicator was 
released this week -- the report on housing starts and 
building permits.  It showed that <B>the number of housing 
units started in the United States fell by more than 12 
per cent in December, to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 1.329 million units</B>.  In the fourth quarter, 
starts averaged 1.409 million units, almost 6 per cent 
below their third-quarter level.  Residential building 
permits behaved in a similar fashion.
<P>
Given the scarcity of economic statistics, financial 
markets focused their attention on the <B>testimony of 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan</B> before 
the Senate Budget Committee and the <B>Fed's Beige 
Book</B> on regional economic conditions. <B> Both 
documents were very balanced in their assessment 
of the U.S. economy, and as a result, perfectly 
ambiguous about the direction of Fed policy in the 
near term.</B>  In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan cited &quot;low 
inflation and quiescent inflation expectations&quot; as the 
dominant characteristic of the current U.S. economic 
expansion, while simultaneously questioning &quot;whether 
prospective labor market conditions will be consistent 
with the maintenance of satisfactory price performance&quot;.  
The Beige Book mentioned &quot;moderate&quot; economic 
growth, &quot;scattered evidence of increasing wage 
pressures&quot; but no &quot;significant price pressures other than 
for energy items&quot;.  The almost perfect balance in both 
reports suggests that <B>the Fed remains undecided 
about any change in the setting for monetary policy.</B>  
Since the main source of concern is the state of the 
labour markets, the Fed and investors will <B>scrutinize 
minutely the employment cost index for the fourth 
quarter of 1996, when it is released next Tuesday.</B>
<P>
Canada watchers had a full array of  statistics to 
examine, and most data painted a positive picture of the 
economy. <B> Canadian retail sales rose by 0.9 per cent 
in November </B>-- the third consecutive monthly gain -- 
with all of the increase coming from purchases of motor 
vehicles.  The<B> composite leading indicator rose by 0.7 
per cent in December</B>, boosted by a strong rise the 
housing component (a combination of housing starts and 
house sales) and the surge in the value of the  TSE 300 
stock price index.
<P>
<B>With the exception of energy prices, inflation 
at the consumer level remained subdued.</B>  Canada's 
consumer price index (CPI)  rose by 2.2 per cent from 
December 1995 to December 1996, as energy prices 
jumped by 5.4 per cent.  Excluding the prices of food and 
energy and the impact of indirect tax changes, the index 
rose by 1.7 per cent, confirming that the core rate of 
inflation remained in the bottom half of the Bank of 
Canada's 1 - 3 per cent target range.  At the same time, 
the <B>annual average increase in base wage rates in the 
labour settlements negotiated in November was a 
moderate 1.9 per cent,</B> and for all settlements in the first 
11 months of 1996,  a minimal 0.9 per cent -- the same 
as in 1995.
<P>
Somewhat disconcerting was the report that 
non-resident investors cut their investment in Canadian 
securities by C$3.3 billion in November.  The data 
suggest that non-residents were reacting to the autumn 
surge in the Canadian dollar and concomitant drop in 
Canadian short-term interest rates.  <B>Although foreign 
investors sold over C$5 billion of Government of 
Canada treasury bills in November, they remained 
net buyers of Canadian bonds and stocks.</B>  It appears 
that non-residents  continue to regard Canadian 
financial assets with favour and confidence.
<P>
<B>SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES:  </B>
<P>
North American debt markets weakened in advance of 
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
remarks to the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday, 
amid concern that his statements would spark a selloff.  
Although Mr. Greenspan's testimony and the Beige 
Book, released on Wednesday, alluded to scattered 
evidence of higher wages, the Fed statements were 
taken by investors to stress moderate growth and 
stable inflation, which supported the bond market.  
However, the gains were short-lived as supply 
pressures from new government and corporate debt 
issues placed upward pressure on fixed income 
yields.   The yield on Canadian 3-month T-bills 
remained virtually unchanged from the week before, 
closing on Thursday at 2.83 per cent.  In the United 
States, the yields on 3-month T-bills eased by 1 basis 
point over the week ended Thursday,  closing at 5.17 
per cent.
<P>

<P>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="JA24AT04.gif"  ><BR></B>
<P>
<B>BOND MARKETS AND YIELD CURVES:  </B>
<P>
In the first part of the week, Canadian and  U.S. bond 
yields were supported by the favourable interpretation 
of the comments by the Chariman of the Federal 
Reserve.  Reduced speculation of a Fed interest-rate 
hike helped to push bond prices higher.  However, the 
gains evaporated in reaction to supply pressures in 
both countries.  In the United States, auctions of 
2-year and 5-year Treasury notes and the 
announcement of the first auction of inflation-indexed 
10-year notes added to the already heavy supply of  
corporate debt.  In Canada, supply pressures came 
from a federal government issue of  C$1.3 billion of 
30-year bonds and two new corporate issues.  
Canadian bond prices also declined in reaction to 
slightly firmer-than-expected Canadian CPI data on 
Thursday.  For the week ended Thursday, the yields on 
Canadian and U.S. 30-year bonds closed  3 basis 
points higher.   
<P>
<B>CANADIAN DOLLAR:  </B>
<P>
After a strong two-week rally, the Canadian dollar lost 
some ground this week as investors realized some 
profits.  The dollar closed on Thursday at 74.35 US 
cents following light intervention by the Bank of 
Canada.  The recent strength in the Canadian dollar 
can be attributed to expectations of robust economic 
growth in Canada and hope of further sharp reductions 
in federal and provincial budget deficits.  Over the 
week, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen, hitting 
multi-month highs against the German mark and the 
Japanese yen.  Present and projected interest rate 
differentials between the United States and Europe 
and Japan contributed to the rise.  Comments by U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin arguing that a strong 
U.S. dollar is in the economic self interest of the United 
States, and indications that the G-7 nations agreed, 
also gave support to the U.S. dollar.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, February 5, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>Green Line Launches www.greenline.ca to Help Self-directed Investors
Better Manage Their Portfolios</h3>



<p><b>TORONTO</b> - Green Line Investor Services is opening a new on-ramp to the

portfolios.
<P>The new investor-oriented web site, created by Canada's most innovative discount broker,
can be accessed at <b>www.greenline.ca</b> effective at noon, Wednesday February 5.  It will
offer Green Line customers direct access to Green Line WebBroker, the firm's highly secure,
leading-edge, Internet-based securities trading service.

<P>&quot;The Internet allows us to add a whole new dimension to investor services,&quot; says
John See, President and Chief Operating Officer of Green Line. &quot;The delivery of real-time
information and pricing together with highly secure transaction capabilities through a low cost,
electronic distribution channel such as the Internet, has tremendous benefits for the average retail
investor.&quot;
<P>Green Line Investor Services remains integrated with The Toronto-Dominion Bank's
award-winning site <b>(www.tdbank.ca)</b>.  Visitors to the TD Bank site will be able to
connect directly to Green Line's site and vice versa through user-friendly search tools.

<h4>Quotes and Information Just Keystrokes Away</h4>
Green Line's new web site gives users free and unlimited access to delayed quotes on Canadian
and U.S. equities and options, as well as daily unit prices (net asset values) on the more than 575
mutual funds available through Green Line.  The new web site adds value with timely investment
information, such as real-time press releases from more than 1,500 publicly traded Canadian
companies.

<P>&quot;We've designed our new site to be extremely user-friendly and educational with the
addition of how-to guides on trading and mutual fund investing,&quot; says Mr. See.

<P>&quot;Technology-based services, like our new Green Line web site and Green Line
WebBroker, offer investors another way to conduct transactions and gives them access to
up-to-the-minute information they can use to make informed, independent investment
decisions,&quot; Mr. See points out. &quot;We expect that 50 per cent of our trading activity
will be conducted electronically by the year 2000.&quot;

<h4>Place Trades On-Line</h4>
Green Line WebBroker, which was introduced in pilot phase last August, was made available to
Green Line clients across Canada in December.  It enables investors who prefer to manage their
own portfolios to use the World Wide Web to access <i>real-time</i> stock quotes, company
information and place trade orders on-line.  They can also review, change or cancel orders,
update their portfolios and do research on a wide range of investment products 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. 
<P>&quot;Green Line WebBroker has gained tremendous momentum in recent weeks,&quot;
says Mr. See. &quot;And there's no sign of it slowing down.&quot;

<P>To sign up for Green Line WebBroker, investors must first open a Green Line account and
then call the Green Line Help Desk at (416) 982-6000, or 1-800-667-6299, to receive a user
identification and password.  Existing Green Line customers don't have to open a special
account; they just call in for their ID and password.

<h4>Clients Say Green Line WebBroker Goes Extra Mile</h4>
For Green Line customer Joe Carusone of Toronto, Green Line WebBroker is a prime example
of the way Green Line gives its clients what they want -- when they want it.  The 32-year-old
research associate has been using Green Line WebBroker for the past three months, and says it's
indispensable for managing his investment portfolio.

<P>&quot;I use the World Wide Web to learn about investment vehicles before I make a
commitment to invest,&quot;   says Mr. Carusone. &quot;I really appreciate the fact that Green
Line WebBroker allows me to place orders to buy or sell, or to get an up-to-the-minute quote on
a particular stock.  Now I can do everything I want in one easy on-line session.&quot;

<P>Miles Harris, a 34-year-old semi-retired investor who lives in Yellowknife, relies heavily on
the World Wide Web in general -- and Green Line WebBroker in particular -- for timely financial
information. 

<P>&quot;Green Line WebBroker is a perfect add-on to Green Line's web site,&quot; says Mr.
Harris, who is one of 20 residents in the North West Territories who subscribe to the service. 
&quot;I've been trading with Green Line for about six years, and in the past year, I've made the
most of the Green Line MicroMax and Green Line TeleMax electronic order entry services.

<P>&quot;But in recent months, the Internet has become my toolbox to manage my portfolio. 
And Green Line WebBroker is one of my favourite tools.  I use it to place buy and sell orders,
get quotes, and do research.  I sign on to the Internet at 7 a.m. when the market opens and sign
off at 3 p.m. when it closes.  I now depend on the Web and Green Line WebBroker for just about
all my investment needs -- so much so that I got rid of my fax machine.&quot;

<h4>Fast, Secure and Cost-effective</h4>
The savings don't stop there.  Active traders using Green Line WebBroker can pay as low as
$30.96 per transaction, and no monthly fee.  This represents an additional 20 per cent off
commissions that are already up to 88 per cent lower than those charged by traditional,
full-commission brokers.

<P>Supported by over 650 licensed Investment Representatives, Green Line WebBroker
perfectly complements the discount broker's DOS, Macintosh and Windows-based electronic
services, as well as the personal attention over the phone or in-branch.  

<P>Green Line WebBroker offers peace of mind by utilizing the highly secure Microsoft
Explorer or Netscape Navigator Internet Browser technology with 128 bit data encryption, the
only Canadian Internet brokerage service which requires this as a minimum level of security. 

<P>Mr. See says Green Line's new web site and its specialized trading services, such as Green
Line WebBroker, represent the firm's ongoing commitment to pass on cost savings to its clients
through leading edge technology that makes investing more accessible and affordable to the
retail investor.

<P>&quot;Our new site puts a wealth of information at the fingertips of anyone with a computer
and a modem,&quot; explains Mr. See. &quot;Whether you want to analyze 45 days worth of
history, or just get an update on the status of an order you ve placed, Green Line WebBroker
adds value to virtually every aspect of the investment process.&quot;

<P>Green Line Investor Services is a division of TD Securities Inc. which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth-largest bank.  With approximately 
$18 billion in assets under administration, Green Line serves over half a million Canadians.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, February 4, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD Evergreen Offers Strategies to Maximize Returns
 in Low Interest-Rate Environment</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - The continuing downward trend in interest rates is capturing the
attention of a steadily growing number of Canadian investors -- so much so, that many of them
are taking longer, harder looks at the performance of their portfolios.

<P>&quot;There's no doubt that low interest rates will continue to challenge Canadian investors
for the foreseeable future,&quot;  says Jeff Carney, President and Chief Operating Officer of TD
Evergreen, Canada's fastest-growing, full-service investment firm. &quot;The halcyon days of
earning a 19.5 percent return on Canada Savings Bonds and 17.5 percent on Treasury Bills are
long gone.  That's not to say that fixed-income investments are a thing of the past -- far from it. 
But for investors to earn a good rate of return, they will need to reconsider their tolerance for
risk.&quot;

<h4>Report Eliminates Guesswork</h4>
To help take some of the guesswork out of choosing the right investment vehicles for the times,
TD Evergreen has published the <I>Low Interest Rate Strategy Report</i>, a timely guide that
offers investors insight into how to maximize their abilities to generate the returns they require to
meet their financial goals.
<P>The guide is available free of charge at any TD Evergreen office across Canada, or by calling
1-800-983-2238.  This guide highlights a number of products, that when added to a diversified
portfolio, can help maximize returns in a low interest-rate environment.

<h4>A Challenge for Many</h4>
&quot;Financial security and retirement planning are crucial considerations for many
Canadians,&quot; Mr. Carney points out.   &quot;Others want to put together the down payment
for a house, while some are worried about how low interest rates will affect their income. 
Regardless of personal priorities, this guide offers individuals some investment alternatives, that
when added to a diversified portfolio, can help to minimize the effects of a low interest-rate
environment.&quot;
<P>Ana Escubedo, Vice-President, Investment Advisor Services and the author of the <i>Low
Interest Rate Strategy Report,</i> adds that &quot;this downtrend in interest rates is not only a
function of monetary and fiscal policies -- it results from changes in the population.
<P>&quot;As the demand for credit ebbs, it is being greeted by a torrent of baby-boom investors
who are eager to lend money to governments and institutions in return for a guaranteed rate of
return. As a result, supply is dwarfing demand for money in capital markets, and rates of return
on fixed-income investments are being driven down to levels not seen since the 1950s.&quot;
<P>Canadians who live off their fixed-income investments must maximize their current income.
To that end, the guide suggests they consider a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to
reduce risk and improve returns.  Blue-chip stocks -- the stalwarts of equity markets -- have the
potential to improve after-tax returns.  The preferential treatment of dividends can add to the
actual income you get to keep.  And, with their potential to grow in value, equities can offer a
way to grow capital as well. 
<h4>The Real Risk in Investing</h4>
&quot;You have to be goal-oriented; if you aim nowhere, you'll hit the mark every time,&quot; 
Mr. Carney warns. &quot;You must also be diversified.  It's a mistake to put all your eggs in one
basket.
<P>&quot;While there are new and exciting opportunities for investors, the benefits could be
lost if people don't understand which investments will help them achieve their financial goals. 
You've got to have a plan.&quot;
<P>Mr. Carney recommends that given the plethora of investment vehicles, most investors
should seek professional advice to help them make appropriate decisions.  And although he
advocates proceeding with caution, he is quick to add that the real risk in investing is not having
your money invested.
<P>TD Evergreen is a Division of TD Securities Inc., a subsidiary of  The Toronto-Dominion
Bank. Through its network of more than 230 Investment Advisors, TD Evergreen helps clients
achieve their financial goals through a full-range of investment vehicles, and life insurance and

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK PRESIDENT CHARLES BAILLIE CALLS FOR GREATER DEBATE
ON THE ISSUE OF BANK MERGERS</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - Speaking at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, TD Bank President 
Charles Baillie today called for greater debate on the issue of bank mergers.  Using TD's 
own experience, Mr. Baillie challenged the arguments being put forth by merger advocates.    

<P>&quot;On the surface, the case for bank mergers makes intuitive sense...greater size is
touted as the essential condition of success -- the bigger, the better.&quot;  Mr. Baillie
continued to say, &quot;Today, the issue is not gross quantity.  It is high quality.  Bigger is
not always better.  But better is always better.&quot;

<P>Baillie provided evidence that when it comes to efficiency, risk, service and clout the
smaller banks, especially TD, have outperformed.  

<P>The TD Bank President, who will take over as CEO in February emphasized,
&quot;The fact is, in today's world, you succeed by being smarter, by having a good strategy
and executing it well.  Size is not a strategy.  It's a statistic.&quot;  

<P>&quot;We are not opposed to acquisitions per se...Nor are we against the merger of
particular activities,&quot; continued Baillie. &quot;The point is: merging makes sense only
when it fits into a sensible strategy.&quot;

<P>Mr. Baillie added that being a better bank is far more important than being a bigger
bank. TD's commitment has always been to increase return on equity.  Mr. Baillie
emphasized, &quot;I would rather concentrate on adding additional percentage points to our
return on equity.  Innovation is the way to do that.  And, as anyone in virtually any business
will happily tell you -- there's little evidence that size bolsters innovation or creativity.&quot;

<P>One of the primary reasons for the current 10 per cent limit on bank ownership,
legislated in the mid-1960s, was because Chase Manhattan wanted to buy TD, not because
mergers were becoming popular. &quot;We must confront the implications of the probability
that lifting the 10 per cent limit would result in continental, not Canadian consolidation.&quot;

<P>&quot;Knowingly or unknowingly, while the word may be merger, the meaning is
American ownership.  That's a major public policy issue.  It is not being debated.  It should
be,&quot; concluded Mr. Baillie.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, January 22, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>STAY THE COURSE TO CONTINUE BENEFITTING FROM THE HEALTHY
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, SAYS TD BANK CHAIRMAN AND CEO</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - There is more good news ahead for Canadians who have seen their
economic prospects turn the corner on a very difficult period in Canada's economic history,
explained TD Bank Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Thomson to the Bank's
Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Toronto.

<P>Mr. Thomson cited a much healthier economic environment with low and stable
inflation rates and a strong Canadian dollar as reasons for his optimism. &quot;We are finally
beginning to reap the rewards of all the difficult -- and often painful -- adjustments that
governments, individuals and businesses have had to make in one way or another over the last
6 or 7 years.&quot;

<P>Mr. Thomson commented on the increasing global competitiveness of Canadian
businesses, pointing out that &quot;...our exports are booming and last year we achieved an
international current account surplus for the first time in 14 years.&quot;

<P>Through low inflation, low interest rates and a stable dollar Canadians can benefit from
an environment which encourages capital investment and economic growth. &quot;And growth
creates jobs,&quot; emphasized Mr. Thomson.  

<P>To continue benefitting from the progress that Canadians have made, monetary and
fiscal policies must be kept on track. &quot;And that means that we should support the Bank
of Canada in its pursuit of current monetary policy.  It also means that we should continue to
support our governments in their efforts to balance budgets and begin paying off some of that
huge debt that we have managed to accumulate over the last 20 years,&quot; stressed Mr.
Thomson. 

<P>Political stability and fiscal fortitude remain Canada's two biggest challenges. 
&quot;Although not much has been heard about Quebec separation lately -- we must remind
ourselves that the issue has not disappeared,&quot; he added. 

<P>Mr. Thomson noted that, &quot;...the new environment has led our customers -- both
consumers and businesses -- to demand new and better ways of managing funds and raising
capital.  TD has responded to this challenge.&quot;  Mr. Thomson cited TD's increasing
investments in the technology and training that allows the Bank to deliver a wide range of new
services.  

<P>TD is a market leader in computer banking and brokerage.  Full brokerage services,
mutual funds, investment management and investment banking have played a significant role in
TD Bank's overall success.  While the new ventures prosper, Thomson pointed out that,
&quot;Our traditional banking services are also showing healthy growth and 1997 looks like a
most promising year for TD.&quot; 

<P>By taking responsibility for its economic destiny and putting its fiscal house in order,
Canada will maintain a healthier economic environment which will benefit all Canadians.
&quot;Let us make sure that we encourage our governments to continue to operate in a
financially responsible manner, so that we can keep our economy growing -- and thereby
produce higher living standards for all Canadians,&quot; concluded Mr. Thomson.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, January 21, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK AND SIRROM CAPITAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCE NEW JOINT
VENTURE, SCC CANADA, TO FUND INNOVATIVE SMALL BUSINESS IN
CANADA</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - TD Bank announced today it has entered into a joint venture
agreement with Sirrom Capital Corporation of Nashville, Tennessee to create SCC Canada Inc.
to provide venture loans to Canadian small businesses.

<P>The new company will begin operations immediately.  SCC Canada will focus on lending to
service sector companies and will adapt innovative financing strategies developed by Sirrom
Capital Corporation.

<P>&quot;We are impressed with Sirrom's ability to finance service businesses and help them
expand and grow,&quot; says John Greenwood, a Vice President and Director in the Merchant
Banking group of TD Securities Inc. who will head up SCC Canada. &quot;For that reason, TD
is teaming up with Sirrom to bring its winning formula to Canadian small business.&quot;

<P>Sirrom Capital Corporation President and CEO George Miller is &quot;very excited by our
first venture outside of the United States.&quot;  He added, &quot;Having TD as our partner
here in Canada will help our investment immensely.&quot;

<P>SCC Canada will follow Sirrom's approach, which has been implemented in 150 companies
in  25 states, to provide venture loans of $500,000 to $5 million to smaller companies.  Sirrom's
borrowers are typically above-average performers with proven profitability, rapid growth (20 per
cent or more per year), sophisticated equity investors and skilled management teams holding
ownership positions.
                                  
<P>In addition to providing venture loans, Sirrom acquires equity positions in the borrower,
usually by obtaining warrants of the company.  This provides the company with a stake in the
success of their borrowers, and lends itself to a greater commitment by all involved. &quot;We
want to work with a company to help it succeed,&quot; says Miller. &quot;We invest in bright
people and we have found that assisting them is a profitable strategy.&quot;

<P>The new joint venture will be a Canadian corporation.  Its ownership will be divided
between  TD Capital Group Ltd. (60 per cent) and Sirrom Capital Corporation (40 per cent).  It
will be headquartered in Toronto and will focus on small business throughout Canada.  

<P>Greenwood comes to the new company after spending 13 years in the venture capital
industry. &quot;John will provide leadership in this role,&quot; says John MacIntyre, Vice Chair
of Merchant Banking at TD Securities. &quot;He has tremendous knowledge of the Canadian
investment industry, as well as a keen understanding of the needs of small business.&quot;

<h3>JOB GROWTH AND LOW INTEREST RATES TO UNDERPIN CANADIAN
ECONOMIC EXPANSION</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - The prospects for the Canadian economy this year and in 1998 are
the brightest in several years, say TD Economists in the latest issue of the <I>TD Quarterly
Economic Report.</i> &quot;After a long period of adjustment, retrenchment, and slow
growth, the Canadian economy is poised for liftoff,&quot; says Ruth Getter, Senior Vice
President and Chief Economist at TD. 

<P><b>Canadian expansion healthy, more balanced</b><br>
The Canadian economy is expected to expand at a rate of about 3 per cent per year in both
1997 and 1998 -- twice the rate recorded last year.  Stronger employment gains, combined
with low interest rates, will be the key to improving consumer confidence -- and spending --
over the next two years.

<P>While the unemployment rate is currently quite high, at 9.7 per cent, job prospects will
improve steadily in Canada over the next two years, bringing the rate to just below 9 per cent
by the end of 1998. &quot;We expect a total of about 265,000 net new jobs to be created in
1997, and an additional 280,000 new jobs in 1998,&quot; says Getter. &quot;This is a major
improvement from annual gains of less than 200,000 jobs in each of the last 2 years.&quot;

<P>The <i>TD Quarterly Economic Report</i> notes that the Canadian economy will
be spurred by domestic demand in 1997-98, led by an acceleration in consumer spending,
further growth in business investment and strong activity in the new and resale housing
markets.  Exports -- the key to Canadian growth in the 1990's -- will continue to do well.  As
the U.S. economy expands at a sustainable pace of about 2 per cent per year, demand for
Canadian exports should continue to climb over the next few years.
<P><b>Government deficit reduction paying off</b><br>
&quot;The great success story in Canada in the past two years has been the dramatic
turnaround in Canadian government finances,&quot; says Getter.  Following a number of
years of spending restraint, Canadian federal and provincial governments have made great
progress in eliminating budget deficits -- and in some cases, reducing debt.

<P>&quot;The prospects for Canadian governments to balance their books before the year
2000 are excellent,&quot; says Getter. &quot;Healthy economic growth and continued low
interest rates will help a number of governments in Canada to meet their deficit-elimination
and debt-reduction goals sooner than planned.&quot;

<P><b>Provincial outlook: Ontario, Alberta to lead this year</b>
Most provincial economies will fare better this year than last.  (Text follows)

<P>Ontario will lead the provinces in economic growth in both 1997 and 1998, propelled by
a pickup in consumer spending and housing activity as well as a rapid rise in manufacturing
output.  The expansion in the Alberta economy will almost match the pace set in Ontario this
year, as the oil and natural gas industries continue to prosper.  Although economic conditions
in British Columbia and Quebec will improve this year, growth will remain below the national
average, partly as a result of a weak recovery in the pulp and paper industries.  Among the
remaining provinces, economic performances will range from above-average growth in
Manitoba to a slight decline in activity in Prince Edward Island in 1997.
                                
<P><b>Canadian dollar to climb, but exports will remain strong</b><br>
The Canadian dollar will strengthen somewhat, climbing to 77 U.S. cents by late 1998. 
&quot;Canadian exporters will remain competitive with a dollar at that level,&quot; says
Getter, &quot;and we do not believe that the dollar will climb much higher than that over the
next year or two.&quot;

<P><b>Canadian long-term rates to dip below U.S. rates</b><br>
Due to Canada's superior inflation performance, the dramatic reduction in Canadian
government deficits, and the shift in the international current account to a surplus, Canadian
interest rates for maturities up to five years dropped below U.S. rates in 1996.  At the same
time, the Canadian dollar held its ground against the U.S. dollar.  TD Economists expect U.S.
monetary policy to remain unchanged this year and next. &quot;We expect Canadian short-term
interest rates to remain well below U.S. rates, and for long-term interest rates to fall
below U.S. rates by early next year,&quot; according to the report.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, January 16, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>GREEN LINE OFFERS CANADIANS MORE INCENTIVES TO CONTRIBUTE
TO RRSPs</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO</b> - Green Line Investor Services -- Canada's leading discount broker -- is
making it even more attractive for Canadians to contribute to registered retirement savings plans
by waiving annual administration fees on its two plan options.

<P>Effective immediately, Green Line is also eliminating the annual administration fee for all
retirement plan accounts for those with balances of more than $25,000.

<P>As a special incentive to invest now, the brokerage will waive the annual $100
administration fee for every $10,000 contributed to one of its self-directed RSPs.  Green Line
will also waive the $25 administration fee for one year on any new Green Line Focus RSP,
regardless of the contribution amount.  This offer, which expires March 1, applies to new account
openings, as well as to funds transferred to Green Line from other financial institutions.

<P>&quot;It is hoped that this program will help spur Canadians into taking a more active role to
provide for themselves in their retirement years,&quot; says John See, President and Chief
Operating Officer of Green Line. &quot;Research has revealed that a secure retirement is the top
priority for 40 per cent of investors.  Baby-boomers, in particular, are keenly aware of the need to
invest aggressively today to guarantee financial security tomorrow.  This attitude has
far-reaching implications for all Canadians -- regardless of their economic circumstances.&quot;

<h4>Plans for All Reasons</h4>

Green Line's Focus RSP is aimed at first-time contributors and those who are considering
investing with a discount broker.  Like their full-fledged, self-directed cousins, investors can
choose from a comprehensive list of the most popular RRSP-eligible vehicles, including more
than 570 mutual funds, guaranteed investment certificates, Government of Canada, provincial
and corporate bonds, strips, treasury bills, term deposits and cash.

<P>Green Line will waive the $25 annual administration fee for those who sign up before March
1.

<P>More seasoned investors will likely prefer to go the full self-directed route.  Unlike the
Focus Option, self-directed RSPs offer a greater number of eligible investments -- most notably
stocks and equity options in addition to all other eligible RSP investments.  And if they act now,
investors can save the annual administrative fee (up to $100) for every $10,000 they deposit or
transfer from another financial institution.  If the plan account balance is $25,000 or greater, the
fee is eliminated completely.

<P>&quot;Green Line's self-directed plans give the investor more freedom to tailor their plans to
their financial goals and objectives,&quot; Mr. See points out.

<P>&quot;A self-directed plan opens doors to investors such as the potential to maintain the
maximum
allowable amount of foreign content.  This, in turn, can not only reduce risk through
diversification, but can lead to enhanced overall performance.&quot;

<h4>Help on Demand</h4>

Since administration fees for registered retirement savings plans are no longer tax-deductible, the
fact that Green Line is waiving its administration fees is worth more to investors than they may
realize.  And Green Line has a variety of services to help investors get the biggest bang for their
retirement dollars, including:

<ul>
<li><b>telephone support.</b>  Green Line is an unbiased source of expert information to help
Canadians make their own investment decisions.  Investors can speak directly to Green Line
Mutual Fund Specialists by calling 1-800-465-LINE (5463);<br><br>

<li><b>electronic real-time services.</b>  Personal computer services compatible with DOS, 
Macintosh, Windows and Internet application platforms which give access to market and
portfolio information any time, anywhere and can reduce trading commissions by an additional
10 to 20 per cent when used to place trade orders;<br><br>

<li><b>investor reports.</b>  Complementing Green Line's monthly newsletters and research
catalogues, Green Line can provide investors with analysis and reports that explain and chart the
performances of numerous investment alternatives and more than 5,000 Canadian and U.S.
market listed securities; and <br><br>

<li><b>seminars.</b>  Throughout the RRSP season, many of Green Line's 29 branches across
Canada will hold special sessions on how to maximize returns on retirement investments.</ul>

<h4>Retirement Savings a Year-Round Priority</h4>

&quot;Canadians must view saving for retirement as a year-round priority.  That's why Green
Line offers monthly purchase plans for a variety of mutual funds,&quot; says Mr. See.

<P>&quot;Investors who contribute to their RRSPs throughout the year at regular intervals can
take advantage of the benefits of compound interest to make their nesteggs grow more
quickly,&quot; he explains. &quot;It is also a less stressful way to save for retirement because
you don't have to scramble for a lump sum around deadline time.&quot;

<P>In 1996, more Canadians opened accounts and placed trade orders through Green Line than
in any other year in the brokerage's 12-year history.  Green Line clients established more than
150,000 new accounts -- including 36,500 RRSP accounts -- Green Line ranked number one or
number two in monthly total listed market retail brokerage transactions throughout 1996
(according to the TSE Revenue and Market Analysis Study data on all listed markets for which
data is reported).
<P>In December alone, which traditionally marks the beginning of the year's RRSP campaign,
Green Line's registered savings plan account openings were up a remarkable 150 per cent over
the comparable period last year.

<P>Green Line Investor Services is a division of TD Securities Inc., which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.  With Approximately $18 billion in assets under
administration, it serves more than half a million Canadians.

<A NAME="SEC1"><H2>Developing Your Business Plan</H2></A>

<P>Unless you enjoy the challenge of discovering new territories without any kind of assistance, you are not likely to try to reach an unfamiliar destination without a road map. Using a map helps minimize the risks of getting lost.
Similarly, by using a business plan you can minimize the risks of losing time and money usually associated with starting a new business venture. 


<P>The following material outlines details that are usually found in business plans.





<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC2">Objectives.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC3">Competition.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC4">Clients.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC5">Pricing Your Services.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC6">Operating Requirements.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC7">Financial Considerations: Start-up and Forecasting Statements.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#SEC8">Using your plan.</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Small_Business/BUSPLANLIC.HTML">Download a copy of the Business Planner software.</A>
</OL>


<HR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC2" ->
<A NAME="SEC2"><H2>1.  Objectives. </H2></A>
<P>Your objectives will describe in detail the products or services that you will provide. They could reflect the image you want to project to your clients. They might also reflect the market or niche market in which you plan to specialize, and the type of client base you would like to build. In their finished form, your objectives should read like the copy for a well-prepared 30-second commercial: clean, concise and complete.
<!- Named anchor "SEC3" ->
<A NAME="SEC3"><H2>2.  Competition.</H2></A> 
<P>A thorough analysis of your competition is essential. This will include answers to the following questions:

<UL>
<LI>Who are your competitors?
<LI>Where are they located?
<LI>How long have they been in business?
<LI>How do they price their services?
<LI>Who are their major customers?
<LI>What are their unique strengths?
<LI>What are their unique weaknesses?
<LI>What can they do better than I can?
<LI>What can I do better than they can?
</UL>
Gather the information necessary for this analysis from your own knowledge of the competition, from suppliers, clients, colleagues, third parties or anyone with solid information about your competition.
	When reviewing information, consider its source. Is the information realistic and believable? Is the source of the information credible? Is the information intended to be deceptive or to mislead? Once you have analyzed the information, develop a profile of the competition that will make it possible to differentiate your business from theirs. The profile will also make it possible to project why clients will prefer your services over those of the competition. A written summary of the analysis will form part of the business plan.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC4" ->
<A NAME="SEC4"><H2>3.  Clients.</H2></A>
 <P>For purposes of the business plan, prepare a brief summary describing your clients and the needs they have that you will be meeting.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC5" ->
<A NAME="SEC5"><H2>4.  Pricing Your Services.</H2></A> 
<P>Include a brief summary covering:
<MENU>
<LI>Hourly and daily rate.
<LI>Average fees per project.
<LI>Projected total fees.
<LI>Break-even point - level of sales to just cover operating expenses.
<LI>Comparison of your prices to the competition.
</MENU>
Again, use only those items that apply to your business - if you supply products, only the last three items would be included.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC6" ->
<A NAME="SEC6"><H2>5.  Operating Requirements.</H2></A>
<P>This section of the business plan identifies the licenses, permits and resources that you will require to begin and maintain your operation. Included in these requirements are:
<MENU>
<LI>Compliance with federal, provincial or state and municipal government regulations.
<LI>Obtaining the necessary permits and licenses to conduct your specific business.
<LI>Registration for the collection of sales tax, if applicable.
<LI>Acquisition of major pieces of equipment and furniture.
<LI>Skills required to provide services to clients, and the source and cost of acquiring those skills.
<LI>If dealing with third-party financing, i.e., banks or private investors, an outline of your own relevant skills and experience to confirm that you can make a successs of your business.
</MENU>
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC7" ->
<A NAME="SEC7"><H2>6.  Financial Considerations: Start-up and Forecasting Statements.</H2></A>
<P>(Preparing these statements is detailed in a separate area of the book.). In their final form, they should be incorporated into the business plan.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC8" ->
<A NAME="SEC8"><H2>7.  Using your plan.</H2></A>
<p>Once prepared, your business plan should not be consigned to the bottom drawer of your desk. Just as you use a road map to monitor your progress toward a destination, you should use your plan to monitor progress towards your ultimate business goals. If the business is developing as planned, you can be confident that, if you stay on course, you will achieve your overall goals. Conversely, if things are not developing as planned, you can make mid-course correctionns or modify your goals. Your business plan can and will serve as an effective road map, provided you consult it regularly.

<!- Named anchor "SEC1" ->
<A NAME="SEC1"><H2>1.	Maintain steady business hours.</H2></A>
<P>Although you are physically separated from the business community, your home business operation must be accessible to and compatible with it. This means operating your business during hours compatible with those of your existing and potential customers, contacts and referral sources.
	Further, by maintaining steady business hours, you will develop the discipline of concentrating on your work responsibilities and minimizing the potential impact from household distractions. Equally important, you will minimize the spillover of business activities into family and social life.
<BR>

<!- Named anchor "SEC2" ->
<A NAME="SEC2"><H2>2.	Maintain a separate business telephone line.</H2></A>
<P>A separate business telephone line will make it easier for clients to contact you. The line may be listed in the telephone directory and Yellow Pages if you choose. With a separate line, all business calls will be handled in a professional manner.
	A separate line will also make it possible to close shop when you are no longer working. An answering machine or answering service will ensure that business calls are answered appropriately after normal business hours.
<BR>

<!- Named anchor "SEC3" ->
<A NAME="SEC3"><H2>3.	Establish your office away from living areas.</H2></A>
<P>As much as possible, your business activities should be separated from your personal activities. This will ensure that client paperwork does not get used for grocery lists or other family notes and messages. The physical separation will also help protect the confidentiality of your dealings with clients.
	Having your office away from living areas will also help you maintain the personal discipline that you need to work at home. Some people go so far as to physically leave the house when it is time to go to work. They may walk around the block, re-enter the house (often by a different door) and proceed to the office.
<BR>

<!- Named anchor "SEC4" ->
<A NAME="SEC4"><H2>4.	Organize your office efficiently.</H2></A>
<P>Unless your office is located in a very unusual setting, you can expect few clients to visit. (One consultant, who for a short time operated his business from his sailboat moored in a local marina, reports that while there, every one of his clients came to see him!) As a result of not having to maintain appearances for clients, there is a risk of your home office becoming an unmanageable jumble of paper, books and so on.
	You should organize and maintain your home office according to the same standards that you would use in regular office premises. As well as helping to reinforce your personal discipline, efficient organization will prevent important pieces of paper from going astray.
<BR>


<!- Named anchor "SEC5" ->
<A NAME="SEC5"><H2>5.	Establish and follow definite work routines.</H2></A>
<P>Your home office work routines should not be significantly different from those you followed in other work situations. This will involve planning your day and working according to that plan.
<BR>


<!- Named anchor "SEC6" ->
<A NAME="SEC6"><H2>6.	Use fixed price contracts.</H2></A>
<P>Prices for your services should be a set contract based on the value that your clients will receive; i.e., a set fee rather than an hourly or daily rate.
<BR>

<!- Named anchor "SEC7" ->
<A NAME="SEC7"><H2>7.	Sell value.</H2></A>
<P>Clients are primarily interested in what they will be receiving for their money; they are less interested in either the time you spend on a project or your rates. Paying for your services on a fixed price basis, clients can attach a cost to the benefits that they will receive.
<BR>

<!- Named anchor "SEC8" ->
<A NAME="SEC8"><H2>8.	Follow your business plan and your marketing plan.</H2></A>
<P>Once completed, these plans represent a significant investment of time and energy. They are not intended to be historical documents cast in stone and bound for the archives. They should serve as road maps or blueprints, providing you with an overall sense of direction. Your plans should give you the inspiration and direction to keep forging ahead to your goals when you seem to be bogged down in details.
	For future reference, you should record any changes or modifications to your business or marketing plan. This will help ensure the accuracy of your planning process the next time you go through it. It will also help ensure that your goals and strategies are realistic in light of your services and your clients.
<BR>


<!- Named anchor "SEC9" ->
<A NAME="SEC9"><H2>9.	Extend your services through sub-contracts, joint ventures and part-time staff.</H2></A>
<P>With finite resources, there are limits to the services that you can provide directly and limits to the number and type of clients whom you can serve. By sub-contracting services to others, or working on projects as a joint venture, you can dramatically increase your service potential.
	Similarly, by hiring part-time support staff, you may also significantly increase your service capability. The same principles apply: know what you need and ask for it.
<BR>


<!- Named anchor "SEC10" ->
<A NAME="SEC10"><H2>10.	Stand behind your services.</H2></A>
<P>Your services are at least as good as those of your competitors. If this were not true, you should not have started your business in the first place. Your commitment to providing top-quality services should be high enough that you can guarantee your clients' satisfaction. This is not "satisfaction guaranteed or money refunded." The guarantee is "satisfaction guaranteed or I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy." Note also that you are guaranteeing your services, not the end results. You can guarantee your services because you can control them; you can't guarantee end results because you cannot control your clients' actions. Ensure that you and your customer understand the distinction.

<A NAME="SEC1"><H2></H2></A>



<!- Named anchor "SEC1" ->
<A NAME="SEC1"><H2>1. Clients don't want the service itself; they want the benefits of the service.</H2></A>
<P>This is particularly true of most professional services. Except for the occasional person who thrives on the attention that comes from medical treatment or court actions, most clients aren't thrilled with spending time, energy and money visiting their dentist or auto body shop.
	What clients really want are the benefits that come from the service. These benefits may include help in resolving a problem or assistance in acquiring information, or even purchasing knowledge or skills that they lack. For example, the benefits of dental services would be healthier, more attractive teeth. Similarly, the benefits of time-consuming auto body shop services might include the repair and use of a damaged motor vehicle.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC2" ->
<A NAME="SEC2"><H2>2.	Clients need your service.</H2></A>
<P>Customers usually consider their internal resources before looking elsewhere to purchase services. This means that you are not your clients' first choice. They need you to perform some task that they are unwilling or unable to perform for themselves.
	Thus, the services that you ultimately deliver to your clients are defined by their own needs. Services could be the performance of specific tasks such as writing an operations manual or preparing advertising copy. Alternatively, the services could involve providing specialized information and knowledge such as a summary of attractive investments. In many cases, the services involve both providing information and performing specific tasks, such as summarizing potential investments and then purchasing investments on the client's behalf.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC3" ->
<A NAME="SEC3"><H2>3.	Clients demand quality service.</H2></A>
<P>The demand for quality service is widespread in contemporary society. This demand is just as commonplace with business people as it is with consumers, and results from two forces working simultaneously.
	Business people are also consumers. Like everyone else, they are bombarded with advertising that emphasizes quality as a vital component of fast food, cars, home appliances, housing, travel accommodations and so forth. The message is bound to spill over into their work. If quality is an important component of their personal lives, then shouldn't it also be a component of their work lives? If the products they purchase as consumers are &quot;quality checked,&quot; why should they settle for anything less at work?
	The second force is the increasing number of business organizations currently adopting formal quality programs. Total Quality Management, or TQM, is becoming one of the most popular buzz-words of the 90s. A key TQM principle requires suppliers, e.g., you and your competitors, to provide evidence of your ability to deliver quality goods and services to your clients. Failure to provide this evidence will put you at a serious disadvantage when competing with those who can.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC4" ->
<A NAME="SEC4"><H2>4.	Quality service is what your clients say it is.</H2></A>
<P>Many retail businesses have posted signs with the following rules of customer service:
Rule #1: 	The client is always right.
Rule #2: 	If you think the client is wrong, read Rule #1.
This is one way of defining quality service. If your standards of quality coincide with or exceed your clients' standards, you will be successful. If your standards fail to meet those of your clients, you risk losing their business.
	A cautionary note: Clients' standards for one reason or another may be unrealistic. They may not fully understand what they require from you. They may also not fully understand what you can and cannot do for them. It is your responsibility to ensure that the client understands your services and the standards of quality that may be reasonably expected.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC5" ->
<A NAME="SEC5"><H2>5.	Providing technical information is not quality service.</H2></A>
<P>Generally speaking, most clients are looking for more than technical information.
	For example, when I consider purchasing new software for my computer system, I want to know whether the software will perform specific functions. I am not looking for a lecture on the technical specifications of the latest version of the piece of software. Quality service in this situation consists of listening to what I am asking, and applying whatever technical information may be relevant to answering my questions in terms that I can understand. Like most consumers, I am usually ready to purchase when I understand what I am buying and what benefits I will receive.
	The same principles apply regardless of the field. Do not simply recite technical information to clients: draw on your knowledge to help them understand how the technical information can be applied in their unique situations. Ensure that your clients fully understand the benefits that can reasonably be expected as a result of your service.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC6" ->
<A NAME="SEC6"><H2>6.	Clients do not always understand your technical jargon.</H2></A>

<P>As we become more familiar with technical information we learn to communicate with our colleagues and peers in a form of oral shorthand or jargon. Consultants perform &quot;SWOT analyses,&quot; financial analysts &quot;crunch some numbers, &quot;psychologists administer a &quot;WISC-III,&quot; and so on. To those in the know, the meaning of these terms is perfectly clear. To the uninitiated, they are gobbledygook. Communicating with clients involves treading a fine line between using terminology that is too technical, and talking down to the client by using language that is too simple. It is vitally important to listen carefully to each client - as an individual.
	Knowing your client will enable you to assess what he or she knows now and what he or she needs to learn in order to make a decision. This will also enable you to frame your questions and comments in terms that your client will understand fully.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC7" ->
<A NAME="SEC7"><H2>7.	Standardized technical services will produce comparable results, regardless of the provider of the service.</H2></A>
<P>This is true of every standardized service area. Various insurance brokers will provide policies with analogous features. Although independent, they act as sales agents for the same insurance companies. Similarly, assuming they follow the same procedures for the same purposes, independent researchers will produce similar results. They are after all, considering the same information base.
	The farther one moves away from standardized services, the easier it becomes to distinguish services amongst competing businesses. Those services of individual consultants are often defined by their unique skills, knowledge and experience. Thus, two individual consultants may offer quite different but equally workable solutions for the same problem. The best solution is clearly the one that works best for the client.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC8" ->
<A NAME="SEC8"><H2>8.	Client service is intangible.</H2></A>
<P>Services are intangible: they cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard or smelled before they are purchased. This means that clients who are considering the purchase of services must draw inferences of quality indirectly.
	In the case of large organizations, this means looking at physical premises, personnel, equipment, communications material, symbols and logos and the price of the service. In home businesses, the range is limited to you, your communications material, your symbols and logos and your pricing. Obviously, with fewer criteria on which you're being evaluated, you must strive to exceed client expectations.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC9" ->
<A NAME="SEC9"><H2>9.	Customer service is variable.</H2></A>
<P>Because service cannot be mass produced on an assembly line, the same service can vary from one provider to another. Although it is true that all hair stylists receive the same basic training, it is unlikely each one would create the identical hair style for a specific client.
	In less standard service areas such as consulting, there is considerable variance from practitioner to practitioner. With no uniform training and continuing education standards, consultants are free to provide whatever services they believe will sell. In situations like this, any standardization or consistency of service standards occurs more by coincidence than design.
<BR>
<!- Named anchor "SEC10" ->
<A NAME="SEC10"><H2>10.	Client service is perishable.</H2></A>
<P>Services cannot be produced and stored in inventory until they are needed. They are produced and used virtually simultaneously. This often results in service providers experiencing significant peaks and valleys in workload - and revenue - during the year. For example, businesses that prepare tax returns face high demand for their services between February and April and low demand between July and September.

<H2>About the Author - Larry Easto</H2>
<TABLE>
	<TR>
		<TD valign=top><IMG SRC="gifs/face.gif"></TD>
		<TD valign=top>Larry Easto, a former practising lawyer, and now a business consultant, has over
		twenty years experience in the field of small business.  In addition to having
		the hands-on experience of running his own business, he has lectured and written
		articles on a variety of topics dealing with business and law.
		<P>He began working on the first edition of this book in the fall of 1992.  Since
		that time he has spoken to hundreds of people who either operate a business from
		home of are thinking of doing so.
		<P>For Larry, the most significant development has been the increased respectability
		of home businesses.  Until fairly recently, few people were willing to talk
		openly about their businesses being home-based.  Over the past few years, he
		observes that we have come to acknowledge home businesses as "real".
	
<P>Current estimates indicate that more than 2 million Canadians conduct some or all
of their business from home, and experts tell us that with changes in the
marketplace and advances in communication, this number is certain to increase.

<P>Operating a business from your home offers a whole set of opportunities and
challenges.  In &quot;How to succeed in Your Home Business &quot;, Larry  shows the
home-based entrepreneur both the pitfalls and potential of the self-operated home
office.</TD>

<h2>YOUR BANK IS PEOPLE....<br> 

<br>



</h2>

<br>

<h3> January 24, 1996</h3><br>

<p><b>Remarks By:<br>

A. Charles Baillie<br> President<br>

Toronto Dominion Bank<br>

<br>

<br>

To:<br>

Annual Meeting of Shareholders<br>

Toronto, Ontario<br>

</b></p>



<br>Ladies and gentlemen:<br>



<p>The Chairman mentioned that millions of Canadians own this Bank and

benefit from its profits.  What I want to talk about are the <u>thousands </u>

of Canadians who work hard to <u>earn</u> the profits and build long lasting value

for our shareholders by serving our customers well.



<p>I am talking about our employees -- the people of TD Bank -- the people

who <u>are</u> the Bank.  Your Bank.  



<p>Your Bank is not the office towers at King and Bay.  It is not a thousand

branches across Canada and around the world.  Your Bank is thirty thousand

people -- serving customers, developing financial solutions, coming up with

new ideas, leading and implementing new businesses... providing advice...

learning new products and services... getting better all the time at what they

do.  

Thirty thousand full and part time employees -- thirty thousand individuals... 

That's Your Bank.



<p>Your Bank is people like Val Emond, a personal lending officer in our

branch in Fernie, British Columbia.  A few years ago, all the local mines in

Fernie were shut down, and half the town was unemployed.  Val Emond

worked long and hard with our customers, to help work out loans and

mortgages.  Our customers came through with just one foreclosure, the branch

had minimal credit losses, the Fernie Chamber of Commerce gave the branch

a special award -- and TD became known in Fernie as "the people's bank",

and has seen phenomenal growth there ever since. 



<p>Your Bank is individuals like Winnie Sim, a personal banker at a TD Bank

and Trust branch in Edmonton.  Winnie has been praised by customers and

staff alike for always going the extra mile -- and for taking the time to make

new customers -- including children and new Canadians -- feel at home at TD. 

She has also been instrumental in the development of our very effective Asian

Banking Focus -- helping to make TD Your Bank Your Way for the Asian

community.



<p>Your Bank is people like Brian Tracy, manager of a branch in Montreal,

who uncovered a con artist scam that was victimizing an elderly customer. 

Brian brought in social workers as well as employees from TD Trust to help

the elderly woman maintain her financial security.



<p>These are all people who make a difference in the Bank... make a difference

for their customers... make a difference for their communities... helping to

make the Bank a better place and their communities a better place -- with an

exceptional level of caring and commitment, of leadership and initiative.  



<p>These employees were among 122 TDers who have honoured us and were

honoured in turn with our first TD National Award of Excellence.  They were

among 500 people selected by their peers for an Award of Excellence at the

division level -- who were among 3,000 TD people nominated for the Award.



<p>Some of these employees are here today -- our ushers were all honoured

with the division award, marked by a gold lapel pin.  And those with the

national award proudly wear a similar pin with a TD green stone.  When you

see someone wearing one of these pins, you will know that that person has

demonstrated qualities and values that inspire us all.  [Will all those people

here today please stand up to be recognized.  Congratulations.]



<p>They will give you a sense of <u>who</u> TD Bank is, and what it is.  It is

people who care about what they do, and work hard to do it. And it is

certainly not just those who received awards.  



<p>Your Bank is made of the many thousands of employees who donate

millions of dollars to charities, and who generously volunteer their time to

community activities.



<p>Your Bank is made of the thousands of employees who are making small

business banking -- what we call "Main$treet Banking" -- a reality.  Just a

year ago, Main$treet Banking was available in a third of our branches -- now

it's in two thirds -- and by the end of this year, employees in every one of our

branches will be working hard to make it easier for small businesses to grow

and prosper with TD.  



<p>Your Bank is made of the hundreds of people who have been developing

electronic services that make it easier for customers -- whether it's satellite

banking in the Yukon, or the best Internet web site of all Canadian companies,

or the development of a superior home PC banking product we'll be launching

later this year.



<p>Your Bank is made of the five thousand employees who have upgraded

their learning to become qualified to provide mutual funds to our customers --

and who completed our demanding National Education Review.  Incidentally,

both Dick Thomson and I wrote the Review -- and believe me, it was

demanding.



<p>Thanks to those five thousand employees, TD Bank was Number One of

Canada's 12 major financial institutions in a survey about mutual fund advice

and knowledge at the branches -- we were number one in every city across

Canada.  That superior service, combined with the strong performance of our

Green Line No-Load Mutual Funds, has led to solid asset growth.  And growth

is continuing this year -- even before RSP season gets into full swing, our

mutual fund hotline is handling 4,000 calls a day, and Green Line is handling

over 73,000 calls a day. 



<p>With five thousand qualified mutual fund salespeople serving our

customers, we are confident in moving ahead as the first bank in Canada to

sell other brand name mutual funds besides our own in our branches.  Our

people are transforming our branches into the kind of one-source financial

shopping centres that our customers want.  



<p>We are already the leader in our industry in selling third party paper in

our branches.  And we are the leader in integrating trust services into our

branch system -- we now have 201 TD Bank and Trust branches.  Hopefully,

you have noticed the TD Bank and Trust signs that are appearing on branches

in communities across the country.



<p>The thousands of people who serve customers in our branches have been

working hard to develop the skills and knowledge that are essential to meeting

our customers' needs in all these areas.



<p>With people such as these, Your Bank achieved a lot in 1995.  Our record

earnings and our financial performance are detailed in the

annual report, so I won't repeat them all here.  But what I find particularly

significant is that improvements in our performance were so widespread -- a

significant reduction in credit losses, an increase in interest income, and strong

growth in other income, a reflection of improvements in so many of our

businesses.



<p>These results reflect efforts throughout the Bank -- and they reflect the

benefit today of businesses we entered yesterday.   Your Bank has entered

many new businesses in the past few years -- to service our customers better

and to maintain our competitiveness.  And we are already beginning to see a

positive impact from some of our new ventures -- including a number of

initiatives of my predecessor, Robin Korthals -- initiatives such as the $5

service guarantee... the TD/GM Visa card... Green Line Investor Services... the

acquisition of what is now TD Trust... 



<p>We are beginning to reap the benefits.  But we're not just harvesting what

was planted years ago -- we're planting and cultivating for the future.



<p>Another area where we have been doing a lot of planting is at TD

Securities Inc., where we made a major leap forward in 1995.  Rapidly

building its capabilities and recruiting strong individuals and teams -- while

broadening distribution with the expansion of TD Evergreen, our full service

broker -- TD Securities has emerged as a significant player -- bringing benefits

to our clients, and broadening our client relationships.  



<p>TD Securities is already number one in some key areas -- including private

placements, asset securitization, and discount brokerage...  And it has

participated in virtually every major equity issue of the past year -- and in

many of the high profile M&A deals -- such as Stone Consolidated-Rainy

River. TD Securities is already providing solid returns -- and it has the momentum to

build long lasting value for our shareholders.



<p>The 2000 people who are making TD Securities a force to be reckoned with

are your Bank.  So are the employees who launched the TD Gold Travel Card,

and TD Life, and reverse mortgages, and U.S. banking services for Canadian

commercial customers in 1995.  So are the people who opened new offices for

TD Evergreen across the country -- and for Green Line in the United States.  



<p>So are the people in our new high yield group in New York, and our new

Eurobond desk in London, and our new representative office in Mexico, and

our new trade office in Houston, and our new corporate finance office in

Singapore and our new branch in India.



<p>So are the employees who launched the TD VISA Cash card last month --

a smart card with stored value for low dollar purchases.  This will give our

customers more payment options.



<p>These people are Your Bank -- and they have been developing and

launching initiatives to keep us at the forefront in meeting customer needs. 

(You will get a sense of some of these initiatives and businesses at the displays

we have set up in the room next door.)



<p>Clearly, the employees of TD Bank have been doing a lot of things to

generate record profits... and we aim, as Dick Thomson mentioned -- to do

even better in the year ahead -- to deliver more for all our millions of

shareholders by delivering more to our millions of customers...  And we have

the people, the management team, and the strategies to get there.



<p>In our Annual Report, we talked about a key strategy for growth in very

competitive times... and that is building on core strengths that differentiate TD

-- that make us stand out from the competition.  Those strengths are -- first,

being the integrated bank, where one relationship manager gets to know the

customer well and handles all of that customers' needs... second, being the

bank of industry specialization, where our understanding and knowledge of

our customers' industries adds value to the relationships... and third, being the

bank that makes it easier for customers by delivering superior service and

advice.  



<p>These core strengths give us a competitive advantage -- the kind of

advantage that is very rare in banking.  And we have good reason to believe

these advantages are sustainable.  It would take an enormous amount of time,

expense and effort for our competitors to duplicate our level of integration and

specialization -- or service initiatives such as our $5 guarantee and longer

branch hours.  We intend to maintain our advantage by building on our

strengths. 



<p>Also in our annual report, we talked about specific benchmarks for

measurement of our progress -- our goals and measures for return on equity,

for productivity, for risk management, and for improvements in our customer

service index.  We will be measuring the success of our strategies against these

goals.  We will be accountable.  And we will make progress by making your

bank, your way a reality for our customers.  



<p>While talking about all the benefits that Canadians derive from the Bank,

the Chairman said he is proud to be a banker.  I too am proud -- and I am

particularly proud to be working with such an exceptional group of people as

the employees of TD Bank.  



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all shareholders, I would like to extend

thanks to the people of TD Bank.  Your Bank.  Your Way.  



<p>Thank you.

<h2> YOUR BANK - YOUR PROFITS</h2><br>

<br>

<h2> A message to the millions of Canadians who own TD</h2><br> 

<br>





<br>

<h3> January 24, 1996</h3><br><br>

<br>

<p><b>Notes For Remarks By:<br>

Richard M. Thomson, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer<br>

Toronto Dominion Bank<br>

<br>

To: Annual Meeting of Shareholders<br>

Toronto, Ontario<br>

</b></p>



<br>

<p>Today, I am going to do something that might be considered a bit radical

by bank bashers who are critical of our profits.  I am going to explain why our

strength and our success is something to celebrate -- something for all

Canadians to celebrate.  Our performance in 1995 is a source of pride.</p>



<p>In our annual meeting of shareholders, we traditionally address the direct

shareholders of the bank -- thousands of Canadians, including many

thousands of TD's employees, who directly own shares in TD.</p>



<p>Those of you here today who are direct shareholders know that our

earnings are indeed something to celebrate... you know that you benefit

directly from the profits of the Bank, the increase in dividends, and the

building of shareholder value.  I don't need to explain to you that good returns

are a good thing --  that's why you invested in the Bank.  



And, as direct shareholders, you also know that while we achieved record

profits in absolute dollar terms, we did not achieve record profitability.  Our

return on common equity in 1995 was 14.3% -- well below the 20% return

that we earned in 1988.  So, as direct shareholders, you know that while we

celebrate our performance of 1995, we must do more to improve our return on

equity.</p>



<p>My message today is for the shareholders who are not here -- the

shareholders who <u>don't even know</u> they are shareholders -- and who

therefore do not know that they are reaping the benefits of our profits.</p>



<p>My message today is to the social worker in Vancouver... the firefighter in

Kingston... the teacher in Chicoutimi -- to all those hard working Canadians

whose retirement income depends on pension funds that are the largest

shareholders of this bank.  My message today is to the farmer in North

Battleford and the small business owner in Halifax who are building their

retirement savings through mutual funds -- mutual funds that are major

shareholders of this Bank.</p>



<p>That means that your Bank is mainly owned, directly and indirectly, by

millions of hard working Canadians who are looking for some financial

security in their retirement.</p>



<p>And to all of those millions of Canadians who are part of pension plans or

invest in mutual funds, my message is that the Bank's profits are

<u>yours</u>.  The strength, success and profitability of this bank -- and of

the other major Canadian banks -- contribute directly to your financial

security.</p>



<p>TD and the other banks contribute to your retirement income and your

financial security every time we make a profit... every time we pay a

dividend... every time we build shareholder value by building our businesses.



<p>It has been estimated that one out of every two working Canadians is an

indirect shareholder of the banks, which are the most widely held corporations

in the country.  And millions of other Canadians are customers of this bank or

one of the other banks.  They too benefit from our success, our profitability

and our growth.



<p>Profits that we don't pay out in dividends are reinvested in our business.  

That has built our capital base, which enables us to increase our lending

activity and fuel economic growth.  And we have also reinvested to improve

competitiveness and customer services.  



<p>The net result is that Canada has one of the best, most efficient, technically

advanced, stable and secure banking systems in the world -- delivering

tremendous benefits to customers, and to the economic health and stability of

Canada.



<p>One major benefit is our strength, safety and security -- which means

every customer can deal with the Bank and entrust us with their funds with

total confidence.  



<p>Another benefit is our cost effectiveness.  Our interest rate spreads

between what we pay on deposits and what we charge borrowers are amongst

the lowest in the world.  These spreads are about a third lower than in the

United States.  So our depositors and borrowers alike are getting a better deal.



<p>Canadian customers benefit directly from our low interest rate margins --

which are a testament to our efficiency and competitiveness.  And Canadians

benefit directly from our highly efficient payment system -- which provides

same day value on deposits -- compared, for example, to waiting periods of

several days in the U.S.



<p>And here in Canada, with our national banking system, customers have

the convenience of any branch banking across the country -- with all regions

enjoying access to all services and products, regardless of regional economic

downturns.  There is nothing like that in the U.S.  



<p>Another benefit of our strong, efficient, national system is the national

pricing we deliver in Canada.  All our services and products are delivered

everywhere in Canada at the same prices.  People in small towns and remote

regions where business volumes are low pay the same prices as people here in

downtown Toronto.  



<p>While earning profits, we have done an enormous amount to improve

service and advice -- to help make it easier for our customers.  Think of our $5

guarantee... Think of how we have introduced trust services and investment

services in our branches to meet customers' needs... Think of how we have

improved electronic banking to provide low priced self service alternatives and

to make banking more convenient.  To achieve such improvements, we spend

well over $100 million a year in hardware and software alone.  



<p>During these profitable years -- as we have delivered benefits to millions of

shareholders -- we have made dramatic improvements which have benefitted

customers, while holding the line on most of our service charges.  



<p>Our service charges -- which contribute less than 7% to our gross income -- compare

favourably to charges in other major economies such as the United

States and Great Britain.  And we believe we deliver good value -- increasing

choice and convenience for customers -- and providing all customers with

opportunities to reduce service charges with low priced electronic banking

options.  Furthermore, well over half of our customers do not pay any regular

service charges, thanks to the cost-effective service plans and account options

we have in place.  



<p>Our strong, stable profitable banking system is one of Canada's greatest

national assets.  It has contributed to Canada's domestic economy -- in

contrast to the economic problems in countries such as Mexico and Argentina,

where the banking system is weak and getting any loan is difficult.  



<p>Our banking system has also contributed to the country's success as a

trading nation.  While we support our customers in foreign markets, we earn

profits in foreign markets -- foreign earnings which we bring back into

Canada.  Close to one third of the net income of TD Bank in 1995 was earned

in the United States and other international markets. 



<p>Canada's big banks also make a huge contribution as Canada's biggest

taxpayers.  We certainly pay our share of taxes -- in fact, we pay more than

our share.  Taxes paid by the banks accounted for 12% of total federal and

provincial corporate income and capital taxes last year -- which is far higher

than our share of corporate profits.  TD alone paid $769 million in income and

other taxes in 1995 -- and $642 million of that amount was paid in Canada. 

TD paid just about a dollar in taxes for every dollar we earned.



<p>Those tax dollars paid by TD and the other banks benefit millions of

Canadians, because our tax dollars pay for a good chunk of government

services provided in communities across the country.



<p>Clearly, the more money TD and the other banks make, the more we pay

in taxes that pay for government services... And the more profits we make, the

more we contribute to the retirement income of millions of Canadians, the

more we lend to customers the more we improve economic activity and the

wellbeing of Canadians.



<p>That is certainly something to celebrate.  And I think it's time we started

celebrating success in this country -- success which contributes to national

prosperity.  This is more important than ever now, because of the economic

challenges we face in Canada.



<p>Economic growth in Canada has been modest for the past year, and we

expect that trend to continue in 1996.  Consumers are still cautious, and that

has dampened growth in consumer spending and in new housing construction. 

As well, government spending at all levels is constrained by essential deficit

reduction programs.  Exports -- particularly to the United States where

demand is fairly robust -- and business investment in machinery and

equipment will once again drive economic growth.



<p>In this slow growth environment, the Canadian economy would benefit

from lower interest rates in 1996.  In part, that will depend on lower rates in

the United States.  But it will also depend -- to a large measure -- on the ability

of governments to control deficits and continue to get their fiscal houses in

order, while minimizing political turmoil and uncertainty.  We are hopeful

that both will be achieved.  That would contribute to national prosperity --

which in turn would contribute to the success of our customers, and the

success of your Bank.



<p>I am proud to be a banker.  I am proud of what TD people have achieved

for our customers and our shareholders and for all Canadians.  And for the

sake of all our shareholders -- those of you who know you are shareholders

and those of you who don't know you are shareholders -- I hope we achieve

our goals for an even better year in 1996.

<h2 >TD In 95 -- Strategies For Future Growth</h2>
<br>
<h3>January 25th, 1995</h3>
<p><b>Notes For Remarks By:<br>
A. Charles Baillie, Vice Chairman<br>
Corporate & Investment Banking Group<br>
Toronto Dominion Bank<br>
<br>
To: Annual General Meeting Of Shareholders<br>
Toronto, Ontario<br>
</b></p>

<br>

<p>My job today is to look ahead -- to give you a sense of where TD is going and how we're getting there.  But I'm going to start by looking back -- I'm going to look back thirty years, to when I joined TD.</p>  

<p>At that time, in 1964, TD had a very narrow product range. Except for a few secondary activities, our basic business was simply taking deposits and making loans -- a limited range of loans, as there were no term loans, no conventional mortgages, no consumer loans.</p>

<p>And we had one delivery system -- our branch network, where our customers came to us, on our terms, during our banking hours, to make deposits, and borrow money.  "Your Bank. Your Way."  would not have been a very credible mission statement in those days.</p>

<p>In those simpler times -- where all the banks had the same basic product range -- we could apply a consistent, straightforward strategy throughout the Bank.  And the only way to really differentiate ourselves from the competition was through superior credit skills, the location of our branches, and service.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we have seen enormous change since then.  And one of the few certainties in life is that the pace of change will continue to accelerate.  And the change we face is sweeping.</p>

<p>We have seen challenges to our traditional franchises of lending and branch banking.   Over the years, we have talked about disintermediation, as major corporations have gone straight to the capital markets and individual investors for money, rather than borrowing from banks -- cutting out the middleman.  And we have talked about competition in deposit taking, from other institutions, and from alternative investments such as government securities and mutual funds.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have seen challenges to the value of our branch banking franchise, due to electronic systems that don't rely on bricks and mortar.</p>

<p>So our franchises were under siege -- but rather than just letting them erode, we sought out new avenues of growth by broadening our own business and our own delivery system -- building on our strengths, and responding to our customers.  In fact, we have been entering the very businesses and embracing the very delivery systems that threatened our own franchises in the first place.</p>

<p>So we have developed a lot of new franchises and changed dramatically since I joined the bank -- and much of this change is attributable to the vision and leadership of Robin Korthals.</p>  

<p>Just in the past five years alone, we have entered a host of new businesses, as indicated in the annual report.  TD has become an investment bank, a trust company, a mutual fund company, a major retail broker, a convenience bank, and so on.  To give you a sense of the scale of change, we now have twenty different businesses that are larger than the entire bank was when I joined TD.</p>

<p>And our delivery system now includes the Green Machine and plastic cards for payment transactions... it includes the telephone -- for Green Line, our discount broker, and Bankline, our phone banking service... it also includes the computer -- for Business Window, our computer-banking link for business customers, and for Green Line and other services... Over 75% of transactions don't take place in the branch anymore.  They are electronic.</p>

<p>These sweeping changes in the business of TD have a lot of implications.  For one thing, all purpose training for our employees no longer makes sense -- we have highly specialized areas in our businesses; we require a broad array of training programs; and we must be focused on continuous learning -- with "just-in-time" delivery of training right in the workplace -- because change is so rapid.</p>

<p>Another implication is that our competitors are beginning to develop distinct personalities.  Given the huge range of products and services that now fall under the banking umbrella, banks can no longer pursue all opportunities with equal vigour.</p>


<p>So each bank plays to its particular strengths -- and I think Canadian banks will look less and less alike as time goes on.</p>

<p>The third and most important implication of the changes we have seen is in the area of strategy.  With such a wide range of businesses, we need a wide range of strategies. And so we have developed different strategies for each area of the Bank, while developing some core strategies to drive us forward and keep us on course through a sea of change.</p>

<p>These core strategies are very straightforward -- to make banking with TD an enjoyable experience for our customers; to be among the best capitalized and highly rated banks;  to be the lowest cost producer; to be the best risk manager; and to be a balanced bank -- balanced, among other things, between our two key sectors -- wholesale and retail banking.</p>

<p>Let me now give you a sense of our strategies for those two key sectors of our business.</p>




<p>In wholesale banking -- where we serve the corporate and institutional sector -- we have, as mentioned, been facing the challenge of disintermediation.  The decline in corporate loan demand has led to considerable overcapacity in lending.  The resulting narrow margins mean we can no longer earn a decent return on lending as a stand-alone business.</p>

<p>That leaves a number of options -- we could soldier blithely on and watch our franchise erode;  we could withdraw from corporate lending... or, we could maintain credit as our core product for the foreseeable future while using it to help diversify and build other revenues.</p>

<p>That is the course we are taking.  Credit remains our core product, and we are diversifying our revenues.</p>

<p>The way we are building other revenues is by building relationships with our traditional customers -- and, equally important, attracting new investing clients -- by providing a range of products and services that meet their needs... products and services such as cash management, treasury products, and underwritings.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have responded to the low margins in our  credit business by improving the liquidity of our loan portfolios through syndications, secondary loan trading, and securitization.</p>

<p>Our strategy of building relationships with customers is based on taking an integrated approach to providing corporate and investment banking services -- so that one relationship manager can represent and market the entire bank to a client, get to know that client's needs, and respond by drawing on our full range of services for the client.</p>

<p>That's one of the reasons we decided to build our own investment dealer, rather than buying one -- so that we could develop an integrated, relationship approach from the outset.  And that's also why building a fully fledged, first rate investment bank is so important.</p>

<p>Pursuing this strategy has been challenging -- but we are seeing results.  We now have an investment bank we believe is seriously challenging others in the industry.  And we are acquiring significant new banking accounts and additional business from existing customers.</p>

<p>Now for retail banking -- the cornerstone of TD Bank.</p>

<p>In retail banking as well, we have faced disintermediation and competition for deposits from a range of sources. Many of these competitors are traditional customers -- that is, governments and corporations who now sell their paper directly in the markets.</p>

<p>So in the retail sector as well, we have responded by developing a relationship approach... and we have been providing customers with a range of deposit alternatives --whether they be our own or our competitors' securities and mutual funds.</p>

<p>As mentioned, we have seen the emergence of competing delivery systems in retail banking -- with increasing numbers of transactions being handled electronically.  In the huge business of processing transactions, we face competition not only from Canadian financial institutions, but also --potentially -- from foreign banks and computer and media companies -- which do not rely on bricks and mortar.</p>

<p>This has raised questions about the value of our branches. In the bank of the future, will our branches be an asset?</p>

<p>We intend to ensure they remain a great asset.  Although our branches have seen their previous role as transaction centres erode, we are creating new value by transforming them into service centres -- centres of expertise and information -- for everything from mutual funds to mortgages, and -- potentially -- insurance.</p>

<p>The value of our branches today is created by our people --who are helping customers, providing advice and useful information, developing financial solutions.  This is an enormous asset, and it is summed up by our values -- caring people, delighted customers, best results.  TD people are delivering -- and in so doing, they are providing the best customer service in our industry.</p>

<p>While maintaining a strong branch network, we have been leading the way in self-service delivery systems -- with Green Machines and BankLine, for example.  And we are going to add more and more value to phone and computer banking -- by providing customers with more information, more options, more choices.</p>


<p>For many of our customers, the key to TD's success has already moved from location, location, location -- that is of our branch system -- to the quality of our software, our data, and -- of course -- our people.</p>

<p>Certainly, we have moved away from the simpler times of banking -- when we were focused on one product, one approach, one solution.  But what we have created at TD --in both wholesale and retail banking -- is an ability to develop individual solutions for our customers, and to assist them in managing financial risk -- with a choice of delivery systems and a range of products and services, tied together by relationship managers and the people in our branches.</p>

<p>That's what we mean by our public commitment -- Your Bank.  Your Way.  We foresee the time when our customers can bank with us when, how, and where they like.  That's where we are going -- and we have the strengths and the strategies to get there.  We also have the management team and the people to get there -- the people of TD Bank. It is thanks to their support and hard work that I look forward to my new role with confidence and great enthusiasm.</p>

<h2>Implications To Canadians Of High Government Debt</h2>
<p>
<h3>January 25th, 1995</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Notes For Remarks By:<br>
Richard M. Thomson, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer<br>
Toronto Dominion Bank<br>
<br>
To: Annual General Meeting Of Shareholders<br>
Toronto, Ontario<br>
</b></p>

<br>
<p>We ended 1994 on a high note.  Canadians finally felt that the long and apparently endless
recession was over.  Output was expanding, employment had recovered to pre-recession levels and
growing, exports were booming, retail sales were the strongest in 5 years, profits were rising
sharply, and consumer confidence had finally reappeared.  Even in Ontario -- where the recession had
hit hardest -- there was a strong hint of optimism in the air.</p>

<p>I wish I could stand here and say: "O.K. - we're home free now. We've gone through a terrible
time, but good times are back again! We have nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>But I can't.  Even though our economy is in the healthiest shape it's been for a long time, we
still have some serious problems that threaten our economic well-being.</p>

<p>I believe, that as we enter 1995, our primary problem is our governments' fiscal situation.  That
is -- our governments have a very serious debt problem.  It may be easy to say: "Well, that's our
governments' problem."  But the bottom line is that the government debt is OUR debt, and that means
that all Canadians -- both Canadian businesses and Canadians as individuals -- have a serious debt
problem.</p>

<p>At this point some of you may be thinking: "Oh, no!  Not again! I've heard this all before.  Why
doesn't he talk about banking?" Well, this IS about banking -- because it's about the health of the
economy, the prospects of our customers, the international competitiveness of our industries, the
cost and availability of funds, the value of the dollar and the level of interest rates.</p>

<p>I'd like to explain -- as briefly as I can -- why government debt is such a burden and why we MUST
do something about it.  But before I do that, I would first like to remind you of the difference
between DEFICIT and DEBT -- something which seems to cause no end of confusion.</p>

<p>The deficit is the shortfall between government revenues and expenditures in a single YEAR.  The
debt is the sum total of all the deficits accumulated in previous years.  Our combined federal and
provincial government deficit for this fiscal year is estimated at about 57 billion dollars.  That
means that our governments will spend almost 60 billion dollars more than they take in just in this
fiscal year alone!  Put another way, governments are spending roughly 20 per cent more than they are
collecting in taxes.</p>

<p>If we add up the deficits of all previous years -- including the accumulated interest, of course
-- we end up with our debt number. Let me give you a sense of the magnitude of the debt:</p>

<p>1) Total government debt -- federal plus provincial -- will reach almost 780 billion dollars in
this fiscal year.</p>

<p>2) If this doesn't give you a sense of how big our debt is, perhaps this will:  On average, each
and every woman, man and child in Canada owes -- on behalf of the government -- almost $27,000!
That's almost TWICE as much as an average Canadian owes in terms of personal debt, including
mortgages, car loans, credit cards, etc.</p>

<p>But it is not only the size of the debt that is a problem.</p>

<p>We must also ask: Who owns this debt?  Who did our governments borrow these vast sums from?</p>

<p>In the past, Canadian governments borrowed primarily from their own citizens.  Essentially,
Canadians "owned" their own debt, and most of the interest that was paid on that debt remained in
Canada.</p>

<p>In more recent years, as the borrowing needs of our governments grew rapidly, and as it became
easier to access global financial markets, Canadian governments began to borrow abroad.  Now about 40
per cent of Canadian federal and provincial bonds are held by foreign investors.  And that has
radically changed the situation.</p>

<p>The most important change is that Canadians are now much more vulnerable to the reactions of
foreign investors.  If foreign investors become nervous about our ability to issue more debt to
service our debt, or about political uncertainty, they have the option of getting out of their
Canadian holdings.</p>

<p>Canada must compete in international financial markets for savings. Because of our current debt
situation we are considered to be a higher risk (i.e., have a lower credit rating) than the United
States. Therefore, in order to attract and keep foreign investors, our government must offer interest
rates which are generally higher than comparable U.S. rates.   If we kept our rates at or below U.S.
rates, investors would not buy or hold Canadian bonds.  Therefore, whenever the United States raises
its interest rates, for whatever reason, Canada must follow -- whether it is good for us or not.</p>

<p>Since last February, the United States has raised interest rates 6 times -- because the American
economy was overheating.  The Canadian economy was certainly NOT overheating -- yet we had to move
our rates up along with theirs.  When we tried to hold back late last year, our dollar came under
severe downward pressure, and we were forced to move our rates up in spite of the fact that this is
not what we wanted -- or needed.</p>

<p>The harsh reality is that our government has become powerless over the value of our dollar and the
level of our interest rates, and thus over the appropriate conditions for our economy to grow.</p>

<p>Recent events have shown us very clearly that the value of our dollar and the level of our
interest rates are determined mainly by external forces -- by the whims and moods of international
financial markets.  Unfortunately, we have ended up with a dollar that is lower than, and interest
rates that are higher than, what we would like.</p>

<p>Our inflation rate is extremely low.  But the economy is not operating anywhere close to full
capacity, and we still have a very high unemployment rate.</p>

<p>We don't need higher interest rates now -- we need lower rates. Higher rates discourage
individuals and businesses from spending and investing and therefore threaten our economic recovery.
 Yet we have seen our interest rates rise higher and higher.</p>

<p>Most ironically, with every increase in interest rates, the amount of interest our governments
must pay on the debt rises.  For example, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates raises the
cost of servicing the federal debt by $1.7 billion!  And much of that flows straight out of the
country to foreign investors.   We are caught in a trap of our own making.  The more we borrow -- the
higher our interest rates -- the higher our interest payments on the debt -- the more we borrow.  And
the more money we send out of the country.</p>

<p>This is obviously not sustainable.</p>

<p>How did we get ourselves into this vicious cycle?  It was not hard. We have allowed and encouraged
our governments to spend more than they took in, year in and year out.</p>

<p>In order to stop the growth in our debt, we must first eliminate our deficits.  Governments must
learn to balance their budgets -- to spend only what they can pay for.</p>

<p>To get from a deficit position to a balanced budget, governments can either increase revenues, or
cut expenditures, or a combination of both.  It is that simple.</p>

<p>It may be simple -- but it is not easy --  so many politicians tell us. Yet we have seen very
successful efforts by some provincial governments who have reduced their deficits significantly by
relying on substantial spending cuts rather than on revenue increases.  These spending cuts were key
in bringing their deficits down from among the highest of the provinces only a few years ago.  Most
notable among them are Alberta and Saskatchewan, whose economies, fiscal positions and political
orientations are VERY different.  And that proves that when the political will is there, it IS
possible to do what is necessary.</p>

<p>Canadians have made it very clear in recent years that they already feel overtaxed.  Yet at the
same time Canadians appear to be very reluctant to give up any government programs.</p>

<p>Well, we cannot have it both ways.  In the end, the choice is up to us -- but we do have to make a
choice between higher taxes or cutting expenditures.</p>

<p>If we don't act -- ultimately others will act for us.  Our current vulnerability to the whims of
international financial markets will only increase with time.  And in the end we will have to make
the difficult choices anyway -- but we'll have far fewer choices.  The longer we delay, the higher
the cost will be.
I sincerely hope that 1995 will be the year that more governments in Canada will make a major move to
restore financial responsibility.  If that were to happen, 1995 will be a much better year.</p>

<h2>TD: A Retiree's Perspective</h2><br> <p> <p>

<h3>January 25th, 1995</h3><br>



<p><b>Notes For Remarks By:<br>Robert W. Korthals, President<br>Toronto Dominion
Bank<br><br>To: Annual General Meeting Of Shareholders<br>Toronto,
Ontario<br></b></p><br><p>The highlight of last year was the fact that we finally
got our loan losses down to almost half of what they had been the previous year. 
It was the first time they had gone down in four years, and they reached the
lowest level since 1988.  In addition, they were below what we had estimated
early in the year.  As a result, we were able to increase our dividend ten
percent.  To someone who is retiring,that is a very important event!</p><p> The
Annual Report has been out in the public for so long, there is not much I can add
to it.  But there are two things I would like to highlight.  The first is that,
while I had hoped that my last year would be a record year, we just missed.  I
really look at pre-tax earnings rather than net earnings for shareholders and, on
that basis, we fell about $14 million short, or one and a half percent, from
1988. That is unfortunate because our tax rate in '88 was 47 percent, and in '94,
it was only 43 percent.  With that drop you might expect we should have added
about $40 million.</p><p> But it was not a record year on the basis of after tax
earnings either.  That's because in the intervening period of time, we have
incurred an awful lot of legislated costs: payroll taxes, deposit insurance,
municipal taxes and capital taxes.  In 1988 these amounted to about $90 million
and last year they had reached just under $300MM. That is a huge increase in the
tax burden. And that has offset by far the lower income tax rate.</p><p> Now, is
that a relevant event for shareholders?  It might well be.  Because there are
rumours that the financial services industry will bear the brunt of additional
taxes in the coming budget.  Indeed, last year, a tax on financial services was
introduced in which you pay tax on unrealized gains of securities.  Now, this is
a very unusual tax in the western world, you rarely see taxes on something that
does not produce cash.  But this is an indication of the desperation of our
government as it tries to speed up the flow of money in its coffers.</p><p> At
the same time that the tax burden has been rising, we have seen increasing
pricing pressure.  We are part of a wave that is sweeping through Canada, and
that is discounting. Consumers have not seen much growth in real incomes,
disposable incomes for four, five, or six years. So they are stretching their
dollars by looking for bargains, and you can see that in discount retailing, you
can see that in price wars on automobiles and you can even see that on the
opposition to the recent cable television price increase for the extra channels. 
It does not receive much press, but this same discounting has happened in our
industry. </p><p> You can see it in our margins, the interest rate spread.  About
two-thirds of our gross profit is made from the spread between what we charge on
loans and what we pay depositors.  Traditionally, in Canadian banking that spread
was about four and a quarter percent.  In other words, for every hundred dollars
that we collect as interest, we pay about 96 cents to depositors.  It is a very
small spread.  When you consider a retailer might make a margin of 30 percent, we
make a very small margin.

</p><p> In the last two years, that spread has declined from 4.2 percent to 3.4
percent, a decline of about 15 percent.  That means a loss of $400 million in
pre-tax income.  And the most amazing thing of all is that the average level for
U.S. banks in the United States is well in excess of five percent.  In Canada,
because banking is so competitive, we operate one of the most efficient banking
industries in the world.  And that is why taxes are significant because the
pressures for lowering our margins will continue and, if taxes continue to rise,
we are going to have to find different ways to meet the needs of our customers. 
We will have to find ways to minimize the tax burden that a regular bank, as an
institution, has to pay.</p><p> Last year we started, or continued to develop and
invest in many new businesses.  They are all outlined in the Letter to
Shareholders and they include investment banking, the trust business, mutual
funds, card services and so on.  For the development of these businesses, we
incurred very substantial costs.  These costs were not capitalized and they were
not acquired costs that you can build into goodwill; they were all expensed as
the year progressed and, at the end of the year, the balance sheet of your Bank
had no goodwill.  What makes me happy is that we made such substantial
investments in new businesses and still had our second best year ever for
shareholders.</p><p> You might ask, how did we do that?  Well, basically, it is
because of our people.  They have all taken on new tasks, new skills and new ways
of thinking and they have all learned on the job, in all areas of the Bank.  To
all those people, I would like to give a heartfelt thanks, because I really do
appreciate the enormous effort to cope with change.  Thank you.

</p><p> If I am allowed a moment of personal indulgence... I feel a little
sad.</p><p> First of all, I'm giving up one of the very best jobs in the country.
 I do not know how I ever got it.  And the Bank has a very exciting future, I'm
sorry I won't be part of that.  I have met so many people that I respect and
admire and I will miss the relationships with customers and co-workers.  I will
also miss you, Dick Thomson, I have never paid him a compliment yet.  Dick sets
terrific standards for himself and inspires others by those standards.  So, I
will miss you, Dick.</p><p> But, in another way, I am happy.  I am happy for two
reasons:  First, because I have a fine successor in Charlie Baillie. Charlie
knows the Bank, he knows our customers, he knows how to build businesses both
outside Canada and inside Canada, he knows how to develop good people.  And he
has good judgement, which is very important in our business, as well as
integrity.</p><p> So, because of all this, and everything the Bank is doing,
we're bound to see higher dividends.</p><p> In closing, I often profess great
faith in markets, compared to many other Canadians who profess great faith in
government.  I have dear friends who are critical of my views who say I should be
more compassionate.  To balance my life, they urge me to read the teachings of
Taoism, from 2,000 years ago.  One of the great thinkers in that area was Lao Tsu
and, believe it or not, I keep his books in my desk and sometimes I read them.  A
week ago, I was reading a passage which may tell you why I am happy today.</p><p>
He is talking about opposites, and the fact that opposites are very important to
understand, because you cannot measure length without understanding shortness. 
If everything was beautiful, that, in itself, would be ugly.  So, looking at
contrasts and opposites, a thoughtful person does his or her work without ado,
tries to accomplish things but does not dwell on them and, because that person
does not dwell on them, no one can ever take them away.</p><p>Anyway, it is like Bob
Hope's theme song, "Thanks for the Memories".</p></body>

<h2>TD IN '95:<br> 

It's good to be in New York, and other success stories<br>



</h2>

<br>

<h3>November 1, 1995</h3>

<p><b>Remarks By:<br>

A. Charles Baillie<br> President<br>

Toronto Dominion Bank<br>

<br>

<br>

To:<br>

Salomon Brothers Annual Global Banking Conference<br>

New York, N.Y.<br>

</b></p>



<br>It's good to be in New York.<br>



<p>That may sound like the nice polite greeting you get from

every Canadian.  But I mean a little more than the usual

nicety...  Naturally, I like New York.  And naturally, it feels

good to be here talking to all of you -- because a lot of great

things have happened at TD since the last Conference in 1994.



<p>But when I say "it's good to be in New York" what I really

mean is -- it's great to be a TD banker in New York -- it's great

to be doing business here.  Our USA division, which is based in

this city, is having a terrific year.



<p>We have a number of success stories to tell -- because the

whole Bank's been having a terrific year.  And I thought I'd

start with New York, because it's really a microcosm of the kind

of success stories we are seeing throughout the Bank, in a broad

range of businesses.



<p>Here's a sense of our success stories in our U.S. corporate

and investment banking business:

<br>

<ul>Our corporate lending continues to show strong growth in our target areas -- such as

cable, wireless, health care and forest products -- as we have established ourselves as a

well capitalized bank that can fully underwrite loans.<br>

<br>

We've developed a very strong syndication business in the U.S.  We are one of the top

foreign banks in syndications --indeed, we are number twelve in the entire U.S.  And in

LIBOR plus 150 financings, we are number three here, with a market share of over

8%.<br>

<br>

Our U.S. mergers and acquisitions group -- which we launched in a serious way only a

year ago -- has already won 23 mandates and completed 6 deals.<br>

<br>

<p>We gained Tier II investment banking powers in August, so we

can now underwrite and deal securities.

<p>

In anticipation of these powers, we had recruited some top notch people, and in August,

we established a high yield operation -- which has already closed two deals and filed three

others, with several more in the pipeline.<br>

<br>

Just last month, we hired a highly regarded repo sales and trading team. <br>

<br>

And during the summer, we opened a New York office for Green Line Investor Services

-- Canada's largest discount broker, which we built from within over the past decade, and

 which now has close to 15% of the entire Canadian retail brokerage market.</ul><br>



<p>So we have been busy -- and our business in the United States

is growing, as is our profitability.  It's a New York success

story -- and it's also a TD success story -- because it is

indicative of what's been happening at our Bank.  We have made

considerable progress across the board in new businesses that we

have built or acquired, and in mature ones.



<p>This is important, because we have done a lot of building and

acquiring of new businesses over the past decade. 



<p>I have talked in past years of Green Line Investor Services,

which we built from within -- and enhanced by acquiring and

successfully integrating Marathon Brokerage and Gardiner

Securities, our primary competitors... 



<p>I have talked of our securities dealer, TD Securities Inc.,

which we have built from within... I have talked about our TD/GM

VISA card -- a huge new business... 



<p>I have talked about our acquisition of Central Guaranty Trust,

which boosted our retail market share and launched us into the

trust business -- and which we successfully integrated into our

operations in a remarkably short period of time. 



<p>So we have been building successfully -- and we are continuing

to do so -- as you can see by our intense business building

activity here in New York.



<p>In New York and throughout our organization, we are building

on certain core strengths of the Bank -- certain strategies that

make us distinct and that differentiate us from the competition.



<p>That's important these days -- because banks are all evolving

in different directions.  In years past, Canada's major banks

were in such similar businesses with such similar products that

it was difficult to differentiate among us.



<p>But things are different now, due to the plethora of

opportunities available.  The choices for major banks today are

just too broad for us all to place equal emphasis on each

opportunity.



<p>At TD, our strategy is to build on three distinct strengths --

our differentiation as:  the integrated bank; the bank that is

focused on industry specialization; and the bank that is

committed to making banking easier and better for our customers.



<p>Let me quickly review these three points of differentiation.



<p>First, we are an integrated bank -- delivering financial

products and services in an integrated way to our customers.  And

it is a direct response to our customers -- who told us they want

one person -- one relationship manager -- to handle all their

various dealings with TD.



<p>That makes sense to our customers, as it enables us to tailor

solutions from a full range of approaches -- and to bring to bear

all the resources of TD to meet their needs.  So we have

integrated to the point that one relationship officer represents

the Bank to each of our corporate, institutional, and commercial

clients -- and, increasingly, our personal customers.



<p>The move to positioning personal bankers managing

relationships with our personal customers is an ambitious one. 

But having developed technology to provide customers with a range

of low cost electronic delivery options, we have repositioned our

branches -- 960 retail branches across Canada -- as value added

service centres, where we meet a range of our personal customers

financial needs.  We have removed many of the administrative

functions from our branches, enabling our staff to focus on sales

and service quality.



<p>Many of our branches now include personal trust services, all

sell third party paper, and all sell mutual funds.  Indeed, 5,000

of our employees are qualified and just completed our Mutual Fund

National Education Review. 



<p>So the role of our personal bankers is rapidly becoming that

of financial services relationship managers -- providing advice

and developing solutions for every individual customer.



<p>With this approach, we can keep on adding value for our

customers -- and creating more value in our delivery system -- by

integrating more services.  Insurance would be a natural -- and

our customers would like the option of buying insurance at our

branches, but regulation still prohibits this.  However, we think

it will eventually happen -- because it makes sense.  Our

customers want this kind of integrated service.  And -- as the

integrated bank -- TD is ideally positioned to meet these needs. 

Differentiating ourselves this way is very important.



<p>Our second point of differentiation is that we are the bank of

industry specialization.  We have taken industry specialization

further than any of our competitors -- and we have used our

industry expertise in such areas as communications, health care,

forest products, power, energy and resources to enter new

markets, and to build new businesses.  



<p>This is particularly evident here in New York.  For example,

TD is a cable and communications specialist -- and we've long

since been the leading lender in the industry.  The instant

success of our M&A business here, and our high yield business has

been based on our cable and communications specialization --

that's what opened the door.  Our expertise and deep

relationships provide a powerful entree.



<p>Again, industry specialization extends beyond the corporate

sector and investment banking to our branch system.  To meet the

needs of our mid-market clients, we are positioning specialists

in industries such as high tech, auto parts, and agriculture in

our branches.  



<p>Our third point of differentiation is our commitment to making

banking easier and more enjoyable for customers.  All banks would

make that claim, but we have taken very tangible and measurable

actions to back up our commitment.  



<p>In retail banking, for example, we have led the way in Canada

-- making banking faster and more convenient, and giving

customers more choice.  



<p>Our customers tell us they want faster service, and we have

responded with our 5 minute - $5 service guarantee.  Our

customers tell us they want longer hours, and we have responded -- our branches are open longer

than the competition -- 8 hours a

week, on average.  



<p>Our small business customers tell us they want business

service at their local branch rather than at a commercial banking

centre, and we have responded -- with Main$treet banking, now

available at two thirds of our branches, and soon to be in place

at all of them.



<p>Our customers tell us they want more choice of delivery, and

we have responded -- leading the way in Canada in telephone and

electronic delivery -- even satellite delivery in the Yukon.  



<p>Our customers tell us they want more and better advice, and we

have been responding, with our integrated relationship management

approach, and the highest level of third party paper distribution

through a bank branch system in Canada. 



<p> Our approach is summed up in our public commitment -- Your

Bank, Your Way -- which means providing financial services to

customers where, how and when they want.  We just launched a new

ad campaign, with the theme line, "We're here to help make it

easier."  And we have invested heavily in technology and in

training to ensure we deliver.



<p>So we have a sense of how to differentiate ourselves at TD --

and we are building on that.  Building fast.



<p>Nowhere was this more evident than in our securities dealer --

TD Securities Inc.



<p>Having built from within, it has taken us a while to get all

the elements in place -- and to be taken seriously as a

securities dealer.  



<p>So in the past year, we accelerated our build -- with

aggressive recruiting of individuals and teams, with internal

development and resources, and with a key acquisition --

Lancaster Financial -- a highly respected financial advisory firm

with strong M&A capabilities. 



<p>

Through these activities, we boosted our investment banking

business, our fixed income business, our asset securitization

group, our full service brokerage, and our institutional equities

group, and we launched a new merchant banking operation.



<p>Today, TD Securities has staff of close to 2000, 58 offices,

and revenues of over $300 million.  So we have entered the major

leagues in terms of scale -- and we are seeing considerable

success.

<p>Today, TD Securities has staff of close to 2000, 58 offices,

and revenues of over $300 million.  So we have entered the major

leagues in terms of scale -- and we are seeing considerable

success. <br>

<br>

<ul>#1 in asset securitization<br>

#1 in private placements <br>

#1 in discount brokerage <br>

   tied for #1 in capital committed in merchant banking <br>

#1, 2 or 3 in key money market products <br>

#1 in market share gains in fixed income and institutional

equities -- and in our increase in the Lead Investment Bank

ranking.</ul><br>



<p>And according to a recent Brendan Wood survey, we are #1 in

terms of momentum.  As far as we are concerned, that's an

attractive place to be.



<p>We have also developed an effective distribution system --

with our Institutional equities business, and, on the retail side

with Green Line, and with our rapidly growing full service broker

-- Evergreen.  When I was last here, Evergreen had just been

launched -- with 15 brokers in 4 offices...  We now have over 100

Investment Advisors in 25 offices across Canada.  Our

distribution reach is expanding.



<p>Throughout the Bank, we are also seeing progress in businesses

which we had just launched or acquired when I was here last --

our trust business is steadily gaining ground...  our TD GM VISA

card, which incurred heavy start-up costs, is now profitable and

should make a significant contribution to profits in 1996... and

our mutual fund business is doing well, having gained market

share, and having launched several successful new funds.  



<p>We continue to differentiate ourselves here by hiring the best

managers available for every fund, and it has paid off.  



<p>Our Science and Technology Fund has been the top performer in

Canada this year, and as a group, we are a leader in top

percentile performance.



<p>Success in our new businesses is heartening -- and so is

success in our mature businesses.  Our domestic retail banking

business is having an exceptional year.



<p>I should mention that retail banking in Canada does not face

the same competitive threat as American retail banks do from

operations such as Quicken.  In Canada, we have a very efficient

clearing system with same day settlement anywhere in the country

-- so our customers already have the value of the float.  In

addition, we are already providing a wide range of electronic and

value added products, from discount brokerage order execution via

personal computer, to debit cards.

<p>

Some of you who have heard me speak at these conferences before

may now be waiting for the downside.  Since 1990, I've been

talking about success stories in entering new businesses and

positioning ourselves for the future -- but with no bottom line

proof that these strategies were working.  



<p>Indeed, the last time I was here, earnings had slipped for the

fourth consecutive year -- and our loan loss estimate for 1994

was $450 million, as we were still working off credit problems

from the recession and the collapse in Canadian real estate.



<p>Well things have changed.  By the end of 1994, we had reduced

loan losses to $345 million, and profits rebounded to $683

million -- our second best year ever.  



<p>And we just enjoyed a record third quarter -- with net income

of $225 million, and record nine month results, with net income

of $568 million -- as both net interest income and other income

reached record levels.  These results were achieved while we made

considerable investments in our new businesses -- expensing costs

such as the acquisition of Lancaster Financial.



<p>At the same time, we have continued to make strides with

credit quality.  In the third quarter, we reduced our loan loss

estimate from $240 million to $200 million.  And net non-accrual

loans fell to $815 million -- just 1.1% of net loans and bankers'

acceptances.



<p>Furthermore, we have continued to strengthen our capital base,

as well as increasing dividends by 10% this year.  At the end of

the third quarter, we had Tier 1 capital of close to $6 billion -- a ratio of 7.4%, and total capital of

$8.4 billion - or 10.4% -- even by relatively conservative Canadian BIS standards.  We

were recently ranked by 'Global Finance' as one of North

America's safest banks.



<p>Our results indicate solid growth, as we are beginning to reap

returns from investments we made several years ago -- and we are

continuing to invest where we see good opportunities for the

future -- opportunities to meet our customers' needs, and

opportunities to deliver good returns.



<p>As we move forward, we have some clear benchmarks --

guideposts for our strategies and business development.



<p>We aim: <br>

<ul>One, to make dealing with TD an enjoyable experience.  Our proxy for that is our

Customer Service Index, which has improved from 78.4% to 80.9% in the past year.  Our

goal is 82.5%.<br><br>  



Two, we aim to be the best risk manager over the cycle -- as measured by the loan loss to

total loans and bankers' acceptances ratio.  Our goal is a ratio of 30 basis points through

          the cycle.  At this point, we are below that benchmark -- and we rank #1.<br><br>



Three, we aim to be the low cost producer -- as measured by the expense to gross profit

ratio -- with a target of 55%.  At the third quarter, we were at 58.4%, and neck and neck

with one other bank for #1.<br><br>



And ultimately -- in pursuit of those benchmarks -- we aim to achieve the best returns in

Canadian banking, as measured by return on equity.  This is a challenging benchmark,

because we have the highest common equity to assets ratio in Canada.  However, with

16% in the third quarter, we ranked a close third.  Our goal is to achieve 7% over 10-year

government bonds through the cycle.  We won't enter new businesses where we do not

see the prospects of such a return. </ul><br>



<p>At Toronto Dominion, we have clear goals and benchmarks... we

have clear strengths and strategies... we have momentum... and we

have a strong management team and entrepreneurial leadership in

all our businesses.  We're not just sitting back swapping success

stories -- we know where we want to go, and we are confident we

will get there.  That is why  "It's good to be in New York"!

<h2>THRIVING IN THE NINETIES:<br> 
TD BANK'S STRATEGIC VISION<br>
(The Tao of Your Bank, Your Way)
</h2>
<br>
<h3>Tuesday, February 21, 1995</h3>
<p><b>Notes For Remarks By:<br>
G.F. Kym Anthony, Executive Vice President<br>
Investment Banking Group<br>
Toronto Dominion Bank<br>
<br>
To: Gordon Capital Corp.<br>
King Edward Hotel<br>
Toronto, Ontario<br>
</b></p>

<br>

<p>Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.  As you all know, the theme of today's
conference is &quot;Thriving in the Nineties&quot; and I have been asked to discuss TD
Bank's strategic plan for the remainder of this decade.

<p>The word STRATEGY.  It has a nice ring to it.  It always makes me think of an
all-seeing all-knowing group of thinkers deep in the core of an institution, or
in some management consulting company, pontificating on the future of the
markets and consumers' preferences -- and directing strategy to benefit present
and future generations.  The trouble with this approach to strategy is that it
tends to be biased towards a rear view mirror picture of the world, static,
rigid, even brittle, while the world around us is increasingly dynamic and
uncertain.  Too rigid a view of the future can leave a corporation inflexible
and unwilling or unable to seize new opportunities or react to sudden shifts in
the environment or in customer preferences.

<p>However, at no other time in the financial services industry's history has it
been as necessary for Canadian banks to develop distinct strategies and truly
unique corporate personalities.  None of us has the management or financial
resources necessary to exploit all of the market or product opportunities
emerging today. And in our current environment of economic, regulatory and
political uncertainty, serious strategic choices and the construction of a
strategic framework are essential to our success. As you listen to the
strategies presented today, keep in mind that there is room for more than one
successful strategy.  Also bear in mind that even the best strategy does not
guarantee success --excellent execution of good strategy does.

<p>When Charlie Baillie, our President, last spoke at the Gordon Capital Global
Banking Conference, he delivered a speech entitled: &quot;Focus on Banking
Strategies: TD in 93 -- The More Things Change....&quot;.  In it, he described the
initiatives and projects then underway -- the acquisition of the assets of the
U.S. Corporate Lending portfolio of Westpac, the acquisition and successful
integration of CGT, the launching of the GM Visa card, the acquisition of
Marathon Brokerage, the growth of our mutual funds business and TD Asset
Management, the launching of a full service brokerage operation called
Evergreen, the building of our Investment Banking capabilities, etc. 
Historically, the best way to explain TD's strategy has been to review our
actions rather than read carefully crafted strategy papers.  There are now over
20 businesses that earn more than the entire bank did when Mr. Baillie joined in
1964.

<p>We continue to be very action oriented, but we have committed ourselves to
certain elements of strategy around which all of our key decisions and
initiatives are based.  These elements are financial strength, low costs,
customer service, and revenue growth.  I will review each of these areas with
you now.


<h3>I.	FINANCIAL STRENGTH</h3>

<p>TD has been steadfast in its strategy of being the most strongly capitalized
bank in Canada.  Common Equity to Total Assets as at October 31, 1994 was 5.05%,
more than one percent higher than the average of the other five banks and almost
60 basis points higher than our closest competitor.  Net Common Equity, that is
after deducting goodwill and other intangibles, as a percentage of BIS capital
is at 6.49% for TD, again more than one percent higher than the average of the
other five banks and more than 60 basis points higher than that of our nearest
competitor.  At this moment, TD has perhaps its strongest capital structure
ever.  The Balance Sheet is clean as we are not carrying any goodwill
whatsoever.  Also, an aggressively conservative approach to loan loss
provisioning --consistently applied through the years - has left us with the
lowest net NAL's as a percentage of Loans and BA's and as a percentage of common
equity of all the Canadian banks.  The stage is set in terms of financial
strength: the strongest capital ratios with the least likelihood of impairment
through loan losses through the rest of the economic cycle.  We believe that the
benefits of a commitment to financial strength are not just in the resulting
high credit rating, in the lower cost of funds and in the stability of the
institution, -- but also in the confidence it brings us to act swiftly on new
business opportunities in the future, without the burden of capital constraints
or concerns.

<h3>II.	LOW COSTS</h3>

<p>Being the low cost producer is not one of those strategies that can be switched
on overnight - it must result from a consistent focus over an extended period of
time.  And yet, in a world of shrinking and uncertain margins, it is of
paramount importance.  To achieve our low cost strategy, we have focused on
systems and technology --and we're making progress.

<p>Ten years ago, over 90% of the transactions in our branches were processed in
those branches.  Today that number is less than 26%, and continuing to go down
as more and more transactions are handled electronically.  We are reducing our
paper processing costs at the rate of 5% per year.  All this while maintaining
our goals of the highest systems availability and virtually error free service.

<p>The same group that has steadily implemented systems and technology strategies
to reduce costs also accomplished the Central Guaranty Trust integration: on
time, below budget and with customer retention well above business case
projections.  There is more room to go in the reduction of our operating costs
through the adoption of new technologies and re-configurations.   For example,
in 1995, we will remove a stack of paper equivalent to the height of the CN
Tower that passes through the branches each month.  We  will be moving to chip
based mainframe technology over time, we believe the first to do so, which will
result in significantly lower processing costs and greater flexibility.  Our
systems and technology group continues to work closely with various areas of the
Bank to develop alternative channels for delivering new and existing products
and services to our customers.  Some will be introduced this year. In other
areas, we have found ways to add additional volumes of transactions through
existing and new businesses, thereby reducing our marginal costs.

<p>Our status as a low cost producer, as measured by the expense-to-gross profit
ratio, was eroded in 1994, primarily by the costs of starting up new businesses.
 As mentioned, every new initiative has been fully expensed, we have no goodwill
on our balance sheet. Productivity remains of extreme importance to us and we
are determined, as part of our core strategy, to get back into the lead in cost
management.

<h3>III.	CUSTOMER SERVICE</h3>

<p>&quot;Your Bank, Your Way&quot;.  There is no question that the Canadian public has and
will continue to demand better service from their financial institution -- in
fact from all suppliers of services. &quot;Your Bank, Your Way&quot; is TD's public
commitment to raise the performance bar with respect to customer service.  The
$5 - 5 minute service guarantee has been one of the more visible tactics by
which we have introduced a better service culture.  The positive change in the
branch culture and our customer satisfaction has been outstanding. 
Many other initiatives are well underway -- largely based on identifying
differing customer requirements revealed through research and customer
segmentation.

<p>Some people have asked if the branch network is still relevant for the delivery
of products and services to our retail customers.  And it is true that every
delivery channel, like products, has its life cycle.  Part of our challenge is
to extend and revitalize the life cycle of  the  branch system by: lowering
costs, expanding the number of customers, delivering more products through the
system and -- most important -- delivering higher value added services and
advice to our customers.  We are accomplishing this through a number of tactics,
including training and upgrading our staff (approximately 3,200 people took the
Mutual Fund National Review last fall), customer segmentation, product
development, systems improvements, etc., each of which may be considered a
strategy in itself. At the same time, the continuing development of Green Line
and other telephone banking and dealing services and the reviewing of other
distribution channels such as cable and PC based systems are of extremely high
priority.  These new channels of distribution are poised for rapid growth in the
future, although no one knows when and by how much.  TD is the industry leader
in most of the new and prospective delivery channels -- so we are well
positioned to take advantage of changing customer preferences when they occur. 
In the meantime, our branch system, which did not increase as rapidly as some of
our competitors' in the eighties, should prove more stable through the remainder
of the nineties.

<p>We have also increased our service levels in our corporate and treasury
businesses by adding experienced professionals who are leaders in their markets
and by bringing an integrated and industry focused approach to coverage and deal
or trade execution.  Our strategy of focusing our corporate coverage through a
Relationship Manager who is responsible for bringing all of TD's resources and
products to bear on solving customer problems and providing advice and financing
is meant first and foremost to increase customer service.  The same type of
coordinating value-added role is envisaged in the retail side of our business.

<p>Customer Service is a prime example of execution being at least as important as
strategy.  A tremendous amount of work is being done in this area -- we all know
that in the end, Customer Service is how we'll be judged.

<h3>IV.	REVENUE GROWTH</h3>

<p>No discussion of strategy can avoid the need to explain where  we see sources of
revenue growth.  Adding new customers and new businesses with existing customers
are obviously the two fundamental areas of focus.

<p>Adding new customers on a rationalized and stable cost base has been the primary
driver behind many of our recent acquisitions and initiatives.  And that
includes the GM Visa card, the Marathon acquisition, the Westpac asset
acquisition and CGT.  We are continually on the look-out for more opportunities
to bring new customers into our existing delivery capability.  The leverage
gained from this growth strategy has been outstanding.

<p>Of equal interest is the addition of new businesses and/or products to our
existing customer base and skill sets.  Here we have consistently held fast to
the view that all new ventures must maximize the leverage of our existing
skills, client base and infrastructure.  Every move that we have made or are
contemplating fits this set of criteria.  Also, when we are developing strategy,
we look carefully at whether it is enough simply to be involved in a product or
market, or whether it is necessary to be one of the top 3 &quot;players&quot; or even
number 1.  This type of decision is largely a matter of the cost of entry,
economies of scale and the risk adjusted profitability of any particular
business -- along with the need to meet our customers' needs and expectations.

<p>To illustrate this approach, I'll now talk about the Corporate and Investment
Bank, a subject that places me on home territory.

<p>Let me start with the building of our equity operation.  From a standing start
about 18 months ago, we have built a first rate institutional equity division
comprised of over 36 professionals and taking a growing share of the domestic
new issue and secondary trading markets.  Some aspects of this business
represent new skill sets for the Bank, such as the equity trading desk, and the
best possible people have been hired from within the industry to complement TD
Bank people who are being retrained.  These skill sets have been used to build
new sources of value added and hence revenue with our existing customer base. 
Other areas, however, play more naturally into the existing strengths of the
Bank; an example is research, which in some cases has been a natural extension
of the analytic support that underpins our Corporate Banking industry focus.  If
you were to survey the various Canadian banks and dealers, you would likely find
TD to have the highest level of industry specialization in its approach to
corporate and investment banking.  So, when building our equities business, our
first emphasis was on the communications industry -- where TD is a world leader
as a bank, followed by other industries where we have a strong franchise.  This
approach leveraged our corporate relationships, which are very strong, and also
the general expertise of management with respect to that industry.  So, while it
may not be reasonable to assume that, on an overall basis, we will be in the top
three or four of equity houses in the very near term, we will be very successful
in certain niches, such as communications, forestry, oil &amp; gas and mining. 
Other industries have followed and are raising the general level of capability
and market profile of the operation.  And by recruiting the best people in the
business who are at the same time compatible with TD's culture and who buy in to
our integrated approach -- the whole strategy is easier to implement and a
pleasure to manage.  It is not just the avoidance of paying large amounts for
goodwill that makes the build strategy attractive relative to buying.  It is
also the ability to maintain cultural integrity and remain focused on customers,
which can be difficult during a large and disruptive integration and
rationalization process.

<p>Other dealer initiatives such as asset securitization and mergers and
acquisitions were launched after similar analyses.  With respect to M&amp;A, given
TD's excellence in the acquisition finance business and the bank syndication
markets, and with our industry focus, becoming excellent (read top three) in the
M&amp;A and advisory business in Canada is important strategically, particularly at
this point in the market cycle.  To build this capability quickly in Canada is
difficult, hence the decision was made last fall to acquire Lancaster Financial,
primarily an M&amp;A boutique.  The integration process is going smoothly with
Lancaster, and should be completed within the next six weeks.

<p>Asset Securitization is another product area that leverages off of our
established strengths in corporate relationships, derivatives, money markets and
fixed income distribution, and will also be of increasing importance to our own
balance sheet management in the future.  But, only the top two or three in the
industry have been consistently profitable.  As a result, through external hires
and internal development we focused the resources necessary to assemble what we
believe to be the top asset securitization team in Canada, a team that is truly
and fully integrated into the Bank.

<p>In the U.S. we have followed a similar strategy of planning growth to lever off
of our existing customer relationships, skill and infrastructure.  It was
predictable that we should focus our M&amp;A activity in the U.S. in the
communications industry and we found the best person possible in the marketplace
to head it up.  The success thus far has been truly outstanding.  As you are no
doubt aware, we applied some time ago for our Tier II license.  Our areas of
focus will complement our franchise industries: communications, health care,
&quot;trees&quot; and &quot;rocks&quot; as well as our skills and market position in research, Bank
syndication and private placement markets.  Our geographic strategy is based
foremost on being a North American Bank.  Offshore, we continue to pursue our
treasury business in an aggressive manner in most of the world's major capital
market centres.  On the corporate side, we tend to keep to our industry focus
and follow  our key clients and industries worldwide.  For this reason we are
one of the leading cable and communications lenders in the U.K. and the leading
Canadian investment dealer in the underwriting and distributing of U.K. cable
stocks.  We are the only Canadian bank still fully operational in Australia,
sticking to our knitting in terms of industries and exposures.  Other
international operations are largely driven by Trade Finance, Private Banking
and Treasury Operations.

<p>Back in Canada, a renewed commitment to the fixed income business has resulted
in new and top level leadership for the area with a plan to be a top three or
four fixed income house within the next couple of years.

<p>As we build these businesses, we hear a lot of talk about integrated bank dealer
strategies.  One of our competitors even claims to be the first to integrate. 
However, TD's &quot;build&quot; strategy has meant that every single product and market
strategy has been fully integrated into the Bank as it has been introduced.
External hires are blended in with long term TD people to form a unique
bank/dealer culture, one that understands credit,  value and markets as well as
TD's way of dealing with our customers and employees.  It is a pleasure to work
there. By building on our centres of excellence and maintaining a solid
strategic framework, we also hope to be able to quickly seize opportunities not
yet even contemplated.

<p>In the banking industry, there has been a lot of emphasis given to the growth of
the bank syndication market, which allows banks to sell down lending positions,
to the importance of investment dealer products and to asset securitization, all
of which are important. There is a temptation to draw the conclusion that, like
some others, we are shunning credit products as part of our overall strategy. 
Not true.  It is true that we need to deliver more, non capital intensive
products to our credit relationships to attain a satisfactory return on equity
for our shareholders, but credit is and will continue to be central to our
overall strategy for the foreseeable future.  We have taken a more disciplined
approach to our exposures, aggregates, industry concentration, risk adjusted
rate of return calculations and overall customer profitability which will allow
us to satisfy our customers' credit needs while at the same time delivering long
term shareholder value.

<p>There are a host of other initiatives currently underway in TD that fit the
growth criteria outlined previously.  Some, such as a reformatted and mandated
merchant banking business have been well publicized; others will be announced
over the upcoming months.  In every case, there is a reluctance to step into new
products or markets unrelated to our existing businesses, our skill sets or our
clients.  Every strategic initiative is designed to leverage our strengths or
correct our weaknesses, strengthen our customer relationships and make more
money for our shareholders.

<p>Whether we are communicating with our retail, commercial, corporate,
institutional or government clients domestically or offshore, or our
shareholders, we believe we are delivering TD Bank as: Your Bank, Your Way.  I
have outlined our strategies for achieving this - but I suggest you continue to
look at our actions.

<p>Thank you for your attention and I would be pleased to take questions at this
time.

  INDEPENDENT ADVICE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF WEALTH

</H3>

<P>

<I>"There is a critical point in every successful person's life when the

management of wealth can benefit tremendously from experienced, trustworthy

advice. We are proud of the fact that TD Evergreen Investment Advisors are

the very best in the business."</I>

<P>

W. Keith Gray, Executive Vice President of The Toronto-Dominion Bank and

Chairman of TD Evergreen<BR>

<BR>

<H3>

  A Relationship of Trust is the Best Basis for Financial Success

</H3>

<P>

Investors reach a point in their financial life when wealth accumulation

becomes more than simply a matter of building savings at a reasonable rate

of return. Where the need for diversity and flexibility makes their investment

needs more complex. Where controlling tax is critical. Or where income becomes

important. Whatever the reason, sound objective advice based on experience

is essential. But seeking investment advice can be difficult. It's a matter

of trust.

<P>

TD Evergreen Investment Advisors know trust grows with performance, service

and professionalism. Performance - taking the time to evaluate your individual

situation and ensure no opportunity is overlooked. Service - timely reporting,

constant vigilance and regular contact to ensure your financial strategy

keeps up with changes in your life. Professionalism - adhering to the standards

of conduct you'd expect from your doctor or your lawyer; discretion, thoroughness

and an unwavering concern for your well-being.

<H3>

  We Help Individual Client's Uncover Every Opportunity for Financial Growth

  and Well-Being

</H3>

<P>

Created by The Toronto-Dominion Bank, TD Evergreen* offers clients a unique

and valuable service: complete, private, financial and investment advice

supported by the resources of one of Canada's largest banks. We hand picked

the most experienced investment specialists in the country. And we empowered

them to offer independent opinions and advice to their clients.

<P>

Our network of TD Evergreen offices across the country utilize the many resources

of the TD Bank including one of the most sophisticated transaction and account

management systems in Canada.

<P>

As a result, TD Evergreen offers clients access to an almost limitless range

of financial products - everything from individual stocks to over 400 mutual

funds world-wide; fixed income securities; registered products such as

self-directed RRSP's and RRIF's; and special banking and account services

specially designed for investors.

<H3>

  Wise Advice Begins with Knowledge

</H3>

<P>

Building and managing comprehensive personal financial strategies is the

basis of TD Evergreen's business. We hold to a fundamental belief that only

through a complete review of your financial position, investment objectives

and long term goals can we offer our best advice.

<P>

We believe thoroughness is also essential in investment research. TD Evergreen

makes investment research on local and world markets available from many

sources including TD Securities Inc., TD Bank Department of Economic Research,

Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Standard and Poor's and International Bank

Credit Analyst.

<P>

Not limited to global securities, our research includes other financial matters

necessary to provide you with the most complete personal financial strategy

possible.

<P>

<I>"Our Investment Advisors' unique approach to the business of wealth management

is not only meeting, but exceeding the expectations of our clients."</I>
