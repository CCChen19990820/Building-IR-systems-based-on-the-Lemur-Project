<H1>Consumers To Benefit From Historic Legislation</H1>
<p>
<B>See also:<br>
<A HREF="parchar.html">Questions and Answers About the New Law</B></A>

<hr><font size=+2>I</font>n a historic step toward ending discrimination against individuals
in need of mental health services, Congress has passed a provision that
will prevent the placement of annual and lifetime limits on mental health
services that are not placed on services for physical health. </P>

<P>&quot;This is an important victory for consumers. The law will expand
patients' access to appropriate mental health services by allowing necessary
treatment to continue without the risk of an arbitrary dollar limit stopping
it,&quot; according to Russ Newman, Ph.D., J.D., executive director of
the APA Practice Directorate. &quot;A recent national survey conducted
prior to passage of this legislation indicated that 7 out of 10 Americans
see access to and coverage of mental health care as very important. However,
only 35% agree that people in the U.S. have adequate access to mental health
care.&quot; </P>

<P>Before Congress took action, health plans could apply two vastly different
dollar limits to medical/surgical benefits versus mental health benefits.
For example, in some cases this meant a $1 million lifetime limit for medical/surgical
services as compared to a $50,000 lifetime limit for mental health services.
Under the new parity requirement, plans may no longer impose such separate,
unequal dollar limits on either a lifetime or annual basis. The new parity
requirement does not, however, affect the day or visit limits contained
in some health insurance policies. </P>

<P>The new parity requirement applies to all group health plans, including
managed care plans, as well as self-insured plans (ERISA plans) under which
most Americans currently receive coverage. It covers plans in the Federal
Employee Health Benefits Program, but not Medicare or Medicaid programs.
Small businesses with 50 or fewer employees are also exempt, and the law
does not apply to the treatment of substance abuse or chemical dependency.
</P>

<P>Patients may still face higher annual deductibles and co-payments for
each outpatient session than they must pay for medical visits. However,
the law makes it far less likely that people requiring outpatient psychotherapy
will be forced to discontinue treatment or pay for services out-of-pocket
simply for having reached an insurance policy's annual dollar limit on
mental health services. </P>

<P>&quot;This legislation puts the interests of patients first,&quot; Newman
said. &quot;People whose access to mental health services has been discontinued
or disrupted because of coverage limits stand to gain tremendously from
this new law. With 69% of Americans acknowledging the importance of seeking
professional help for problems they cannot resolve themselves, removing
this barrier is a major step forward for consumers.&quot; </P>

<P>For more information on how to access psychological services, call the
American Psychological Association's consumer information line at 800-964-2000.

<TITLE>How Therapy Helps People Recover from Depression</TITLE>

<H1>How Therapy Helps People Recover from Depression</H1>


<HR>
<I>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated
17 million adult Americans suffer from depression during any one-year period.
Many do not even recognize that they have a condition that can be treated
very effectively. This question-and-answer fact sheet discusses depression
with a focus on the ways in which psychotherapy can help a depressed person
recover.</I>
<p>
<H3><B>How does depression differ from occasional sadness? </B></H3>

<P>Everyone feels sad or &quot;blue&quot; on occasion. Most people grieve
over upsetting life experiences such as a major illness, loss of job, a
death in the family or divorce. These feelings of grief tend to become
less intense on their own as time goes on.</P>

<P> Depression occurs when feelings of extreme sadness or despair last
for at least two weeks or longer and when they interfere with activities
of daily living -- such as working, or even eating and sleeping. Depressed
individuals tend to feel helpless and hopeless and to blame themselves
for having these feelings. Some may have thoughts of death or suicide.</P>

<P> People who are depressed may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop
participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw
from family and friends.</P>

<H3> <B>What causes depression?</B></H3>

<P>Changes in the body s chemistry influence mood and thought processes,
and biological factors contribute to some cases of depression. In addition,
chronic and serious illness such as heart disease or cancer may be accompanied
by depression. With many individuals, however, depression signals first
and foremost that certain mental and emotional aspects of a person s life
are out of balance.</P>

<P> Significant transitions and major life stressors such as the death
of a loved one or the loss of a job can help bring about depression. Other
more subtle factors that lead to a loss of identity or self-esteem may
also contribute. The causes of depression are not always immediately apparent,
so the disorder requires careful evaluation and diagnosis by a trained
mental health care professional.</P>

<P> Sometimes the circumstances involved in depression are ones over which
an individual has little or no control. At other times, however, depression
occurs when people are unable to see that they actually have choices and
can bring about change in their lives.</P>

<H3> <B>Can depression be treated successfully?</B></H3>

<P>Absolutely. Depression is highly treatable when an individual receives
competent care. Psychologists are among the licensed and highly trained
mental health providers with years of experience studying depression and
helping patients recover from it.</P>

<P> There is still some stigma, or reluctance, associated with seeking
help for emotional and mental problems, including depression. Unfortunately,
feelings of depression often are viewed as a sign of weakness rather than
as a signal that something is out of balance. The fact is that people with
depression can not simply &quot;snap out of it&quot; and feel better spontaneously.</P>

<P> Persons with depression who do not seek help suffer needlessly. Unexpressed
feelings and concerns accompanied by a sense of isolation can worsen a
depression. The importance of obtaining quality professional health care
can not be overemphasized.</P>

<H3> <B>How does psychotherapy help people recover from depression?</B></H3>

<P>There are several approaches to psychotherapy -- including cognitive-behavioral,
interpersonal, psychodynamic and other kinds of &quot;talk therapy&quot;
-- that help depressed individuals recover. Therapy offers people the opportunity
to identify the factors that contribute to their depression and to deal
effectively with the psychological, behavioral, interpersonal and situational
causes. Skilled therapists can work with depressed individuals to:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI>pinpoint the life problems that contribute to their depression, and
help them understand which aspects of those problems they may be able to
solve or improve. A trained psychotherapist can help depressed patients
identify options for the future and set realistic goals that enable these
individuals to enhance their mental and emotional well-being. Therapists
also help individuals identify how they have successfully dealt with similar
feelings, if they have been depressed in the past.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>identify negative or distorted thinking patterns that contribute to
feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that accompany depression. For
example, depressed individuals may tend to overgeneralize, that is, to
think of circumstances in terms of &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never.&quot;
They may also take events personally. A trained and competent therapist
can help nurture a more positive outlook on life.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>explore other learned thoughts and behaviors that create problems and
contribute to depression. For example, therapists can help depressed individuals
understand and improve patterns of interacting with other people that contribute
to their depression.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>help people regain a sense of control and pleasure in life. Therapy
helps people see choices as well as gradually incorporate enjoyable, fulfilling
activities back into their lives.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Having one episode of depression greatly increases the risk of having
another episode. There is some evidence that ongoing therapy may lessen
the chance of future episodes or reduce their intensity. Through therapy,
people can learn skills to avoid unnecessary suffering from later bouts
of depression. </P>

<H3><B>In what other ways do therapists help depressed individuals and
their loved ones?</B></H3>

<P>The support and involvement of family and friends can play a crucial
role in helping someone who is depressed. Individuals in the &quot;support
system&quot; can help by encouraging a depressed loved one to stick with
treatment and to practice the coping techniques and problem-solving skills
he or she is learning through therapy.</P>

<P> Living with a depressed person can be very difficult and stressful
on family members and friends. The pain of watching a loved one suffer
from depression can bring about feelings of helplessness and loss.</P>

<P> Family or marital therapy may be beneficial in bringing together all
the individuals affected by depression and helping them learn effective
ways to cope together. This type of therapy can also provide a good opportunity
for individuals who have never experienced depression themselves to learn
more about it and to identify constructive ways of supporting a loved one
who is suffering from depression.</P>

<H3> <B>Are medications useful for treating depression? </B></H3>

<P>Medications can be very helpful for reducing the symptoms of depression
in some people, particularly for cases of moderate to severe depression.
Some health care providers treating depression may favor using a combination
of therapy and medications. Given the side effects, any use of medication
requires close monitoring by the physician who prescribes the drugs.</P>

<P> Some depressed individuals may prefer psychotherapy to the use of medications,
especially if their depression is not severe. By conducting a thorough
assessment, a licensed and trained mental health professional can help
make recommendations about an effective course of treatment for an individual
s depression. </P>

<P>Depression can seriously impair a person s ability to function in everyday
situations. But the prospects for recovery for depressed individuals who
seek appropriate professional care are very good. By working with a qualified
and experienced therapist, those suffering from depression can help regain
control of their lives.</P>

<H1>Ideals of sport psychology can also work off the field</H1>
<I>With images from the Olympics still vividly in memory, the Help Center offers a focus on sport psychology and its many applications. In addition to this NewsView article, information on sport psychology is available in the sections below.</I>
<hr>
<FONT SIZE=5>L</FONT>aid off several months earlier, John needed
work. In fact, he wanted a job so badly he sabotaged interview
after interview, letting his anxiety overshadow his impressive
qualifications.
<P>
Working himself into a frenzy of self-doubt before each appointment,
he would arrive at the scheduled time with sweaty palms, a face
that betrayed his nervousness and an attitude that convinced the
potential employer that John was right: He couldn't do the job.
Desperate, he finally turned to a psychologist for help.
<P>
If the psychologist were Robert N. Singer, PhD, John would quickly
find himself immersed in the world of sport psychology. 
<P>
Sport? Yes, said Singer, president of APA's Div. 47 (Exercise
and Sport) and chair of the department of exercise and sport sciences
at the University of Florida in Gainesville. 
<P>
A patient like John could clearly benefit from the same techniques
sport psychologists use to reduce arousal levels in elite athletes,
he said.
<P>
&quot;Just as an athlete might mentally prepare for a sports event,
the patient could rehearse in advance what he's going to say and
how he's going to say it, as well as anticipate questions that
might come up and how he's going to answer them,&quot; said Singer,
noting that visualization reduces stress, builds confidence and
ultimately leads to a better performance.
<H3>Enhancing performance </H3>

<P>
Like Singer, many psychologists recognize that sport-psychology
techniques such as visualization, positive self-talk and cognitive
restructuring have applications beyond sports. A growing number
of them are incorporating sport psychology into their practices
and taking the message out to the community.
<P>
The techniques work just as well in everyday situations. A patient
who isn't performing well at work might benefit from a technique
called cognitive restructuring. With a psychologist's help, the
patient thinks about how well he is making his points at a meeting
rather than how his boss is hating every word and plotting to
fire him.
<P>
Other techniques commonly used to enhance performance include
emphasizing process vs. outcome; using deep breathing and progressive
muscle relaxation to manage stress; and shifting attributional
orientations from external factors, such as incompetent bosses,
to internal factors, such as poor preparation.
<H3>Building winning teams </H3>

<P>
Psychologists aren't just sharing sport psychology ideas with
patients; they're also working with corporations eager to reconceptualize
themselves as winning teams in an era of downsizing. 
<P>
&quot;When you see someone competing in the Olympics, you know
that's high-pressure stress,&quot; said Shane M. Murphy, PhD,
who was head of sport psychology for the U.S. Olympic Committee
between 1987 and 1994. &quot;But there's also the stress of trying
to increase productivity while lowering costs, the stress of working
long hours on jobs that might take weeks or months, the stress
of fitting into a team where individual goals have to fit into
group goals.&quot;
<P>
Helping employees develop the psychological skills needed to manage
this kind of chronic stress is a major goal of Gold Medal Psychological
Consultants, the business Murphy now runs. One recent client was
a nuclear energy company whose employees were flunking a federal
licensing exam despite extremely thorough preparation. When Murphy
interviewed the employees, he discovered that the stress of being
in the actual testing situation was making their minds freeze
up. 
<P>
To help the employees cope, Murphy used the same skills he teaches
the professional teams who represent the bulk of his business:
relaxation techniques, self-talk strategies and cognitive restructuring.
And he got them to switch from a results focus to an action focus.
&quot;Once you've moved from 'I have to pass this exam!' to 'How
can I do what I'm doing right now as well as possible?' you'll
do a lot better in any situation,&quot; he explained. The result
of Murphy's intervention? The company's failure rates are down
by half.
<P>
Sport psychology will play an increasingly important role in both
the corporate world and in clinical practice, predicted Murphy,
whose continuing-education workshops attract primarily clinical
psychologists.
<P>
&quot;A lot of them say that with managed care's increasing emphasis
on short-term results and increased productivity, these ideas
are very applicable to what they do,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot
of them tell me they wish they'd heard about this earlier.&quot;

<h1>Middle School Malaise</h1>
<hr>
<font size=+1>J</font>une.  The end of the school year.  For many children this summer
represents a critical transition between elementary and secondary
education.  It sounds fairly simple, but according to many educators
and school psychologists the transition marks a point where some
kids thrive and others begin a serious downward spiral.
<P>
The switch from elementary to junior high school coincides with
several major changes for young adolescents.   Most are in the
throes of puberty; they're becoming more self-aware and self-conscious,
and their thinking is growing more critical and more complex.
At the same time, adolescents are often "in a slump"
when it comes to academic motivation and performance.  

<P>
Researchers at the University of Michigan have studied the transition
from elementary to middle school and have found that:

<ul>
<li> On average, children's grades drop dramatically during the
first year of middle school compared to their grades in elementary
school.

<P>
<li> After moving to junior high school, children become less
interested in school and less self-assured about their abilities.


<P>
<li> Compared to elementary schools, middle schools are more
controlling, less cognitively challenging and focus more on competition
and comparing students' ability. 
</ul>
<P>
Through this and other similar research, psychologists have discovered
a &quot;developmental mismatch&quot; between the environment and
philosophy of middle schools and the children they attempt to
teach.  At a time when children's cognitive abilities are increasing, middle school offers them fewer opportunities for decision-making and lower levels of cognitive involvement, but a more complex social environment. At the same time, numerous teachers have replaced the single classroom teacher and students often face larger classes and a new group of peers.

<P>
These factors all interact to make the transition to junior high
school difficult for many youngsters.  Studies find the decreased
motivation and self-assuredeness contribute to poor academic performance;
 poor grades trigger more self-doubt and a downward spiral can
begin.


<H3>New Learning Environment and New Goals</H3>


Elementary schools and elementary teachers often tend to be more
task-oriented in their teaching: The goal is to master a certain
task such as learning addition or subtraction.
<p>
 In junior high schools, however, the goal of teaching often becomes
attaining a certain grade. Learning is still key, but measuring performance is also part of the equation.

<P>
As the goals of the game change, some students adjust and thrive
while others do not.  Why?  

<P>
Many psychologists who study childhood education believe that
an important key is how children think about their own intelligence
and abilities.  If a child thinks of his or her intelligence
as fixed -- I'm either this dumb or this smart -- he or she will
avoid tasks that challenge their ability or risk failure.  Instead,
they chose to work on problems that they already know how to solve.
 

<P>
Children who think of intelligence as malleable -- they believe
they can get smarter if they work at it -- look for challenging
tasks and look at failure as a way to learn and improve.  These
children tend to blame their failures on a lack of effort rather
than a lack of ability.



<H3>Which Students Do the Best?</H3>


According to the research, children who believe that intelligence
can change over time made the best adjustment to secondary school;
this is true even if these children had low self-confidence. 
 It was actually the high-confidence kids who believed that their
intelligence was fixed who had the most trouble making the transition.
 These kids apparently believed that they should be able to do
well because they were smart and that extra effort in order to
learn a new skill was not necessary.  When "effortless" learning
did not take place, these students lost confidence, motivation
and interest.



<H3>What Can Parents Do?</H3>


<ul>
<li> Encourage your child to try new things, learn new skills.


<P>
<li> Tell them that it is OK to fail and act that way when they
do fail.

<P>
<li> Teach them that learning takes effort, time and practice.
</ul>

<h1>How To Achieve Good Mental Health</h1>
<hr>
<font size=+2>M</font>ay is  National Mental Health Month. On this occasion,
the American Psychological Association is encouraging Americans
to pause and think about their own mental health.
<P>
 Most Americans believe that good emotional health is just as
important as good physical health.  In fact, in a survey conducted
earlier this year, APA found that 84 percent of Americans feel
psychological health is important for overall good health.
<p>
 The survey also found some disturbing news -- 47 percent of Americans
don't know when it's appropriate to see a mental health professional
and 68 percent don't know how to find a mental health professional
to help them.<BR>

<P>
 People may need professional help to maintain good psychological
health in much the same way that you need a dentist to examine
a toothache, a physician to set a broken bone, and a lawyer to
answer legal questions.
<P>
&quot;One of the ways to achieve good mental health is
to talk to people you trust about what's bothering you,&quot;
said Dorothy Cantor, Psy.D., president of the American Psychological
Association.  &quot;Try not to turn a bad day into a major catastrophe
-- we all have bad days once in a while.  But, if time passes
and you're still feeling overwhelmed by problems in your life,
even after you have talked to people who you love, admire and
trust, then perhaps it's time to talk to a mental health professional.&quot;
<P>
 When you have a question about your emotional health, psychologists
can be a great resource.  Psychologists have the necessary background
and education to help you resolve your problems and help you find
solutions you may not have known existed.
<P>
 After graduation from college, psychologists spend an average
of seven years in graduate education training and research before
receiving a doctoral degree.  As part of their professional training,
they must complete a supervised clinical internship in a hospital
or organized health setting and at least one year of post-doctoral
supervised experience before they can practice independently in
any health care arena.
<P>
 According to Dr. Cantor, learning to talk about your problems
and concerns is an important part of taking good care of yourself
and maintaining good psychological health.
<P>
 &quot;When you have good emotional health, you're able to experience
feelings, share them appropriately and not be overwhelmed by them.
 That doesn't mean you can never be angry or sad.  It means finding
a balance and expressing your feelings appropriately,&quot; said
Dr. Cantor.
<P>
 Good psychological health means having the mental energy to function
well at home, at work and at play.  &quot;It means being able
to eat, sleep and relax without feeling anxious, depressed or
worried,&quot; she said.
<P>
<h3>How to maintain good mental health</h3>
<P>
 In addition to taking care of your loved ones and your career
-- it is important that you take care of yourself.  &quot;Find
time to do things you enjoy -- things that you're passionate about.
 Spend time exercising and eating well,&quot; suggested Dr. Cantor.
<P>
 She warns that when you put yourself last on the priority list,
you're not going to be able to maintain good psychological health.
 &quot;In some instances, women put themselves low on the priority
list and don't take care of themselves.  They become more concerned
with taking care of everyone else and they may forget about themselves.
 Men, on the other hand, have a tendency to ignore signals that
something is distressing them and typically won't talk about their
problems.
<P>
<h3>Good psychological health vs. good physical health</h3>
<P>
 Psychological health affects physical health.  &quot;We've been
told for so long to get physical checkups, but taking care of
our emotional well being has been sorely overlooked,&quot; she
said.  &quot;We are 'whole' people -- whole in the sense that
our minds and bodies are connected.  If we only take care of our
physical well-being and not our emotional well-being, it could
come back to haunt us.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;When we're doing the things that enable us to have good
emotional health, we're far more likely to maintain both the level
of physical and emotional health we need.  We feel energetic and
more productive at home and at work,&quot; said Dr. Cantor.

<H1>Oklahoma City's Trauma Lingers</H1>
<b>See also:<br>
<A HREF="tassey.html">Questions and Answers with John Tassey, Ph.D.</A>
</b>
<br>
<hr>
<font size=+2>A</font>pril has a new significance for Americans.
<p>
A year ago April 19, the world was stunned by the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Today the reverberations of America’s worst terrorist incident still echo in the minds of those intimately affected by it and, to varying degrees, in the minds of most Americans. It affected the psyche of a city, a state and an entire country.

<p>
The people of Oklahoma City -- with the help of the national
and international community -- have worked to rebuild what had
been destroyed, but the emotional and psychological damage is
less easily healed.
<P>
 While structures can be rebuilt and renovated, it takes much
more than building materials to restore people's security and
confidence taken away by traumatic events like the Oklahoma City
bombing, the Middle East suicide bombings, and the killing of
innocent schoolchildren in Dunblane, Scotland.
<P>
 Many people have either been in a traumatic situation or been
affected by one. Traumatic experiences are not limited to terrorist
acts, however. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and
floods which cause pain, suffering and loss are also traumatic
experiences. In addition, many children experience trauma at an
early age when they see violence in their home and community.
<P>
 &quot;Shock and denial are typical responses to disasters and
other kinds of trauma, especially shortly after the event,&quot;
said American Psychological Association President Dorothy Cantor,
Psy.D. &quot;As the initial shock subsides, reactions vary.&quot;
<P>
 Shock is a sudden and often intense disturbance of your emotional
state that may leave you feeling stunned or dazed. Denial involves
not acknowledging that something very stressful has happened,
or not experiencing fully the intensity of the event.
<P>
 Psychologists note that events like these can trigger strong
emotional reactions among people who were not personally involved
in the situation, but whose feelings of fear, alarm and insecurity
can lead to difficulty in coping effectively with daily life.
<P>
 In the instance of the Oklahoma City bombing, for example, people
who had never been to the state or knew any of the victims, still
were shocked after the incident.
<P>
 &quot;There were many people who thought something like that
could never happen in Oklahoma City,&quot; said John Tassey, Ph.D.,
a psychologist who was among the first mental health professionals
on the scene in Oklahoma City. He is also a member of the APA's
Disaster Response Network.  &quot;You look at the people in Oklahoma
City and see that they're a lot like you. That commonality, that
feeling that this could happen to you can really affect people
psychologically.&quot;
<P>
 The effects of trauma vary as greatly as the events which cause
trauma. Following are normal responses to traumatic events:
<UL>
<LI><I>Feelings become intense and sometimes are unpredictable.</I>
You may become more irritable than usual, and your mood may change
back and forth dramatically.
<LI><I>Thoughts and behavior patterns are affected by the trauma.</I>
You might have repeated and vivid memories of the event. You may
find it difficult to concentrate or make decisions, or become
more easily confused. Sleeping and eating patterns also may be
disrupted.
<LI><I>Recurring emotional reactions are common.</I> Anniversaries
of the event, such as at one month or one year, can trigger upsetting
memories of the traumatic experience. These &quot;triggers&quot;
may be accompanied by fears that the stressful event will be repeated.
<LI><I>Interpersonal relationships often become strained.</I>
You may have more arguments with family members and co-workers
or you might become withdrawn and isolated.
<LI><I>Physical symptoms may accompany the extreme stress.</I>
Headaches, nausea and chest pain may result and may require medical
attention.
</UL>

<P>
<B></B>
<P>
 These effects, when coupled with a number of other factors, can
affect the length of time needed for recovery. An intense sense
of loss or general inability to cope with emotionally challenging
situations and other stressful events can all make recovery that
much more stressful.
<P>
 &quot;It's important to realize that there is not one 'standard'
pattern of reaction to the extreme stress of traumatic experiences,&quot;
Dr. Cantor said. &quot;Some people respond immediately, while
others have delayed reactions.&quot;
<P>
 There are ways in which you can help yourself or those who have
been affected by a traumatic experience:
<UL>
<LI><I>Give yourself time to heal.</I> Anticipate that this will
be a difficult time in your life. Allow yourself to mourn the
losses you have experienced. Be patient with changes in your emotional
state.
<LI><I>Ask for support from people who care about you.</I> Communicate
your experience in what ever ways feel comfortable to you -- such
as by talking with family or close friends.
<LI><I>Find out about local support groups.</I> These can be especially
helpful for people with limited personal support systems. Find
groups led by appropriately trained and experienced professionals.
Group discussions can help people realize other individuals in
the same circumstances have similar reactions and emotions.
<LI><I>Engage in healthy behaviors.</I> Eat well-balanced meals
and get plenty of rest. If you experience ongoing difficulties
with sleep, you may be able to find some relief through relaxation
techniques.
<LI><I>Establish or reestablish routines.</I> Eat meals at regular
times and follow an exercise program. Take some time off from
the demands of daily life by pursuing hobbies or other enjoyable
activities.
<LI><I>Avoid major life decisions.</I> Switching careers or jobs
can be highly stressful and could add additional strain on your
emotional well-being.
<LI><I>Become knowledgeable about what to expect.</I> Know what
the normal reactions are during and after a traumatic experience.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 Children, in particular, may have special needs. They might ask,
&quot;Could this happen to me?&quot; There are some ways to help
them cope with their trauma:
<UL>
<LI><I>Spend more time with children and let them be more dependent
on you.</I> Allow your child to cling to you more than usual during
the months following trauma. Physical affection is very comforting
to children who have experienced trauma.
<LI><I>Provide play experiences to help relieve tension.</I> Younger
children in particular may find it easier to share their ideas
and feelings about the event through non-verbal activities such
as drawing.
<LI><I>Encourage older children to speak with you, and with one
another, about their feelings.</I> This helps their confusion
and anxiety related to the trauma.
<LI><I>Keep regular schedules.</I> To help restore a sense of
security and normalcy, stay with the usual times for eating, playing
and going to bed.
</UL>

deal with your or your child's psychological needs. Call the APA

<h1>Raising Children to Resist Violence: What You Can Do</h1>
<hr>
<font SIZE=+2>N</font>early every day the news reports stories about
children committing acts of violence, often against other children. 
<br>
<br>Research has shown that violent or aggressive behavior is often learned
early in life. However, parents, family members, and others who care for
children can help them learn to deal with emotions without using violence.
Parents and others can also take steps to reduce or minimize violence.


<p><h2>SUGGESTIONS FOR DEALING WITH CHILDREN</h2>
Parents play a valuable role in reducing violence by raising children
in safe and loving homes. Here are suggestions that can help. You may not
be able to follow each one exactly, but doing what you can will make a
difference in your children's lives. 

<h2>Give your children consistent love and attention.</h2> 
Every child needs a strong, loving, relationship with a parent or other
adult to feel safe and secure and to develop a sense of trust. Behavior
problems and delinquency are less likely to develop in children whose parents
are involved in their lives, especially at an early age.</p>

<p>It's not easy to show love to a child all the time. It can be even harder
if you are a young, inexperienced, or single parent, or if your child is
sick or has special needs. If your baby seems unusually difficult to care
for and comfort, discuss this with your child's pediatrician, another physician,
a psychologist, or a mental health provider. He or she can give you advice
and direct you to local parenting classes that teach positive ways to handle
the difficulties of raising children.</p>

<h2>Make sure your children are supervised. 
<br></h2>Children depend on their parents and family members for encouragement,
protection, and support as they learn to think for themselves. Without
proper supervision, children do not receive the guidance they need. Studies
report that unsupervised children often have behavior problems.</p>

<p>Insist on knowing where your children are at all times and who their
friends are. When you are unable to watch your children, ask someone you
trust to watch them for you. Never leave young children home alone, even
for a short time.</p>

<p>Encourage your school-aged and older children to participate in supervised
after-school activities such as sports teams, tutoring programs, or organized
recreation. Enroll them in local community programs, especially those run
by adults whose values you respect.</p>

<p>Accompany your children to supervised play activities and watch how
they get along with others. Teach your children how to respond appropriately
when others use insults or threats or deal with anger by hitting. Explain
to your children that these are not appropriate behaviors, and encourage
them to avoid other children who behave that way.</p>

<p><h2>Show your children appropriate behaviors by the way you act. 
<br></h2>Children often learn by example. The behavior, values, and attitudes
of parents and siblings have a strong influence on children. Values of
respect, honesty, and pride in your family and heritage can be important
sources of strength for children, especially if they are confronted with
negative peer pressure, live in a violent neighborhood, or attend a rough
school.</p>

<p>Most children sometimes act aggressively and may hit another person.
Be firm with your children about the possible dangers of violent behavior.
Remember also to praise your children when they solve problems constructively
without violence. Children are more likely to repeat good behaviors when
they are rewarded with attention and praise.</p>

<p>Parents sometimes encourage aggressive behavior without knowing it.
For example, some parents think it is good for a boy to learn to fight.
Teach your children that it is better to settle arguments with calm words,
not fists, threats, or weapons. And most importantly, don't hit your children.</p>

<p><h2>Be consistent about rules and discipline. 
<br></h2>When you make a rule, stick to it. Children need structure with
clear expectations for their behavior. Setting rules and then not enforcing
them is confusing and sets up children to &quot;see what they can get away
with.&quot;</p>

<p>Parents should involve children in setting rules whenever possible.
Explain to your children what you expect, and the consequences for not
following the rules. This will help them learn to behave in ways that are
good for them and for those around them.</p>

<p><h2>Keep violence out of your home. 
<br></h2>Violence in the home can be frightening and harmful to children.
Children need a safe and loving home where they do not have to grow up
in fear. A child who has seen violence at home does not always become violent,
but he or she may be more likely to try to resolve conflicts with violence.

<br>
<br>Work toward making home a safe, nonviolent place, and always discourage
violent behavior between brothers and sisters. Keep in mind as well that
hostile, aggressive arguments between parents frighten children and set
a bad example for them. 
<br>
<br>If the people in your home physically or verbally hurt and abuse each
other, get help from a psychologist or some other type of mental health
provider. He or she will help you and your family understand why violence
at home occurs and how to stop it. </p>

<p><h2>Try to keep your children from seeing too much violence in the media.

<br></h2>A report released earlier this month again confirmed that seeing
a lot of violence on television, in the movies, and in video games can
have a negative effect on children. As a parent, you can control the amount
of violence your children see in the media. Here are some ideas: </p>

<ul>
<li>Limit television viewing time to 1 to 2 hours a day. </li>

<li>Make sure you know what TV shows your children watch, which movies
they see, and what kinds of video games they play. </li>

<li>Talk to your children about the violence that they see on TV shows,
in the movies, and in video games. </li>

<li>Help them understand how painful it would be in real life and the serious
consequences for violent behaviors. </li>

<li>Discuss with them ways to solve problems without violence. </li>
</ul>

<p><h2>Help your children stand up against violence. 
<br></h2>Support your children in standing up against violence. Teach them
to respond with calm but firm words when others insult, threaten, or hit
another person. Help them understand that it takes more courage and leadership
to resist violence than to go along with it. 
<br>
<br>Help your children accept and get along with others from various racial
and ethnic backgrounds. Teach them that criticizing people because they
are different is hurtful, and that name-calling is unacceptable. Make sure
they understand that using words to start or encourage violence-or to quietly
accept violent behavior-is harmful. Warn your child that bullying and threats
can be a set-up for violence.</p>

<H1>Children and television violence</H1>
<hr>
<font size=+2>V</font>iolence on television affects children negatively, according
to psychological research.
<P>
The three major effects of seeing violence on television are:
<UL>
<LI>Children may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering
of others.
<LI>Children may be more fearful of the world around them.
<LI>Children may be more likely to behave in aggressive ways toward
others.
</ul>
<p>
 Studies by George Gerbner, Ph.D., at the University of Pennsylvania,
have shown that children's television shows contain about 20 violent
acts each hour and also that children who watch a lot of television
are more likely to think that the world is a mean and dangerous
place.
<P>
 Children often behave differently after they've been watching
violent programs on television. In one study done at Pennsylvania
State University, about 100 preschool children were observed both
before and after watching television; some watched cartoons that
had many aggressive and violent acts; others watched shows that
didn't have any kind of violence. The researchers noticed real
differences between the kids who watched the violent shows and
those who watched nonviolent ones.
<P>
 Children who watched the violent shows were more likely to strike
out at playmates, argue, disobey authority and were less willing
to wait for things than those children who watched nonviolent
programs.
<P>
 Field studies by Leonard Eron, Ph.D. and his associates at the
University of Illinois, found that children who watched many hours
of television violence when they were in elementary school tended
to also show a higher level of aggressive behavior when they became
teenagers. By observing these youngsters until they were 30 years
old, Dr. Eron found that the ones who'd watched a lot of television
when they were eight years old were more likely to be arrested
and prosecuted for criminal acts as adults.<BR>

<P>
<h2>Questionable Influences<BR>
</h2>
<P>
 For most of television's early years, it was difficult to find
role models who would inspire young girls in the viewing audience.
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, a new genre of programs such as &quot;Charlie's
Angels,&quot; &quot;Wonder Woman,&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;
entered the scene.
<P>
 Now, there were females on television who were in control, aggressive
and were not dependent upon males for their success.
<P>
 Conventional wisdom might suggest this phenomena would have a
positive impact on younger female viewers. But, a recent study
by L. Rowell Huesmann, Ph.D. -- a psychologist at the Aggression
Research Group at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social
Research -- refutes that premise.
<P>
 Huesmann's research states that young girls who often watched
shows featuring aggressive heroines in the 1970s have grown up
to be more aggressive adults involved in more confrontations,
shoving matches, chokings and knife fights than women who had
watched few or none of these shows.
<P>
 One example cited by Huesmann is that 59 percent of those who
watched an above-average amount of violence on television as children
were involved in more than the average number of such aggressive
incidents later in life.
<P>
 Huesmann says that ages six to eight are very delicate and critical
years in the development of children. Youngsters are learning
&quot;scripts&quot; for social behavior that will last them throughout
their life.
<P>
 Huesmann found those &quot;scripts&quot; didn't always have happy
endings.
<P>
 In the onset of his research -- which took place between 1977
and 1979 -- Huesmann asked 384 girls in the first through fifth-grades
in Oak Park, Ill. about their viewing habits.
<P>
 In his follow-up between 1992 and 1995, he tracked down 221 of
the original subjects and collected information on their life
histories. Huesmann had subjects enter responses into a computer
and as an accuracy check, Huesmann got information about each
subject from a close friend or spouse. <BR>

<P>
<h2>What Is Being Done About The Problem</h2>
<P>
 The television industry took steps toward implementing a ratings
system for its programming at a meeting with President Clinton
in late February.
<P>
 The policy is to develop a ratings system for television programs
that will give parents an indication of content not suitable for
children.
<P>
 The rating system may use letter codes (such as PG-7 for programs
deemed suitable for children aged 7 and up, PG-10, PG-15, etc.),
or the television industry may develop a short description of
content which would be broadcast prior to the program.
<P>
 Unlike the Motion Picture Association of America, which uses
an independent third-party board to rate films, television networks
will rate their own programs.
<P>
 &quot;I agree with President Clinton's and the industry's decision
to promote some sort of ratings system and the use of the V-chip,&quot;
said Dorothy Cantor, PsyD, president of the American Psychological
Association. &quot;We live in an era where both parents are often
working and children have more unsupervised time. Parents need
help in monitoring the amount of television and the quality of
what kids watch while they're young.&quot;
<P>
 According to recent studies, the following steps can help parents
maintain some control in shaping their child's viewing habits.
<UL>
<LI>Watch at least one episode of the program your child views
so you can better understand the content and discuss it with them.
<LI>Explain questionable incidents (e.g. random violence) that
occur and discuss alternatives to violent actions as ways to solve
problems.
<LI>Ban programs that are too violent or offensive.
<LI>Restrict television viewing to educational programming and
shows or programs which demonstrate helping, caring and cooperation.
<LI>Encourage children to participate in more interactive activities
such as sports, hobbies or playing with friends.
<LI>Limit the amount of time children spend watching television.
</UL>

<P>
There are experienced psychologists who can help
you learn to deal with your child's psychological needs.  Call
the APA at <font size=+1>1-800-964-2000</font> to find a psychologist in your local
area.  Psychologists are bound by strict codes of ethics and laws
to keep all information confidential.

<title>Questions and Answers About the New Mental Health Parity Law</title></head>
<body bgcolor="ffffff">
<blockquote>
<img src=newsview.gif>
<h1>Questions and Answers About the New Mental Health Parity Law</h1>
<hr>

<p><I>President Clinton signed into law in late September a measure governing
parity of mental health insurance coverage and medical coverage
by group health plans. Following are answers to key questions
about the new parity law.</i>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>What does the new law require?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>The parity provision requires
that health plans offering mental health services to beneficiaries
not impose different annual or lifetime dollar limits on those
services than are applied to medical services. Under the provision,
health plans that do not apply aggregate lifetime or annual dollar
limits to medical and surgical benefits may not have such limits
for mental health benefits. For example, plans that do not place
an annual dollar limit on medical benefits may not establish an
annual dollar limit, such as $2,000, for mental health services.
Before the new law was enacted, a health plan could apply two
vastly different dollar limits to medical/surgical benefits vs.
mental health benefits. For example, a plan could place a $1 million
lifetime limit for medical/surgical, and a $50,000 lifetime limit
for mental health services. Under the new parity requirement,
plans may no longer impose such separate, unequal dollar limits
on either a lifetime or annual basis.

<P>The new parity requirement does not
affect the day or visit limits contained in some health insurance
policies.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>Are
managed-care plans affected by the new parity requirement?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>Yes. The parity requirement
applies to all group health plans, including managed-care plans.
Also, the new provision covers self-insured plans (ERISA plans)
under which most Americans now receive coverage. In this respect,
the parity provision is a landmark development, since Congress
has not altered ERISA plan benefits since 1986. The new parity
requirement applies to plans in the Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program, but not to the Medicare or Medicaid programs.

<P>It is important to note that the
parity provision does not address the inappropriate cost-containment
techniques applied by some managed-care and other health plans.
Instead, the requirement simply pertains to the annual and lifetime
dollar limits contained in health insurance policies. APA intends
to continue its active legislative advocacy efforts aimed at establishing
federal quality and cost containment standards for all health
plans.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>What companies are exempt from complying with the new parity
requirement?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>Small businesses of 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the new law.
All other companies must comply, although any business that can
demonstrate to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
that its health insurance premiums have increased by 1 percent
or more because of the parity provision may apply for a waiver
from the requirement.

<P>Such a scenario is unlikely, according
to an actuarial analysis prepared for the APA, as well as independent
estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The anticipated
premium increase resulting from the parity requirement is projected
not to exceed 0.4 percent.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>How
will the parity provision affect continuity of outpatient mental
health care?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>This law makes it far
less likely that a patient requiring outpatient psychotherapy
will be forced to discontinue treatment (or pay for services out-of-pocket)
simply for having reached an insurance policy's annual dollar
limit on mental health services.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>What about plans with separate annual dollar
limits that apply specifically to outpatient psychotherapy -- are
these limits now ended?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>Yes. Any health plan affected
by the new requirement may no longer impose a separate outpatient
psychotherapy dollar limit.


<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>
Does the requirement apply to all mental health-care services?


<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>It applies to all mental
health services that a health plan determines are &quot;medically
necessary.&quot; However, the parity provision does not apply
to the treatment of substance abuse or chemical dependency.


<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>
What is the impact on the amount that patients must pay
for individual outpatient visits?


<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>As before this provision passed,
clients may still face higher annual deductibles and co-payments
for each outpatient session than they must pay for medical visits.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>Q: </FONT>
Is this new parity law really going to make a difference?

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A: </FONT>The new parity requirement
is an important incremental step in helping to expand patient
access to mental health services. It constitutes a clear expression
by Congress of the desire to end discrimination against individuals
in need of these services. With this victory, patient interests
have for once prevailed over the cost-driven concerns expressed
by the business lobby. Patients whose care has been discontinued
or otherwise disrupted because of annual or lifetime dollar limits
in their health insurance coverage stand to gain tremendously
from this historic law.

<H1>Do You Know the Signs of an Anxiety Disorder?</H1>
<hr>
According to recent studies, anxiety disorders cost the United
States $46.6 billion in 1990, nearly one-third of the nation's
total mental health bill of $147 billion. We are not referring
to dollars spent on effective treatments, but rather to the costs
of worker absenteeism, job loss and alcohol/substance abuse.
<P>
<h3National Anxiety Disorders Screening Day is May 1</h3>
<P>
People can help themselves by recognizing the signs of anxiety
disorder. These can include:
<UL>
<LI>Endless checking or rechecking actions.
<LI>A constant and unrealistic worry about everyday occurrences
and activities.
<LI>Fear and anxiety that appear for no apparent reason. 
</UL>

<P>
&quot;People need to talk about what's bothering them,&quot; said
Dr. Cantor. &quot;Anxiety often comes about when people hold in
their fears until they begin to feel anxiety. People shouldn't
wait until they're paralyzed with anxiety before they seek some
kind of consultation.
<P>
&quot;They should talk with friends and loved ones about their
feelings. If problems remain, they should talk to someone who
can help. People shouldn't be ashamed of what they're feeling.
We all experience a wide range of feelings and there is no shame
in talking about them.&quot;
<P>
Anxiety disorders include the following:
<UL>
<LI><U>panic disorder</U>: a sudden, uncontrollable attack of
terror that can manifest itself with heart palpitations, dizziness,
shortness of breath, and an out of control or terribly frightening
feeling;
<LI><U>generalized anxiety disorder</U>: excessive anxiety and
worry that last for at least six months accompanied by other physical
and behavioral problems;
<LI><U>social phobia</U>: a persistent fear of one or more situations
in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny of others;
<LI><U>obsessive compulsive disorder</U>: repeated, intrusive
and unwanted thoughts that cause anxiety, often accompanied by
ritualized behavior that relieve this anxiety; 
<LI><U>post-traumatic stress disorder</U>: caused when someone
experiences a severely distressing or traumatic event. Recurring
nightmares and/or flashbacks and unprovoked anger are common symptoms.

</UL>

<P>
By contacting a psychologist, those who suffer from an anxiety
disorder can take the first step on the road to recovery. According
to the National Institutes of Mental Health, 90 percent of people
with emotional illnesses will improve or recover if they get treatment.
<P>
To locate the nearest screening site for Anxiety Disorders Screening
Day, call 1-800-442-2020. You will be asked to enter your zip
code into the telephone and you will be provided with the name
and number of the nearest screening site.
<P>
There are experienced psychologists who can help you learn to
deal with your or your child's psychological needs. Call 1-800-964-2000
to be connected with a state psychological referral service which
can help you find a psychologist in your local area. Psychologists
are bound by strict codes of ethics and laws to keep all information
confidential.

<h1>Questions and Answers with...<br>
John Tassey, Ph.D.</h1>
<P>
<h3>
 John Tassey, Ph.D., is a psychologist at the VA Hospital in Oklahoma
City.  He is a member of the American Psychological Association's
Disaster Response Network and was part of the team in Oklahoma
City to help those affected by the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building last April. Additionally, he is the chair of
the APA Task Force on the Mental Health Response to the Oklahoma
City Bombing.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> What kinds of reactions are common for people who experience
a traumatic situation?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> Extreme behaviors, feelings of anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks
are expected immediately following the event. Unfortunately, isolation,
substance abuse, domestic violence, self-harming behavior and
suicide are also common following traumatic events. The sooner
trauma victims and relief workers receive therapy, the more quickly
they will recover.<BR>

<P>
The message needs to get out that survivors are experiencing normal
reactions to abnormal events and that these reactions will subside
over time. Seeking qualified psychological help will help people
cope with their feelings and can often reduce the time it takes
to return to a &quot;new&quot; normal.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> How can people who have been exposed to a traumatic situation
help themselves to cope with what has happened?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> People exposed to traumatic situations need to recognize that
they may have abnormal experiences including flashbacks, nightmares,
heightened anxiety, or emotional numbing.<BR>

<P>
They should tell themselves that they are having normal reactions
to an abnormal situation. By letting other people know how they
are feeling, they can take advantage of the support others can
offer. Talking about their experiences as early as they are able
will help the psychological healing process begin.<BR>

<P>
Sometimes, family members, clergy or neighbors can provide comfort.
However, if the trauma is severe or sensitive, a specially-trained
mental health provider should be seen.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> Can therapy help? If so, in what ways?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> The research is very clear that therapy can help survivors
of traumatic events. Many survivors require only minimal treatment
in which they are able to explore their thoughts and feelings
and learn about how the mind and body react to trauma and how
to effectively cope with the loss.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> How can families help each other to survive a traumatic
event?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> Family support is the critical element of recovery from traumatic
events. The parents play an important role with their children
in establishing the guidelines of open communication, non-judgmental
expression of feelings, and seeking competent help outside the
family.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> What fears enter into people's minds in the wake of a terrorist
act?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> One of the greatest fears is a loss of control. When people
learn of a plane crash, some decide that they are never going
to fly again. When they hear about a shooting incident, they decide
that they are not going to visit certain sections of town. By
making these decisions, people feel like they can control what
is happening.<BR>

<P>
In the instance of Oklahoma City, people felt a real loss of control.
Here was a town that never makes the international news. Here
were innocent children in a daycare center. But then we hear about
their death -- and it's not from a natural disaster. Someone intentionally
and maliciously blew up a building.<BR>

<P>
The bombing shattered the illusions of security. People asked
the question, &quot;Where do you go to be safe?&quot;<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> How can parents best help their children cope with a traumatic
incident?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> First of all, it helps to find out what the child's concerns
are. If the child is concerned for the safety of their parent,
you need to help the children identify how the parent is safe.
Parents need to explain that they are safe when they leave the
house and they are protected from harm.<BR>

<P>
If the kids are concerned for their own safety, you can discuss
how to be safe. Ask the child what they need in order to feel
safe. Have your child draw how they feel safe. When kids draw,
they really can show what they feel and what they need.<BR>

<P>
Help the child to identify how they don't feel safe. The worst
thing we could do is make an assumption of what the child is scared
about. Instead of proscribing why they are scared, try to elicit
what the scary feelings are. Try to reassure them about those
concerns.<BR>

<P>
Parents need to limit exposure to media presentations. Young children
and pre-teens really cannot -- developmentally -- work with that
kind of information. How do you explain to a child that some of
their playmates were killed in the Federal Building? How do you
explain that some bad guy came in and killed their friends and
former teachers?<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> With the one-year commemoration of the Oklahoma City bombing
approaching, what types of mental health symptoms do you expect
to see within the community?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> You can always expect some return of or some manifestation
of some symptoms -- sleeplessness, fearfulness. But an anniversary
can bring out the other side as well -- a sense of reunion and
remembrance.<BR>

<P>
The community really banded together, but the community was more
than just Oklahoma City. During that first month, there was a
national -- if not international -- cohesion. I think that can
be recreated as we commemorate. There are a lot of activities
to facilitate that like bringing in survivors, family members
of the deceased and rescue workers. The commemoration will offer
both -- not only the re-experiencing of the unpleasant side effects,
but also the sense of togetherness.<BR>

<P>
<B><font size=+4>Q.</font> What impressed you most as far as the community's reaction
to the bombing?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<font size=+4>A.</font> The spirit of the community was overwhelming. Most of them
said let's do something and meet this thing face on.<BR>

<P>
Obviously, at first there was a lot of anger and emotions. But
these people really came together. They all felt they had to do
something. When the media trucks ran out of diesel fuel, people
brought out more. They dropped off steel-toed boots for the firefighters.
The Red Cross was swamped with volunteers. People stood out in
the rain, waiting to volunteer.<BR>

<P>
Instead of people heading for the bomb shelter, they decided to
do something about it, get involved. Many thought, &quot;This
is my chance to gives something.&quot; That was the overwhelming
sentiment. Events like this can galvanize a community.<BR>

<H3>When you need to talk to someone who can help, you need an experienced,
trained professional.<BR>
<BR>
There are many types of mental health providers you can choose from. What's
important is that you select a provider with appropriate training and qualifications.<BR>
<BR>
Psychologists spend an average of 7.2 years, in addition to their undergraduate
college degree, in education and training. They possess a unique combination
of scientific methods, along with substantial skills and experience in working
with people who have real life problems. Psychologists study the science
of human behavior, and then apply it, in a professional setting. Psychologists
are licensed by the state in which they practice.<BR>
<BR>
A psychologist can help you identify your problems, and then figure out
ways to best cope with them; to change contributing behaviors or habits;
or to find constructive ways to deal with a situation that is beyond your
control. </H3>

<H3>Therapy works by helping you objectively look at behaviors, feelings
and thoughts in situations which you find problematic. It helps you to learn
more effective ways in dealing with those situations.<BR>
<BR>
Therapy is a collaborative effort. You and your psychologist will identify
your goals - what you want to have happen, and agree on how you'll know
when you're making progress. Your psychologist will talk to you about the
length of time it may take to help you see changes.<BR>
<BR>
Progress, and change, can happen. Nine out of ten Americans surveyed by
Consumer Reports said that psychotherapy had helped them. And in another
recent major national study, half of the patients studied were making improvement
after eight sessions of therapy, 75 percent after six months of therapy.</H3>

<H2>Your privacy is important to you and will be important to your mental
health provider. All members of the American Psychological Association subscribe
to a <a href="http://www.apa.org/ethics/ethics.html">Code of Ethics</a> that requires strict efforts to maintain patient confidentiality.<BR>
<BR>
Today, patients are often asked to approve the release of information in
order to obtain insurance reimbursement or coverage for their treatment.
Your psychologist will only release that information if you sign a release
form indicating that you give your approval.</H2>

<H2>Many insurance and coverage plans, including HMOs, provide some level
of coverage for psychological services. In addition, governmentsponsored
health coverage programs (Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS, etc.) provide varying
levels of coverage.<BR>
<BR>
If you do not have coverage, and will be paying for your treatment out of
pocket, you can talk with your psychologist about sliding-scale fees, or
working out a payment plan. Community mental health centers are also an
alternative.<BR>
<BR>
Millions of Americans who have received help from psychological treatment
would say that it is one of the best investments they've made, in terms
of improving their lives. </H2>

<H2>Call your insurance health plan representative to find out exactly what
is covered -- outpatient therapy, inpatient treatment, etc. -- and what level
of coverage you have. <BR>
<BR>
Ask if the full cost of treatment is covered, or only a part. Inquire if
there are limits -- co-payments, limit on the number of visits, annual
or lifetime maximums.<BR>
<BR>
If the plan covers only &quot;medically necessary&quot; treatment, find
out how that decision is made.<BR>
<BR>
Ask what you can do if your coverage is denied or cut short.<BR>
<BR>
Find out if there is a group of providers, a &quot;network,&quot; that you
must choose from or if you can choose any qualified provider. If you can
choose any qualified provider, find out what licenses and degrees he or
she must have before reimbursement is authorized.</H2>

<H2>It's important that you talk with the benefits or human resources manager
at your employer. Let him/her know that you believe mental health services
are important, and that you are concerned that you have no or limited coverage.

<H2>First, gather information. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals.
Today, many family practitioners work with a team of providers, including
psychologists and can refer you to one they know and trust. Consult the
department of psychology at a local college or university, or the local
community mental health center. You could also ask a clergy member, as well
as family members and friends who may know of, or have heard about individual
psychologists. </H2>

<H2>Once you have the name or names of several 
psychologists, there are several questions you'll want to ask, including:<BR>
<HR>Are you a licensed psychologist? How long have you been practicing?<BR>
<HR>What areas do you specialize in (i.e., family therapy, marriage counseling,
etc.)?<BR>
<HR>What kind of treatment do you usually use, and why do you feel this
would be effective for my situation? How long would you expect my treatment
to last?<BR>
<HR>What are your fees? Will you accept my insurance or HMO coverage? Will
you directly bill my insurance company? Do you have a sliding fee scale,
or will you set up a payment plan?<BR>
<HR>Once you've established the credentials, it's important that you feel
comfortable with the psychologist, since your treatment will involve working
together as a team. A good rapport with your psychologist is critical. Choose
a psychologist with whom you feel comfortable and at ease.</H2>

<H1>Coping with Holiday Stress</h1>
<h3>Psychologist Dorothy Cantor, Psy.D. </H3>

<hr>
<font size=+2>&quot;T</font>he anticipation of the holiday season begins with Christmas
decorations going up around Halloween. It is no wonder that people
who expect to have the perfect holiday are set up for feeling
stressed out over the holidays,&quot; said psychologist Dorothy
Cantor, Psy.D., a private practitioner in Westfield, N.J., and
the current president of the American Psychological Association.
&quot;A person will get very disappointed if he or she expects
to get along with everyone in the family that historically doesn't
get along, just because it is the holiday season. Pegging the
holidays as a magical time for curing all past problems is not
being realistic and will get you into trouble.&quot;

In addition, you can choose from a variety of interesting formats that make better use of your time than traditional media.  Brief news summaries linked to the full text of a story let you choose hat you want to see in detail.  Future uses of the Web will include the option of customizing news sources according to your particular interests (see Pointcast below).

<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce</B> was formed in 1981 by the merger of the 60-year-old Littleton and Englewood Chambers of Commerce and became the Centennial Chamber of Commerce.  In 1988 the name was changed by the membership to more accurately reflect the Chamber's service area.  The South Metro Denver Chamber is currently the fastest growing and the third largest Chamber in the state.  Our members tell us that it is our responsive, pro-active, dynamic nature which brings them back year after year.  The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce is an investment in your business, and in your community's future.</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=6>ACCESSIBLE</FONT></B>
<P>
Make yourself at home.
<P>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 SRC="images/manchair.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
Energetic volunteers and staff  ensure that Chamber members get the most of their investment.  New members don't feel new for long.  They are immediately invited to participate and are given every opportunity to access programs which will best benefit their businesses.   
<P>
Have an idea?  Most of our new programs and services spring up from the thoughtful recommendations of members.  
<P>
Our special industry networks are a good example, bringing together business people who share common interests.  <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#women">Women in Business</A></B>, <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#home">Home-Based Businesses</A></B>, and our <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#prof">Young Professionals Network</A></B> represent other avenues to share information and make new contacts.
<P>
You can gain access to the political world too.  Our monthly <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#public">Public Affairs Council</A></B> is open to all Chamber members, opening up a range of committees and task forces, and featuring a variety of experts on metro area public policy issues. 
<P>
The Chamber's <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="calendar.html#bah">Business After Hours</A></B> is perhaps the best example of the Chamber's accessibility.  This is where you'll find our <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="board.html">Board of Directors</A></B>, our <B>Chairman's Club</B> volunteers, and our staff ready to help members feel at home.   It's hard to imagine an intimate gathering of 400 people... until you've attended one of our Business After Hours.
<P>
<B>Accessibility</B>.  It's the heart of our Chamber. 
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=6>INFLUENTIAL</FONT></B>
<P>
You don't have to be a 400-pound gorilla to get attention.
<P>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/gorillaman.jpg">The Chamber's voice is heard clearly by our elected officials, not only because of our growing size, but also because of the integrity of the process we use to craft Chamber positions. 
<P>
Straw polls are conducted monthly to get member input about issues which affect the business community.  Our <B>Legislative Issues Committee</B> incorporates that input into their  review of business-related bills, and final recommendations are made to our Board of Directors.  Press releases then publicize the Chamber's positions on important issues.  Through this process, we keep in close touch with the views of business members, and ensure that when we speak, we speak for our membership.
<P>
During the legislative session, we hold monthly <B>Legislative Breakfasts</B>, where we connect legislators with business people.  We even have a lobbyist at the Capitol.
<P>
But the Chamber's influence doesn't stop there.  The <B>Economic Development Group</B> is actively involved in creating jobs and serves as a critical liaison with local governmental entities in their economic development efforts. Through its company recruitment services,  exisiting business retention programs, community redevelopment efforts, and educational forums on critical economic development issues, the Group's impact on the south metro Denver community is significant.
<P>
<B>Influence</B>.  It takes strength, integrity and reputation.
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=6>SUPPORTIVE</FONT></B>
<P>
We're from the Chamber, and we're here to help you.
<P>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 SRC="images/woman.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>Really.  We know that business people have a wide range of needs, and we offer a wide range of support.
<P>
Some people do best in a classroom setting.  In targeted seminars and workshops, small businesses are shepherded through every stage of growth.  <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="education.html">Success Tracks</A></B> seminars, pre-business workshops, the Plan to Succeed Series - we have the instructors and topics you require.  
<P>
Some people prefer one-on-one.  In our <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#boss">BOSS</A></B> groups, small business owners serve as advisors to one another.  The <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#manage">Management Connection</A></B> brings together CEOs of mid-size companies to discuss common concerns.  Our <B><!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="volunteer.html#lead">LEADers</A></B> groups, where members actively promote the businesses of other group members, illustrate how vital members businesses are to one another.  Our <B>Business Relationships and Issues Group</B>, led by a psychologist, explores elements of human behavior which tend to undermine effective relationships in the business world.  It's member-to-member, and it works.
<P>
The <B>New Member Network</B> provides our members a chance to build small networks with other new members.  Their familiarity with other new members eases them into our larger networking groups.
<P>
If you're more of the cerebral type, we're no strangers to the information age.  <B>The Economic Development Group</B>'s customized research is available for businesses of any size who need specific information which will increase their effectiveness.    We're the only organization around, for example, with an analysis of every area zip code, including detailed business information.  Through Capitol Connection, the Chamber offers members an online computer service which accesses language, summaries and the status of every piece of legislation under review at the State Capitol.  
<P>
It only matters when it works.

The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce was recently named runner-up for the National Award of Excellence by the National Association of Membership Development, an arm of the American Chamber of Commerce Executives.  The award, the most prestigious national award bestowed on a chamber of commerce, was presented at the annual National Association of Membership Development conference in New York City.  Chamber president <!-- Link Tag -->

This year's meeting was sponsored by US WEST, TEXACO, Columbia HealthONE, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber &amp; Strickland, PC.

This Luncheon was the culmination of the Chamber's most successful year, and included a celebration of the efforts of outstanding volunteers, a poignant video retrospective, and, of course, the Chamber Ensemble.

Last month, as part of its ongoing public affairs presidential series,  the Chamber was host to a visit by Senator Bob Dole.  More than 800 <!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="memdir.html">Chamber members</A> and guests gathered for breakfast at Colorado Beach and Sport, which had been dramatically transformed overnight to a festive dining room.
<P>
Among the several elected officials on hand were Senator Hank Brown, Colorado Attorney General Gayle Norton, and U. S. Representative Scott McInnis.  On stage with them were our recent winners of the Small Business Person of the Year award, Tony Rosacci, TonyÕs Meats and Specialty Foods; Shari Leigh, MIACO Corporation; and Bill Heringer, Rocky Mountain Desk Corporation.
<P>
The event, which was photographed and videotaped by more than 50 members of the national press, was kicked off with a popular version of America the Beautiful by the Chamber Ensemble.
<P>
Special thanks goes to the Arapahoe County SheriffÕs Department for their extraordinary vigilance and professionalism, Colorado Beach and Sport for providing their beautiful facility, Pro Entertainment for the use of their professional studio for the rehearsals of the Chamber Ensemble, and Mutual Graphics for their overtime gymnastics in getting our flyers printed and mailed.

<P>
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 BORDER=4 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/romer.jpg">
SEDCA (South Employers Dependent Care Association) got off to a rousing start at the Chamber office with the participation of The Honorable Roy Romer on March 14.  The event was attended by many of the employers participating in the consortium, and several of the local press were on hand to record the event. SEDCA, the ChamberÕs newest employee benefit program,  provides cost-effective, meaningful child care and adult care support programs to Chamber members with fewer than 100 employees .  Until now, the program has been accessible only to companies with 100 employees or more.
<P>
Employees have access to this impressive package of benefits when their employer joins the association.  Employers pay a one-time initiation fee (based on the total number of employees) and $13 annually for each employee.The employersÕ annual membership fee helps to pay for the subsidies, full services, and administrative costs associated with the program.
<P>
For employees with home care needs for a sick child or resources and referrals for child care or adult dependent care,  SEDCA will cover those unanticipated emergencies. A simple system has been developed, one which streamlines the process for participating employees. 
<P>
To enroll your company for this unique employee benefit, simply call the Chamber, 795-0142, for an application.

The word has spread.  And people have been responding with phone calls and letters, applauding the Chamber's decision to turn down continued federal support for small business programs.
<P>
While there have been a number of letters praising the Chamber's courageous stand, the most unusual and touching came from an anonymous donor.  The envelope had only a copy of a Rocky Mountain News editorial with &quot;Thanks!&quot; written in the margin, and the sender included a one dollar bill.

Demonstrating the Chamber's commitment to stay on the cutting edge, leading the way for businesses in the south metro area, the Board of Directors agreed in October to establish this organization on the increasingly popular World Wide Web.  To that end, all member companies with the technological capability were invited to participate in the competitve selection process.

80112 is divided by Interstate 25 and marks the southern end of a series of business parks known as the "I-25 Corridor."  One of the oldest and most successful of the business parks is Inverness, a planned development that includes a beautiful golf course.  Just to the south, one of the region's newest parks, the Meridian International Business Center, is also built around a golf course - this one in the Scottish style, with no trees.  Along 1-25, there are numerous other planned business parks, with Panorama Park, on the west side, on the highest point in Arapahoe County.  The views are stunning.  Between Inverness and the Dove Valley Business Park is Centennial Airport, the second busiest general aviation airport in America.  The remaining land to the east of I-25 is commercial; to the west, it is largely residential, with a few scattered retail centers and small business complexes.

You are on the edge of the foothills when you travel to 80125, an area that offers everything from industrial sites to water recreation to some of the most magnificent red rocks in the world.  Along Santa Fe Drive (85) you will discover several distribution and industrial sites along a well traveled rail line.  The Chatfield Industrial Park is the farthest north and Park 85 and the Santa Fe Distribution Center are situated on the portion of Mission Viejo's Highlands Ranch that extends to the west of Santa Fe.  At Titan Road and Santa Fe is the fourth industrial park in the area, appropriately called the Titan Road Industrial Park.

80126 is Highlands Ranch, a planned community by the Mission Viejo Company that is extremely successful both in its residential developments and its commercial properties.  With infrastructure already in place for the next several decades, Highlands Ranch has taken full advantage of its proximity to the rest of south metro Denver.  Santa Fe, Broadway, University and Quebec all give Highlands Ranch direct north-south access, while C-470 gives it easy access east to the I-25 corridor and west to the mountains.  Highlands Ranch residential communities incorporate a philosophy of creating "housing ladders," giving homeowners a wide range of choices from starter homes and townhouses, to established middle and upper income developments, to retirement areas.  Nearly one-fifth of all new homes sold in metro Denver recently were sold in Highlands Ranch.  Commercial developments in Highlands Ranch include retail and service businesses along County Line Road and C-470, two major business parks - Highlands Ranch Corporate Center and Highlands Ranch Business Park - and, in zip code 80125 - several distribution and manufacturing sites.

80127 is the largest zip code, geographically, in the south metro area.  It is partly mountainous, from the Chatfield State Recreation Area to the west.  Martin Marietta has two facilities in 80127, where most of its Colorado labor force is concentrated.  With easy access to the metro area, Martin Marietta also provides its employees with a location close to nature.  It is not uncommon, in both facilities, to spot deer while on your lunch break or view nesting eagles in the cliffs just outside of your office window.  The southwest section of C-470 defines the northeast corner of 80127, framing the Ken Caryl Business Center.  Driving west on Ken Caryl Avenue, you pass through the "Dakota Hogback,"  a sharp ridge that precedes the foothills of the Rockies.  Between the Hogback and the Rockies lies the historic Ken Caryl Valley, once a ranch and now the site of a variety of quality housing options in a spectacular setting.

The northern part of 80222 is largely comprised of the City of Glendale, an historic town that is totally surrounded by the City and County of Denver, but is actually part of Arapahoe County.  Glendale houses some of the metro area's most notable landmarks, including Four Mile House Park and the stunning Hellenic Community Center of the Greek Orthodox Church with its brilliant gold dome.  Glendale also boasts one of the highest concentrations of employers.  A strong retail and entertainment trade help to make Glendale a destination, while it is also convenient to both downtown Denver and the I-25 corridor business center.  The southern part of 80222 is primarily residential and within the City and County of Denver, except for a small enclave of unincorporated Arapahoe County.  University Hills Mall is one of Denver's oldest shopping centers and can be found just to the south of Colorado Boulevard and I-25, which cuts through the area.

The following section will describe the many options of ART, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), zygote donation and embryo cryopreservation, embryo donation and host uterus.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="200">In Vitro Fertilization</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>I</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>VF fundamentally involves removing eggs and sperm from the body, combining them in the laboratory to achieve fertilization, and then transferring the resulting embryos back into the uterus through the cervix. Candidates include women with tubal disease, unexplained infertility and male factor infertility. The steps involved in an IVF cycle include ovarian hyperstimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization and culture, and embryo transfer.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="300">Ovarian Hyperstimulation</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>N</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>ormally a woman develops one egg per monthly cycle. For IVF, multiple eggs (which grow inside follicles) are stimulated to develop simultaneously. This super ovulation is accomplished with a series of injections using a combination of Lupron, for pituitary suppression, followed by Metrodin (gonadotropin) for approximately ten days. The response to these medications is monitored by serial ultrasound and blood hormone levels. When the parameters indicate theat the eggs are mature, a medication called HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) is given, and the egg retrieval procedure is scheduled approximately 35 hours later.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="400">Egg (OOCYTE) Retrieval</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>A</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4> ll IVF procedures will be done in the comfort of our own surgical center. Our nursing anesthesia staff prepare patients for egg retrievals in our holding area. Medical histories are taken and intravenous lines started in anticipation of a light sedation which keeps patients comfortable during the procedure.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=4>To retrieve the eggs, a transvaginal ultrasound guided retrieval technique is used. A needle, guided by an ultrasound picture, is passed through the vaginal wall and into the follicles (sac of fluid containing the eggs). The fluid is aspirated and given to the embryologist for identification of the eggs. The procedure takes approximately 20 minutes.</FONT></P><BR> <P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="500">Semen Collection</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>T</B></FONT> <FONT SIZE=4>he quality of the male partner's semen will be tested prior to initiating the IVF cycle. On the day of egg retrieval, the husband will be asked to collect a sample of sperm for fertilization of the eggs. Abstinence of at least two days, but not more than 7-10 days, is recommended. To ensure privacy, a specifically designated room is provided for collection of the sample.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="600">Fertilization and Embryo Culture</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>S</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4> ix to eight hours after the eggs are retrieved, the sperm is combined with the eggs to achieve fertilization. Twenty-four hours later, fertilization can be documented by examining the eggs under the microscope. At this time, you will be told how many embryos have developed and a decision will be made regarding cryopreservation (freezing) of the extra "embryos." Embryos, which are not frozen, are held in a culture for an additional 24 hours and are, at that point, cleaved (divided into two to eight cells).</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="700">ICSI</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>I</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>n 1994, a major break-through occurred in the treatment of male infertility called Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). In a controlled laboratory setting, the embryologist utilizes microscopic technology for joining eggs and sperm to encourage fertilization. One sperm is injected through the egg membrane into the cytoplasm of the egg.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=4>Candidates for ICSI include men with: 1) Severely compromised sperm parameter including count, motility, morphology or antisperm antibodies. 2) Men with the need for microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration and testicular sperm aspiration for blockage or absence of the vas deferens. 3) Failed fertilization on prior ART attempts.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="800">Embryo Transfer</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>T</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>wo days after the egg retrieval, the two to eight cell embryos are transferred back into the uterine cavity. The procedure requires no anesthesia and is similar to an insemination. Patients are required to rest for several hours in the surgery center after transfer and for an additional two days at home. Progesterone and estrogen is given after egg retrieval to help prepare the uterus for the embryo's implantation. Two weeks after the egg retrieval, a pregnancy test tells us if we were successful.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="900">Gestational Carrier Program (Host Uterus)</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>W</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>omen diagnosed with uterine anomalies which render the uterus unsuitable for pregnancy, or absence of the uterus, may benefit from a "Host" uterus. The woman must still retain ovarian function for egg production and the husband must have adequate sperm function. Through the IVF process, gametes from the couple are joined and the resulting embryos are transferred into the "Host" uterus which has been readied with estrogen and progesterone. The host carries the pregnancy and delivers the baby, which is given to the biological parent at birth.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="1000">Assisted Hatching </A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>A</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>ssisted Hatching is a supplement to standard in vitro fertilization (IVF). A patient goes through all of the routine steps of IVF, including ovarian hyperstimulation, transvaginal oocyte retrieval and embryo transfer. However, on the third day of embryo culture, approximately four hours before embryo transfer, a small hole is made in the zona pellucida to help the embryo "break out" of the shell, ultimately hatch, and implant on the mother's uterine wall. Women most likely to benefit from Assisted Hatching are those: <!-- List Tag --><UL><LI>Over 38 years of age with elevated gonadotropins (FSH) <LI>Elevated Gonadotropins (FSH)<LI>Having repeated ART failures <LI>Or by identification of need through visualization by the embryologist</UL></FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="1100">Egg Donation</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>W </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>omen with premature ovarian failure, women with poor ovarian function, women over age 40, and women with multiple failed cycles of IVF, may all benefit from egg donation. The main aspects of the cycle are identical to those of IVF, except that a volunteer donor is used to furnish multiple healthy oocytes or eggs. Estrogen and progesterone are given to the patient "recipient" to pre-pare the uterus for transfer and implantation of the donor embryos.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements for egg donation are that the women be under age 46, and have a healthy uterus. Details of the donor selection and screening process are available upon request.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="1200">Embryo Cryopreservation</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>C</B></FONT> <FONT SIZE=4>ryopreservation, or freezing, is performed to preserve extra embryos not transferred in the original procedure. This allows the patient to limit the number of embryos transferred "fresh" without sacrificing the chance for pregnancy, which the additional embryos would afford. The additional opportunity for conception with the transfer of frozen embryos is significant.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="1300">Donor Embryo</A></B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=6><B>O</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>n rare occasions, a couple may need both donor egg and donor sperm, thus "donated embryos". The supply of readily available and suitable embryos is extremely small and comes from former patients of the practice having undergone IVF but no longer wishing to use their cryopreserved embryos.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=4>The embryo recipient's uterus will be readied with estrogen and progesterone in preparation for implantation at the time of the embryo transfer.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4>In addition to ART procedures, our Surgical Center hosts an array of out patient procedures.

<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>Work History</B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>CPA</B> - Bob worked five years as a CPA for the international accounting firm of Laventhol and Horwath with assignments in the Chicago, Miami and Orlando offices.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Corporate Finance</B> - Bob left public accounting in 1974 to join AIRCOA (now know as Richfield Hotel Management Company), a national hotel development and management company.  He began his 15 year career with AIRCOA as its Corporate  Controller and when he left in 1989, as the result of a corporate buyout, he was its Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.  At that time AIRCOA was the largest hotel management company in the US with over 150 hotels managed out of Denver and its two subsidiaries in Dallas and Atlanta.</FONT>
</P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>Bob then took another corporate position as CFO for a hotel management company headquartered in Guam.  With hotel developments in Guam, Saipan, Indonesia, and Thailand and a major client in Japan, Bob traveled extensively throughout this part of the world.  The management company was dissolved in 1991 and Bob returned to the U.S.</FONT></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Real Estate Sales</B> - After returning from Guam, Bob obtained his Real Estate Broker License and joined a real estate company whose reputation matched his personal standards of excellence. Moore and Company.  After a two year apprenticeship at Moore, where his initiation and training was the best of that offered by the industry, Bob move to Cherry Creek Realtors, and equally large and well respected  firm.  The Cherry Creek affiliation allows Bob to operate and manage his own business independently while still providing the resoreces of a large company, a winning combination.  Although he has worked in most areas of Denver, Bob  is most active in the South Metro Denver suburbs, home to him and his family since 1979.</FONT></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>Personal</B></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>In the early years Bob's family lived in Indianapolis, then moved to Orlando when Bob was 13.  Bob completed high school, college and his CPA years in Florida before moving to Cleveland with AIRCOA.  In 1979 AIRCOA relocated its corporate headquarters to Denver and the Leaman family migrated for the last tine.  Bob's wife of 25 years, Lindsay, is also licensed in Real Estate Sales and they work together in the business.  She is a native northeasterner and a graduate of Glassboro State College (now Rowan College) in southern New Jersey.

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=7>Buyer Agency Information!</FONT></B></CENTER></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>In Colorado there are several different types of relationships that a Buyer or Seller may have with a real estate agent.  We are required by the Colorado Real Estate Commision to explain each of them to you and to keep on file evidence that we have done so.  Therefore, when we first meet, we will present you with the definitions of Real Estate Brokerage relationships and our office policy on how we work with Buyers and Sellser.  Additionally, we will ask you to sign an acknowledegment for our file, evidencing that we have done so.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Following is a copy of that form:</B></FONT></P>


<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><I>The printed portions of this form except (italicized) additions, approved by the Colorado Real estate Commission (DD25-1-94)</I></FONT></P>



<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=5><B>DEFINITIONS OF REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE RELATIONSHIPS</B></FONT></P></CENTER>


<BR>


<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Seller's Agent*:</B>  A seller's agent works solely on behalf of the seller and owes duties to the seller which include the utmost good faith, loyalty and fidelity.  The agent will negotiate on behalf of and act as an advocate for the seller.  The seller is legally responsible for the actions of the agent when that agent is acting within the scope of the agency.  The agent must disclose to potential buyers or tenants all adverse material facts about the property actually known by the broker.   A separate <B>written</B> listing agreement is required which sets forth the duties and obligations of the parties.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Seller's Subagent:</B>  A subagent owes the same duties of utmost good faith, loyalty and fidelity to a seller as the seller's agent and must make the same disclosures to buyers concerning adverse material facts about the property.  A subagent will negotiate and act as an advocate for the seller, who is legally responsible for the acts of the subagent when acting within the scope of the subagency.  Seller must give <B>written</B> permission for the listing agent to employ subagents.</FONT></P>

  

<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Buyer's Agent*:</B>  A buyer's agent works solely on behalf of the buyer and owes duties to the buyer which include the utmost good faith, loyalty and fidelity.  The agent will negotiate on behalf of and act as an advocate for the buyer.  The buyer is legally responsible for the actions of the agent when that agent is acting within the scope of the agency.  The agent must disclose to potential sellers all adverse material facts concerning the buyer's financial ability to perform the terms of the transaction and whether the buyer intends to occupy the property.  A separate <B>written</B>  buyer agency agreement is required which sets forth the duties and obligations of the parties.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Transaction-Broker:</B>  A transaction-broker assists the buyer or seller or both throughout a real estate transaction with communication, advice, negotiation, contracting and closing without being an agent or advocate for any of the parties  The parties to a transaction are not legally responsible for the actions of a transaction-broker and a transacation-broker does not owe those parties the duties of an agent.  However, a transaction broker does owe the parties a number of statutory obligations and responsibilities, including using reasonable skill and care in the performance of any oral or written agreement.  A transaction broker must also make the same disclosures as agents about adverse material facts concerning a property or a buyer's financial ability to perform the terms of a transaction and whether the buyer intends to occupy the property.  <B>No written</B> agreement is required.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><I>The bottom portion of this form is from Brokerage Relationships Disclosure (Buyer) (BD24-1-94). <u> It applies only to buyers anad does not apply </u> if this is a buyer agency relationship.</I></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>NOTE:  DIFFERENT BROKERAGE RELATIONSHIPS ARE AVAILABLE WHICH INCLUDE SELLER AGENCY, SUBAGENCY, BUYER AGENCY, OR TRANSACTION-BROKER</FONT></P>


<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>BROKERAGE RELATIONSHIPS DISCLOSURE<BR>

(BUYER)</FONT></CENTER></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>Cherry Creek _________________________, Ltd, and its agents are working with you as a seller's agent on properties we have listed and as a transaction-broker on properties listed with other companies.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Seller's Agent:</B>  On properties we have listed, we are an agent for the seller and not your agent, unless we enter into a written agreement to act as your agent.  We owe duties to the seller which include utmost good faith, loyalty and fidelity. We will negotiate on behalf of and act as an advocate for the seller.  Please do not tell us any information which you do not want shared with the seller.  You are not vicariously liable (legally responsible) for our actions.  Although we do not represent you, we will disclose to you all adverse material facts about the property actually known by us.  We will assist you without regard to race, creed, sex, religion, national origin, familial status, marital status, or handicap.  In addition we will provide the following services:</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4><I>We will be honest.  We will write an offer at a price and terms you specify.  We will present all offers.  We will communicate information that the lender will request at loan application.  We will keep you informed regarding the transaction.  We will be present at closing.</I></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>*For purposes of these Definitions & this Disclosure, buyer also means "tenant" and seller also means "landlord".</FONT></P>


<P><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=464 HEIGHT=6  SRC="border3.gif"></CENTER></P>



<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>How We Work With Buyers and Sellers</B></FONT></CENTER></P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>(This document reflects our company office policy required by the Colorado Real Estate Commission).</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>How We Work With You as a Buyer</B> - On properties listed with our company, we represent the seller as a seller's agent.  If you would like to look at properties that are listed by other brokers, we will be delighted to assist you by becoming your agent.  If you later decide to buy one of our listings, we may act as agents for both buyer and seller as a disclosed dual agent for in-company transactions.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>How we Work With You as a Seller</B> - We represent the seller when we are the listing agent.  If a buyer requests representation, we may provide service to both buyer and seller as a disclosed dual agent for in-company transactions.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Why We Don't Work as a Transaction-Broker</B> -We will act as a transaction-broker ONLY when the buyer or seller will not allow us to act as their agent.  Currently  the case law related to being a transaction-broker is not well defined.  We don't want you to have to go to court  to find out what the rules are for this new type of relationship.  The primary drawback of being a transaction-broker is the possibility of accidental undisclosed agency which can expose our customers and clients to law suits, and a potential risk that a transaction can be rescinded, or canceled.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Selling Our Company Listings to Buyer Clients</B> - Colorado law allows buyers and sellers to use the same real estate broker to represent them in putting together a real estate transaction.  This may be done via disclosed dual agency.  A dual agent acts as a limited agent for both seller and buyer.  To make this relationship work to the maximum benefit of all parties, Colorado law allows dual agents to disclose most relevant information to one party that the broker gains from the other party.  To keep things fair, the broker is required to keep the price, terms, and motivations of the parties confidential.  The full details of this relationship are explained in the Dual Agency Addendum built in to our listing and buyer agency agreements.</FONT></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>We hope you find these disclosures regarding agency to be informative and beneficial.  We believe that most buyers want their real estate agent to be a true agent, representing them and negotiating on their behalf.  We also prefer to work as a buyer's agent.  During the home buying process we will get to know you and you, us, pretty well.  It would be difficult for us NOT to be your advocate and therefore your agent under such circumstances.  We look forward to working for and with you as your Buyer's Agent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Note:</B>  <I>This is not intended to be a complete guide to real estate transactions.  A complete review will be conducted during our Buyer Counseling Session.  This section is intended for those relocating to Colorado and highlights those areas which are unique to Colorado and/or Denver.</I></FONT></P>

<P>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>
<A NAME="100">The Metro Denver Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</A></FONT></B></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>The Denver MLS covers all of Metro Denver from the Jefferson County foothills on the west to eastern Adams and Arapahoe counties and from Broomfield and Brighton on the north to Parker, Castle Rock, Highlands Ranch and other Douglas and Elbert County communities on the south.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>We are very fortunate to have one comprehensive MLS that gives us a single source of information on all homes for sale in the entire metro area, both new and formerly owned.  This assures you, the buyer, that you can work with one agent to access every home for sale, no matter the location, no matter what company listed the home or what builder offers the new home for sale.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>When any home, new or resale, is listed in the MLS, it  includes an offer of compensation to the cooperating Realtor.  This protects the buyer from becoming liable for payment under a Buyer Agency Agreement.  Prior to showing you a home, you will know in advance that the seller has agreed to pay our fee!</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>In the case of a new home being offered for sale directly by the builder, there are some specific rules to follow.  First, all builders who are also members of the Builder-Realtor Council have agreed that they will not adjust the price of the home, up or down, to reflect either the payment or the non-payment of a commission to your Realtor.  Therefore, it makes good sense for you to have your own Realtor by your side to be your advocate when you negotiate with a builder.  Second, the builder agrees to pay us as your Realtor/Buyer Agent provided that:</FONT></P>


<!-- List Tag -->
<B><FONT SIZE=4><OL TYPE=A>
<LI>One of us will accompany you on your first visit to the home or the builder's model home/sales office and properly registers you as our client;
<LI>One of us is with you at the time you negotiate and sign the purchase agreement; and,
<LI>One of us is with you at the closing.</OL></FONT></B>
<P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>If you are thinking about a new home, let us help you.  Builders often write their own contract which are grossly one sided in their favor.  If you let us, we can be with you every step of the way.  It doesn't cost you a cent to have us as your advocate at your side, but you must follow the rules!</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>The MLS provides a variety of tools to make your time and ours more productive.  Because we are "on-line" with the MLS computer, our information is always the most current.  We can search the data base for only those homes matching your criteria.  Examples include:  area, number of bedrooms and baths, square footage, style, basement finish, garage space, location of laundry or master bedroom, year built and a multitude of other parameters.  By narrowing our search to those items critical to your needs, we can maximize the use of our time and yours.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Additionally, we can specify those features most important to you and ask the MLS computer to notify us whenever a new listing matches your specifications.  If you are looking for a hard to find home or one in limited supply but high demand, this can be an extremely valuable service that insures you will have an opportunity to see every home that meets your needs.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>With the depth of resources available through the MLS, it is no longer necessary for a buyer to work with several agents to insure he doesn't miss an opportunity.  You need only be confident that the Realtor you select has the knowledge, experience and equipment to make maximum utilization of those resources!</FONT></P>



<!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="200">Contracts and Related Legal Issues</A></FONT></B></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>We are indeed fortunate in Colorado to have a very active and progressive Real Estate Commission which takes seriously its responsibility to the public.  The Commission has prescribed the form and content of "Commission Approved" contracts for most every possible real estate transaction including listings, buyer agency and purchase and sale.  These forms automatically provide for the most common contingencies including buyer's inspection, seller's property disclosure, loan approval, appraisal and satisfactory title insurance commitment.  There is ample room to add additional provisions specific to the transaction.</FONT></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>The Commission Approved contracts are so comprehensive that most buyers and sellers rarely engage an attorney.  In fact, under Colorado law, your real estate agent is granted a limited license to practice law.  We can, for instance, explain the legal effect of the contracts and their various components and  clauses.  We can fill the blanks and we can assist you in adding terms and conditions you specify.  We cannot, however, give you legal advise or draft non-commission approved contracts and forms.  For example, we can explain the difference between joint tenants and tenants in common, but we cannot advise you as to which legal alternative is the most appropriate in your circumstances.  We can explain the exceptions listed in the title insurance commitment. but we can not advise you regarding the acceptance, rejection or remedy of an objectionable item.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>It is usually not expensive to engage an attorney to review and comment on your purchase contract, title and loan matters and closing papers.  We recommend it in the case of first time home buyers or any other client who may not be comfortable with contracts and their related issues, alternative and decisions.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Should you wish to include an attorney in your transaction, we suggest you interview and bring one on-board in advance of actually viewing property.  Often, the need to move quickly can determine success or failure when bidding on your dream home.  By involving your attorney in advance, he will already be familiar with your needs and circumstances and the form of the contract offer.  He will, therefore, be in a position to respond quickly when needed.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>We would be pleased to work with whatever attorney you choose.  If you don't know one, we suggest you first try your corporate attorney if you have one.  Your company may offer his services to you at no charge.  Otherwise, ask us.  We know several well regarded attorneys who handle these types of transactions for a modest fee.</FONT></P>



<!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="300">Closing and Delivery of Property</A></FONT></B></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Closings in Colorado are usually done at  the "table" with all parties present.  The date is agreed to and specified in the Contract.  Should this logistically be a problem, we can arrange to close by mail or overnight courier.  Should one, but not all parties on the deed be present, a power of attorney for the absent party will be necessary.  Should you anticipate any of these situations, discuss immediately with us, so the appropriate arrangement can be made well in advance.  We will provide you with a detailed accounting of all funds required to close, usually within 24 to 48 hours in advance of the closing.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>In Colorado, real estate closings require "good funds", usually represented by funds being wire transferred to the closing agent in advance or by a cashier's check presented at closing.  If you must transfer funds to your bank from other savings or investment accounts, be sure to do it well in advance of requesting your bank to issue the cashiers check.  Most banks require your funds to be collected before they can draw against them to write the cashiers check!  If you have questions, talk to us.  We can help you coordinate these activities.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>One again, Denver is unique in all the world.  It is common practice for the seller to deliver the property to the buyer 2,3 or even 5 days after the closing.  The specifics will be detailed in the contract.  Better you should know that such a request is likely in advance sot that you are not surprised and can anticipate and plan around it.  No rent is normally paid for this short holdover period.</FONT></P>



<!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="400">Reported Square Footage</A></FONT></B></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Unlike many areas of the country, the square footage of the Denver home, as quoted by the Metro Denver MLS, will normally only include those floors which are above ground.  Basements, even those which are professionally finished, are not to be included in the reported square footage.  This information is separately disclosed so watch for it. A 1500 square foot home could easily have a full, finished basement, effectively doubling the usable living area!  (However, be aware that if you go into the mountains, you will likely find the finished portion of the basement space included in the home's total square feet.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>The contract will contain a provision allowing for the buyer's inspection of the property.  It will also detail what happens in the event the inspection reveals the property to be in unsatisfactory condition.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>In Colorado we have many different varieties of expansive soils which, when they become wet, expand many times over.  Homes are specially engineered to deal with expansive soils and properly designed landscaping will draw water away from the foundation.  Despite all the precautions, structural problems can still result.  A good Professional Engineer (PE), experienced in home inspections, should be able to distinguish between the common cracks in drywall and in basement floors and walls and significant structural problems requiring remedial action.  In addition to the structure, expect the inspector to also test/inspect all building systems, plumbing, electrical, heating, air conditioning, appliances included in the sale, windows, floor tile, bath tile, cabinetry and a host of other items.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Depending upon the size of the property, the inspector may take from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.  The buyer should plan to be there as well as the buyer's agent.  The buyer should pay the inspector at the time of the inspection.  Average cost should be $175 to $200.  Very large or very small properties will be more or less, respectively.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Secondary inspections for radon gas and termites may be appropriate.  If you anticipate you may be transferred again in the near future, you should do a radon gas test and, if necessary, request the seller to mitigage.  Relocation companies that buy employee houses demand strict adherence to federal guidelines.  If not done now, you could be stuck with a bill for mitigation when you make your next transfer.  If this doesn't apply to you, then the location, style and use of the home may influence your concern about radon gas.  Discuss with your inspector.  Depending upon the testing method, it could cost another $75 to $150.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>In the past we have rarely had termite problems in Denver.  There has, however, been a noticeable increase in recent years.  Should the property be located in an area known to have problems or should your inspector encounter a suspicious area, an additional inspection by a professional termite inspector may be recommended.</FONT></P>

  

<P><FONT SIZE=4>The buyer is responsible for selecting his inspectors.  Upon request, we will be happy to supply the names and resumes of inspectors used by others with satisfactory results.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=7><B>What is a Realtor?</B></FONT></CENTER></P>



<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG BORDER=4 ALIGN=left hspace=10 SRC="realogo.JPG"align=top>
<FONT SIZE=4>The term REALTOR identifies those licensed real estate agents who  are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the largest trade association for the real estate industry in the United States.  There are approximately two million licensees in the U.S., of which approximately 725,000 are Realtors.  To become a Realtor, the licensee must take classes on ethical real estate practices and agree to a strict set of Standards of Practice and Code ofEthics.  Realtors take their Code very seriously.  They can and do sanction and even expel members depending upon the severity of the violation.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Membership in the local Realtors Association provides access to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).  Only Realtors are allowed to promote properties through the MLS to the other members of the Association. If you are a seller, having your property listed by your Realtor in the MLS makes it available to all the other Realtors in that association.  If you are a buyer, your Realtor can show you any property listed in the MLS, whether it is his own listing or a listing of any other Realtor.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>When selecting a real estate agent to help you with the purchase or sale of property, always make sure you are working with a <B>Realtor!</B></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>Further, however, you will also want to select a Realtor who is constantly seeking to improve himself, through continuing education and experience, so as to provide you with the highest level of service possible.  How does one find the truly committed agents?  The agents who go far beyond the state mandated continuing education programs?  The agents who have proven themselves to be successful real estate professionals?  One way is to look for those who have achieved certain professional designations, usually identified by initials after their names.  Following are two of the most widely recognized designations:</FONT></P>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>GRI</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>About 25% of all REALTORS have earned the GRI, which stands for Graduate,  Realtor  Institute.  The program is sponsored by the National Association of Realtors and is administered by the Colorado Association of Realtors (and other state associations around the country).  It consists of 12 highly  technical classes totaling 96 hours, covering a wide range of topics including Finance, Advanced Law, Appraisal, Housing Construction, Investment and Taxation, Agency, Listing and Selling.  A Realtor who earns the GRI is dedicated to the profession, having shown that he is willing to go the extra mile to become the best that he can be!</FONT></P>





<P><IMG BORDER=4 ALIGN=left hspace=10 SRC="crslogo.JPG"align=top><FONT SIZE=4>The most prestigious designation of the National Association of Realtors is the CRS, Certified Residential Specialist.  This program is administered by the Residential Sales Council of the Realtors National Marketing Institute, a not-for-profit corporate subsidiary of the National Association of Realtors.  The Residential Sales Council is a professional organization serving the real estate industry's top producing residential specialists. By offering state-of the-art education courses leading to the CRS Designation , the Council strengthens its members' ability to manage their businesses successfully and profitably.  Currently only approximately 3% of all Realtors have achieved the CRS, placing those individuals in an elite group in terms of education, experience, production and professionalism.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>To earn this designation, agents must meet certain production requirements in terms of number of transactions and dollar volume (varying upon the number of years in the profession), making this honor truly results based.  In addition to production and other service requirements, they must also be members of the National Association of Realtors, members of the Residential Sales Council, have earned the GRI Designation and have completed a series of courses covering advanced marketing techniques, financial skills and ways to apply innovative technology to the real estate business.  The development and use of these skills allow the CRS Designees to provide their clients superior real estate service.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>The proud owners of the CRS Designation regularly participate in continuing education sessions beyond that required for the Designation.  They also have developed an exclusive referral network throughout the country.  They meet frequently at national state and local seminars to strengthen that network and share unique business and marketing ideas to enhance their success and that of their clients.  You can insure your success by hiring a Realtor who has earned the GRI and CRS Designations to assist you in the sale or purchase of your next home or investment property.  If you are making a move out of the area, ask your local CRS agent to recommend a CRS at your destination.  Chances are good that he will know one personally!</FONT></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>Bob & Lindsay have both achieved the "GRI" designation.  In addition, Bob is extremely proud to have achieved the "CRS" designation.  These accomplishments indicate Bob & Lindsay's dedication to the profession and their desire to achieve excellence in all they do.  They are committed to providing their clients with "competent, caring and attentive real estate services".  They are <B>The Dependable Duo in Real Estate!</B>.</FONT></P>

<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>THE BASICS...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Get a group of football fans together and draft players from current National Football League (NFL) rosters to create your "fantasy" team.  Each week pick one quarterback, a combination of one running back (RB), one receiver (Rec), three utility players (either a RB or Rec), one kicker and one Defense from your fantasy team roster to specify that week's active  roster.  Your players score points based upon how many touchdowns, field goals and extra points they score and how many yards they accumulate during that weekend's NFL games.  Your defense scores based on how many touchdowns and safeties they score plus fumble recoveries, interceptions, sacks, points allowed, and yardage allowed.  You can alter your team roster during the course of the season by making trades with other fantasy teams or by acquiring free-agents.  Your team plays head-to-head competition each week against another fantasy team.  The teams with the best won-lost records at the end of the FFL regular season play in a single elimination tournament to decide the Fantasy Bowl League Championship.  Each team pays an entry fee so that cash prizes can be awarded based on regular season standings, points scored during the season, and tournament results.  In addition, cash prizes are awarded each week to the top scoring team of that week.</FONT></B>
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>THE LEAGUE...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>For the 1996 season we will have sixteen (16) teams in our league.  The teams will be split into two conferences of two divisions each.  There are seventeen weeks in the NFL regular season this year, with each team receiving one "bye" week.  We will play a twelve week regular season.  The next four weeks are reserved for both a championship and a consolation tournament.  The last week of the NFL regular season will be a Òfree-for-allÓ where all teams will compete with their entire roster for best score.  The top three teams from each division will qualify for the championship tournament (twelve teams in total).  The remaining four teams will compete in the consolation tournament.  Teams eliminated from the tournaments are still eligible to collect the weekly high score cash bonus.</FONT></B>
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>ENTRY FEE and PRIZES...</I>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The entry fee this year is $55 per team payable before the season begins.  For simplicity, there will be no additional fees for player moves, late roster changes, etc.  Thus, the prize pool for our sixteen team league is $825 (one free slot for the Commisioner).  The prize distribution has been set up to give everyone a chance to win something and to keep everyone interested throughout the entire season.  Prizes will be distributed as follows :</FONT></B>

<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>THE DRAFT...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The draft will consist of 15 rounds and the draft order will be established at random.  Draft order will be in the order established by random in the odd-numbered rounds and in the reverse order in the even-numbered rounds.  
<UL><LI> ROUND ONE:  	1,2, 3, 4 ... 15, 16
<LI> ROUND TWO:	16, 15, 14 ... 2, 1
</UL>
<P>
Trading of draft picks is permitted if you can manage to negotiate such a deal.  Each team will have 30 seconds to make their selection in the first eight rounds and 45 seconds in the last eight rounds.  If time expires before a selection is made, the next team in order is free to make their selection if they are ready.  The commissioner reserves the right to alter the selection time if needed.</FONT></B>
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>TEAM ROSTERS & GAME LINEUPS...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Team rosters will consist of a maximum of 15 players, eight (8) of whom must fit the following categories which constitute your weekly active roster:
<UL><LI> 1 QUARTERBACK
<LI> 1 RUNNING BACK
<LI> 1 RECEIVER
<LI> 3 UTILITY (EITHER A RUNNING BACK OR A RECEIVER)
<LI> 1 KICKER
<LI> 1 DEFENSE
</UL>
<P>
The other eight members of your team can be any combination of the above positions.  Please note that an NFL team DEFENSE counts as one of your 15 "players".  Players are eligible at the position where they are listed on their NFL team's roster in major sporting publications before the season (no changes during the season).  Also, there is once again strategy involved in selecting your backup players since the NFL has scheduled a week off for each team this year.  If you only have one QB, K, or Defense this could be a problem for YOU.</FONT></B>
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>PLAYER MOVES...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>There are two ways to change your roster after the draft, free-agent acquisitions and trades.  Free-Agents are those NFL players who are not on anyone else's fantasy team roster.  Free-Agents may be acquired at any time during the week on a first-come, first-served basis by calling the co-commissionerÕs work phone to notify him of such a move (Sid has voice messaging at work).  To preserve the integrity and meaningfulness of the original player draft, there are limits on free-agent moves as follows:
<UL><LI> Two (2) free-agent moves are allowed before the season starts
<LI> Eight (8) free-agent moves are allowed after the season starts
<LI> Two (2) free-agent moves are allowed (max) in any one week
</UL>
<P>
If you are at the roster limit of 15 and pick up a free-agent you will have to release player(s) to get back to the limit.  Again this year there is an Injured Reserve (IR) list.  If one of your players is listed on the NFL IR list, you may place him on your IR list and free up a roster position to accommodate a free-agent move.  However, as soon as the player is activated from the NFL IR list, you must also make a roster move (not considered a free agent move), within one week, to activate him.  Otherwise he will become a free agent.  Released players from fantasy teams become free-agents, except during the playoffs - in this case they are ineligible.  Free-Agent acquisitions can be made during any week of the season, including the playoffs.  Trades are permitted any week of the regular season but not during the tournament.  Uneven numbers of players can be traded (e.g. 1 for 2, 2 for 3) but the teams will have to release players if necessary to meet the roster limit of 15.  Note:  If you don't use your 2 pre-season free-agent moves they are not carried over into the season. </FONT></B>  
<P>
<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=7><I>WEEKLY ROSTER DEADLINE...</I></FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Lineups for the week may be called into the commissioner or his representative up to 15 minutes before the beginning of the first game of the week.  If no call is made the lineup from the previous week will carry over.  You must call me at work (977-7263) since there is a time and date stamp on my voice messaging.  NFL Injury reports are usually run in the newspaper on Friday or Saturday if you're interested in that stuff.  When you call in your lineup you need to specify your top three reserves in for tiebreaking purposes.  If you don't tell me your reserves, they will either carry over from the previous week or, if they are on a "bye" or have been activated, that reserve slot will be empty.</FONT></B>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>When you call in your roster each week, you need to designate your top three (3) reserves.  If a tie exists, we go through the reserves to break the tie.  We will add up the total points of all the three reserves to declare the winner.  If it is still a tie, the game is declared a tie.  The points scored in a tiebreaker do not count towards the weekly bonus prize nor do they count for the season points standings.</FONT></B>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Twelve teams will qualify for the year-end <A HREF = "playoffs.gif">championship tournament</A> based on won-loss record.  All but the last place team from each division will qualify.  The tiebreaker system that will be applied to determine order of finish within each division is as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Head-to-Head record
<LI> Head-to-Head point differential
<LI> Total Points

For rules problems or other disputes we will refer to the 1990 Fantasy Football Guide  for reference but the commissioner reserves the right to present the situation to the league owners where majority opinion will rule.</FONT></B>

<P>The focus of our business strategy is further explained in my <A HREF="welcome.htm">message.</A></P>

<P>We hope this site adds to London East's business performance and prosperity. We seek to provide a 
world class environment in which to stimulate the thoughts and ambitions of our customers. </P>

<LI><P><B>Become a Winner</B></P>

<P>Our role is to help small and medium sized businesses survive, grow and export. </P>

<IMG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=202 ALT="[Photograph]" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 SRC="images/photo05.jpg">

<P>We are ourselves a small growing company currently employing some twenty five 
members of staff. In determining our strategic development plan we set priorities which we 
feel are key to the development of a successful  culture. At the top of our list of priorities is 
the pursuit of customer satisfaction, we believe that the key driver of corporate value is customer 
loyalty. Second on our list is the development of a culture of continuous improvement and 
service innovation.</P>

<P>We can also look at our role from a different perspective.</P>

<P>Our role is to seek out and support winners from the small and medium sized business community. </P>

<P>There has been considerable research undertaken into identifying the characteristics of successful 
winning companies; the consensus of this work is that the following characteristics are always 
present; winning companies always,  </P>

<IMG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=163 ALT="[Photograph]" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 SRC="images/photo03.jpg">

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> have visionary leaders, dedicated to the long term and enthusiastic champions of change</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  unlock the full potential of their people</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  know their customers</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> constantly introduce new differentiated products and services</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  and continually exceed their customers' expectations.</P>
	</UL></P>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>If this is the formula for success, why do we have so few world class small and medium sized companies ?</P>

<P>Perhaps the reason is contained in one of these statements, all of which are regularly quoted, </P>

<IMG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=203 ALT="[Photograph]" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 SRC="images/photo01.jpg">

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> I'm too busy....</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  It's not relevant to me I'm too small....</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  I know but my company is different....</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  If I train staff they leave....</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  I've always done it this way....</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>Business Link London East is here to grab the attention of the smaller businesses within our area and to 
change your attitudes. We must inspire and support the businesses currently located, or looking to locate, 
on the eastern side of London to change and adopt winning characteristics. We must show you that 
many of your competitors (from the self employed business to the large corporation) are already pursuing 
world class techniques and leaving you behind. We will give a lead, be single minded and be selfish for 
the success of our clients. </P>

<P>Running a small business is a lonely existence, Business Link London East is here to help. Our 
competitive advantage is that we are independent, we are not here to pressurise you into buying 
products or services you don't need or can't afford. We are here to act as your <B>business' friend</B>, 
sometimes to act as your coach but whatever the role we will stay with you for the long term.</P>

<P>The concept of business link is simple - we are a single point of access, unlocking the doors 
which will enable you to grow your business with all the knowledge, advice, information and support 
you need to compete and win.     </P>

<P><LI><B>Abilene Paradox</B></P>
<P>Where groups of people (committees, for example) often make decisions which, as individuals, they would consider to be silly. The group agrees to do a silly thing because each individual knows he or she can side-step responsibility for the action of the group.</P>

<P><LI><B>Benchmarking</B></P>
<P>Essentially benchmarking means looking for the companies that are doing something best and learning how they do it in order to emulate them. The downside to benchmarking is it can restrict thinking to the framework of what is already being done in your company's own industry. By aspiring only to be as good as the best in your industry can set a cap on ambition. Used this way benchmarking is just a tool for catching up, not for jumping way ahead. The upside is that it can spark ideas, especially if it is used to benchmark companies from outside your own industries.</P>

<P><LI><B>Boston Matrix</B></P>
<P>A concept invented by a firm of consultants (The Boston Consulting Group) in the 1960s. It provides a framework for thinking about different companies within a large group by them along two axes: </P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> their Market Share; and</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> the growth rate of the sector they are in.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The consultants divided the framework into four sections - which they called CASH COWS, DOGS, STARS and QUESTION MARKS - each requiring a different sort of strategic treatment.</P>

<P><LI><B>Business Process</B></P>
<P>Every company consists of a number of processes. Processes in a company correspond to natural business activities although they are often obscured because people think about the individual departments, not about the processes with which all of them are involved.  Processes tend to be unmanaged because people are put in charge of departments or work units, but no one is given responsibility for getting the whole job -the process- done. Some recurring processes, better understood with names that express their beginning and end states:-</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Product Development: concept to prototype.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Order Generation: prospect to order.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Order Fulfilment: order to payment.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Service: enquiry to resolution.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Staff Development: cradle to grave. </P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Customer Loyalty: existing customer to order.</P>

<P>A  phenomenon observed when companies lay off a large number of employees. Those laid off are not those who are least good at their work. Rather, they are those whom it is easiest to get rid of.</P>

<P><LI><B>Change</B></P>
<P>Awareness of the permanence of change is not new: what may be new is an awareness that change is not even a process of evolution towards permanence. Companies are simply wasting their time if they are looking for a fixed state in which all need for further change ceases. Change is uncomfortable and strongly resisted, research has identified ten common reasons for resistance:-</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The purpose of the change is not made clear.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The details of the change are poorly communicated.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The people affected are not involved in the planning of the change.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The change is introduced too quickly or too slowly.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Key job characteristics are changed.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Key people are not seen as being completely behind the change.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> A fear of failure.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The status quo cannot be re-established if the change proves to be a failure.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The people affected believe it reflects badly on their past performance.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Lack of confidence in people's capacity to implement the change.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Contingent Liability</B></P>
<P>A liability that may arise if something else happens.</P>

<P><LI><B>Discounted Cash Flow</B></P>
<P>A method of calculating the present value of a future stream of income and capital (the 'cash flow'). Discounted cash flow (DCF) is used to compare different expected rates of return on different projects.</P>

<P><LI><B>Distinctive Competence</B></P>
<P>The skill which sets an organisation apart from its competitors.</P>

<P><LI><B>Earnout</B></P>
<P>A way of bridging the difference between what vendors believe will be their companies' future profits, and what purchasers expect them to be. An earnout is a way of paying for a company based on its future performance. The purchase price is a combination of an immediate up-front payment plus a number of future payments related to future performance.</P>

<P><LI><B>Gearing</B></P>
<P>All businesses have access to two fundamentally different sorts of money.<BR>
<I>Equity</I>, or owner's capital, including retained earnings, is money that is not a risk to the business. If no profits are made then the owner or other shareholders simply do not get dividends. They may not be pleased, but they usually cannot sue.<BR>
<I>Debt</I> capital is money borrowed by the business from outside sources; it puts the business at financial risk and is also risky for the lenders. In return for taking that risk they expect an interest payment every year, irrespective of the performance of the business.<BR>
The ratio between the equity and debt is the gearing (known as leverage in the USA).</P>

<P><LI><B>Hurdle Rate</B></P>
<P>Is the rate of return that is required for a project to be worthwhile; that is, a higher rate of return than would have been obtained by leaving the capital in a bank. </P>

<P><LI><B>Intellectual Property</B></P>
<P>Ideas, inventions, designs or books that belong to their creator. Although intellectual property can be protected by <I>patent</I>, <I>registered trademark</I> and <I>copyright</I>, it is particularly vulnerable to theft.</P>

<P><LI><B>J-Curve</B></P>
<P>A graphical representation of the fact that immediately after an improvement has been set in change, things often get worse before they get better.</P>

<P><LI><B>Knowledge Worker</B></P>
<P>A new expression to describe what the manual worker will have to become in the future if he or she wants to continue to have a job. As arduous manual work is automated, shopfloor workers will have to become "informated" by information technology, and able to make judgements based on the knowledge that will be at every employees fingertips.</P>

<P><LI><B>LAN</B></P>
<P>Or Local Area Network  is a computer network covering a small geographical area, or office.</P>

<P><LI><B>Lean Production</B></P>
<P>Refers to the remarkable manufacturing techniques developed by the Japanese in order to reduce their production costs and make them competitive with their rivals. </P>

<P><LI><B>Learning Organisation</B></P>
<P>A concept developed which describes the company (or organisation) that "learns" as its employees learn. In the learning organisation, systems and methods are altered to take account of things learnt.</P>

<P><LI><B>MacGregor's Theory X</B></P>
<P>Suggests that people dislike work, are incapable of, or unwilling to exercise, self-direction and self-control and work only for money. Therefore close, firm supervision needs to be exercised, and managers must crack the whip to achieve results. A Theory X style of management will promote motivation (through fear) but cannot be expected to engender job satisfaction.</P>

<P><LI><B>MacGregor's Theory Y</B></P>
<P>Suggests that people want to work, that work is as important as play; that workers seek responsibility and recognition and have potential. The Theory Y manager adopts a participative approach, allowing workers input to their own jobs and responsibility for their own actions. This style of management is held to be superior because it can and should give rise to both motivation and job satisfaction.</P>

<P><LI><B>Law of Maldistribution</B></P>
<P>Also known as the Pareto 80-20 Rule. The rule states that 80 percent of the effort expended in a process is caused by only 20 percent of the input.</P>

<P><LI><B>Maugham's Muffler</B></P>
<P>Information which comes from low down the ranks of an organisation gets "muffled" by the time it reaches the top, for little reason other than the fact that "junior" is taken to mean "unreliable" by those at the top. This is a double-edged sword: it harms those who do not hear the muffled messages; and it discourages those who send them from doing so again.</P>

<P><LI><B>Mission Statement</B></P>
<P>A statement by the company of its overriding business goals, of how it is going to achieve them, and of the values it will uphold in doing so. To achieve their aim, mission statements must be:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The result of some sort of consensus throughout the company of what it is about;</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Clear and memorable</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Widely known and widely disseminated throughout the company;</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Realistic, and not based on some far-flung ambition that employees cannot relate to.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Non-Executive Director</B></P>
<P>Companies are placing an increasingly high value on attracting suitable non-executive on to their boards. Good non-executives directors combine general business knowledge and experience with objectivity, and have the guts to tell the chief executive when they think he or she is wrong.</P>

<P><LI><B>Organic Growth</B></P>
<P>The growth of a business from within itself rather than from external influences, like a merger or an acquisition. Organic growth is probably the most difficult form of growth to achieve, but it is the most resilient.</P>

<P><LI><B>Product Development</B></P>
<P>The systematic development of a product to ensure that it does not get stranded by changing consumer tastes.</P>

<P><LI><B>Quality Circle</B></P>
<P>A system devised by the Japanese whereby shopfloor workers are grouped into teams. Each team is responsible for undertaking certain tasks, and for the quality of those tasks. The leader of a team is called the "circle facilitator".</P>

<P><LI><B>Restraint of Trade</B></P>
<P>That part of a contract which imposes a restriction on one of the parties to the contract. In many countries contracts which contain a restraint of trade are legally invalid, unless the contract is between parties of roughly equal bargaining power who are in a position to look after themselves; or if there is a good reason for the restraint, for example, if an employer is merely protecting their legal right to their trade secrets or patents.</P>

<P><LI><B>Seven Ss</B></P>
<P>Seven qualities which were identified as being the areas in which the Japanese companies excelled over US companies. They were: strategy, structure and systems; style, shared values, skills and staff. The first three were called the hard Ss; the last four the soft Ss. The Japanese made the hard Ss more productive by allying them better with the soft Ss than did the western companies.</P>

<P><LI><B>Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)</B></P>
<P>The lifeblood of a nation's industry; a fact recognised by most governments. There is one big unanswered question about SMEs. Are they such a wonderful thing that a nation with nothing else would beat the Japanese? Or are they mere sucker fish, dependent on contracts from bigger fish for survival?</P>

<P><LI><B>Solvency</B></P>
<P>The condition of being able to pay one's debts on time. Company Directors have to be careful, however, that they do not let their company continue to trade knowing it to be insolvent. If they do, they can be held personally liable for the debts of the company.</P>

<P><LI><B>Strategic Alliance</B></P>
<P>The bringing together of bits of companies in a loose partnership in order to improve the competitiveness of both. Strategic alliances are appropriate when full take-overs or mergers are not.</P>

<P><LI><B>Strategy</B></P>
<P>The way in which a corporation decides to set about achieving its future goals.
Two management consultants - Benjamin Tregoe and John Zimmermann - devised a simple 14-part questionnaire, which they called the "Strategic IQ Test",  in order to determine how strategy-oriented companies are.  To how many of the following questions would the answer for your company be "yes"?</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The direction of future organisational development is clearly defined by upper management.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each manager knows details of the strategy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each manager agrees on the details of  the strategy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each manager has a common view of new products and markets, based on the company's strategy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The company's strategy is the most important factor in evaluating new opportunities.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Strategy is developed independently of long-range planning.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Strategy determines plans, and guides resource allocation.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Strategy is based on analysis and assumptions, not on plans.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Strategy guides acquisitions and capital expenditure, not the other way round.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each division or subsidiary has a clear strategy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each division's strategy is entirely consistent with the overall strategy of the organisation.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each department has a clear strategy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Each department's strategy is entirely consistent with the overall strategy of  the organisation.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The organisation (and its divisions) are evaluated on the basis of strategic performance as well as operating performance. 
The higher the number of "yes" answers, the higher the company's strategic IQ.</P>

<P><LI><B>Succession Planning</B></P>

<P>The task that many people argue is the most important for a chief executive; choosing his or her successor. Certain guidelines have been laid down for those who have to make such choices.</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Choose early, disclose late.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Draw the "invisible" organisation chart; that is, the differences between titular equals.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Identify the "hidden influential" people in the company.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Spell out the unwritten rules.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Control the bloodletting.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Free the successor from restrictive commitments.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Share your observations about people, but do not impose them.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Let the successor's credentials speak for themselves; do not overpraise him or her.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Plunge them in at the deep end.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Total Quality Management  </B></P>

<P>The idea that quality is something that must be disseminated throughout an organisation, and not just left to a quality "controller" who examines goods as they emerge at the end of the production line (when it is too late to do much about them).
TQM strategies are characterised by the following:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Excellence of all managerial, operational and administration processes.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> A culture of continuous improvement in all aspects of the business.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> An understanding that quality improvement results in cost advantages and better profit potential.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The creation of more intensive relationships with customers and suppliers.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The involvement of all personnel.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Market-orientated organisational practices.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Vision</B></P>

<P>The succinct philosophy that defines where an organisation wishes to go.</P>

<P><LI><B>Zero-Base Budgeting  </B></P>

<P>A method of drawing up budgets which assumes that there was no budget at all last year. Managers are asked to justify all expenditure afresh each year. They are not allowed to get away with justifying only the increase.</P>

<LI><A NAME="intro"><P><B>Introduction</B></P></A>

<P>Information regarding possible grants, loans and venture capital funding are probably the most frequent 
of all the questions asked of Business Link London East.</P>

<P>We are sure that you will not be surprise to learn that there is no simple magic answer to the 
question of funding, however there are a number of routes that can be investigated. The <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal 
Business Adviser</A> will, as part of the support, investigate all these avenues and more for their clients.</P>

<P>It is critical that you seek independent professional advice before you commit or sign any paperwork 
regarding the various schemes that my be available to you. Ask questions and read the many booklets 
that are available via Business Link, and other organisations.</P>

<LI><A NAME="sources"><P><B>Sources of Finance</B></P></A>

<P>Because of the complex and varied nature of the grants and loans that can be accessed by business 
in the UK, Business Link use a computer system to track these opportunities.</P>

<P>Your <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal Business Adviser</A> can tap into this system to help 	you find the appropriate scheme, if it is available.</P>

<LI><A NAME="banks"><P><B>Banks</B></P></A>

<P>High Street Clearing Banks</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Overdraft Facilities</P>	
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Short & Medium Term Loans</P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Foreign Currency Payments</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The most frequent source of  short and medium term funds for a business. bank managers are also one 
of the most misunderstood and mishandled group of people in the business community.</P>

<P>Different banks have different lending policies and banking criteria. It is always useful to talk to more 
than one bank regularly, so that you are aware of their current criteria.</P>

<P>The key to successful relationships with your bank manager is to communicate frequently, dealing 
with both the good and bad news. No bank manager likes surprises. It is also important to know how 
that particular Branch operates and what their lending ceiling and criteria are.</P>

<P>It is critical to have a well considered business plan with realistic business forecasts, set out on paper 
in a clear format. It is also important to demonstrate management control by having available, management 
accounts set against budgets with industry related measurements included. </P>

<LI><A NAME="insts"><P><B>Factoring and Invoice Discounting</B></P></A>

<P>a) Factoring</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Cash for Fast Growth </P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Debt Collection Service </P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Sales Ledger Maintained </P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Credit Worthiness Checking </P>
	</UL></P>

<P>Under a factoring arrangement a business sells its invoices, as they are issued to its customers, onto a
 factoring organisation. The factoring company's name is on the invoice, and all payments are made to 
them. The factor pays the business 80% of the invoice value within 24 Hours in cash.. The 20% 
balance, less charges are then paid to the company after a set period or when the debt is 
cleared. The factor collects your debts, checks your customers credit rating and operates 
your sales ledger for you. Your  company will still be responsible for losses due to bad debts, 
and you should consider taking out credit insurance.</P>

<P>b) Invoice Discounting</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Cash for fast Growth</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Own Company Identity</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Own Control over Account</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Customers unaware of your arrangements</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>With an invoice discounting arrangement a business exchanges its invoices for cash as you do in factoring, but 
still operates the other aspects of the accounting functions. The business sends out its own invoices and is 
responsible for its own sales ledger, and credit control operations. Payments collected are paid into the invoice 
discounting company's bank account. Your business is responsible for the bad debts. The invoice discounting 
arrangement often suits the medium sized business that is growing.</P>
  	
<P>Notes</P>

 <P>There are a number of organisations that offer these services including subsidiaries of High Street Banks. 
Not all companies will find the arrangements suitable for their trading conditions. If you are interested call the organisations listed below.</P>

<P>Factoring Companies look for clients with turnover in excess of £100,000 and Discounters look for sales at around £750,000.</P>

<P>Available cash can normally be called down from the finance house as it is required, thus saving interest charges.</P>

<P>Costs for these services split into two parts </P>

<UL>
<LI> To provide the finance will cost 1.5 - 3.0% over Bank Base Rates depending on sales levels and company performance
<LI> There is also a service charge, typically from below 1% to 2.5%

	</UL></P>

<P>Venture Capital is an ideal source of funds for additional capital to grow a healthy business. It is not a 
source of funds for a business that is disorganised or losing money, miss-managed or being in 
a dying market. 	It is important that you take independent advice and consider your 	
medium and long term objectives, before committing to any 	arrangements.</P>

<P>Funds invested are normally starting at £100,000 and on average are around £1,000,000 
(for less than £100K see <A HREF="#angels">Business Angels</A>)</P>

<P>To be in the best position to take advantage of venture capital funding a company needs a 
Health Check and the services of a <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal Business Adviser</A> to ensure that the company is 
well under control with good management, detailed budgets and plans, as well as monitoring its 
activities through comprehensive reporting systems. The investors will 
also be looking for good profitability and future growth. </P>

<P>Then an approach can be made to a venture capital organisation on the best terms 
for both parties.</P>

<P>An agreement will be required by the investor and it is important that you secure the 
services of a Solicitor and Accountant that have experience of these matters.</P>

<P>Advantages</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> A one to five year investment with no interest payments to drain cash flow from the business.</P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Outside Non Executive Director to add a further dimension to the Boards views.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Excellent Launching pad to expand and float on the London Stock Exchange or other growth routes.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>Disadvantages</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> You have an external shareholder to report to and satisfy.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> You do need to agree an exist route for the investor.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Time will be needed to ensure that you take the correct advice.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>More Information</P>

<P>A comprehensive set of information is available from British Venture Capital Association 
including a range of booklets that clearly explains 	the services provided by its members. 
A good starting point is the publication A GUIDE TO VENTURE CAPITAL that is available free on application. </P>

<P>This is similar to a venture capital arrangement except Angels are normally private individuals and tend to deal in amounts	
starting at £10,000 up to £100,000 using their own funds. They also group together to form syndicates to invest in larger projects .
The Government have introduced some tax concessions for small investors to help prime small investments.
Angles also work through business introduction services, acting as marriage bureau. Angels are more flexible on some projects 
were they expect larger returns.</P>

<LI><P><B><A NAME="smart">SMART</A></B></P>

<P>Is at the heart of the DTI's programme for encouraging innovation and excellence in research and technology. 
It is an annual competition.  Under SMART individuals and companies with up to 50 	employees can apply 
for grants covering 75% of  project costs totalling up to £45,000 and further grants under SPUR to take their 
ideas from drawing board to within sight of the production line. This programme is open for a certain period only.</P>

<LI><P><B><A NAME="spur">SPUR</A></B></P>

The Scheme enables companies with up to 250 employees (or a <A HREF="#smart">SMART</A> scheme participant) 
to move their projects forward to production. The project must involve significant technology advances and must cost 
at least £50,000 and be of six months to three years duration. SPUR Grants are normally 30% (50% for SMART participants).</P>

<P>For further information contact your <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal Business Adviser</A> or the government office for London (see <A HREF="#gofl">above</A>).</P>

<LI><P><B><A NAME="small">Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme</A></B></P>

<P>This scheme has revised rules from September 1996 which will 	widen the scope of the scheme. 
In 1995 / 6 the DTI guaranteed approximately 7500 loans valued at £247 Million. This scheme is focused on the smaller 
company and operates through Banks and other institutions, with the DTI  normally guaranteeing  70% of the loan. 
(The borrower is liable for the full debt).</P>

<P>The scheme is aimed at new and small businesses where normal loan arrangements are not available due 
to the lack of company or personal guarantees.  Each loan above £15,000 has to be agreed with the DTI via the 
lender such as a Clearing Bank. Between £5000 and £100, 000 can normally be loaned dependent on the 
business plans and relevant financial information being presented to the lender and they being satisfied with the proposals.
Repayment is normally between two and seven years. Lenders may 	agree a Capital repayment holiday for a given period.
See the DTI Booklet URN 94/628.</P>

<LI><P><B><A NAME="eu">European Union</A></B></P>

<P>There are some twenty three Director Generals heading up EEC operations, each with a specific 
area of interest, budgets and activity. The DGs are responsible for a large number of 	
funded programmes across Europe. Business Link London East monitors these various programmes so 
that we can be aware of 	opportunities for London East businesses. Our <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal Business Advisors</A> 
have the objective to make their clients aware of any appropriate funding that is available. </P>

<P>a) Large Corporations</P>

<P>Larger organisations are sometimes interested in acquiring a company or a part share in a 
business to expand the products or services that they offer or enter new markets 
You will normally be approached by a third party such as a Merchant Bank to see if 
there is any interest.  This could be a useful approach to expanding your business or 	
releasing your personal investment. It is important that you take independent advice on these matters.</P>

<P>b) Overseas Companies</P>

<P>This is a similar situation to the Larger Company approach but in this case their focus is to 
expand into the UK or acquire a product or service.</P>

<P>You can help your business considerably to improve cash flow by controlling key areas as listed below. 
We are sure most business people are aware of these factors, but it is worth reviewing them.</P>

<P><B>Credit Control (Debtors)</B> Check customers credit ratings regularly. Send out invoices 
promptly and collect receivables as early as possible, ideally within 30 days.</P>

<P><B>Payable (Creditors)</B> Have agreements with suppliers to extend payment terms on end 
of their month of invoice.</P>

<P><B>Material and component control</B> Plan when you are going to bring products and raw materials in so 
that they are turned around in the shortest time. Ensure that products or raw materials arrive to schedule so 
that money is not tied up too long.</P>

<P><B>Stock Control</B> Profile (age) stock and move out slow-moving stock quickly (unless 
holding slow-moving stock gives you an edge and you can 	charge a good premium).</P>

<P><B>Cash flow Control</B> Produce accurate Receivable and Payable lists at least weekly or 
monthly as applicable and monitor them. Chase in old and large debts. You must have 
very clear procedures to control cash flow.</P>

<P><B>Letters of Credit</B> If you are exporting arrange payment by Letter of Credit. 
This ensures payment and if necessary can be discounted to produce cash for raw materialises.</P>

<LI><P><B>Special Services</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East is launching its "Leading Edge" special services designed to turbo-charge 
the growth rate of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs).  All these services are provided by 
highly trained, senior specialists from industry and commerce. They are not civil servants or from the
 public sector.</P>

<P>These services are made affordable for  small and medium sized businesses as a result of DTI
 funding and other sponsorship.  The only qualification to benefit from these services is an 
obvious <B>obsession</B> to grow or export and be based in 
the <A HREF="index.html#where">area we cover.</A></P>

<P>If you wish to compete in the global market by accessing these <B>Leading Edge</B>
 services please complete the <A HREF="#form">form</A> below or call us on Tel: 0171 505 2525 
and we will be in touch to arrange an exploratory meeting <B>without charge.</B></P>

<LI><P><B>Financial Advice</B></P>

<P>Research has shown that most SMEs now believe that their bank only gives advice on 
its own products and does not give their clients all the options available  when seeking 
additional financial support (especially when the bank does not have a commercial interest 
in the correct solution).</P>

<P>It is also true that most SMEs cannot afford good senior financial 
advice and guidance from expensive accountants or in-house staff.
As a result most SMEs are pre-occupied with money rather than the development 
of the business.</P>

<P>Our financial adviser will :</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Carry out an 
		in-depth analysis of the current financial structure of your company - from 
		capital structure, through all financial controls, to assessing the impact of 
		your financial position on the confidence of your customers and suppliers.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>   Help you 
		formulate the most appropriate financial strategy for your future businesses 
		objectives.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Having helped 
		you set the strategy our adviser will stay with you acting as your financial 
		mentor while you implement the strategy (offering advice and providing help 
		along the way.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Make you aware 
		of all the sources of appropriate additional funding including equity finance, 
		grants, venture capital, hire purchase, leasing, factoring, invoice discounting. etc etc</P> 
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  If part of your 
		strategy is to expand via mergers and acquisitions you will already have the 
		appropriate advice on hand to assist with the project.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Your adviser will 
		<B>stay</B> with you until you are able to recruit your own Financial 
		Director who can carry forward the financial foundations which have already been laid.</P>
	</UL></P>


<P>The service obtains no financial benefit from any funding bodies brought to the attention
 of your company. </P>

<P>Launch Date:  Expected October 96</P>

<LI><P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East is geared to showing small-to-medium sized businesses  
how to realise their full potential.  We can help you take advantage of a whole range of 
high quality resources designed to enhance the performance and profitability of your 
business.</P>

<P>The way in to our Better Business Service couldn't be simpler.  Just call us and arrange 
a meeting, probably at your premises.  There's no charge for this, no obligation on your 
part, and it's all done in the strictest confidence.   We don't pry or snoop.  We just 
listen hard, then advise you on all the various opportunities you could take advantage 
of - many of which will be available to you either free or significantly subsidised.</P>

<P>The Better Business Service is designed to equip companies employing up to 250
staff  with the quality information, 
advice and support that will help your company compete and win at the various stages 
of its development.</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Insight</B></P>

<P>The purpose of Business Insight is to discuss your long term business goals and assess 
the kind (and amount) of assistance you need.  Business Insight is conducted by one of 
Business Link London East's highly experienced business analysts and takes the form 
of a well-focused, fact-gathering mission.  It's unlikely, but in the event of our analyst 
spotting some fundamental problem, Business Link London East might decide, at this 
stage, that your business is unsuitable for the Better Business Service.  In such a case, 
we certainly wouldn't leave you in the lurch; where possible we'd recommend action to 
address your immediate difficulties.</P>

<P>Business Insight normally takes just half a day but can be extended, depending on the 
size and scope of your business.  The initial Business Insight analysis is free.  Further 
half day sessions - if required - may be used to address special 'one-off' problems and 
cost only £25 for the second, with a third or fourth just £50 each.  The quality of 
advice you receive through our Business Insight would otherwise cost upward of £200 
a day, which makes Business Link London East's offering truly astonishing value.
(Prices are quoted excluding VAT).</P>

<P>At the end of the process, you will receive a short Business Insight Report, clearly 
setting out our analyst's general assessment of your current situation, long-term 
potential and recommended course of action.</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Focus</B></P>

<P>Having established the basic soundness of your business through Business Insight, the 
point of Business Focus is to pinpoint a more particular course of action.  After close 
examination of the key areas of your operation, a professional consultant 
recommended by Business Link London East will work with you in more detail on one 
or more specific projects.  These could include business/financial planning, best use of 
IT resources, marketing issues, quality (ISO 9000 and T.Q.M.), training, export plans 
and so on.</P>

<P>Normally lasting one or two days, Business Focus is designed to add real value to the 
way your business performs.  We take great care to match each consultant on the basis 
of his or her relevant expertise and likely responsiveness to your particular business.  
You'll be pleased to hear we bear a substantial part of the cost. The price to you is 
usually just £100 per day, depending on the daily rate of the consultant.
(Prices are quoted excluding VAT).</P>

<P>At the end of Business Focus, you will be presented with a detailed account of the 
consultant's findings and a full breakdown of recommended action.</P>

<LI><P><B>The First Point Of Contact For Businesses In Eastern London</B></P>

<P>We find that small and medium sized businesses
in the area want easy and uncomplicated access
to up-to-date information and the professional support that can back it up.
Business Link London East is the business support organisation dedicated to
providing you with high quality information
and the tailored professional support you need to make the most of all your
business opportunities. And we're as close as your telephone or computer:</P>

<P>Tel: 0171 505 2525 <BR>Email: <A HREF="mailto:info@londoneast.businesslink.co.uk">info@londoneast.businesslink.co.uk</A></P>

<LI><P><B>How A Personal Business Adviser Can Help You</B></P>

<IMG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=196 ALT="[Photograph]" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/photo06.jpg">

<P>Personal Business Advisers offer a wide range of general and specialist
advice and support. Their task is simple, to focus on the medium and longer
term opportunities that deserve the attention your busy day rarely allows.</P>

<P>Running your own business can often be a lonely affair as many business
people will agree. So it's good to know that a Business Link London East
"independent business confidante and friend" can provide a sounding board
for new ideas as well as cast a professional eye over your progress to date
and suggest new avenues of approach to the opportunities ahead.</P>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<LI><P><B>All Our Personal Business Advisers Have Hands-On Business Experience</B></P>

<P>To become a Personal Business Adviser (PBA) takes a lot of commitment. All
our PBA's have been subjected to an exhaustive selection process and must
offer real expertise before gaining their appointment. In particular, every
Business Link London East PBA must have been involved with the management
or ownership of a business and be able to demonstrate a pro-active approach
to both the practice and theory of modern business skills.</P>

<P>Business Link London East excludes civil servants and academics from our
PBA team. We guarantee that the advice that's offered is given by well
trained business people with practical hands-on experience gained in a wide
variety of industries and business sectors.</P>

<LI><P><B>How A Personal Business Adviser Works With You</B></P>

<IMG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=188 ALT="[Photograph]" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/photo02.jpg">

<P>We do not offer standardised solutions or
try to fit your business into a mould. All our PBAs recognise that every
business is different and that it is only by getting to know you, the
client, that we can create solutions to meet your needs.
By a series of planned meetings, your Personal Business Adviser will get to
grips with your unique problems and barriers to development.</P>

<P>Your PBA will then work with your management team to develop a strategic
business plan designed to open up the future of your business. Specific
areas of need may be identified, some of which may call for specialist
expertise that your PBA can draw on. In addition your PBA can also arrange
other support services.</P>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<LI><P><B>Personal Business Advisers Work Alongside You</B></P>

<P>The unique benefit of the service is that having developed a strategic
plan, the PBA will continue to work alongside you and your management team
to ensure the long term implementation is executed successfully. This
implementation phase is known as the "World Class Performance Programme"
and it has one single, resonant aim:- "<I>to help your business to become as
good as the best, better than the rest - anywhere!</I>"</P>

<LI><P><B>Could You Use A Business 'Friend'?</B></P>

<LI><P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East is geared to showing small-to-medium sized businesses  
how to realise their full potential.  We can help you take advantage of a whole range of 
high quality resources designed to enhance the performance and profitability of your 
business.</P>

<P>The way in to our Better Business Service couldn't be simpler.  Just call us and arrange 
a meeting, probably at your premises.  There's no charge for this, no obligation on your 
part, and it's all done in the strictest confidence.   We don't pry or snoop.  We just 
listen hard, then advise you on all the various opportunities you could take advantage 
of - many of which will be available to you either free or significantly subsidised.</P>

<P>The Better Business Service is designed to equip you with the quality information, 
advice and support that will help your company compete and win at the various stages 
of its development.  And each element of the Better Business Service can be used 
either on its own, in conjunction with other elements, or with other BLLE services.</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Insight</B></P>

<P>The purpose of Business Insight is to discuss your long term business goals and assess 
the kind (and amount) of assistance you need.  Business Insight is conducted by one of 
Business Link London East's highly experienced business analysts and takes the form 
of a well-focused, fact-gathering mission.  It's unlikely, but in the event of our analyst 
spotting some fundamental problem, Business Link London East might decide, at this 
stage, that your business is unsuitable for the <A HREF="supp80.htm">Better Business Service.</A>  In such a case, 
we certainly wouldn't leave you in the lurch; where possible we'd recommend action to 
address your immediate difficulties.</P>

<P>Business Insight normally takes just half a day but can be extended, depending on the 
size and scope of your business.  The initial Business Insight analysis is free.  Further 
half day sessions - if required - may be used to address special ‘one-off’ problems and 
cost only £25 for the second, with a third or fourth just £50 each.  The quality of 
advice you receive through our Business Insight would otherwise cost upward of £200 
a day, which makes Business Link London East's offering truly astonishing value.
(Prices are quoted excluding VAT).</P>

<P>At the end of the process, you will receive a short Business Insight Report, clearly 
setting out our analyst's general assessment of your current situation, long-term 
potential and recommended course of action.</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Focus</B></P>

<P>Having established the basic soundness of your business through Business Insight, the 
point of Business Focus is to pinpoint a more particular course of action.  After close 
examination of the key areas of your operation, a professional consultant 
recommended by Business Link London East will work with you in more detail on one 
or more specific projects.  These could include business/financial planning, best use of 
IT resources, marketing issues, quality (ISO 9000 and T.Q.M.), training, export plans 
and so on.</P>

<P>Normally lasting one or two days, Business Focus is designed to add real value to the 
way your business performs.  We take great care to match each consultant on the basis 
of his or her relevant expertise and likely responsiveness to your particular business.  
You'll be pleased to hear we bear a substantial part of the cost. The price to you is 
from £100 per day, depending on the daily rate of the consultant.
(Prices are quoted excluding VAT).</P>

<P>At the end of Business Focus, you will be presented with a detailed account of the 
consultant's findings and a full breakdown of recommended action.</P>

<LI><P><B>Diagnostic and Consultancy Services</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East constructed and launched its <A HREF="supp80.htm">Better Business Service</A> with 
the express intention of helping independent businesses employing between 1 and 250 
staff to realise their full competitive potential.  As you are no doubt acutely aware, 
growth creates its own particular problems, however strong your business may be. </P>

<P>The role of the Diagnostic and Consultancy Services is to make available to you the 
very best possible professional advice to undertake major projects which cannot be 
covered under Business Insight and Business Focus, so you can make confident 
decisions about the shape, structure, size and direction of your business.  </P>

<P>All the analysts, consultants and advisors we recommend are genuine business 
professionals, approved under a strict independent accreditation scheme.  They're 
people who - like you - have run their own companies.  They know what it is - and 
what it takes - to succeed.  They understand business theory because they've put it into 
practice.  So you'll find them not just expert, but sympathetic too.</P>

<P>Our aim is always to ensure that the advice you receive is totally appropriate to your 
business needs, so the <A HREF="supp80.htm">Better Business Service</A> is designed to relate to the different 
stages of your company's development.  Each element can be used either on its own, in 
conjunction with other parts of the service, or with other Business Link London East 
Services.</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Diagnostic</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East is ready and equipped to help eligible businesses with 
major projects in two ways. The first step is Business Diagnostic.  This is designed to 
give you a realistic, unvarnished appraisal of the precise health of your business.  
Business Diagnostic is also designed to reveal how your business stands in relation to 
the rest of the market and your competition.  (In some cases, Business Diagnostic may 
recommend - and help you take advantage of - government or European Union funded 
Research & Development assistance, to assess new products and their marketability.)  
To prepare this diagnosis, Business Link London East will assign one of our highly 
experienced accredited consultants to you.  He or she will spend up to a maximum of 
five days preparing the Business Diagnostic report on your business.  (It's worth taking 
the time, because Business Link London East subsidises this stage only once.)</P>

<P>Business Diagnostic forms a solid foundation of knowledge from which you can then 
choose the most appropriate kind of action for your business to take. (You may, of 
course choose to take the Business Diagnostic report and act on it totally 
independently, using your own management team.)</P>

<LI><P><B>Business Consultancy</B></P>

<P>Business Consultancy is for the business that has defined exactly those areas where it 
needs sophisticated advice and direction.  You may have reached this point 
independently, or through the <A HREF="supp80.htm">Better Business Service.</A>  Either way, once we have 
confirmed the diagnosis, Business Link London East will be able to recommend and 
introduce you to precisely the kind of consultants (all accredited, of course) best 
qualified to tackle your business needs.  The range of consultancy services available is 
very wide indeed, and includes specialities as diverse as Advertising / PR, 
Environment, Quality Assurance, Exporting, Premises, Financial Planning, Personnel, 
Production, Accounting and Distribution.</P>

<LI><P><B>The Cost?</B></P>

<P>If your business is eligible, the cost of a Business Diagnostic or Business Consultancy 
will be nowhere near as much as you'd have to pay if you were organising consultancy 
on your own behalf - we may be able to facilitate a subsidy for both of them, on the 
basis that each can only be a 'once-only' service. Together, we will monitor the service 
you receive to make sure you and we get full value for every penny we spend on your 
project.</P>

<P>Our funding to support Business Diagnostic and Consultancy programmes is not 
unlimited.  Accordingly, preference will be given to businesses who already have a 
relationship with one of our business advisers, need financial support to buy in external 
consultancy advice and can clearly demonstrate how this will stimulate growth in their 
business.</P>

<LI><P><B>What Do I Do Now?</B></P>

<P>The first point of access to our Diagnostic and Consultancy service is through 
Business Insight, the entry point to the <A HREF="supp80.htm">Better Business Service</A>.  Please call us on

<LI><P><B>Special Services</B></P>

<P>Business Link London East is launching its "Leading Edge" special services designed to turbo-charge 
the growth rate of Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs).  All these services are provided by 
highly trained, senior specialists from industry and commerce. They are not civil servants or from the
 public sector.</P>

<P>These services are made affordable for  small and medium sized businesses as a result of DTI
 funding and other sponsorship.  The only qualification to benefit from these services is an 
obvious <B>obsession</B> to grow or export and be based in 
the <A HREF="index.html#where">area we cover.</A></P>

<P>If you wish to compete in the global market by accessing these <B>Leading Edge</B>
 services please complete the <A HREF="#form">form</A> below or call us on Tel: 0171 505 2525 
and we will be in touch to arrange an exploratory meeting <B>without charge.</B></P>

<CENTER><B>Response Form <A HREF="#form"><IMG  WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=50 ALIGN=MIDDLE BORDER=0 ALT=Form SRC="images/env.gif"></A></B></CENTER>

<LI><P><B>Innovation and Technology</B></P>


<P>The business world is changing at an ever accelerating rate.  With the unstoppable globalisation 
of  markets the hardest thing for a small and medium sized business to do is to gain and keep a lead 
over its "real" competition (where-ever it’s located). </P>

<P>History is littered with failed companies who haven’t kept this initial lead and who have
 resorted to continuous price reductions to defend their besieged share of the market.</P>

<P> This new service will help small and medium sized businesses to end the siege! </P>

<P>Our Innovation and Technology specialist will:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Evaluate, 
		in depth, your current "change" culture and performance. 
		Have you currently got an ability to internally generate improvement
		 in your 	products and services, or improve the way you perform as a business?</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Show you how you 
		compare with your real competitors, by benchmarking you against them 
		(where the information exists).</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Help you draw up 
		a Strategy for Change together with an implementation plan.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Stay with you as
		 long as is necessary to successfully implement the strategy and adopt 
		a "Culture of Continuous" Improvement throughout your business.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The adoption of a Continuous Improvement Culture is paramount to your ongoing
 prosperity and survival..</P>

<P>Launch Date:   August 96</P>

<LI><P><B>Design</B></P>

<P>Your survival  in the global market cannot just be dependent on competitive pricing. It is also
 heavily dependent on the markets view of your company, its products/services and your 
performance as a supplier.</P>

<P>When interfacing with potential new customers initial impressions are critical. If this 
impression is highly favourable, it then needs to be re-inforced by excellence in on-going 
customer service and product/service performance.</P>

<P>This Business Link London East service will help you to achieve this "competitive edge".</P>

<P>Our Design Specialist will:</P>


	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Investigate, in depth,  
		your current design strategy for your products/services and determine how it 
		compares to your real competition.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>   Analyse your current 
		design performance with regard to corporate image, logos, stationery.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Investigate the image 
		your customer facing staff create wiith your customers etc.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif>  Help you to develop 
		an corporate design strategy for your whole business, including achieving your 
		future objectives (this will include a phased  implementation plan).</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Once this plan 
		is in place, the design specialist will stay  with you for as long as is necessary 
		to achieve successful implementation. You will not be left to get on with it.</P>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Ready to Export!</B></P>

<P>Then here are some pointers.</P>

<P><LI><B>An Exporter's Checklist</B></P>

<P>The checklist is designed to help you to decide whether you should be exporting and to begin drawing up your export plans.  The checklist highlights the key issues you will need to consider at each stage in the export process.</P>

<P>Your decision to begin exporting should be based on a clear understanding of what is involved and what your aims are.</P>

<P>At this stage, you will need to consider your:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Additional financing needs and availability.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Pay back requirements.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Management resources and commitment.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Products export potential.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Product strengths and weaknesses.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Staff's export training needs e.g. on export documentation or foreign languages.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Doing the Groundwork</B></P>

<P>Success overseas depends on careful planning and preparation.  You will need first to decide how to select (or eliminate) markets.  Visiting the market can be a valuable part of your research.  But unless you prepare properly before you go it can also be an expensive way of collecting information available at home.</P>

<P>Consider:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Size of the market, rate of growth, demand for your products.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Local and international competition.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Similarity to UK or other markets familiar to you.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Market accessibility.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Ease of transportation</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Political and economic stability.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Tariff and other import restrictions.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Ease of payment.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Availability of export credit insurance.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Technical standards.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Distribution arrangements within the market.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Language and culture.</P>
	</UL></P>


<P><LI><B>Contacting the Market</B></P>

<P>Once you have decided on your target market you will need to determine how best to establish a presence there.  But look  at what your competitors do as this will often give you a lead.  The key question is how you will reach, supply and service your customers.</P>

<P>Consider:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Whether you want to deal with your customers direct.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> How to arrange warehousing, distribution and after-sales service.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Whether you can afford the management time necessary to maintain a direct relationship with your customers.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Whether to appoint someone to represent you - an agent who will act on your behalf or a distributor who may hold and distribute stock on his own account.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> How you will promote your products and whether your sales literature and packaging needs translation or more fundamental redesign, to better meet the needs of the local market.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Doing Business</B></P>

<P>Your customers need to know the price of your product and how it will be delivered and when. You need to be sure that your distribution arrangements are reliable and cost effective and that your pricing and payment terms are not only acceptable to your customer, but meet your requirements and ensure that you receive prompt payment.</P>

<P>Consider:</P>

	<P><UL>

<P><LI><B>How We Can Help</B></P>

<P>Only you can decide on your exporting strategy. But through the services of your <A HREF="supp50.htm">Personal Business Adviser</A> 
 information and support is available to help you make an informed decision.  
See also our <A HREF="exp80.htm">Exports Development Directory</A></P>


<P><LI><B>How Exporting Can Benefit You</B></P>

<P>Sustained success in exporting can bring you a whole range of benefits.</P>

<P><LI><B>Higher Earnings and Profits</B></P>

<P>For most goods, margins overseas - and particularly in Europe - can equal or exceed those in the UK.</P>

<P><LI><B>Longer Production Runs</B></P>

<P>Many firms see selling overseas as essential because unit costs are lowered through longer production runs.</P>

<P><LI><B>Spreading the Risk</B></P>

<P>Selling in several overseas markets can make it easier to adjust to unexpected changes in the market-place. Decline in demand in one market may be offset by increases in another.</P>

<P><LI><B>A More Competitive Edge</B></P>

<P>Operating overseas can give you an edge on cost to your domestic customers, developments in quality, design, product trends, packaging, marketing techniques and customer preference.</P>

<P><LI><B>Your Firm Going Places</B></P>

<P>Success overseas boosts your reputation at home, and creates a sense of pride throughout the firm.</P>

<P><LI><B>Service Sector Companies too!</B></P>

<P>The sources of support and advice referred to on this site are equally available to assist service sector companies to take advantage of the opportunities that exist. Overseas Trade Services and your Personal Business Adviser can help you to export your skills and expertise.</P>

<P><LI><B>Size does not matter</B></P>

<P>Whether you are a service provider or manufacturer you do not have to be big to export profitably. Some of the UK's most successful exporters are small firms. They can benefit from faster decision making, more flexible production schedules and easier personal contact between those running the firm and the overseas customers.</P>

<P><LI><B>Export Marketing Research Scheme</B></P>

<P>The Export Marketing Research Scheme (EMRS), is managed by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on behalf of the Joint Directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Trade and Industry.</P>

<P><LI><B>What is Export Marketing Research?</B></P>

<P>Export marketing research is the systematic and objective collection of information about a potential export market.  It can help companies to reach sound decisions on such issues as whether or not to export to a new market or how best to introduce their products into a new market.  With marketing research, you are less likely to make costly mistakes.</P>

<P><LI><B>What are the Aims of the EMRS?</B></P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> To help and encourage British Companies to undertake overseas marketing research prior to developing a market entry strategy for a new overseas market.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> To ensure British companies undertake or commission marketing research based on sound methods.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> To achieve a widespread understanding of the discipline and benefits of marketing research in the exporting process.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><LI><B>Who is Eligible for the EMRS?</B></P>

<P>The Scheme is open to British companies with less than 500 employees, wishing to research specific overseas markets for their own products and services; these must be mainly of UK origin, exportable from the UK and have a proven track record.</P>

<P>Applicants can be considered from subsidiary companies, but not from separate divisions within a company or group.</P>

<P>It is not anticipated that companies which have been formed for less than two years or employ less than five people will have sufficient resources to make appropriate use of the Scheme.</P>

<P>The Scheme dose not accept applications submitted  by commission agents on behalf of their principals.</P>

<P><LI><B>What Limitations are there on Support?</B></P>

<P><B>Numbers of studies:</B> Companies may use the Scheme for ad hoc research up to ten times.</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Up to three of these projects may be conducted in the regions of the USA, Canada and the European Union.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> A maximum of two studies may be supported in any one year.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Only one study may be supported in any one country except for  the USA and for China where, in each case, two separate studies may be considered.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>In <B>addition</B>, the purchase of two published market research studies per company per year can be supported.</P>

<P><LI><B> Introduction</B>

<P>LETEC (London East Training and Enterprise Council)  is one of the largest of the 81 TEC's in England and Wales.  The LETEC area covers the six London Boroughs of <A HREF="loc50.htm">Barking & Dagenham,</A> <A HREF="loc60.htm">Havering,</A> <A HREF="loc20.htm">Newham,</A> <A HREF="loc40.htm">Redbridge,</A> <A HREF="loc10.htm">Tower Hamlets</A> and <A HREF="loc30.htm">Waltham Forest.</A>  LETEC is a private company, limited by guarantee.

<P>LETEC is contracted to deliver, support, promote and develop a wide range of programs, projects  and initiatives in business and enterprise, training and education.
<P>As a geographical area, London East is fast becoming a focal point for economic activity and opportunity within London and the South East.

It has:
    <P><UL><IMG ALT="bullet" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="images/bullet.gif"> 1.2 Million (18%) of London's residents;

    <P><IMG ALT="bullet" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="images/bullet.gif"> Almost 400,000 (12%) of London's employees.
    <BR>
    </UL>
<P>
<B><LI>The LETEC Mission Statment</B>
<P>
    <B>Vision</B> - For the East Side of London to be as prosperous as the west<P>
    <B>Mission</B>  - To help local people and local businesses to share fully in that prosperity<P>
    <B>Main Purpose</B> - To make a strategic and unique contribution to the economic development and regeneration of London East  through: 
    <P>
    <ul><IMG ALT="bullet" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="images/bullet.gif"> Maximising human resource potential in business, enterprise and the local labour market
    <P><IMG ALT="bullet" HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="images/bullet.gif"> Working in partnership  with key local agencies and local businesses
    </ul>
     
<P>

<LI><B>Strategic Objectives</B>
    <P>
    <B>Partnership in Regeneration</B>
    <P>To promote and support improvements to the infrastructure for achievement of economic growth which will ensure increased employment, prosperity and quality of life in the London East community.
    <P><B>Business Competitiveness</B>
    <P>To provide and promote a range of high quality services and assistance that improves local business competitiveness, retains and creates new jobs and improves the prosperity of the London East economy.
    <P><B>Competitive People</B>
    <P>To maximise opportunities for local people and businesses to develop and improve skills in order to promote a competitive world class workforce.
    
<P>
<LI><B>LETEC Services</B> 
     <P>The London East Training and Enterprise Board  operates and or manages some two hundred projects and programs which are of benefit to local businesses and the community. 
      We have highlighted some of these on this web site, which should be of benefit to business and industry. We will provide information on further relevant programs at a later stage.
<P>
    <B>People Are Our Competitive Edge</B>
    <P>Within its overall strategic objective of local economic development and regeneration, LETEC provides a range of programs, initiatives and services to business, enterprise, training and education.  The starting point is investing in people. People are our competitive edge.
    <P><B>Investing In People Is Good For Business</B>
    <P>The <A HREF="dev30.htm">Investors in People</A> quality standard enables companies to link their investment in people, through training and development, firmly to their business objectives, and can be clearly related to bottom line improvements and increased profitability through the performance of individuals - from junior employees to senior managers.
    <P>The Investors in People Standard is for any company, large or small. All that is needed is a thirst for excellence and a determination to succeed - in whatever business you are in.  More and more companies across the UK are achieving the IiP Standard for on reason only - it makes good business sense.
    <P>
    
LETEC also offers, in collaboration with Business Link, services aimed at new business start-up, and small to medium sized companies.
<P>LETEC  promotes and supports Lifetime Learning through it's work in training and education and, in particular, in the achievement of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). NVQs are nationally accredited and recognised qualifications developed by business and industry to fit their particular needs. More and more companies are introducing NVQ training in the workplace for their employees - and they each reap the benefits.
<P>LETEC offers the <A HREF="dev40.htm">Network and Modern Apprenticeship programs</A> for those young people who prefer to train while they work rather than stay on in full time education.  The Modern Apprenticeship now covers a wide range of business and industry sectors and is tailored to the needs of each sector.
<P>For those adults who have become unemployed and are seeking re-training and upskilling in preparation for a new job, LETEC offers the <A HREF="dev50.htm">ADVANCE Training for Work program</A>. On the ADVANCE program, there are opportunities across the spectrum including the improvement of basic skills and the acquisition of higher level managerial and technical skills.
<P>There are advantages for employers on two levels - to recruit new staff trained to meet the needs of their companies through Network Modern Apprenticeship and ADVANCE; and to develop existing staff through the NVQ route - each with the help of LETEC.

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<LI><B><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></B>

<P>The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham is based in the Thames-side area of East 
London, at the heart of the Thames Gateway initiative.  The Borough Council is working 
with the private sector to implement Single Regeneration Budget programmes for the 
Roding Valley and East Thames-side Partnerships.  The Borough’s three Thames-side 
wards benefit from Intermediate Assisted Area status.  Both Barking and Dagenham 
contain large areas of industrial development.  Ideally located for business and leisure, the 
Borough has a long tradition of providing employment for workers over a wide area of 
East London and Essex.  It is one of the most important areas of manufacturing industry 
within Greater London and lies astride the major trunk routes between the capital and the 
ports serving European trade.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="pop">Population</A></B>

<P>The estimated population of the Borough at mid-1994 was 155,000.  Unemployment at 
March 1996 was estimated at 10.4%, below the average for Greater London.  At the last 
Census in 1991, the Borough was shown to have one of the highest percentages of 
residents in manufacturing employment.  Although the Borough has low levels of residents 
qualified to degree level, the population has a wide range of skills.  Barking and 
Dagenham has, by far, the highest proportion of skilled manual worker households 
amongst the London Boroughs and has average representation in skilled non-manual 
households.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="local">Local Economy</A></B>

<P>Ford is the largest of the industrial companies based in the area, with its massive car 
production plant at Dagenham, but there are many others such as Rhone Poulenc Rorer, 
GPT Telephone Cables, Dairycrest and Alba Radio, which have established and grown 
within the Borough.  There are extensive areas of industrial development within the 
Thames-side areas of the Borough and at Chadwell Heath and East Dagenham, catering 
for small and large scale companies.  Riverside companies make active use of the wharves 
along the Thames and Barking Creek for bulk freight movement and the Council is willing 
to support applications for Freight Facilities Grants from the Government for enhancement 
of local wharf facilities where appropriate.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="thames">Thames Gateway</A></B>

<P>The potential for growth in the East Thames area has been recognised in the 
Government’s planning framework for the sub-region, now re-christened as 'Thames 
Gateway'.  The Government has made it clear that the Thames Gateway initiative will 
have a vital function in regional planning for the South East of England and in the region’s 
relationships with Europe.</P>

<P>The Gateway stretches from Inner East London to the Thames Estuary.  The area will be 
traversed by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and also contains London’s extensive port 
facilities.  Barking and Dagenham is located in an ideal position in the Gateway area, with 
a wide range of opportunities for regeneration and new development.  </P>

<P>The Thames Gateway London Partnership, comprising the London and Essex authorities 
in the Gateway and other economic partners, has now been established and provides a 
strategic base for all the more local initiatives.  </P>

<LI><B><A NAME="partner">East Thames-side Partnership - Dagenham Dock</A></B>

<P>The East Thames-side Partnership brings together three local authorities (Barking and 
Dagenham, <A HREF="loc60.htm">Havering</A> and <A HREF="loc20.htm">Newham</A>) 
and key private sector landowners in a major venture 
to secure the economic and environmental transformation of this critical part of the 
Thames Gateway.</P>

<P>East Thames-side is the extensive commercial and industrial area along the north bank of 
the Thames between <A HREF="loc70.htm">Docklands</A> and the Greater London boundary.  The area contains 
tracts of vacated or undeveloped land with major development opportunities in all three 
Boroughs within the Partnership.</P>

<P>The proposals for East Thames-side are to be financed through the Government’s Single 
Regeneration Budget, combined with other public and private sector funding.  A linked 
programme of schemes will upgrade the local infrastructure of the area and advance 
development opportunities at the key sites at Beckton, Havering Riverside, Dagenham 
Dock and Barking Reach. In addition, one of the key areas within the programme is to pursue
a series of environmental improvements along the A13 Trunk Road and the river frontage to
enhance the image of the area.</P>

<P>The proposals at Dagenham Dock provide for improved access by means of a new 
roadbridge, which will cross the existing London-Tilbury tracks and the new Channel 
Tunnel Rail Link   Private roads and sewers will be upgraded and extended to provide 
major new areas of serviced land suitable for new industrial and commercial development.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="reach">Barking Reach</A></B>

<P>Within the Gateway area, there are a number of key development sites.  There are 
ambitious proposals for most of these and the main project in Barking and Dagenham is 
known as Barking Reach, a major new area of proposed housing to meet East London and 
regional needs.  The development will provide some 5,500 new homes on largely 
undeveloped Thames-side land and the first phases of development are already underway. 
The Council has spearheaded the scheme in partnership with National Power, who own 
much of the land, and Bellway Homes, who will be the principal housebuilder.  There 
will also be plenty of scope for numerous other housebuilders to participate.  A joint 
venture company has been established to push the development forward.  A key ingredient 
to the success of the scheme will be the achievement of 25% social housing to meet needs 
in this part of London and the close integration of the development with existing 
communities.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="roding">Roding Valley</A></B>

<P>Proposals for the regeneration of the Roding Valley area centred on the historic Mill Pool, 
immediately to the west of Barking Town Centre. A half-tide barrage has been funded by 
the Council and further environmental and economic initiatives are being funded through a 
Single Regeneration Budget programme.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="economic">Economic Partners</A></B>

<P>The Borough Council works with many partners in its efforts to support and build the 
local economy. Services for local business and industry are being co-located in Business 
Link London East’s one-stop facilities at key points in East London and the service for 
Barking and Dagenham is operating from Roycraft House, 15 Linton Road, Barking IG11 
8HE in the heart of Barking Town Centre.  <A HREF="dev20.htm">LETEC,</A> the London East Training and 
Enterprise Council, covers six London Boroughs, including Barking and Dagenham, and is 
active in a whole range of business development, training and exporting initiatives.
Advice to small and starter businesses is provided by the 
<A HREF="new10.htm">East London Small Business Centre</A> and 
LETEC’s Small Business Services. </P>

<P>An export documentation service is available from the London Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry at Cambridge House, 5 Cambridge Road, Barking  (Tel: 0181 594 3195).</P>

<P>The <A HREF="dev10.htm">University of East London</A> has a thriving campus at Barking and is seeking to develop 
its links with the local business community, particularly in areas of applied technology.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="inward">Inward Investment</A></B>

<P>The London local authorities, together with partners in Central Government and the 
business community have established the London First Centre to provide information and 
practical assistance to companies seeking to locate in London.   The Council will be 
working with London First and the <A HREF="http://.www.netadv.co.uk/thames_gateway/">Thames Gateway London Partnership</A> to handle all 
local inward investment enquiries. The Thames Gateway London Partnership is based at 
Gateway House, 10 Park End Road, Romford, Essex RM1 4AU 
(Tel: 01708 772160 Email: <A HREF="mailto:thames_gateway@gtnet.gov.uk">thames_gateway@gtnet.gov.uk</A>)</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="assist">Assisted Area Status</A></B>

<P>The announcement of Intermediate Assisted Area Status for the Thames-side wards of the 
Borough provides an important opportunity to underpin the manufacturing sector within 
the area and attract new investment.   The three wards all lie close to the trunk road 
system, linking sites with the M25 and routes to Europe. A discretionary grant scheme, 
Regional Selective Assistance (RSA)  is potentially available to most categories of 
manufacturing business.  The scheme is administered locally by the Government Office for 
London and local clinic sessions can be arranged for companies in order to assist in the 
preparation of bids for RSA Grants through Alan Watts, the Borough’s contact at the 
Business Link office at Barking (Tel: 0181 591 6606).</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="sites">Sites and Premises</A></B>

<P>The Council maintains a listing of information on the availability of industrial and office 
accommodation and sites within the Borough to assist companies to start, expand or 
relocate.  Separate schedules for industrial and office premises can be provided at regular 
intervals.  Contact Alan Watts at the Business Link office at Barking for assistance

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<LI><B><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></B>

<P>With London’s largest development opportunity alongside the River Thames, the largest 
town centre in East London and many thriving commercial and industrial areas, the London 
Borough of Havering offers excellent opportunities for investors and businesses.</P>

<P>The Borough has direct rail and tube connections to the City and Central London, 
less than 12 miles (20 Km).  The A12, A13 and M25 all run through the Borough, providing 
immediate access to the Channel and East Coast ports, the national motorway network and nearby 
Stansted and City Airports.</P>

<P>Although a London Borough,  Havering has nearly 2000 acres (800 hectares) of  parks and 
open spaces and 54% of the borough is in the Green Belt.  This environment provides many 
recreational facilities and a high quality of life.</P>

<P>The Rainham and South Hornchurch area, which includes one of the Borough’s 
largest and most important business and industrial areas, was awarded Assisted Area 
status in 1993, following  successful lobbying by the Council.  Companies located in 
the area are eligible to apply for Regional Selective Assistance, a discretionary 
Government grant.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="econ">Economic Regeneration In Havering</A></B>

<P>Confidence is growing in the potential of Havering to attract inward investment.  The Council 
has established a new Economic Regeneration Unit to promote development opportunities, 
encourage investment and help businesses to relocate into the area.  It will also help existing 
and new businesses to get the most from grants, investment and the many significant regeneration 
opportunities in the Borough.  The unit aims to co-ordinate regeneration initiatives through 
the Borough wide Regeneration Strategy.  It will also work closely with local businesses 
through the new local Business Link. </P>

<LI><B><A NAME="opportunity">Largest Opportunity In Thames Gateway London</A></B>

<P>Havering Riverside is one of the largest development opportunities in  East London.   
It is recognised, in the Thames Gateway Planning Framework, as an area of strategic 
significance to the economy of both Havering and East London.</P>

<P>The A13 realignment brings a major six lane road link to the national motorway 
network directly to the area.  The new junction at Havering Riverside will be less 
than 5 minutes drive from junction 30 on the M25.</P>

<P>Havering Riverside covers approximately 1100 acres.  The Council is 
currently promoting the development of its 230 acre site in partnership with 
English Partnerships, the Government’s regeneration agency and the private 
sector.  A number of environmental improvement initiatives are also underway in the area.</P>

<P>Havering Riverside has Assisted Area Status so new and existing companies are eligible for grants.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="romford">Romford Town Centre</A></B>

<P>The London Borough of Havering, in partnership with Boots the Chemists, Debenhams, 
and Marks & Spencer have appointed a Town Centre Manager.   The Town Centre 
Manager is  developing and implementing a coherent strategy for the Borough’s 
town centres, commencing with Romford. A Business Plan has been produced 
for Romford looking forward over a ten year period and based around seven 
objectives for improving, amongst other items, the quality and range of attractions 
in the centre, of access and of the environment. Annual action programmes in the 
Plan are being implemented in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors.</P>

<P>A key aspect of the Town Centre Manager’s work is liaison with the business 
community and he is always willing to work with and advise local businesses.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="europe">European Dimension</A></B>

<P>There are a wide variety of European funds available to Havering, for educational , 
social, environmental and technological initiatives.  The Council’s European Officer 
has helped to secure £106,000 from the European Social Fund in 1995 and 1996 
to train unemployed young people and people with disabilities.</P>

<P>The European Officer is the Council’s central reference point on 
European issues and promotes Havering’s views to the European 
Institutions.  Working closely with the wider community, including 
businesses, will help the Borough adapt to new policies emanating from 
Europe and make the most of the opportunities Europe has to offer.</P>

<P>Regular information on legislation, proposals, and European Tendering opportunities 
is also held at the Central Library, Romford.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></B>

<P>The London Borough of Newham is based in the Thames-side area of East London at the heart 
of the <A HREF="#thamgat">Thames Gateway</A> initiative.  The Borough Council is working with public and private sector 
partners to implement Single Regeneration Budget programmes for Green Street, Canning Town, 
and Stratford areas. The Borough's Thames-side wards of South and Custom House & Silvertown 
benefit from Intermediate Assisted Area status, which means that Regional Selective Assistance 
funding through the DTI can apply.  The Borough has a long tradition of providing employment for 
workers over a wide area of East London and Essex.  It is particular well served in terms of transport 
as it lies across the major trunk routes out of London, and the M11 extension will provide 
significantly improved access into and out of Newham.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="pop">Population</A></B>

<P>The estimated population of the Borough at mid-1994 was 226,000.  Minority ethnic groups 
constitute approximately 43% of the Newham population. Projections indicate that this will reach 
51% during 1996.  Unemployment at April 1996 was estimated at 17%.  A wide range of training 
and careers initiatives and programmes is helping to improve the skills of residents.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="locec">Local Economy</A></B>

<P>Well known and substantial employers based in the Borough include Britvic, Courtaulds, and 
Tate & Lyle.  In the North west of the Borough industrial estates either side of Stratford High Street 
contains many well-established businesses with a strong manufacturing bias.  The retail sector is 
well served throughout the Borough, and there is a notable centre for Asian businesses based at 
Green Street.  There are significant opportunities for inward investment in the southern part of the 
Borough to tie in with land and premises' availability, funding assistance through the Regional 
Selective Assistance programme of the DTI and the new initiatives planned for the Royal Docks.  
London City Airport is increasingly being recognised by both the business and leisure traveller as 
a convenient and efficient means of access to both UK and Europe.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="thamgat">Thames Gateway</A></B>

<P>The potential for growth in the East Thames area has been recognised in the Government's 
planning framework for the sub-region, now re-christened as "Thames Gateway".  The Government 
has made it clear that the Thames Gateway initiative will have a vital function in regional 
planning for the South East of England and in the region's relationships with Europe.</P>

<P>The Gateway stretches from Inner East London to the Thames Estuary.  The area will be 
traversed by the <A HREF="#sips">Channel Tunnel Rail Link</A> and also contains the region's extensive 
port facilities.  Newham lies in the centre of the Gateway area and has a wide range of opportunities 
available for regeneration and economic development.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="sips">Stratford International Passenger Station</A></B>

<P>Rail communications have long been an important part of Stratford.  The Jubilee Line extension 
will be opening in 1998 and will, together with the already established Docklands Light Railway, 
provide improved access to London.  The London Borough of Newham worked with a range of partner 
organisations - "Stratford Promoter Group" - to secure a Channel Tunnel Rail Link.  London and 
Continental Railways have secured the contract for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and an International 
Passenger Station will be built at Stratford as part of  the line.  As a result, a substantial number of 
jobs will be created, and the development will itself contribute to an improved infra-structure for the area.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="obj2">Objective 2 Status</A></B>

<P>The Borough carries Objective 2 status under European Union Regional Policy as part of the Lee 
Valley.  This means that for approved projects ERDF and ESF funding can be obtained,  principally 
for the improvement of infra-structure of the area and general support for business activity.  Newham 
lies at the centre of the Lee Valley, and is playing an active role in the London Lee Valley Partnership 
in developing a thriving sub-regional economy.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="scc">Stratford City Challenge</A></B>

<P>Stratford itself lies within the scope of a "City Challenge" area, and a considerable amount of 
urban regeneration activity has taken place since 1993.  A limited grant fund for small businesses 
(whether start up or not) has been made available in the City Challenge area.  The scheme, which 
is competitive, is administered by <A HREF="dev20.htm">LETEC</A> on behalf of Stratford Development Partnership, and

<P>The plans for the Royal University, including a Technology Centre and adjacent science park with 
potential for growth businesses, are well advanced.  Implementation of this project will lead to a major 
transformation of the southern part of the Borough.  London Borough of Newham is working actively 
with all relevant organisations in both the public and private sector to ensure that this flagship project 
is a catalyst for business growth and is a significant magnet for inward investment.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="nbf">Newham Business Forum</A></B>

<P>The London Borough of Newham is actively seeking to consult with established representative 
organisations of the local business community and business generally through the Newham Business 
Forum.  The Council recognises the importance that  business has in creating wealth and employment, 
and the contribution it makes in helping to resolve the structural and social problems that it faces.  
The Borough is facing times of change and there will be significant opportunities available for local 
business to profit from the developments referred to above.</P>

<IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Produced guides on how the Council awards contracts and purchases goods and services.</P>

<P><A NAME="location"><LI><B>Location</B></A></P>

<P>Waltham Forest lies in the north-east sector of Greater London, bounded on the west by the Lee Valley Regional Park, and on the north and east by Epping Forest.  It has common boundaries with the boroughs of Enfield and Haringey (to the west), Hackney and Newham (south) and <A HREF="loc40.htm">Redbridge</A> and Epping Forest District (east and north).  It has three parliamentary constituencies - Chingford, Walthamstow and Leyton.</P>
<P>The borough has good connections to the national road network via the M11 and M25 motorways, and the North Circular Road, and via these to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports.  Improvements to the A406 North Circular Road between Silver Street in Edmonton and Hall Lane in Chingford is underway.  The improvements will connect the Lea Valley local road system to the major road network and reduce congestion.  In the South of the borough the Hackney/M11 Link Road is scheduled to open to traffic in mid 1997 which will improve access to the City.  The Borough also has both British Rail and London Underground lines to Central London, and via Stratford to the Docklands Light Railway.</P>
<P>Tilbury Docks lie approximately 20 miles east of the borough, City Airport is some 8 miles to the south and Stansted Airport some 20 miles to the north, just off the M11.  <A HREF="loc70.htm">Docklands</A> lies within easy reach to the south.</P>

<P><A NAME="population"><LI><B>Population</B></A></P>

<P>The borough has a total population of approximately 213,000 with a workforce of about 100,000 containing a fairly high proportion of skilled workers, especially in engineering, furniture and plastics.  The total unemployment in Waltham Forest in June 1995 stood at 13.4 % nearly 60% higher than the Greater London average with pockets of higher unemployment in some southern and central parts of the borough.</P>
<P>In fact the unemployment rate for men in Waltham Forest is 18% which is more than twice the 7.4% rate for unemployed women.  In addition the unemployment rate for black and ethnic minorities is double the unemployment rate of white people in the borough.</P>

<P><A NAME="structure"><LI><B>Structure of the Local Economy</B></A></P>

<P>As with most parts of the country, the Waltham Forest economy has seen a decline in its manufacturing base during the last two decades, and some growth in parts of the service sector, which is now a major local employer.  The largest sectors in manufacturing have traditionally been in timber and furniture, clothing and footwear and engineering, although company closures have lessened their importance. In the service sector, distribution (wholesale or retail) is a large and fast growing sector, and is now a major user of industrial floorspace. Waltham Forest is characterized by small firms, the 1991 Employment Census indicated that 3400 (90%) of all business in the borough employed less than 25 employers.  In the past 20 years the number of large companies employing more than 100 people has declined by almost 50%.  There has, however been a significant growth in the number of small and medium size businesses which makes up a significant component of the local economy.</P>
<P>Public authorities are also prominent in the service sector - the Borough Council, the Health Authority, London Regional Transport and the Post Office are all major employers.</P>
<P>Assisted Area status and European Union funding designation recently received for parts of Waltham Forest, recognize the degree of economic change the area has experienced.   The new opportunities they will bring for local business are summarized on page 5.</P>

<P><A NAME="industrial"><LI><B>Industrial Land and Property</B></A></P>

<P>There are over 300 acres of land "zoned" for industrial purposes allocated in the draft Development Plan for the borough published recently.  This land covers virtually all the larger industrial sites, as well as the great majority of the main manufacturing companies.  In addition there are over 500 premises with industrial, warehousing or similar use rights, which occupy in total about 120 acres of land outside of  the zoned industrial areas.  With the decline in the manufacturing sector in the Borough during the 1970's, a number of large sites fell vacant through company moves and closures, and as a result there has been major redevelopment and refurbishment of the local property stock.  This has created a substantial supply of modern industrial units across a broad range of sizes.</P>

<P><A NAME="newbusiness"><LI><B>New Business Developments</B></A></P>

<P>In recent years the Council has recently been involved in a number of major new development initiatives, either by itself or in partnership with the private sector.  These include:-</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The development of a centre of small business units for industrial and office uses at the Alpha Business Centre, South Grove, Walthamstow - opened Spring 1991</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> The relocation of Spitalfields Market to Temple Mills in Leyton - opened May 1991</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Working with the Lea Bridge Gateway Partnership and Argall Staffa Industrial Tenants Association to improve Industrial Estates in the Argall Avenue and Church Road area.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Working with companies in the Blackhorse Lane Assisted Area on	environmental improvement projects.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Working with the North Walthamstow industrial estates Close Circuit TV project to improve security on industrial estates - which have successfully secured Home Office funding in 1995.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>Applications for European funding to assist with some of these projects have been developed in consultation with business occupiers and business associations.</P>

<P><A NAME="commercial"><LI><B>Commercial Developments</B></A></P>

<P>Selborne Walk, the new covered shopping precinct at Walthamstow, (opened in mid-summer 1988), continues to trade well comprising a third of  a million square feet of new shopping floorspace, tenants include British Home Stores and Food Giant supermarkets, as well as a wide range of other leading national multiple traders.</P>
<P>A Sainsbury's Food Superstore off the North Circular Road opened in Spring 1994 and a new Tesco's Store at the Bakers Arms opened Spring 1995.  Two further retail developments are being planned.  Planning applications have also been approved for a large retail development at Leyton Yard and proposals are being considered for retail at Leytonstone House.  A special initiative to enhance Leytonstone High Road is also being planned, following construction of the M11 Link Road.</P>

<P><A NAME="urban"><LI><B>Urban Regeneration Initiatives</B></A></P>

<P><B>Lee Valley Partnership</B></P>
<P>Waltham Forest took the lead in initiating and setting up the Lee Valley Partnership.  This comprises the six Lee Valley boroughs, three Training and Enterprise Council's and two Business Leadership Teams covering the Lee Valley.</P>
<P>Having successfully lobbied for and achieved European Union designation and Assisted Area status,  the Partnership has been awarded £1.66m from the European Union to help develop and implement a Marketing Strategy for the regeneration of the Lee Valley and East London.</P>
<P>The Strategy's aim would be to make local businesses and people, as well as potential investors, aware of the numerous improvements proposed for the Lee Valley, funded mainly by European monies.</P>

<P><B>Temple Mills/Stratford</B></P> 
<P>The Council has been working in Partnership with site owners, British Rail and British Gas, to bring old dis-used, landlocked sites back into use.  The Government's announcement that its preferred route for the proposed fast Channel Tunnel Rail Link was via Stratford and that this should be designed to carry freight traffic, will affect the use of these sites.</P>
<P>Now a Partnership comprising Waltham Forest and Newham Councils, Waltham Forest HAT and Stratford City Challenge Company have been awarded £13 million from the Government's Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) for a seven year programme beginning in 1995.</P>
<P>These major infrastructure developments in Temple Mills and Stratford will provide employment and urban regeneration opportunities for the surrounding communities.  The bid includes projects to assist local business and local job seekers respond to these.</P>

<P><A NAME="areafunding"><LI><B>Assisted Area Funding Assistance</B></A></P>

<P><B>Assisted Area Status</B></P>
<P>In August 1993, after extensive lobbying by the Council, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) recognized a part of the Lee Valley for Assisted Area Status for the next three years.  An Assisted Area receives special assistance from the Government to help industry.  The Waltham Forest Assisted Area covers the Lloyd Park ward around Blackhorse Lane and Sutherland Road.  Businesses in this area, or those moving to it, may be eligible for Regional Selective Assistance which is a Regional Grant administered by the DTI.  Firms can apply for grants to help progress projects with a sound and commercial base that cannot be fully funded from private sector sources.  Grants of any size can be considered.  The DTI provides an average of 15% towards the cost of:</P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Equipment</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Site purchase and presentation</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Job creation</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>Already several local firms have applied to DTI, with support from the Council, for financial assistance.  The Council is able to advise and guide Waltham Forest businesses about the potential benefits and incentives available to businesses in or relocating to Lloyd Park.</P>

<P><A NAME="eurofund"><LI><B>European Union Funding</B></A></P>
<P>Parts of East London and the Lee Valley have been designated as eligible for 3 year funding under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF - Objective 2 Status) from January 1994.  This is the first time any part of London has received recognition by the European Union (EU) as an area which is experiencing particular economic change.</P>
<P>In Waltham Forest,  six Wards are eligible for funding.  These are Higham Hill, Lloyd Park, High Street, St. James Street, Lea Bridge and Leyton.</P>
<P>For the three years 1994-96, 74m ecu (approximately £57 million) ERDF funding will be available to East London and the Lee Valley for projects which improve or develop:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Business Development Support</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Action for Knowledge Based Industries and Advanced Technological Development</P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Targeted Assistance</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The Council with other local public agencies have submitted applications for first round funding in 1995 and has been successful in securing over £1.7m and a share of £1.6m for the borough.  The grant award will make a significant contribution towards improving the urban environment and regenerating the local economy.  The successful projects are:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Lea Bridge Gateway environment improvements on industrial estates.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Business Centre - to provide a range of facilities to benefit local small businesses.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Package of Business support measures including advice and training to benefit 	local businesses.</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> New (Walthamstow - Leyton) public transport route to increase access for residents to employment areas.</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The Council, with partners will consider developing further bids for second round ERDF funding at the end of 1995.</P>

<P>In addition the Council will be submitting a bid for SRB funding in 1996 to provide crucial infrastructure improvements to industrial estates in the Lea Bridge Gateway area to provide physical links with strategic road network and wider North East London region.</P>

<P><A NAME="whatis"><LI><B>What is Docklands?</B></P></A>

<P>London Docklands covers eight and a half square miles of land in East London:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> North of  
		the river from Tower Hill to Beckton in the Royal Docks</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> South of 
		the Thames from London Bridge City to Greenland Docks in the Surrey Docks</P>
	</UL></P>

<P>The areas include parts of the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham and Southwark.  Only the area North of the river i.e. excluding Southwark, is within the BLLE catchment area.</P>

<P>The London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was set up in 1981 with the task of securing the long lasting physical, economic and social regeneration of the 8.5 miles of London Docklands.  Its remit finishes in March 1998 and the wind-down has already commenced, handing back Bermondsey to the London Borough of Southwark in 1994, and in 1995 it will complete its remit in Beckton and Wapping.</P>

	<P>The LDDC are based at:<BR>
	Thames Quay<BR>
	191 Marsh Wall<BR>
	London E14 9TJ<BR>
	Tel: 0171 512 3000<BR>

<A NAME="doctod"><P><LI><B>Docklands Today</B></P></A>

<P>Docklands is now considered to be London’s newest business district, and an attractive place to live as well as work.</P>  
<P>Docklands splits into three sections:</P>

<P><B>Wapping and Limehouse (London Borough of Tower Hamlets)</B></P>
<P>Roughly the area from the Tower of London to Limehouse.</P>  

<P><B>The Isle of Dogs (London Borough of Tower Hamlets)</B></P>
<P>The Isle of Dogs has undergone massive changes.  Business development followed the DLR across the island in the 1980’s and the area is now London’s third business district. 13 000 people work in the flagship Canary Wharf development, which is now over 70% let.  Major tenants include Morgan Stanley, London Underground Ltd and Mirror Group Newspapers.</P>

<P><B>The Royal Docks (London Borough of Newham)</B></P>
<P>As yet largely undeveloped, apart from London City Airport, but includes the Royals Business Park, which is the largest urban regeneration project in Europe, and the fastest growing business district in the UK.  The business park is surrounded by four other major projects:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> An 80 acre site
		 on the south side of the Royal Victoria Dock where the West Silvertown Urban 
		Village will provide homes for 5 00 people, jobs and a range of facilities.  <BR></P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> An 85 
		acre site on the north side of the same dock is designated for a major 
		international exhibition centre.  London International Exhibition 
		Centre Ltd (LIECL) have been appointed developers of the scheme, due 
		to start in 1996.</P>

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> An 82 acre 
		site around the Royal Albert Basin, to be developed for retail and leisure uses. </P> 

	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> A 25 acre site 
		reserved at the eastern end of the business park for the Royals University 
		College.  This project, backed by a consortium of the four local universities, 
		LDDC, LETEC, and the London Borough of Newham, has now been approved, 
		with an adjacent science and technology park.  It is seen as a key foundation 
		for the whole economic regeneration of the East Thames Corridor.</P>  
	</UL></P>

<P>Companies wishing to relocate to the Royal Docks could be eligible for discretionary grant assistance:</P>

	<P><UL>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> RSA of
		 up to 15% of capital cost (DTI).</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> Regional 
		enterprise grants of up to £25 000 for smaller companies for innovation 
		projects</P>
	<P><IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 Alt=Bullet SRC=images/bullet.gif> City Grant, 
		for special projects which require grants to attract private sector 
		financing (LDDC)</P>
	</UL></P>

<P><A NAME="popu"><LI><B>Population</B></A></P>

<P>Since 1981 the population of Docklands has grown by 68%, from 39 500 to 65 500.  65% of these new residents have relocated from the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham and Southwark.  Owner occupation levels have soared from 5% to over 40%.  It is forecast that by the year 2000, London Docklands will be home for 110 000 people and will provide jobs for 100 000 people.</P>

<P><A NAME="employ"><LI><B>Employment</B></A></P>

<P>Employment has more than doubled to 55 000.  Docklands has the highest  growth rate for jobs in the whole of London, generally for highly skilled work.  During the year 1994-5 annual job growth exceeded 8 000.</P>

<H3>BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS ESCALATES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the recent release of version 3.0 of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer, the browser battle is heating up.  Microsoft is
sweetening its Internet Explorer deal with the addition of free access to
some popular services that otherwise charge a fee, including the Wall Street
Journal Web site, ESPN's sports site, and the InvestorsEdge.com financial
advice site.  In addition, the software giant has the advantage of bundling
Internet Explorer with all new PCs shipped with Windows 95, a strategy that
will net it 46 million potential users in 1996 alone.  The next version of
Windows, scheduled for sometime next year, will have the browser built in.
Meanwhile, for the time being, Netscape still retains 85% of the market
share, and about 30,000 Web sites offer Netscape Navigator as a downloadable
option.  But Netscape's director of technology has his sights set on higher
goals:  "People assume that this is the highest hill, but we're not making
that mistake," he says.  (The Economist 17 Aug 96)  Netscape is offering its
own deal-sweetener with Navigator 3.0 -- its Netscape Inbox Direct feature
allows users to receive daily downloads of news from 26 content providers,
including the New York Times and c-Net.

<H3>PAYING PARKING TICKETS ONLINE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles has made paying speeding
tickets and renewing automobile registrations much easier - now motorists
with access to the Web can visit their site at < http://www.state.ma.us/rmv
> to conduct business.  Other services, such as ordering vanity license
plates, will be available by fall.  The state anticipates the move online
will eventually allow it cut back on the $6 million annual DMV allocation.

<H3>JUSTICE'S WEB SITE IS INFILTRATED</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The U.S. Justice Dept.'s Web site < http://www.usdoj.gov/ > took on a quite
different look after crackers broke in this weekend and altered the page to
include swastikas, obscene pictures and criticism of the Communications
Decency Act.  The site was shut down following the discovery Saturday
morning; the department expects to reconstruct the page and have it running
again by Monday, if not before.

<H3>NSF BESTOWS 13 WEB GRANTS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The National Science Foundation has announced 13 grants of $350,000 each to
U.S. universities for research projects aimed at developing technology to
improve the Internet of the future.  In addition to the cash, each school
will have access to NSF's vBNS (very high speed Backbone Network Service).
Types of projects funded include improvements in basic networking technology
as well as creation of new multimedia applications based on high-speed
networking.

<H3>SOFTBANK TO ACQUIRE KINGSTON TECHNOLOGY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Japan-based Softbank Corp., which has built an empire based on software
distribution, trade shows, publishing and Internet media ventures, has
announced its intention to buy 80% of Kingston Technology Corp., the world's
largest maker of plug-in PC memory boards.  While some industry analysts
admitted they were mystified as to why Softbank would expand into a business
area that's currently flat in growth and notorious for cyclical price
swings, Softbank president and founder Masayoshi Son defended the
$1.5-billion deal as a good business strategy:  "Through this investment, we
are spreading our risk so when the basket gets tipped, not every egg falls
out and gets cracked."

<H3>ECHOSTAR TO DELIVER DATA, TOO</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
EchoStar Communications has successfully completed a public test of the
technology it will use in cooperation with Intel Corp. and Comstream to
deliver data via satellite to subscribers.  Transmission rates could be
several megabits per second, says EchoStar's director of program management,
who adds that the opportunity to download Web content at higher speeds is
attractive to people hampered by slow phone lines.  "If the download could
be made quickly and it could be stashed on their hard drive, that might be
something they'd be interested in," he says.  In the recent test,
subscribers who use EchoStar's system to receive video and audio content
were given cards to install in their PCs, enabling them to receive data as
well.

<H3>NC WILL CHANGE THE PC, NOT REPLACE IT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
High-tech industry observer George Gilder says the PC will win out over the
TV as the dominant information source:  "On the Net, the viewer gets his or
her first choice of information, instead of the lowest common denominator."
Gilder also sees the NC/PC controversy as a motivation to redesign the PC:
"There's a huge opportunity for new devices on the network in schools,
libraries, kiosks, homes and businesses.  The NC won't displace the desktop,
but it will deeply influence the PC."

<H3>NEW SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RUN NEW CHIPS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As chipmakers strain to find new ways of packing even more power onto tiny
wafers of silicon, an industry consultant notes that more transistors per
chip is not all that's needed for improved performance.  The real boost in
speed will come from combining into a single chip functions that previously
required several processors, such as memory and logic circuits.  "As we push
below 0.25 micron, the software tools available to design integrated
circuits are not going to be able to keep up with the added complexity,"
says G. Dan Hutcheson.  To avoid what it calls a "productivity gap,"
Sematech has signed a multimillion contract with Synopsys for an advanced
design system that can handle circuits of 0.25 microns and smaller.

<H3>BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS ESCALATES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the recent release of version 3.0 of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
Internet Explorer, the browser battle is heating up.  Microsoft is
sweetening its Internet Explorer deal with the addition of free access to
some popular services that otherwise charge a fee, including the Wall Street
Journal Web site, ESPN's sports site, and the InvestorsEdge.com financial
advice site.  In addition, the software giant has the advantage of bundling
Internet Explorer with all new PCs shipped with Windows 95, a strategy that
will net it 46 million potential users in 1996 alone.  The next version of
Windows, scheduled for sometime next year, will have the browser built in.
Meanwhile, for the time being, Netscape still retains 85% of the market
share, and about 30,000 Web sites offer Netscape Navigator as a downloadable
option.  But Netscape's director of technology has his sights set on higher
goals:  "People assume that this is the highest hill, but we're not making
that mistake," he says.  (The Economist 17 Aug 96)  Netscape is offering its
own deal-sweetener with Navigator 3.0 -- its Netscape Inbox Direct feature
allows users to receive daily downloads of news from 26 content providers,
including the New York Times and c-Net.

<H3>WILL GATES BE THE "WINTEL GORBACHEV"?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Red Herring magazine < http://www.herring.com/mag/issue34/letter.html >
urges Microsoft's Bill Gates to use a cross platform architecture for the
company's ActiveX software, arguing that "ActiveX is the right language for
the Intranet and for useful pages on the World Wide Web" but that "Java is
the right language for the emerging market of digital devices that will be
attached -- in ways that are still mysterious -- to the Internet...  In
other words, Java is perfect for what it was originally designed for: the
embedded systems inside smart telephones, faxes, printers, set-top boxes,
and non-standard devices."  The magazine admits that Gates could become
"the Wintel Gorbachev" by following its advice, but insists that Microsoft
would be foolish to hold onto proprietary standards too long.

The University of Michigan has set up a videoconferencing system between

<H3>NETOBJECTS UNVEILS DO-IT-YOURSELF WEB TOOLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
NetObjects has developed a powerful new software program called Fusion that
functions basically as a fill-in-the-blank Web site builder.  Fusion
includes prefabricated Web page designs and features, and "puts Web
publishing in the hands of people who have access to information as opposed
to putting it in the hands of programmers," says an IBM marketing VP.  IBM
plans on bundling Fusion with its DB2 database offerings, and Netscape has
agreed to promote Fusion on its Web site in much the same manner that it has
Sun Microsystems' JavaSoft unit.  "The barrier today to building a cool Web
site is probably a $50,000 contract to get someone to do a lot of custom
work," says a partner in the venture capital firm that seeded Fusion's
development.  "NetObjects allows you to quickly get up and running and
modify it on the fly for $500."

<H3>U.S. GOV'T APPROVES ONLINE ENCRYPTION TOOL DISTRIBUTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The U.S. government has okayed Netscape Communications' plan to distribute
its powerful 128-bit encryption software via the Internet, as long as it's
sent only to U.S. citizens.  Currently, the company has to ship the software
via snail mail. Under the government's terms, Netscape must use a database
to verify the names and addresses of people who want to download the
software and ask them to sign affidavits stating they are U.S. citizens.
Netscape says its 128-bit encryption software requires 309 septillion more
times computing power to break the encryption code than its 40-bit version.

<H3>E-MAIL VIRUS SCARE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Experts say that fears of e-mail-borne viruses appear to be overblown, and
are urging network users to stop their misguided efforts to warn others of
the "non-existent" threat.  Panic over unfounded rumors causes another very
real problem -- floods of e-mail warnings that can slow Internet traffic to
a crawl.  Security specialists say that plain electronic mail cannot carry a
virus, and that users can best protect themselves by not opening attachments
unless they have a good idea of what's inside.  (Chronicle of Higher
Education 12 Jul 96 A19)  Meanwhile, to be on the safe side, Trend Micro
Inc. offers a way to protect network servers from nasty surprises.  Its
InterScan E-Mail VirusWall intercepts each e-mail message and attachment,
scanning them for any suspicious-looking code.  If an infection is detected,
the message recipient and network manager are alerted to the problem before
it goes any further.  The company claims it works with all popular e-mail
systems.

<H3>STRONG ENCRYPTION RAISES STRONG DEBATE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite opposition from the computer industry and civil libertarians, the
Clinton Administration continues to insist that data encryption technology
be based on a "key escrow" technique in which the large numbers ("keys")
used to decode data each be divided into two parts -- with each part held in
escrow by a third party, so that encrypted communications could be monitored
by law enforcement officials who've obtained court orders.  The government
says it will drop restrictions on the export of strong cryptography systems
if industry will go along with the key escrow approach.  That seems
unlikely, however;  Netscape CEO James Barksdale's response was:  "We are
furious.  This is a proposal that doesn't do anything to solve the immediate
needs of industry jobs."  Gore advisor Greg Simon argued that "the President
and Vice President took an oath to protect our national security.  They feel
they have to err on the side of protecting national security."

<H3>FIREFLY AGENTS DELIVER SERENDIPITY, TOO</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The problem with agents that simply learn and narrow down the information
they give you is that there isn't any element of serendipity.  It's hard to
find out about new topics," says one of the founders of Agents, Inc., an
outgrowth of MIT's Media Lab.  Agents is working to solve that problem with
its Firefly technology, which delivers value-added information by allowing
Firefly agents to "talk" with each other to find out what other agents
working for owners with similar interests have found.  The inquiring agent
then weighs each response according to how reliable that particular agent's
responses have been in the past.  If the reliability score is high, the
inquiring agent will pass more information on to its owner.

A new subscription service from Cybermedia automatically checks the Web

list of updates with what's on the customer's machine.  It displays the list
of those not yet installed on the client's PC and the client can then choose
whether or not to accept the upgrade.  A beta version is available at

their businesses within a year.  Forrester predicts that by the end of next
year, Java will have been used to create at least 60% of the programs

from customers in their review process.  The trend toward involving
underlings has become "something of a lightning rod," says the president of
Farm Credit, where 360-degree reviews constitute about half of the annual
review process.  "Some of our supervisors are by nature very responsive to
people above them, but less responsive to people at the same level or below.
I've noticed a change now, as they realize they're going to be evaluated by
these people."  Properly used, 360-degree feedback can be a very useful tool
for grading hard-to-measure areas, such as listening or conflict resolution,
and with the new emphasis on teamwork and project-oriented workloads,
evaluation from all sides makes more sense.

<H3>MOVE OVER, PARADIGM SHIFT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forget paradigm shifts, says a new report by Price Waterhouse LLP -- now
we're getting into "isoquantic" shifts.  The ability to turn nearly
everything into a series of ones and zeroes "places the world at the crux of
enormous change," says one of the authors.  Now that everything can be made
to look like everything else (at least as far as a computer is concerned),
previously disparate industries are rapidly converging.  Examples include
the coming distribution of Hollywood films on CD-ROMs, magazine publishing
on the Internet, and the rise of online banking and shopping.

A U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey has dismissed a lawsuit brought
by a Rutgers University data processor who claimed that IBM's keyboard
design had resulted in her case of carpal tunnel syndrome.  According to
the Center for Office Technology, the ruling was the 19th time a repetitive
stress injury case was decided in the computer maker's favor.  (Investor's
Business Daily 8 Jul 96 A6)  Meanwhile, management consulting firm
Alexander & Alexander reports that workers compensation claims related to
RSI cases cost businesses more than $2 billion last year.  A recent survey
shows 84% of respondents are taking RSI seriously, modifying equipment, job
tasks or work processes to minimize injuries.

<H3>SOHO MARKET A MYTH, STUDY SAYS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A study by Computer Intelligence Info Corp. has branded the so-called SoHo
(unified small office-home office) market a myth, noting that small
businesses and home-based workers make very different buying decisions. 
While the number one computer vendor for small companies last year was IBM,
home businesses patronized Packard Bell the most.  Also, self-employed
people, who make up the bulk of home-based workers, tend to use a wider
range of software and are two-and-a-half times as likely to be regular
users of online services.

E-commerce is coming -- it's just a matter of time, say the experts.  U.S.

money dealing electronically saves them, it will be much, much more.  For
example, a simple automobile parts purchase order is estimated to cost $150
to process -- doing it electronically could cut costs to $25.  "I really see

<H3>DOING IT ALL ONLINE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As various businesses try to size up the Net and figure out what the
electronic revolution means for them and their enterprises, look for a
full-fledged leap to the Net by the travel, sports and employment
industries.  An Internet strategy functions best for consumer processes that
can be enhanced along multiple needs -- activities that are fragmented,
require specialized knowledge, need personalization, benefit from first-hand
experience, and demand anytime, anywhere availability.  The travel business,
a notoriously fragmented, time-consuming and often confusing process, will
benefit from the Net's ability to offer information on multiple topics (from
terrorism to vaccinations to weather reports), its access to other travelers
who've been there, and soon the ability to book hotels, flights, rental cars
and anything else right on the screen, without the aid of a travel agent.
Meanwhile sports enthusiasts can get game scores, chat with other fans and
bet on their favorite teams, all through the Net.  And job-seekers can
browse the want ads, submit resumes, receive counseling and resume
assistance, and land an interview, without leaving their PCs.  "Eventually,
electronic communities will redefine the shape and delivery of all consumer
goods and services."  The companies that figure this out sooner, rather than
later, will be the ones that flourish in the coming decades.

International Data Corp. has come up with a new ranking system, taking into
consideration how well different countries' citizens can access, adopt and
absorb information and information technology.  The top slot, dubbed
"Roller-Bladers," was filled by the U.S. and Sweden.  Further down in the
second-tier "Striders" category were South Korea, Israel, Japan, the U.K.,
Canada and Australia.  IDC describes their information technology attitudes
as cautious, but dedicated and consistent.  Last among the 55 countries
ranked was China.  IDC, working with World Times Inc. of Boston, used 20
factors, such as technology spending, computer use and telecommunications
infrastructure to develop their rankings.  The companies found a close
correlation between technology success and the following five factors:
secondary school enrollment, college enrollment, newspaper readership, press
freedom and civil liberties.

<H3>PC HOMES UP 16% FROM LAST YEAR</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The number of households that own personal computers grew by 16% last year,
according to a new survey by Computer Intelligence Infocorp., which
interviewed 11,500 PC users.  That puts the total percentage at 38.5% of
U.S. homes that have one or more PCs.   "We were surprised to see
penetration levels jump five percentage points," says a Computer
Intelligence analyst.  "That is a very healthy increase."  Recent buyers
tended to be older and less-affluent Americans.  The growth in PC ownership
among households making $10,000 to $30,000 is up nearly 25%, to a range
between 10% and 30% of the total, and about 20% of households headed by
people over 60 now contain a PC.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In his recent book "JobShift:  How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs,"
author William Bridges writes that in the 21st century economy, just about
everyone will be an independent contractor, and warns that if the current
labor force doesn't prepare itself and adapt to these "new expectations and
the economic realities that have shaped them, we are in for decades of
economic chaos that will damage our organizations and devastate several
generations of workers."  Bridges says, "It's clear that in the new,
knowledge economy `jobs' are going to continue to disappear nearly to the
vanishing point, no matter what politicians say or do.  But there is now and
will continue to be plenty of `work' to do...  A century from now we'll see
this industrial age as a kind of island in time -- a reality that was
dependent on the means of production...  I see the passing of the obsolete
social invention called `jobs' as a practical transition problem, even an
opportunity, not an apocalypse."

"The smart publishers are going to team up with Microsoft," says the CEO of
Media News Group.  "You can't ignore them.  If publishers won't play ball
with them, they'll do it on their own."  Knight Ridder's marketing VP has
another view, however:  "To make an alliance based on fear doesn't make any
sense.  I would look long and hard before I gave them any of our product."
Microsoft plans to launch CityScape in New York, San Francisco and San Diego
early next year, and eventually cover the rest of the country's large
markets.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The PointCast Network, which markets its up-to-the-minute online news
service to businesses and individuals, is catching flak from corporate
network operators who say PointCast uses up too much of the bandwidth
available, causing other functions to slow way down.  PointCast is working
on the problem, but several companies have issued restrictions on how and
when employees may used the service, which functions as a screen saver,
providing the news when PCs are idle.  "The main problem with PointCast is
that it is so popular that it has grown very rapidly," says an internal
Unisys consultant.  To alleviate demand overload, PointCast's I-Server,
which will be available this fall, will act a local broadcast facility,
allowing companies to send internal company news, as well as the external
stuff, across an intranet.  That way, "Instead of employees all going
against our central broadcast, the data will only have to be sent once to
the I-Server," says the company's marketing VP.  And next month, PointCast
will release new technology that includes data compression to reduce the
network load by 50%.

have to learn "http://" addresses and HTML formatting:  "The original ideal
was that anybody would very easily be able to write documents that could be
connected through hypertext links.  What has surprised me is the way people
have been prepared to put up with manually encoding text.  HTML was never
supposed to be something that you would see -- it was intended to be
something produced by an editor program.  An analogy is with word
processors.  Computer users don't have to write in all kinds of codes to
format their document with fonts, margins and so on.  So it staggers me that
people have actually put up with having to write HTML by hand.  Similarly, I
had not expected people to have to work out the hypertext links by looking
up and typing in those long, complex codes for addressing.  URL syntax was
never intended for human consumption.  It was intended for a machine."

that is the natural way this technology gets disseminated, and it may be a

<H3>WIRED:  BUSINESS OR HOBBY?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Financial analysts are not of one mind when it comes to evaluating the
Initial Public Offering being made by Wired Ventures, the owner of Wired
magazine and various Internet-focused activities.  Although the valuation is
17.9 times the company's revenues for last year and the company continues to
post losses, Wired Ventures is felt by analyst Richard Shaffer to "have done
well at positioning itself in the middle of the Internet hype because it's
caused a lot of the Internet hype."  Another analyst, Tony Perkins, is more
skeptical:  "The bottom line is if you're doing $7.5 million in revenues and
you're losing $3.5 million, you're still pursuing a hobby, not a business."
Shaffer's view of that issue is that Wired "has real advertisers, real
paying subscribers, and an audience.  There is a real business there;  it
just doesn't happen to make money."

millions) $80M in '95, $343M in '96, and a projected $5,000M in 2000,
according to Jupiter Communications.  LA Times columnist Dan Akst says that
the nonprofit Audit Bureau of Circulations, a creature of the newspaper

offer independent certification of Web counts just as it does newspaper
circulation.  In opposition to these developments is the work of a small

PrivNet's founder says that "if the advertisers want to pay for a
high-speed Net connection to my house, then I would take the ads, but right

the consumer online services market, with the number of U.S. online

Jupiter Communications, author of the report, says to stay competitive, even
"plain vanilla" Internet access providers will begin to offer some
value-added content packages to lure and maintain customers.  Fees will
slide downward toward an "untimed" or "flat rate" access model, where
customers will pay somewhere around $20 for unlimited use.  And advertising
will become an increasingly vital source of revenue says Jupiter, which
predicts advertising-generated dollars topping $5 billion by 2000, up from
about $55 million last year.  The report also predicts continued alliances,
mergers and acquisitions among Internet-related companies and the heating up
of bandwidth wars as technology companies focus on improving data
compression on the Web, cable companies tout the speed of cable modems, and
telcos market ISDN and ADSL access.

<H3>IBM TO BUILD ULTRASUPERCOMPUTER</H3>

IBM has signed a $94-million contract with the U.S. government to build an
ultrasupercomputer - capable of handling 3-trillion operations per second

calls the DOE Option Blue a "dramatic leapfrog" over existing technologies.
Option Blue's main job will be to simulate the performance and deterioration
of the nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons, a function that once required
actual underground testing.  The U.S. is now observing a moratorium on such
testing, and will rely on electronic modeling instead.  Option Blue is the
second machine ordered by the Energy Department for use in simulated weapons
testing - Option Red, a smaller machine capable of handling 1.5-trillion
operations per second, was ordered from Intel Corp. last year and will be
installed at the Department's Sandia National Laboratory in December.

week that the possibility of "an electronic Pearl Harbor" is a very real

-- if not more than -- a well-placed bomb."  On July 15 the Clinton

threats to U.S. infrastructure, both electronic and physical, and to work
with the private sector in devising a strategy for protecting this
infrastructure.  At an earlier hearing, subcommittee members were told that
about 250,000 intrusions into Defense Department computer systems are
attempted each year, with about a 65% success rate.

<H3>STRONG ENCRYPTION RAISES STRONG DEBATE</H3>

Despite opposition from the computer industry and civil libertarians, the
Clinton Administration continues to insist that data encryption technology
be based on a "key escrow" technique in which the large numbers ("keys")
used to decode data each be divided into two parts -- with each part held in
escrow by a third party, so that encrypted communications could be monitored
by law enforcement officials who've obtained court orders.  The government
says it will drop restrictions on the export of strong cryptography systems

<H3>56-BIT ENCRYPTION IS VULNERABLE, SAYS ZIMMERMANN</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Philip Zimmermann, creator of Pretty Good Privacy encryption software,
testified before a Senate subcommittee that, based on a 1993 presentation by
Michael Wiener of Northern Telecom, it would be possible to build a machine
for $1 million that could crack a message encrypted with the Data Encryption
Standard and a 56-bit key in an average of 3.5 hours.  A more powerful
machine, costing about $10 million, could do it in 21 minutes, and a $100
million machine could bring the time down to two minutes.  Zimmermann's
testimony contradicted a recent statement by U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno that even with a "top of the line supercomputer, decoding a 56-bit key
would take over a year and the evidence would be long gone."  At issue is
whether the U.S. should permit the general-license export of 56-bit
encryption products.

A resolution introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives last week by
Rep. Rick White (R-Wash) and Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va), and in the Senate by

Internet to communicate with constituents, make information more accessible
to voters, and induce Congress to work with the Internet community to find
out more about Internet-related issues.  "We need to bring Congress online
for the 21st century," says White.  "The Communications Decency Act is a
pretty good example of what can happen when Congress passes laws on
something it knows little about."  White predicts that when Congress
revisits the Act next year, "a more educated Congress will develop a
solution that protects our children and protects our free speech."

hard drive for accessing later.  In addition, Intel is developing Intercast
technology, which uses the television signal's vertical blanking interval
to transmit a limited amount of digital data.

hostile to the church posted to a Netcom private bulletin board a document

by failing to remove the documents once they were told that copyrighted
documents had been posted on their systems.  Netcom will now warn its
subscribers not to "unlawfully distribute the intellectual property of
others."  (Investor's Business Daily 6 Aug 96 A9)   Internet personality
Howard Rheingold says:  "I would hate to see Netcom to be put in the

control as an easy way to navigate," says an industry publisher.  The
WebTV's remote control works with any TV and has a green button on the upper

with is that the machine's operating and browsing software are different
from the Netscape and Microsoft products that now dominate the Web.

<H3>SOFTBANK TO ACQUIRE KINGSTON TECHNOLOGY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Japan-based Softbank Corp., which has built an empire based on software
distribution, trade shows, publishing and Internet media ventures, has
announced its intention to buy 80% of Kingston Technology Corp., the world's
largest maker of plug-in PC memory boards.  While some industry analysts
admitted they were mystified as to why Softbank would expand into a business
area that's currently flat in growth and notorious for cyclical price
swings, Softbank president and founder Masayoshi Son defended the
$1.5-billion deal as a good business strategy:  "Through this investment, we
are spreading our risk so when the basket gets tipped, not every egg falls

<H3>PIXAR NEEDS NEW "TOY STORY"</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Pixar, the Steve Jobs' computer animation company ("Toy Story"), has shut
down its commercial TV unit and plans to concentrate on full-length movies.
It was a stock market hit when the new offering was made last year at $22
and rose as high as $49.50 on the first day of selling.  Now it's trading
around $18 a share.  Industry analyst Michael Murphy says the problem is
that the company's expensive technology can be copied by imitators:  "Cheap
software replaces expensive software.  When people begin making 'Toy
Story'-sorts of movies on PCs, Pixar will have to move to more
difficult-to-animate projects."

<H3>COMPUTER HAS "TURNED AESTHETICS ON ITS HEAD"</H3>

Author Nicholas von Hoffman says that "for the time being, at least, what
the computer can do in art and design has turned aesthetics on its head."
Noting that in just a few decades "our strange species has broken out of a
millennium of sensory deprivation to live in a condition of perpetual
overload," von Hoffman says that "in time, art critics and the wider public
may develop an aesthetic standard for judging the new imagery.  For now, it
is enough to recognize the electronic look to the wild visuals ever
presenting themselves to our blinking eyes...  With the computer, things are
not so much created as they are produced, with the producer-director
becoming the star and the controlling force of much that was in other hands
at other times."

<H3>FAITHLESS IN DISNEYLAND</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Big Brother could rewrite history;  can the Disney Corporation rewrite
culture?  New York Times cultural critic Paul Goldberger  finds a disturbing
trend, exemplified by the new Disney animated film musical, "The Hunchback
of Notre Dame," which allows "virtually everything to become grist for the
entertainment mill and which can produce a film that shows "an absolute
complete and total misunderstanding of what the original novel and its many
classic film interpretations were about."  Whereas film adaptations in the
past were generally made as attempts to respect the intentions of the
original material, the need to create merchandise tie-ins through false,
"cuddly" new Disney versions show an arrogant determination to make anything
and everything into entertainment.  Goldberger says that "what is troubling
is the extent to which Disney, as the colossus of pop culture it has become,
seems to have lost its bearings.  Something isn't functioning in the
gryoscope here;  some key indicator that once told this company what was and
what was not appropriate seems to have gone awry...  The issue is not
animation per se, or entertainment;  it is faithfulness to the original
material, which requires a willingness to accept the fact that everything is
not entertainment."

<H3>INTEL FOCUSES ON HYBRID APPLICATIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Intel is turning toward hybrid applications to bridge the gap between
today's computer network capacity and the futuristic expectation of
unlimited bandwidth.  "The myth of the Internet is that there is plenty of
bandwidth," says Intel CEO Andy Grove.  "The hybrid application is what we
will use for a long time to overcome the limits of the available
bandwidth."  Such applications involve, for instance, ways of compressing
and downloading data via telephone lines and then storing that data on a PC
hard drive for accessing later.  In addition, Intel is developing Intercast
technology, which uses the television signal's vertical blanking interval
to transmit a limited amount of digital data.

American trade negotiators gave in to Japan's insistence that the U.S.
cease trying to provide oversight of Japanese imports.  In any event, most
analysts think that such bilateral pacts are no longer relevant to the chip
industry, which economic forces have made more competitive (with countries
such as Taiwan and China now prominent in chip manufacture) and at the same
time more cooperative (with companies in various nations working together
to develop new chips).  In 1986 the trade agreement called for Japan to
import 20% of its chips;  now one-third of all its chip purchases are
imported.

<H3>NEW SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RUN NEW CHIPS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As chipmakers strain to find new ways of packing even more power onto tiny
wafers of silicon, an industry consultant notes that more transistors per
chip is not all that's needed for improved performance.  The real boost in
speed will come from combining into a single chip functions that previously
required several processors, such as memory and logic circuits.  "As we push
below 0.25 micron, the software tools available to design integrated
circuits are not going to be able to keep up with the added complexity,"
says G. Dan Hutcheson.  To avoid what it calls a "productivity gap,"
Sematech has signed a multimillion contract with Synopsys for an advanced
design system that can handle circuits of 0.25 microns and smaller.

<H3>QUANTUMLY SPEAKING</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the next 15 years, scientists will have narrowed the width of lines
etched into semiconductors to less than one-tenth of a micron, meaning that
electrical signals running through those circuits will contain so few
electrons that adding or subtracting a single one could make a difference in
the computer's functions.  "At that point, we better have a new technology
ready to go into production," says Texas Instruments' nanoelectronics
manager.  To control the movements of very small groups of electrons,
researchers are developing quantum dots that can corral rambunctious
electrons, allowing them to escape only when zapped by a precisely sized
boost of energy from outside.  Such "quantum confinement" could lead to
tiny, very high-powered lasers that would eliminate the need for expensive
repeaters in optical fiber telecommunications systems, or make it possible
to store 15,000 times more data on a computer chip the same size as those
produced today.

Intel's Pentium Pro microprocessor is fueling an invasion of the higher end
server market, as Compaq, Dell and other computer makers try their hand at
low-cost, high-performance servers.  On the lower end of the market, where
desktop computer makers have already made great inroads, Compaq's
200-megahertz, single-processor Pentium Pro server with 64 megabytes of
memory goes for $11,900, compared with Digital's $16,000 32-bit,
266-megahertz server with 64 megabytes of memory.  Compaq's top-of-the-line
Pentium Pro server is priced at $200,000, still cheaper than Digital's RISC
(reduced instruction set computer) servers that go for $250,000 and up.
"The price-performance ratio is a lot better with the new Pentium Pro," says
an analyst for Technology Business Research.  "All of a sudden, the RISC
makers are saying, `We've got to reduce prices.'"

Canada's cable industry received a "billion-dollar bonus" from federal
regulators yesterday by "administrative fiat without any public input or
participation by the federal government."  CRTC commissioners announced
cable companies will no longer have to demonstrate significant public
benefits such as improvement of infrastructure when they buy control of
another cable concern or merge operations.

<EM> This Field Guide summarizes the common wisdom as gleaned from industry analysts and company managers.  It can help you understand why companies are doing what they are doing and what the future may hold.  It is not recommended for the reader to make investment decisions based solely on this information. </EM><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Updated April 12, 1996</H3>
<BR>
<P>The cable industry is at a crossroads.  Cable companies have traditionally relied on their monopoly status to provide a steady stream of monthly service fees from their subscribers.  But new technology and telecom deregulation are dismantling their cozy monopoly, providing a host of competitors including direct satellite broadcast companies and local telephone companies.  On the other hand, new opportunities in offering local telephone service and high-speed cable modems may provide the cable industry with huge new revenue streams.  The fact that the cable industry has the only existing broadband wire into homes puts it in a unique position in the evolving telecommunications battle.

<H3>STRENGTHS</H3>

<P>The ace in the hole held by all cable companies is their control of the only existing broadband wire into a majority of U.S. homes.  Currently, cable can deliver information 130 times faster than normal phone lines.  The phone companies have started upgrading their lines to digital ISDN, but even at this higher speed, cable modems will be 70 times faster. Most analysts agree that the cost to a telephone company or other potential competitor to duplicate the speed of the cable wires is prohibitive.  What is more, the biggest potential competitors, the local phone companies, have better opportunities getting into long distance service, thus they will likely be distracted from the cable market by "bigger fish."  With communications evolving at a fever pitch and speed becoming a key competitive feature, cable companies have a key advantage over all other players.


<H3>WEAKNESSES</H3>

<P>Unfortunately for the cable industry, customers generally rank satisfaction with cable service below almost all the other utilities, including the phone companies.  Analysts predict this could haunt cable companies as customers are offered choices they never had before.  With telephone companies eventually offering cable services over the phone lines, and cable companies moving into the phone business, customers will soon be able to vote with their purses, and one major factor will be past experience with the candidates.  Images of arrogance and poor customer service give the cable industry a major weakness to overcome as customer satisfaction plays a larger and larger role.


<H3>OPPORTUNITIES</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="tel01.gif" ALT="Chart of market sizes: Long Distance-$70b, Local Phone-$80b, Cable-$20b, Cellular-$11b" ALIGN=RIGHT>

While cable companies are already beginning to take advantage of new opportunities in adding additional channels and in pay-per-view TV, its not hard to see why most cable companies look to providing local telephone service as their biggest opportunity.  At $91 billion, the combined markets for cellular and local telephone service is over four times the size of cable's existing market.  Cable company plans are to provide both "wired" telephone service (via the cable wire extending into the homes) and PCS wireless service (via transceivers positioned along the fiber/coax backbone.  While AT&T, MCI and a variety of other communications groups are positioning themselves to attack this same market, cable's existing broadband wire will position the cable companies to win their share.  Some analysts predict that by the year 2004, cable companies will have signed up 10% of the households in the country for wired telephone service and 5% of the population for wireless services. 


<H3>THREATS</H3>

<P><EM>Direct Broadcast Cable</EM> or (DBS) is frequently cited by cable companies as a major competitive threat.  While home satellite dishes have been around for years, the low power of the satellites required that the dishes be 6 to 10 feet in diameter.  New high-powered satellites have enabled competitors such as Hughes' "DirecTV" and Hubbard Broadcastings' "USSB" to deliver home satellite cable services via a much smaller 18 inch satellite dish.  The cable industry has partially addressed this threat by offering its own medium-powered satellite service called "Primestar".  Currently, about 1 million households get their cable signal through DBS versus 60 million households using conventional cable.  Analysts agree that while DBS poses an immediate threat, new demand for interactive cable services will decrease the advantages of one-way satellite transmission over time.  Industry watchers also cite DBS's inability to provide locally-oriented programming as a weakness vis-a-vis cable.

<P><EM>Local Telephone Companies</EM> have all announced plans to offer video programming over the phone lines, however analysts tend to downplay this threat in the short term.  Telephone companies would have to invest billions on billions of dollars to upgrade their twisted pair network to carry video signals.  At the same time, telecommunications deregulation is opening up the much juicier long distance telephone market to the local bells.  The local bells could enter the long distance market with a much smaller investment than they would need to enter the cable market -- and the long distance market is nearly four times larger.  Many local telephone companies appear to be scaling back their video plans to offering "wireless cable," a system where microwave cable signals are beamed from a local transmitter to the customer's home.  


<H3>FORMULA FOR SUCCESS</H3>

<P>Analysts cite several key issues when evaluating a cable company's positioning for future success.  The sophistication of the company's network is important because more advanced technology means the cable company can offer new services faster and will be burdened with less investment requirements in the future.  The number of subscribers per cable system or "clustering" is cited because of the economies of scale necessary when going into telephony.  Access to capital will be critical as the race to keep the network technology up to speed consumes cash.  And finally, may believe customer satisfaction ratings will play a larger part as consumers are at last able to make choices between cable and telephone providers.

<P><EM>Cox Communications</EM>(COX) is often cited by analysts as being one of the better positioned cable companies.  The company's highly sophisticated network and high numbers of subscribers per cluster gives it a head start in the advance towards the telephone business.  Some also cite Cox's relatively high levels of customer satisfaction as being unique among cable companies.

to begin shipping in September.  "They figured out how to make a Web site
look pretty decent on a TV screen and they figured out how to use a remote
control as an easy way to navigate," says an industry publisher.  The

<H3>TOP SECRET FAX TRANSMISSIONS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You're sending a fax with sensitive information, and don't relish the
prospect of it sitting around in plain view on the recipient's end.  Now
researchers at the University of Rochester have developed a simple fax
cloaking system that camouflages information in a maze of black and white
dots.  The user's fax machine must be equipped with the software that hides
the text within a random pattern of dots.  The fax recipient then places a
clear plastic decoding sheet that contains a matching set of dots, rendering
the original message readable.  The software generates hundreds of thousands
of patterns, so each recipient can have a unique decoding sheet.  So far,
the technology works best with large, bold print, but with the advent of
higher-resolution fax machines, it should be possible to use if for smaller
print, too.

With new companies every week enthusiastically endorsing the NC (network

First, there are the consumers:  Gartner Group predicts that "the vast

itself:  "The concept of the network computer means you are putting a very
large burden on a very thin pipe," says a Gartner analyst.  Some folks

<H3>CIA DIRECTOR WARNS OF INFORMATION WARFARE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Central Intelligence Agency Director John Deutch says the trend toward
increased reliance by companies on telecommunications and computer networks
is making the U.S. more vulnerable to other countries' information warfare
tactics.  "The electron, in my judgment, is the ultimate precision-guided
munition.  Virtually any single `bad actor' can acquire the hardware and
software needed to attack some of our critical information-based
infrastructures...  We have evidence that a number of countries around the
world are developing the doctrine, strategies and tools to conduct
information attacks."  Deutch predicts that the threat of cyber attacks
will be "very, very close to the top" of the CIA's list of worries,
"especially if you ask me to look 10 years down the road."

Jonathan Wallace, co-author of "Sex, Laws and Cyberspace," (Henry Holt,

content from the Internet:  "If Congress had taken a deep breath, it would
have realized the correct analogy for the Net is the printing press.  Every
computer can be used as a tool to create text or redistribute text created
by others.  The analogy is so exact that there's no justification to apply
laws that are different than those for the printing press.  What Congress
did instead was to treat the Net like broadcast TV -- a grievous mistake."

being challenged in court by the American Library Association, whose
legislative counsel Adam Eisgrau notes, "Fear plus ignorance shouldn't equal

Because of the positions President Clinton has taken on such issues as
securities litigation, capital-gains taxes, R&D tax credits, and political
reform, he seems to have lost the support of many of the information
technology industry executives who gave him enthusiastic endorsements in

they'll change their minds because  ''I don't know any political leaders in
the world who have invested more time in promoting the future of information
technology than President Clinton and Vice President Gore.''

<H3>EXPANDED UNIVERSAL SERVICE DEBATED</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Participants in a May 1 Cato Institute policy forum debated whether the FCC
will expand the definition of universal service to include more advanced
services beyond voice-grade dialtone.  "The real motivations of some of
these policies, it seems to me, have very little to do with economics and
very little to do with telecommunications," says Cato's director of
telecommunications and technology studies.  "I think they're part of a wider
agenda which says, `Look, we can't have big social program bills any more.
God knows, look what happened to the health care program.  But we can tack
on social aspects to other bills, especially ones that are very widely
popular, like the Telecom bill.'  So it's sort of social policy by default."
A representative from Citizens for a Sound Economy was a little more
optimistic that market forces would prevail:  "The Telecommunications Act is
a lot like sausage made with very high quality meat and a certain amount of
fat.  What do you do with a sausage?  You put it over the fire and you give
it plenty of heat.  And if you do that, you burn off the fat.  The meat of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to allow for competition."

<H3>TELECOMMUTING WINNERS AND LOSERS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The shift toward more telecommuting will have ripple effects in other
industries.  Here's a list of some of the winners:  Home furniture
companies, which will supply all those home office desks and chairs;
utilities, which will furnish phone lines and power to home office
equipment; copy centers, which can run off a quick 100 copies for workers
far from corporate headquarters, and the mail box business, which serves as
the surrogate corporate mail room; and company productivity, which benefits
from an employee's proximity to the tools of work, so that even a sick day
taken off to care for a child isn't a total loss.  Losers include:  Unions,
which worry about wage-and-hour protections under the new regime; dry
cleaners and fancy clothiers, which aren't needed for sweat suits; gas
companies and car repair shops, which become less important when your car
stays parked in your garage all day; and downtown lunch counters, which
become obsolete when you can heat up last night's leftovers.

too many channels into two small a spectrum, causing interference and

Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jamie Gorelick told a Senate subcommittee last
week that the possibility of "an electronic Pearl Harbor" is a very real
danger for the U.S.  She noted in her testimony that the U.S. information
infrastructure is a hybrid public/private network, and warned that electronic
attacks "can disable or disrupt the provision of services just as readily as
-- if not more than -- a well-placed bomb."  On July 15 the Clinton
Administration called for a President's Commission on Critical
Infrastructure Protection, with the mandate to identify the nature of
threats to U.S. infrastructure, both electronic and physical, and to work
with the private sector in devising a strategy for protecting this
infrastructure.  At an earlier hearing, subcommittee members were told that
about 250,000 intrusions into Defense Department computer systems are
attempted each year, with about a 65% success rate.

<H3>E-MAIL VIRUS SCARE</H3>

Experts say that fears of e-mail-borne viruses appear to be overblown, and
are urging network users to stop their misguided efforts to warn others of
the "non-existent" threat.  Panic over unfounded rumors causes another very
real problem -- floods of e-mail warnings that can slow Internet traffic to
a crawl.  Security specialists say that plain electronic mail cannot carry a
virus, and that users can best protect themselves by not opening attachments
unless they have a good idea of what's inside.  (Chronicle of Higher
Education 12 Jul 96 A19)  Meanwhile, to be on the safe side, Trend Micro
Inc. offers a way to protect network servers from nasty surprises.  Its
InterScan E-Mail VirusWall intercepts each e-mail message and attachment,
scanning them for any suspicious-looking code.  If an infection is detected,
the message recipient and network manager are alerted to the problem before
it goes any further.  The company claims it works with all popular e-mail
systems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
AT&T's recent investment in Nets Inc., through its spin-off of New Media
Services to Jim Manzi's Industry.Net, signals its plans to become a one-stop
shop for electronic communications -- from e-mail and Internet access to
cellular calling and satellite TV.  The company's primary strategy is to
sign up millions of customers for its WorldNet Internet access service.  The
company will also provide its corporate customers a "hosting" service called
EasyCommerce, which will create and operate corporate Web sites.  At the
same time, the company has scrapped Network Notes and is looking to get rid
of its Imagination Network, an online gaming service; it's also considering
phasing out Personalink, a messaging service that uses General Magic
technology.

<H3>56-BIT ENCRYPTION IS VULNERABLE, SAYS ZIMMERMANN</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Philip Zimmermann, creator of Pretty Good Privacy encryption software,
testified before a Senate subcommittee that, based on a 1993 presentation by
Michael Wiener of Northern Telecom, it would be possible to build a machine
for $1 million that could crack a message encrypted with the Data Encryption
Standard and a 56-bit key in an average of 3.5 hours.  A more powerful
machine, costing about $10 million, could do it in 21 minutes, and a $100
million machine could bring the time down to two minutes.  Zimmermann's
testimony contradicted a recent statement by U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno that even with a "top of the line supercomputer, decoding a 56-bit key
would take over a year and the evidence would be long gone."  At issue is
whether the U.S. should permit the general-license export of 56-bit
encryption products.

<H3>CIA DIRECTOR WARNS OF INFORMATION WARFARE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Central Intelligence Agency Director John Deutch says the trend toward
increased reliance by companies on telecommunications and computer networks
is making the U.S. more vulnerable to other countries' information warfare
tactics.  "The electron, in my judgment, is the ultimate precision-guided
munition.  Virtually any single `bad actor' can acquire the hardware and
software needed to attack some of our critical information-based
infrastructures...  We have evidence that a number of countries around the
world are developing the doctrine, strategies and tools to conduct
information attacks."  Deutch predicts that the threat of cyber attacks
will be "very, very close to the top" of the CIA's list of worries,
"especially if you ask me to look 10 years down the road."

The Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies is
developing an "Information Intelligence Quotient" to use as a framework for
"the comparative measurement of three critical factors:  infrastructure,

have focused on telephone penetration, says a senior CSIS official, but
those measurements are "misleading, as well as inadequate...  Electronic
communications infrastructure now reaches far beyond traditional telephone
networks and content providers.  Strategic planners and policy makers need
to start benchmarking the expanding ingredients involved."  These new
criteria include cellular, paging, cable and satellite networks, telephone
booths and voice mailboxes, and access issues such as costs, tariffs,
licensing and interconnection agreements.

<H3>SATELLITE TIME IS GETTING EXPENSIVE FOR SCHOOLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Universities that transmit courses and other educational programs via
satellite are getting hit with charges of up to $1,000 per hour of live
transmission, almost double the cost two years ago, and some are resorting
to mailing out videotapes rather than pay for live shows.  "Since the
mid-'80s, there has been a 1,000% increase in satellite costs," says
Oklahoma State University's Marshall Allen.  Soaring prices have forced OSU
to drop two advanced placement courses it offered to high school students.
The problem stems from a shortage in satellites combined with more
competition in the spot market, where many educators buy their time.
Satellite brokers and consultants predict the shortage will ease over the
next few years as users migrate from analog transmission to digital, which
can be compressed to one-fourth the transponder space requirement of a
full-motion analog signal.  Meanwhile educators are looking to
videoconferencing over phone lines and eventually the Internet as lower-cost
alternatives.

<H3>AT&T HANGS UP PROPRIETARY MESSAGING SYSTEM</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Citing competition from the Internet, AT&T has folded its PersonaLink online
service that enabled users to shop and send messages via hand-held wireless
"personal communicators" made by Motorola and Sony.  The company had poured
some $100 million into the venture, which used its own proprietary software.
In its place, AT&T will launch a new cellular-phone Internet access service
called PocketNet Phone, that uses a hybrid cell-data phone made by
Mitsubishi Wireless Communications and Cirrus Logic.  Software for the new
venture is made by Unwired Planet Inc., a startup company in which AT&T
holds an unspecified stake.

<H3>BELL ATLANTIC OPENS ITS MARKET TO COMPETITION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bell Atlantic regional telephone company is allowing the cable company
Jones Intercable Inc. to connect to the Bell phone network in Virginia;  by
showing the Federal Communications Commission that it is opening its own
market to competition, the move may help Bell Atlantic in turn win federal
approval to enter the long-distance phone market.

Although the quality of voice communication over the Net is still far from
perfect, Internet telephony is gaining in popularity and causing the
long-distance phone companies enough concern that they've petitioned the
Federal Communications Commission to regulate the providers of Internet
voice-communications software as if they were telephone companies.  Jeff
Pulver of the Voice On Net Coalition, a group formed to coordinate the
promotion of Internet telephony, says that "this stuff really works.  No
doubt there are going to be tremendous applications in business."  The

<H3>BELL CANADA WANTS SAME FREEDOM AS AT&T</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bell Canada president John McLennan says his company and other members of
the Stentor alliance of phone companies are handicapped by regulations not
faced by alternative long-distance carriers such as Unitel and Call-Net.
McLennan points out Bell must currently files proposed prices increases with
Canadian regulators where all competitors can review them, and the company
cannot change its charges without first obtaining federal approval.
McLennan wants the same regulatory freedom enjoyed in the United States by
AT&T.

<H3>INTEL VIDEOCONFERENCING SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE SITES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Intel's new ProShare desktop videoconferencing system allows up to 24 sites
to connect on a single phone call, making the process much less expensive
for people who need to connect to multiple sites.  Currently, a user must
install a special circuit board in their PC to use the ProShare system, but
a software-only version is due out later this year.  The system will make it
much easier to run desktop videoconferencing over corporate networks.
"We've been waiting all these years for a picture phone, and we just might
get it.  But it won't be a phone, it will be a computer," says an industry

<H3>BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX MERGER PUTS VIDEO ON HOLD</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first order of business once telco giants Bell Atlantic and Nynex merge,
will be an aggressive launch into long-distance markets, with wireless cable
less of a priority initially.  "The video stuff is clearly back-burnered,"
says Howard Anderson of the Yankee Group, who predicts Internet-related
services will come second.  "The revenue potential is greater in long
distance, and it also helps solidify their positions in the local business,"
says a consultant with Furman Selz.  "It's also an area they know.  It's not
as far afield as video, so the learning curve is much shorter."

Pacific Bell, the principal unit of the Pacific Telesis telephone group,
failed to get permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to
overlay new area codes in a geographical area on top of existing ones to
meet the burgeoning demand for new numbers caused by dramatically rising
numbers of fax machines, cellular phones, and pagers.  PacBell rivals such
as AT&T and MCI said that overlays are anti-competitive, and the Commission
decided to continue dividing up overcrowded area codes into new areas and

<H3>REED EXPLAINS IT ALL</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt uses a sports analogy to explain the new rules of
competition for telecommunications companies:  "Suppose the competitor of
the local phone company were the Washington Redskins and the incumbent phone
company was the Dallas Cowboys.  Congress has said that the Redskins have
the right to borrow Emmit Smith for any number of plays.  That is called
unbundling an element of the incumbent's network.  And the Redskins can use
the entire Cowboy team at a discount off what Jerry Jones has paid them.
That's called resale.  Also the Redskins can hand off the ball to Smith if
their own runners aren't doing so well.  That's called interconnection.  If
Smith helps the Redskins get a touchdown, that's called termination, for
which some think the Cowboys should be paid nothing but the Skins should get
the points."

<H3>REGIONAL BELLS WANT RATE HIKES FOR WIRING SCHOOLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The United States Telephone Association would like to raise the average U.S.
monthly phone bill by about $10 over the next five years to pay for wiring
schools and libraries with new lines for phones and computers, and to
subsidize poor and rural customers.  The proposal assumes an $11 billion
cost for wiring schools and libraries, with local phone companies paying
about a third to a half of that.  The rest would come from a surcharge on
other services, such as cellular.  "No single industry should be held
responsible for fulfilling this major goal," says USTA's president.  "Each
has a role and should make a significant contribution to the national
education technology mandate."

<H3>Updated April 18, 1996</H3>

<P>The baby bells or Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) probably have the most to lose in the intensifying "telecom wars." Created when AT&T broke up in the 1970's, the seven misnamed "baby bells" have enormous revenues and investment power (Pacific Telesis, the smallest RBOC before it was bought by sibling SBC, has revenues of $9 billion.)  But while the Telecommunications Bill recently passed in congress allows the RBOCs to offer a variety of new services including long distance and cable service, the same bill allows a host of competitors to attack the enormous $80 billion market for local telephone service.  Analysts have conflicting theories on whether the RBOCs will be able to parlay their current power into new services before competitors eat the bells' lunch.

<H3>The Bells Control Access to the End Users</H3>

<P>The basis for the RBOCs' strength is that they own the local network that connects to residences and businesses.  While the Telecommunications Bill forces the RBOCs to both provide competitors with access to all parts of the local network, the timeline and terms of these changes continue to remain fuzzy.  Indeed, in the past, the RBOCs have found innumerable ways to stymie competitors wanting to connect to the local network.  The Telecommunications Bill partially addressed this issue by requiring the bells accommodate some competition on the local level before they are allowed to offer long distance services.  

<H3>But the Bells Lack National Scope</H3>

<P>While the baby bells are regional in scope, much of the telecommunications market is national and international.  The RBOCs regional focus will make it very difficult to sell to large businesses or individuals who need to be able to call from anywhere, to anywhere, and have it billed to one of many different offices.  The bells are attempting to gain a national presence through joint ventures with each other and outright buyouts, but they have a long way to go before they have the national presence of an AT&T or MCI.

<H3>Opportunities Abound</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="tel01.gif" ALT="Chart of market sizes: Long Distance-$70b, Local Phone-$80b, Cable-$20b, Cellular-$11b" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Most analysts agree that the bells are poised to grow more from growing demand for telecommunications services rather than invading other markets.  The internet's growth is driving demand for additional phone lines and internet access.  Add-on services in the vein of call waiting and caller ID will also present good opportunities.  However, all of the other retail telecommunications markets present opportunities for the RBOCs.
<UL>
<LI><EM>Cellular and wireless services</EM>, while currently the smallest market, is viewed by many as potentially the biggest opportunity for the bells.  Not only is the market projected to grow a whopping 20% annually over the next five years, but strong customer contact and in-place networks make the bells well suited to benefit from this new market.  BellSouth, for example, already gets 14% of its revenue from wireless services.
<BR><BR>
<LI><EM>Long distance service</EM> is a huge $70 billion business, yet it is not universally recognized by analysts as a good opportunity for the baby bells.  Enthusiasts point to the size of the long distance market and the low investment required by the RBOCs to begin offering this service.  Skeptics say that the baby bells' inability to provide national or international service means that they  will not be able to serve the needs of large corporations or individuals who travel -- thus the potential market is cut down to about $20 billion.  Furthermore, the skeptics argue that the bells already get a large portion of this money because the long distance giants typically pay 40% of their charges to a local bell to complete each call.  Because of the low $150 to $200 million investment required of a typical bell to enter the long distance market, it is likely most will offer long distance services.  But it may not provide the windfall that some expect. 
</UL>

<H3>The Bells' Markets Will Be Threatened on Many Fronts</H3>

<P><IMG SRC="tel02.gif" ALT="Regional Bell Revenues: Access-36%, Toll-21%, Dial Tone-43%" ALIGN=RIGHT>

Telecommunication deregulation has spawned many threats to the baby bells.  Some analysts predict it will be like fighting a war on many fronts, where no one market is lost to competition but where each front loses some ground to a different group of competitors.  Dial tone service, providing over 40% of baby bell revenue, is coveted by both competitive access providers (or CAPS) and cable companies.  Toll revenues, received for taking a call to a nearby suburb, will be challenged by the long distance providers.  The access fees, received from long distance providers for completing long distance calls, will be sought by the CAPs.

<UL>
<LI><EM>Long distance companies</EM> like AT&T and MCI have designs on all of the local phone market but immediately threaten the toll revenues.  With well recognized national brand names, and the ability to include "short distance" toll service with traditional long distance service, these companies will be tough competitors. Indeed AT&T may be the most formidable in that many bell customers still believe that their local phone service is provided by AT&T.
<BR><BR>
<LI><EM>Competitive access providers</EM> (or CAPs) have made their money by connecting high-volume businesses directly to the long distance providers, bypassing the local bells and effectively skimming the best customers.  The Telecommunications Bill requires RBOCs to separately lease to competitors the wires that go to the buildings; thus CAPs now have new tools to gain entry.  
<BR><BR>
<LI><EM>Cable companies</EM> want to leverage their cable connections as a new vehicle for phone service.  There are initiatives underway at all the major cable companies to provide dial tone service over the cable lines.  The cable wire can support a much higher bandwidth than standard phone lines or even ISDN.  Thus as internet usage, video conferencing, and other speed-hungry applications take off, the cable companies may be well positioned to compete.
</UL>

<H3>Success Depends on Factors Largely Out of the Bells' Control</H3>

<P>Up to now, there has not been a big difference in performance between the bells.  Analysts expect this to change as the bells pursue different strategies and take advantage of different strengths.  The nature of each bell's territory and the decisions of the regulators, both factors largely out of the bells' control, are key to future success.  

<UL>
<LI><EM>Population density</EM> of region served will likely be an important factor as competitors seek to cherry pick the most lucrative urban markets.  Urban bells such as Ameritech in Chicago are most likely to face heavy competition because they are in the most desirable areas.  Rural bells such as U.S. West will likely face less competition because would-be challengers do not stand to gain as much for their investment. 
<BR><BR>
<LI><EM>In-Region calling patterns</EM> will be important in determining the success with which a bell can enter the long distance market.  For example, Bell South will be better able to capture long distance revenues because 55% of all long distance calls originating in Bell South's territory also end in its territory.  On the other hand, Nynex will have a more difficult time of it as only 20% of its long distance calls terminate in-region.  Merger discussions are proceeding between Bell Atlantic (based in Washington D.C.) and Nynex (based in the Northeast) because when the two companies are combined, a larger portion of calls would be made entirely in-region.  
<BR><BR>
<LI><EM>The regulatory environment</EM> on both the state and federal level will determine how quickly the bells can get into new markets and how much profit they are allowed to make. Many states recently moved from rate-of-return regulation, which limited the amount of money a bell could earn, to price cap regulation, which limited the prices a bell could charge its customers.  This move is positive for the bells in that they can now benefit by cutting costs.  Under rate-of-return regulation, any savings from cost-cutting had to be passed directly on to the customer, so there was no motivation to cut costs.  The only bell still largely under rate-of-return regulation is U.S. West.

<H3>Investors' Notes</H3>
<P>Most RBOCs produce a lot of taxable income in the form of dividends.  They also tend to have relatively low volatility with respect to the stock market making them good defensive stocks.

<H3>E-DATA'S PATENT CLAIMS UNDER SCRUTINY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
New Jersey-based E-data Corp., which purchased a patent originally filed in
1983 by inventor Charles Freeny that covered the way digital information
could be downloaded over telephone lines, has sued more than a dozen
software and publishing companies over activities it claims are covered by
its patent.  Ex Machina, one of the companies sued, is claiming, however,
that E-data's patent was issued in error - and that Telephone Software
Connection, which is no longer in business, was doing the same thing in
1980, three years before E-data's patent was filed.  The defendants are now
arguing that E-data's patent never should have been issued in the first
place, and is based on technology that should be considered "prior art."
IBM and Adobe have already settled with E-data over their claims, and say
their agreements prohibit them from discussing the terms.

Network told the FCC Universal Service Board that schools need uniform
access to the same services, and suggested that whatever pricing scheme the
FCC comes up with should be based on three factors:  the district's wealth
as reflected by housing values;  the district's per-student education
budget;  and its population density.  "Any system of vouchers or fund caps
based on per pupil allotments (whether adjusted or not) fails to recognize
the premise behind the Universal Service Fund, that is, to equalize the
cost factors associated with providing services in low density, high cost
areas.  The FCC's goal should be to ensure equity of access, not parity in
technology implementation."

<H3>PETITION FILED ON NET TELEPHONY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Voice on the Net coalition has filed comments with the FCC, protesting
that recent attempts by the America's Carriers Telecommunications
Association to persuade lawmakers to regulate Internet telephony "are
designed to protect the economic self-interest of a narrow group of
companies at the cost of a variety of beneficial new services." 
International Data Corp. predicts that the customer base for Net-based
telephony will increase to 16 million users by the end of 1999, generating
an estimated $560 million.  Internet telephony brought in about $3.5
million in revenues last year.

Attorney General Janet Reno has told the FBI, CIA, and Commerce, Defense,
Energy, Transportation and Treasury Departments that she wants to create a
federal computer security emergency response unit to counter physical or
network attacks against the federal computer infrastructure.  (Computer
Industry Daily 6 Jun 96)  And some U.S. senators want to allow the FBI to
combine forces with the CIA and other intelligence agencies to deal with
international criminal and terrorist activity conducted on the Net.  Senator
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) says that "if we're going to live in this kind of world,
we're going to have to link the intelligence world with law enforcement."
Vanderbilt business professor Donna L. Hoffman, whose  work is focused on

Rejecting Clinton Administration arguments that law enforcement efforts
would be hampered by cryptography technology now based on a "key escrow"
system allowing the government to decode any electronic communications after
obtaining a court order, a report prepared for the National Research Council
of the National Academy of Sciences says that unbreakable cryptography would
actually help prevent crime by preventing criminals from intercepting
legitimate business transactions.  The report recommends dropping steep
export controls currently placed by the government on products using the
56-bit key Data Encryption Standard, which offers significantly greater
communications security than the 40-bit-key code that may be freely
exported.

<H3>FBI "DECENCY" INQUIRY CRITICIZED IN COMPUSERVE LAWSUIT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An FBI inquiry into citizens' accusations that CompuServe was violating the
Communications Decency Act has been harshly criticized by one of the three
judges hearing a suit brought by CompuServe and groups such as the American
Library Association and the American Civil Liberties Union.  The plaintiffs
are arguing that the law is unconstitutional because it constrains free
speech.  The FBI inquiry took place despite the fact that the government had
promised to refrain from investigating complaints about online "decency"
while the lawsuit was being heard.  The plaintiffs dismissed as a "semantic
fine quibble" the Bureau's assertion that it had conducted a "review" rather
than an "investigation."  The Communications Decency Act is intended to make
it a crime for "indecent" or "patently offensive" sexual material to be made
available to children over computer networks.

Jonathan Wallace, co-author of "Sex, Laws and Cyberspace," (Henry Holt,

content from the Internet:  "If Congress had taken a deep breath, it would
have realized the correct analogy for the Net is the printing press.  Every
computer can be used as a tool to create text or redistribute text created
by others.  The analogy is so exact that there's no justification to apply
laws that are different than those for the printing press.  What Congress
did instead was to treat the Net like broadcast TV -- a grievous mistake."
(Information Week 29 Apr 96 p12)  The Communications Decency Act is now
being challenged in court by the American Library Association, whose
legislative counsel Adam Eisgrau notes, "Fear plus ignorance shouldn't equal

Legislation recently signed into law by Georgia Governor Zell Miller is
aimed at preventing fraud in cyberspace, but critics say it could force
developers of World Wide Web pages to remove links to other pages.  The law
makes it a crime to "falsely identify" oneself on the Net, or to direct
people to someone else's computer without the other person's explicit
permission.  "The law is written so poorly, and it criminalizes things that
are a very basic way of operating on the Internet, that we're not sure how
it would be enforced," says the legal counsel for the Electronic Frontier

<H3>EXPANDED UNIVERSAL SERVICE DEBATED</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Participants in a May 1 Cato Institute policy forum debated whether the FCC
will expand the definition of universal service to include more advanced
services beyond voice-grade dialtone.  "The real motivations of some of
these policies, it seems to me, have very little to do with economics and
very little to do with telecommunications," says Cato's director of
telecommunications and technology studies.  "I think they're part of a wider
agenda which says, `Look, we can't have big social program bills any more.
God knows, look what happened to the health care program.  But we can tack
on social aspects to other bills, especially ones that are very widely
popular, like the Telecom bill.'  So it's sort of social policy by default."
A representative from Citizens for a Sound Economy was a little more
optimistic that market forces would prevail:  "The Telecommunications Act is
a lot like sausage made with very high quality meat and a certain amount of
fat.  What do you do with a sausage?  You put it over the fire and you give
it plenty of heat.  And if you do that, you burn off the fat.  The meat of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to allow for competition."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Following last Wednesday's 19-hour blackout of America Online on August 9th
because of system problems that developed during routine maintenance, AOL
chief executive Steve Case concluded that "the disruption caused by the
temporary unavailability of AOL illustrates more clearly than ever before
how important AOL has become in the daily lives of our members."  Case
said:  "We still have a long way to go to make AOL as reliable as must-have
utilities such as electricity and the telephone.  But that's what we intend
to do."  Members will get credit for the lost service, which, for
individuals who subscribe to AOL's standard billing plan, will amount to
about a 30-cent credit.

<H3>RULES FOR THE REVOLUTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Paradoxical but true:  the Net's promise as the site for a commercial
revolution is dependent upon the development of rules that fence some
territory in the electronic frontier, because "rules are critical to
commerce.  Without the order that rules create, business cannot be
conducted."  And so, despite the fact that the Net lacks any central
authority, "rules are emerging piecemeal, pulled and prodded by the often
conflicting interests of business, governmental agencies, and traditional
Net users," and involve three main areas:  property rights, means of
exchange, and enforcement.  In each case, "the door is open for private
companies to move directly into the rule-making business.  Although
companies cannot write the rules of intellectual property rights, they can
establish rule-bound areas of the Internet -- `virtual communities' in which
rules are enforced.  In those areas, companies can perform the functions
that governments are not yet capable of filling."  An example?  America
Online, which offers much more than a pathway to the Net;  it provides "a
well-regulated, well-maintained, user-friendly, secure community, thereby
assuring its content providers that their sales will be controlled,
identified and reimbursed."

The White House and the television broadcasting industry seem ready to
compromise on FCC Chairman Reed Hundt's crusade to have the industry
broadcast three hours of educational programming for children per week.
Deciding that they have lost the public relations war, the broadcasters will
apparently agree to offer the three hours, but the compromise with the White
House will give them more flexibility on what to count as educational
programming -- which might include public service announcements or perhaps
work with children in the community.

control as an easy way to navigate," says an industry publisher.  The

Central Television, the country's main government-owned network, was
scheduled to start showing vintage pre-1950s cartoons, dubbed into
Mandarin, beginning Saturday, International Children's Day.  Until a
decision by the United States on trade sanctions, the series and all other
US-imported programs will be banned from CCTV airwaves.

<H3>ATTEMPT TO BLOCK USE OF CANADIAN SATELLITES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
MCI Communications, AT&T and EchoStar Satellite all have filed additional
complaints this week with the FCC about proposals made by rivals
Tele-Communications Inc. and TelQuest Ventures that cite Ottawa's refusal to
allow American companies to beam their programs into the United States as
cause for the FCC to deny the application. (Toronto Financial Post 16 May 96
p3)  An ex-FCC official says the American regulator is unlikely to approve
the use of four Canadian satellites by US-based TelQuest Ventures and
Tele-Communications Inc. to beam signals to the American market unless
Canada's market is opened up to U.S. services.

The venerable British Broadcasting Corp. is getting a digital makeover --
with plans to spend more than $300 million on new subscription and
multimedia channels, on-demand news and sports, and an expanded presence on
the World Wide Web.  "The BBC is going through a cultural revolution," says
a media analyst at Goldman Sachs.  The company hopes that the new offerings
will help it rebuild a steadily dropping viewership, but some analysts say
that scenario is optimistic, given that it's unknown if viewers will be
willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for the set-top boxes required to
receive the new channels.

"The future of TV news is personalized -- it's giving users the ability to

vision, NBC is developing a "circle of cross promotion" for MSNBC, the new

It's a conscious way to use the brand power of a TV network to drive people
to become online users and the online service to become a regular part of

The race into space with direct broadcast satellite TV has created a

Telesat Canada's ambitious $1.6-billion satellite program has run into
fierce opposition from American broadcasters who want to stop competitors
from using Canadian satellites to beam into the lucrative U.S. market.  At
least five major direct-to-home companies (including AT&T, MCI, DirecTV,
Echostar Satellite and United States Satellite Broadcasting) want the
Federal Communications Commission to block rivals Tele-Communications Inc.
and Telquest Communications from using Telesat Canada satellites since
neither company can find space on American satellites.  Although the FCC has
no jurisdiction over Canadian satellites, the two companies still need FCC
"landing rights" licences.

<H3>MICROSOFT TARGETS LOCAL NEWS MARKETS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Microsoft's CityScape project is targeting traditional local news markets
where up till now city newspapers and magazines have dominated, offering
restaurant reviews, local event listings, etc.  The software company, which
envisions a nationwide network of online community guides, is making offers
to publishers across the country to provide news and information content in
return for a piece of the revenue pie.  Microsoft is in talks with a
half-dozen publications, and some are saying its terms are irresistible:
"The smart publishers are going to team up with Microsoft," says the CEO of
Media News Group.  "You can't ignore them.  If publishers won't play ball
with them, they'll do it on their own."  Knight Ridder's marketing VP has
another view, however:  "To make an alliance based on fear doesn't make any
sense.  I would look long and hard before I gave them any of our product."
Microsoft plans to launch CityScape in New York, San Francisco and San Diego
early next year, and eventually cover the rest of the country's large
markets.

<H3>PRIVACY VS. FREEDOM-OF-INFORMATION ON THE WEB</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $222 for its complete motor
vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site, prompting charges
of privacy violations from people who complained that he had invaded their
privacy.  The database allows anyone with an Oregon license plate number to
look up the vehicle owner's name, address, birthdate, driver's license
number, and title information.  The consultant's motive in posting the
information, which anyone can obtain for a fee by going to a state office,
was to improve public safety by allowing identification of reckless
drivers.  Oregon Governor John Kitzhaver says that instant access to motor
vehicle records over the Internet is different from information access
obtained by physically going to state offices and making a formal request
for information:  ``I am concerned that this ease of access to people's
addresses could be abused and present a threat to an individual's safety.''

An out-of-court settlement closes the lawsuit the Church of Scientology
brought against Netcom, an Internet services provider, after an individual
hostile to the church posted to a Netcom private bulletin board a document
for which the Church claimed to hold a copyright.  In late 1995 a federal
judge ruled that Netcom and the bulletin board operator did not themselves
violate the Church's copyright but may have contributed to the infringement
by failing to remove the documents once they were told that copyrighted
documents had been posted on their systems.  Netcom will now warn its
subscribers not to "unlawfully distribute the intellectual property of
others."  (Investor's Business Daily 6 Aug 96 A9)   Internet personality
Howard Rheingold says:  "I would hate to see Netcom to be put in the
position of having to police the material posted on its service.  You can
sue a publisher for libel but of course you shouldn't be able to sue the
bookstore."

<H3>WHO OWNS THE "IMAGE" OF A BUILDING?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a precedent-setting intellectual property dispute, the Rock & Roll Hall
of Fame & Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, is suing a photographer for
infringing its trademark by selling posters made from his photo of the
architecturally distinct museum.  Photographers, artists, filmmakers, and
publishers are concerned about the implications of allowing trademarks for
buildings, but lawyers for the museum argue:  "If we lose our rights on
posters, we'll lose it on T-shirts and hats."  Trademark protection
generally is intended to prevent someone from copying a building's
distinctive shape (such as that of the famous McDonald's golden arches).
The issue is whether the photographer's profits from the poster are due
mainly to his own creativity as a photographer or rather to the beauty and
fame of a building designed by others.

<H3>GOV'T TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION PLAN CRITICIZED</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After repealing in February the discredited 1965 Brooks Act, which dictated
that all computer purchases must be made through the General Services
Administration via a lengthy competitive process, President Clinton's new
plan for government technology acquisition goes too far in the other
direction, say some critics.  The new rules require big systems to be
dissected into small independent chunks, allowing easier upgrades to the
latest technology.  In addition, under the new rules agencies must analyze
and redesign operations before they invest in systems to automate them.
Senator William Cohen (Maine-D), who sponsored the legislation, estimates
the new system could save up to $175 billion over five years, but a former
CIO for Xerox, Kraft and General Foods disagrees:  "Treating each systems
acquisition as a separate solution has resulted in thousands of
unintegrated, hard-to-maintain, impossible-to-manage, contractor-dependent
islands of automation....  This act may succeed in eliminating much of the
existing regulatory chaos of acquisition only to become saddled with a more
costly chaos of operations."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For years, software to combat computer viruses has been a static product --
only as good as the last virus discovered.  Now IBM's AntiVirus system --
modeled on the human immune system -- scans for viruses continually, and if
an unfamiliar one is discovered, it's whisked off to IBM's research labs
where scientists "culture" it and use artificial intelligence programs to
concoct an antidote.  The system can "detect new viruses better than our
human experts," says the head of IBM's AntiVirus department.

California State University at Northridge reports a higher percentage (70%)
of students are passing math classes that incorporate Academic Systems'
algebra instruction programs.  This rate compares with a less than 50% pass
rate without the programs, and several other colleges have made similar
findings.  The Academic Systems product relies on CD-ROM software that's
linked to the instructor's PC, so the teacher can monitor each student's
progress and step in for individual assistance when needed.  "Before this
I've always felt I never met a technology that didn't ultimately just cost
me more money," says CSU Northridge's VP for academic affairs.

Microsoft is now targeting Intuit's lead in home banking, announcing new
initiatives to provide banks and service companies a secure way to process
online transactions.  Up until now, banks that use Intuit's Quicken or
Microsoft's Money programs use Intuit Services Corp. to process the
transactions.  Microsoft's new plan, called Open Financial Connectivity,
would allow banks to deal directly with Money users, without involving ISC
or Visa.  Intuit chairman Scott Cook discounts Microsoft's latest move,
saying he thinks banks would rather deal with one organization that provides
the software and the processing capability: "When you don't have a complete
solution you try to turn that negative into a positive.  Value in this
business comes not from the technology, but can customers actually use it."

Some industry observers are saying that Microsoft's two-year microchip
research project is bearing fruit, in the form of Talisman -- a chip that
delivers fast, realistic graphics using a $300 PC circuit board.  The new
chip will be marketed as a way of enabling PC owners to produce graphics
similar in quality to those produced by $50,000 Silicon Graphics
workstations, resulting in a proliferation of animated, online, storefront
and other applications.  One research industry president calls Talisman
"fabulous," and predicts it will inspire "killer" applications by 1998.

the development, which he sees as the end of the file-and-folder metaphor
for managing information:  "We're moving into a new world;  we now have a

everything is represented by a document."  Explorer 4.0 will be bundled into

<H3>MICROSOFT TARGETS LOCAL NEWS MARKETS</H3>

Microsoft's CityScape project is targeting traditional local news markets
where up till now city newspapers and magazines have dominated, offering
restaurant reviews, local event listings, etc.  The software company, which
envisions a nationwide network of online community guides, is making offers
to publishers across the country to provide news and information content in
return for a piece of the revenue pie.  Microsoft is in talks with a
half-dozen publications, and some are saying its terms are irresistible:
"The smart publishers are going to team up with Microsoft," says the CEO of
Media News Group.  "You can't ignore them.  If publishers won't play ball
with them, they'll do it on their own."  Knight Ridder's marketing VP has
another view, however:  "To make an alliance based on fear doesn't make any
sense.  I would look long and hard before I gave them any of our product."
Microsoft plans to launch CityScape in New York, San Francisco and San Diego
early next year, and eventually cover the rest of the country's large
markets.

<H3>BROWSING BEFORE YOU BUY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Customers frustrated at the "buy first, try later" marketing model for
computer software will welcome TestDrive's answer to their dilemma.  The
company uses a patented "shrink-wrap" technology that allows users to
download software from a publisher's electronic storefront on the Internet,
and use it free of charge for a period of time designated by the publisher.
Then you can either buy it, or TestDrive will automatically delete it from
your hard drive.  The service is a vast improvement over other "try first"
schemes such as demo versions, which tend to be too constrained to really
use, or samples with built-in time bombs that leave a jumble of useless
computer code cluttering up your hard drive.  With software makers
increasingly focusing on the Net as their distribution point of choice,
products such as TestDrive can ensure that you never leave the store with a
dud program again.

In an apparent paradox, Microsoft is pursuing an extensive

says a Dataquest analyst.  "They are creating a huge installed base of
customers."  In a country where copies of Chinese-version Windows sell for
about $5 before they're even officially released, Microsoft is looking to
the long term, figuring that with China's burgeoning technology needs,
they'll make their money back on sales of applications, upgrades and service
contracts.

that consumers can use to rent software by the hour or cruise the Internet.
The software programs, available for about $1 an hour, are not transferred
to the user's terminal -- instead they reside on the servers operated by the
user's Internet service.  Modem connections are too slow for games and other
software that relies on speed, but Wyse's senior VP thinks the concept has
merit:  "We're breaking new ground.  The economic model for this will get
worked out over the next few months."  A Zona Research analyst notes the
approach, if successful, could be emulated by other terminal makers:  "This
is something that will generate a lot of interest in the software
community."

<H3>CERT FOR A FEE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University has begun
offering its computer security services to subscribers who pay $25,000 a
year.  The CERT Affiliates Program will respond to break-ins, and provide
training and consulting on computer system security.  About 30 companies
have signed up so far, and CERT says it will continue to provide free but
limited incident response services to non-subscribers.

<H3>CERT IS NO SECURITY BLANKET FOR CORPORATE COMPUTERS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Companies are beginning to realize that they can't depend on outside help
when a computer security breach occurs, and are starting to staff insiders
to do combat with crackers.  The Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie Mellon University acknowledges that it can't possibly keep up with
the needs of the business community, and says it supports the development of
internal response teams.  Meanwhile, the trend is occurring in big
government, too, where many agencies are setting up their own teams, rather
than relying on the Energy Department's Techwatch service, which has handled
computer security for other government agencies for many years.  The
National Institute of Standards and Technology plans to request funding for
an incident-handling group that would provide services to other agencies on
a fee-for-service basis.

<H3>DEEP BLUE DEBRIEFING</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IBM's Deep Blue computer was programmed to evaluate a total of about 20
billion moves within the three-minute window allotted for each move in a
formal chess match.  That capability is enough to consider every possible
move and countermove 12 sequences ahead and selected lines of attack as much
as 30 moves beyond that.  The fact that this omniscience was not enough to
beat a mere human is "amazing," says one of Deep Blue's programmers.  The
lesson here, says another, is that chess masters such as Kasparov "are doing
some mysterious computation we can't figure out."  Still, the IBM team got
what it needed out of the match -- their goal has always been research to
show how parallel processing can be used for solving complex problems such
as airline scheduling or drug design, not to be world chess champions.
After all, this *is* IBM, says an IBM PR person.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Microsoft plans to release major upgrades of both Windows 95 and Windows NT
in late 1997 or early 1998, with the code-named Memphis and Cairo software
versions being the first step toward a standardized Windows for corporate
users.  The two programs will share the same basic, 32-bit kernel "around
1998."  But some analysts are skeptical about Microsoft's ability to bring
products out on time, while others point out that by 1998, the company will
need to begin launching a 64-bit version of its NT Server to work with
planned 64-bit Unix systems planned for that timeframe.  "The fact is there
will always be two versions of the kernel," says a Forrester Research
analyst.

Microsoft rolled out its Exchange Server software this past weekend in a
challenge to Lotus Notes' dominant position in the corporate groupware
market.  Exchange allows users to set up internal BBSs, set up meetings with
a group-scheduling feature and send e-mail with links to the Web.  Notes'
advantages include a feature that automatically synchronizes all changes
made to a document in a collaborative editing session.  Notes runs on a
variety of servers and operating systems while Exchange runs only on Windows
NT.  "I'm tired of shadowboxing," says Lotus's executive VP.  "We are going
to have a slugfest, and they are going to get their nose bloodied."

<H3>SEEING IS BELIEVING, IN VISUAL DATA</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Rather than staring at long columns of endless digits, phone companies are
now able to "visualize" that data in pictorial form, enabling them to make
better use of the gold mine of data that they collect each billing period.
Data visualization software developed by Lucent Technologies depicts
information about who calls whom, how long they're on the phone, and whether
the line is used for fax as well as voice communications.  By viewing a
graphic representation, companies will be able to discern previously obscure
patterns, enabling marketers to target high-volume callers, or those who
stay on the phone an hour or longer, for instance.

<H3>KNOWLEDGE -- THE CHIEF RESOURCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Knowledge-based manufacturing is finding its way into factories across the
country.  As raw materials and capital resources become more scarce, smart
companies are finding ways to replace costly physical assets -- labor,
materials, assembly lines -- with cheaper substitutes like knowledge-based
technologies.  "This is the kind of thinking that will make companies
successful in the 1990s," says the chairman of a Connecticut-based merchant
bank.  "Desktop manufacturing," which uses 3-D computer-aided design systems
to produce product prototypes within hours instead of weeks, is saving
Chrysler as much as $5 million a year, and has allowed Apple Computer to cut
its development costs by 50%.  Analysts predict that in the future, new
knowledge will continue to cut costs -- leading to composite materials that
can replace many of the raw materials currently used, and superconductivity
applications that will drive down the amount of energy needed to produce
goods.

<H3>PC WATCHDOG</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A computer specialist who grew tired of conventional home security systems
has developed an "open alarm system" built from interchangeable parts and
portable software.  It runs off an IBM-compatible PC and is programmed to
handle connections to just about any kind of sensor.  The CyberHouse
software package is adaptable, and its responses to security breaches
increase gradually with the number of sensors tripped, greatly reducing the
incidence of false alarms.  If a sensor is tripped outside the house,
floodlights come on in that area, but no siren goes off yet.  A few seconds
later, the PC turns on a series of lights in the house, as if someone were
walking from room to room.  Eventually the lights go off.  If, at that
point, one of the motion sensors or glass-break sensors or door-open sensors
goes off, a chime sounds in the bedroom, waking the homeowner.  If the
intrusion occurs during the day, you can program CyberHouse to call your
pager if one sensor goes off, and to call the police if two or more are
tripped.  If you're out of town, you can use a laptop and modem to monitor
activity, using the computer to turn lights, fans and sirens on to scare a
burglar away.  Another feature, due out in a month, will enable you to
capture an electronic photo from a security camera and transmit the image
via the modem.

<H3>IBM'S INFOMARKET TOLL BOOTH</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IBM has persuaded some 30 companies, including Eastman Kodak, Xerox,
Reuters, America Online and Yahoo!, to use its new infoMarket
electronic-content clearinghouse for displaying and distributing their
wares.  The infoMarket concept requires customers to pay for only what they
use, with the content providers controlling the information and setting
their own prices.  "Charging only for what you want is a very attractive
scheme," says one electronic database provider.  The system is based on
"Cryptolopes" -- secure electronic packaging that, when opened, bind the
user to a contractual agreement regarding the use of the content.  If the
content is distributed beyond that agreement, the technology can track its
usage and bill the original purchaser for subsequent viewings.  "It's a
complete break from all other ways information has been published on the Net
to date," says an industry consultant.  "It turns pass-along from a business
threat to a business opportunity."

moves along.  Another module, Physique, supplies even more detail for 3-D
figures, such as how the bicep would bulge when the arm was bent, etc.  The
whole thing's "pretty amazing," according to a Dataquest analyst.

<H3>IBM TO BUILD ULTRASUPERCOMPUTER</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
IBM has signed a $94-million contract with the U.S. government to build an
ultrasupercomputer - capable of handling 3-trillion operations per second
and retaining 2.5-trillion bytes of memory.  Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary
calls the DOE Option Blue a "dramatic leapfrog" over existing technologies.
Option Blue's main job will be to simulate the performance and deterioration
of the nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons, a function that once required
actual underground testing.  The U.S. is now observing a moratorium on such
testing, and will rely on electronic modeling instead.  Option Blue is the
second machine ordered by the Energy Department for use in simulated weapons
testing - Option Red, a smaller machine capable of handling 1.5-trillion
operations per second, was ordered from Intel Corp. last year and will be
installed at the Department's Sandia National Laboratory in December.

Intel's Pentium Pro microprocessor is fueling an invasion of the higher end
server market, as Compaq, Dell and other computer makers try their hand at
low-cost, high-performance servers.  On the lower end of the market, where
desktop computer makers have already made great inroads, Compaq's
200-megahertz, single-processor Pentium Pro server with 64 megabytes of
memory goes for $11,900, compared with Digital's $16,000 32-bit,
266-megahertz server with 64 megabytes of memory.  Compaq's top-of-the-line
Pentium Pro server is priced at $200,000, still cheaper than Digital's RISC
(reduced instruction set computer) servers that go for $250,000 and up.
"The price-performance ratio is a lot better with the new Pentium Pro," says
an analyst for Technology Business Research.  "All of a sudden, the RISC
makers are saying, `We've got to reduce prices.'"

<H3>"SECURITY IS NO. 1 PROBLEM" FOR UNIVERSITY COMPUTER SYSTEMS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
University computer systems administrators are spending more and more time
and resources on tracking computer vandals and cleaning up the messes they
leave.  "Security is the No. 1 problem I worry about," says a Clemson
University systems programmer.  "Universities face a particularly daunting
challenge, because we require openness," says a University of Maryland
computing administrator.  "As of this moment, the hackers are actually
winning the battle."  The problem could lead to more universities installing
corporate-like firewalls to foil crackers, such as the one recently added to
Cornell University's computer science department.  Cornell's computer
security policy is left up to individual departments -- there is no
university-wide firewall.  "It's politically impossible," says a Tufts
University professor.  "It's difficult to justify security measures, even if
they're obviously needed, because of the potential cost, and in particular
the cost of supporting such a measure."

<H3>FASTER MODEMS GET HO-HUM RESPONSE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The new state-of-the-art modems run at 33.6-Kbps, just 17% faster than their
28.8 cousins, and sales are slower than expected based on consumers' rush to
upgrade from 14.4 to 28.8.  Modem manufacturers say the technological limits
of standard telephone lines severely limit any more quantum leaps in
performance.  "The 33.6 modems are only a little bit faster, and most
manufacturers are pricing them competitively with the earlier models," says
a Dataquest analyst.  "Vendors have hit the ceiling on speed, so it's really
becoming a features war."  Accordingly, vendors, who are selling the new
devices for anywhere from $200 to $500, are adding things like voicemail
boxes, speakerphones and enhanced compression ratios to stand out in the
crowd.

<H3>DVORAK COULD BE ANSWER TO REPETITIVE STRESS INJURIES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Dvorak keyboard, developed in the 1930s by August Dvorak at the
University of Washington as an alternative to the slower-paced QWERTY
system, has never really caught on with typists or keyboard manufacturers,
despite its acknowledged superiority in typing speed.  That may change in
the future, however, as repetitive stress injuries continue to cripple
high-volume typists.  In recent tests at the University of Pittsburgh, users
of the Dvorak keyboard were able to reduce their tendon movement by 6% to
10%.  "That doesn't sound like much," says the researcher in charge of the
study, "but it can make a significant difference to people who do a lot of
typing."  A 1944 U.S. Navy study of typists who'd received Dvorak keyboard
training found that "the average time for the typists to reach their
Standard Keyboard net speed was 52 hours" and that the Dvorak typists
out-typed the QWERTY typists "by an average of 68% in accuracy and 74% in
net typing speed."

<H3>RECORDABLE CDS LEAVE FLOPPIES IN THE DUST</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
CD-recordable technology, or CD-R, is on the rise, thanks to lower prices
and a move toward multimedia presentations and large-scale data archiving.
Just six years ago, CD-recordable devices cost $100,000 and "were as big as
locomotives," says a VP at Meridian Data Inc.  Now they're just a little bit
bigger than a CD-ROM drive, and prices should drop to around $500 by year's
end.  "The floppy disk was good when computing was very data-intensive.  But
now that it's graphics-intensive, people need something like CD-R," says an
IDC-Link analyst.  "As soon as the 14-year-olds get a hold of it, it's going
to go through the roof," says a marketing manager at Adaptec.  Future uses
for CD-Rs include using them to record all your favorite songs on one disk,
or replacing your photo albums with a disk that holds all those pictures you
took with your digital camera.  And soon there'll be CD-Erasable, for when
you goof up.

A new type of modem that incorporates AT&T Paradyne's GlobeSpan technology

lines.  AT&T expects to have RADSL fully developed by November, and
manufacturers should be ready to sell the gadgetry to telephone companies
sometime in 1997.  And though the phone companies are touting the benefits
of ISDN now, the simplicity of RADSL technology has distinct advantages --
it doesn't require a separate phone line, nor does it burden telephone
company switching equipment.

In an effort to make liquid crystal displays readable from more angles and

Basel, Switzerland have developed a new method of liquid crystal patterning.
Current technology uses a velvet cloth to rub the polymer material that
encases the magnetic material on either side, thereby aligning the molecular
pattern of the liquid crystals.  The new method uses ultraviolet light
instead of velvet, varying the liquid crystals' angle of orientation, making
it easier to see from a wider range of viewpoints and lighting types.

floppy drive are over:  "We believe that the floppy disk is essentially
obsolete technology.  It isn't big enough to do anything with, and it's
very, very slow.  Software is all shipped on CD-ROM.  In fact, it's really
shipped on the hard drive.  Gateway 2000 Inc., for example, preconfigures
their machines with software right on the hard drive.  Microsoft Crop. has
announced that they're going to stop providing software on floppies.  I
think that's a huge signal.  But to make the Zip the floppy for the
multimedia age, we're going to have to do more than just sell the drive as
an external box.  We've got to get inside the computers."  The Zip drive,
which sells for $200, uses special removable disks that hold 100 megabytes
of data, compared with 1.4 megabytes on a conventional floppy.  Iomega's Jaz
drive stores one gigabyte on each disk.

Scotland may have an answer, though -- they're working on a negative
electrode that uses manganese in place of cobalt, reducing both costs and
toxicity, while maintaining performance.

Doctors and nurses at the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center will soon begin
using custom-made flat-panel PCs, complete with touch-sensitive displays and
virtual keyboards, to perform emergency or operating room functions, record
lab or pharmacy work, maintain patient records, or anything else that can be
done by computer.  The "point-of-care devices" were specially designed to
fit flush against the building's walls.  "We wanted something that's
nurse-proof.  It's going to get spilled on, left on for extended periods,
and heavily used," says the center's director of clinical informatics

<H3>WEATHER-WISE WINDSHIELD</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now there's a windshield that responds to weather conditions outside your
vehicle.  Cadillac's Rainsense system uses an infrared sensor to detect
precipitation on the windshield.  When the windshield is wet, the moisture
scatters the beam, activating the wiper, which is automatically adjusted for
the amount of rain or snow present.  A clear windshield bounces the beam
back to the sensor.

<H3>REMOTE REPAIR</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Very soon, heavy industrial manufacturing equipment may be linked via the
Internet for monitoring and repair services.  Each piece of equipment would
contain a built-in data recorder that would transmit information on
operating conditions to the original manufacturer, which could then use the
data to send a replacement part or even send a command that restarts the
device.  The idea is being championed by Richard Post, head of Applied
Science and Technology, who says all the hardware and software is available
now, and all that's missing is a security system that prohibits the
information flow from being reversed and used for sabotage or industrial
espionage.

<H3>NEW LCD DISPLAYS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Researchers at Kent State University's Liquid Crystal Institute are working
on a cheaper liquid-crystal display technology that produces clearer images
using less energy.  The new displays use a cholesteric liquid-crystal
material that reacts differently to light than the material used in
conventional displays.  Rather than twisting the light so it can pass
through a filter, one ray is reflected, and the other is transmitted --
electrifying the chemical turns it clear.  Because the cholesteric LCDs
reflect light without the need for polarizing filters, they can be bright
and legible without being backlit, thus saving energy.  The panels will be
able to run about 10 times longer on batteries than is possible with
conventional displays.

Despite lingering questions about the viability of CDMA (code division
multiple access) technology, AirTouch Communications has begun offering its
Powerband commercial digital cellular service in the Los Angeles area.
Meanwhile, Motorola has lined up contracts for CDMA networks in China, Peru
and Zambia, and PCS Primeco, a consortium of communications companies, will
launch a CDMA system later this year.  Some critics have accused Qualcomm,
which owns the rights to much of the CDMA technology, of overselling its
capabilities, which were initially touted at 20 times the capacity of
traditional analog systems.  AirTouch says actual increases are more like
nine-fold, but that's still an improvement over clogged analog systems.

<H3>LUCENT'S INFERNO SPARKS INTEREST</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
AT&T spin-off Lucent Technologies Inc. has unveiled a versatile new
networking software package called Inferno, designed to run over a variety
of networks, including the Internet, private data networks and
telecommunications networks.  The software consists of operating-system
software and a programming language called Limbo, which can be used by
programmers to make compatible software for a broad range of consumer
electronics devices.  "With Inferno, any device can communicate and share
information with any device over any network," says the president of Bell
Labs.  "Inferno is designed to take the chaos out of the electronic Tower of
Babel," says the president of Infonautics Consulting.  Inferno's versatility
puts it in direct competition with Sun Microsystems' Java programming
language, which also works across most platforms.  Inferno's advantage lies
in the inclusion of an operating system, which Java does not yet have, and
its lean design, requiring only one megabyte of memory to run, making it
suitable for low-cost hand-held devices.

Nintendo is hoping to reestablish its superiority in video games with its
new 64-bit microprocessor designed by Silicon Graphics.  The system

32-bit machines they sell, but making up their losses with royalties on
sales of games that run on them.

Compaq CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer is eyeing fast growing consumer markets, and

-- using computers to control air conditioning, heating and security
systems.  Compaq is already bankrolling startup Intellon Corp., which is
developing chips for controlling household appliances -- from stereos to
refrigerators -- using a PC.  The company is also working with Mattel's
Fisher Price unit to produce PC add-ons for tots, and an alliance with
Thomson Consumer Electronics will produce new hybrid computer/consumer
electronics products.

Sony Corp. is coming out with two new electronic devices that it hopes will

Walkman boosted the music business.  The company plans to debut later this
month a portable compact disk player and a personal display monitor that
users can wear on their heads while sitting on a plane or at the beach.  The
disk player must be hooked up to the personal display monitor or a regular
TV, and will run up to four hours on two lithium ion batteries.  The
personal display monitor is a head-mounted LCD screen with an in-the-ear
headphone that provides stereo sound, and must be used with a VCR or the
mobile disk player.  Both products will be marketed initially in Japan
before they're available on a wider basis.

<H3>NO SMOKE, BUT PLENTY OF MIRRORS</H3>

Texas Instruments' Digital Light Processing technology uses hinged aluminum
"micromirrors" -- one per pixel -- to reflect light through a color filter
and imaging lens, resulting in large (50-inches and up) TV screens that are

second, resulting in a constantly refreshed image with none of the
flickering quality of conventional CRT displays, and none of the dimness of
an LCD screen.  Projectavision plans to use the technology in a 60-inch
model that can be removed from its cabinet to beam images up to 200 inches
across.

currently use different, proprietary chips in their workstation designs. 
Compaq's latest move is expected to put pressure on other workstation
manufacturers to lower their prices and make machines that are easier to
integrate into office systems that already use Intel-based PCs.  The
company has not said how much these machines will cost.

Compaq Computer is taking a new approach to computer building, and saving

manufacturing style, the company now uses "cell manufacturing," where a

"It's like having a whole bunch of little factories on the factory floor,"
says Compaq's senior manager, who notes the new process means greater
accountability for defects and bolsters worker pride and incentives to
produce quality machines.  In addition, cell manufacturing has resulted in a
17% reduction in the cost of producing the machines, which is passed on to
customers, he says.

vision goes beyond the P-in-every-room scenario; he thinks one of the
biggest future opportunities for his company will be in "home automation"
-- using computers to control air conditioning, heating and security
systems.  Compaq is already bankrolling startup Intellon Corp., which is
developing chips for controlling household appliances -- from stereos to
refrigerators -- using a PC.  The company is also working with Mattel's
Fisher Price unit to produce PC add-ons for tots, and an alliance with
Thomson Consumer Electronics will produce new hybrid computer/consumer
electronics products.

<H3>NEW THEORIES ON PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPUTERS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Stanford University economist has some new ideas on why investment in
computers doesn't necessarily translate into identifiable economic growth.
The Stanford Computer Industry Project has interviewed more than 80
mid-level managers in large companies, and findings indicate several reasons
why effective use of technology lags well behind its invention:  1)
Information technology must be localized before it has its greatest impact,
and 2)  Technology often isn't used to lower costs, but to improve quality.
For instance, ATM machines allow people to bank around the clock, but don't
necessarily lower costs.  The good news, according to the director, is that
research suggests many companies haven't put technology to its fullest use,
which means potentially large benefits may still be reaped.

<H3>IT'S THE CUSTOMER, STUPID</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Companies are turning to customer-interaction software to transform their
customer service operations into a corporate asset.  The software is
designed to track each customer interaction, while in the process compiling
data that can help identify problems, improve products, and even generate
sales leads.  Customer interaction software "has become one of the hottest
areas" for large corporations, says the Gartner Group, and the surge of
customer service activity on the World Wide Web is driving sales of the
software from about $400 million last year to $3 billion by 2000, according
to a Hambrecht & Quist analyst.  "When all the Internet hype finally
settles, customer interaction and services will be the leading applications
on the Net," says an industry executive.

<H3>ATTORNEYS EYE PC SERVICE (OR LACK THEREOF)</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will customers start suing software companies for poor service?  The recent
lawsuit against Leading Edge Products by three PC owners who got tired of
getting the run-around from the company's customer support staff is a
harbinger of things to come, say some computer law attorneys.  "As more and
more people use these computers and they're less sophisticated about it,
vendors are just gong to have to be more responsive.  This case is the first
of its kind, but it's probably just the tip of the iceberg," says a lawyer
representing the plaintiffs.  Some analysts are calling for "PC lemon laws"
similar to those mandated for automobiles, but others warn that such laws
will only increase costs to consumers.  (Investor's Business Daily 19 Mar 96
A8)  Meanwhile, the average call to the Windows 95 help desk is 25 minutes,
double that of calls for Windows 3.1 problems.  The director of software
services at Dataquest says consumers simply expect too much from their
machines:  "Customers have to realize this is not a science.  This is art
supported by science."

<H3>NO HELP AT THE HELP DESK</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Three frustrated PC owners have filed a lawsuit in the New York Supreme
Court, charging that the technical support system at Leading Edge Products
was virtually worthless.  Callers allegedly got a busy signal or recorded
message when trying to reach the help desk, and on the rare occasions they
did make contact with a human, they were told the problem was the fault of
the software and hardware suppliers, not Leading Edge.  "Many computer
buyers are given a warranty and it turns out to be meaningless," says an
attorney representing the plaintiffs.

<H3>COMPAQ CUTS COSTS WITH TEAMWORK</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Compaq Computer is taking a new approach to computer building, and saving
money at the same time.  Instead of the traditional assembly line
manufacturing style, the company now uses "cell manufacturing," where a
group of four workers collaborate to build the entire machine from scratch.
"It's like having a whole bunch of little factories on the factory floor,"
says Compaq's senior manager, who notes the new process means greater
accountability for defects and bolsters worker pride and incentives to
produce quality machines.  In addition, cell manufacturing has resulted in a
17% reduction in the cost of producing the machines, which is passed on to
customers, he says.

<H3>KNOWLEDGE -- THE CHIEF RESOURCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Knowledge-based manufacturing is finding its way into factories across the
country.  As raw materials and capital resources become more scarce, smart
companies are finding ways to replace costly physical assets -- labor,
materials, assembly lines -- with cheaper substitutes like knowledge-based
technologies.  "This is the kind of thinking that will make companies
successful in the 1990s," says the chairman of a Connecticut-based merchant
bank.  "Desktop manufacturing," which uses 3-D computer-aided design systems
to produce product prototypes within hours instead of weeks, is saving
Chrysler as much as $5 million a year, and has allowed Apple Computer to cut
its development costs by 50%.  Analysts predict that in the future, new
knowledge will continue to cut costs -- leading to composite materials that
can replace many of the raw materials currently used, and superconductivity
applications that will drive down the amount of energy needed to produce
goods.

<H3>HELP WANTED:  CIOs WITH VISION</H3>

"Money is no object when it comes to finding a CIO with vision," says a
managing partner with an Atlanta headhunting firm.  "At forward-thinking
companies, if there's a $50,000 to $100,000 premium to get one of these
guys, they'll pay it."  Indeed, the top technology visionaries are raking in
$750,000 and up, says the president of an IS executive placement and
consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif.  A recent survey shows this level of
salary is certainly not the norm, however.  Information Week's May poll
shows more than half of the IS executives questioned earn no more than
$100,000, and a third report $75,000 or less.  "Business people hear about
Java and the Internet, and they want to know where these things fit into the
company," says a VP and CIO for Coty Inc.  "To be successful, you have to
have a strategy that can shepherd existing technology investments with
emerging technology."

promise but does it allow us to do a design cheaper or quicker?  The jury is

<H3>MORE COMPUTERS = MORE PAY?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A study by two professors at the Wharton School indicates an inverse
relationship between workers' and managers' use of computers and pay scales.
When managers' use of computers doubled, the workers' salaries increased by
3% annually.  Conversely, when employees' computer use doubled, managers'
pay rose by 3.5%.  The latter results suggest that when computers are
introduced into a company's operations, managers are freed from some types
of work and are able to take on more complicated duties, which often
increases their salaries.

<H3>VISA TEAMS WITH VERISIGN ON ENCRYPTED PAYMENT SYSTEM</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Visa International and VeriSign are launching a new system that will allow
Visa credit card users to make secure purchases over the Internet.  The new
system handles the transactions by allowing the would-be buyer to fill out a
three-part e-mail message containing a special decoder key, a description of
the merchandise to be purchased and cost, and a "digital certificate," which
contains the user's identity, partial credit card number and the bank that
issued the credit card.  The merchant uses the key to unlock the message,
and uses the other information to complete the transaction.  The merchant
never actually gets the full credit card number - rather, that part of the
transaction is handled by VeriSign.  "This is probably 100 times safer than
what's done off-line in the mail-order and telephone-order businesses," says
VeriSign's president.

<H3>FREQUENT-CUSTOMER CARDS FAVORED BY THE AFFLUENT</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Almost one out of two adults now or in the past have carried a punch card
for food other than coffee or ice cream;  about one of three have used cards
for carwashes;  and one in four for oil changes.  Marketing expert Pradeep
Rau says that "the motivation for the retailer is to build a relationship.
You tie a customer to a business so that you don't have as much uncertainty
about your customer base.  It makes business more predictable."  Another
motive is information:  one company has redeemed tens of thousands of
frequent-customer cards in order to build a database so it can advertise to
the customers most likely to respond to special offerings and new products.
And who are these people who carry frequent-customer cards?  The relatively
well-off.  Only one out of five adults with annual incomes under $15,000
carry them, contrasted with one out of two adults with annual incomes of
$50,000 or more.

<H3>BROWSING BEFORE YOU BUY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Customers frustrated at the "buy first, try later" marketing model for
computer software will welcome TestDrive's answer to their dilemma.  The
company uses a patented "shrink-wrap" technology that allows users to
download software from a publisher's electronic storefront on the Internet,
and use it free of charge for a period of time designated by the publisher.
Then you can either buy it, or TestDrive will automatically delete it from
your hard drive.  The service is a vast improvement over other "try first"
schemes such as demo versions, which tend to be too constrained to really
use, or samples with built-in time bombs that leave a jumble of useless
computer code cluttering up your hard drive.  With software makers
increasingly focusing on the Net as their distribution point of choice,
products such as TestDrive can ensure that you never leave the store with a
dud program again.

A managing director at investment firm Hambrecht & Quist predicts three

primarily "brochureware."  By next year, customers will be able to process
transactions, and by 1998, he says online commerce will fundamentally change
products, people and business practices.  He cites one company that's ahead
of the curve, pcOrder.com, that allows customers to configure and purchase
their computers online.  "That could change the way that industry makes
PCs," he notes.  The successful companies in the future will be those that
combine customer information, online purchasing transactions, and follow-up
service, all over the Web.  "The Internet is the first medium where you can
conduct the entire sales cycle in one place," says the head of an
interactive ad agency.  "That means that you need to get all your VPs --
sales, marketing, operations, and IT -- together on your online strategy."

<H3>GLEICK ON DIGITAL CASH AND NON-NETWORKED HOTDOGS</H3>

Writing about digital cash, Internet entrepreneur and author James Gleick
says that "as money enters a new age, so does counterfeiting.  The ultimate
threat is the perfect copy -- the virtual coin that proves mathematically
identical to the real thing.  If money is a string of bits, then someone,
somewhere, can make a perfect copy, and another and another.  An arms race
is already raging between those working to armor-plate digital cash with
doubly and triply secure cryptography and those working to pierce the armor.
Security experts assume that nefarious characters, in search of an unending
stream of money, are already investing millions in the next stages of
research and development."  His advice for the moment:  "For now, if it's
not too inconvenient, why not reach into your pocket for a few last
vestigial dollar bills, make sure you have exact change for the bus and buy
yourself a secret, non-networked hotdog."

IBM has created a Web site called World Avenue with the idea that merchants
will derive "cross traffic" from other stores at the cybermall, in the same

Hudson Bay department store chain are the first merchants, with about 20
more expected this fall.  An Express executive says the company is

<H3>ADS ON THE NET</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although online advertising represents only a tiny fraction of the
$125-billion U.S. advertising market, it has been growing rapidly, from (in
millions) $80M in '95, $343M in '96, and a projected $5,000M in 2000,
according to Jupiter Communications.  LA Times columnist Dan Akst says that
the nonprofit Audit Bureau of Circulations, a creature of the newspaper
industry, has the latest entry with a system called WebFacts which will
offer independent certification of Web counts just as it does newspaper
circulation.  In opposition to these developments is the work of a small
North Carolina company called PrivNet which has developed software that
blocks ads, blinking texts, Web graphics and Web "cookies" that track a
visitor's movements through a Web site.  < http://www.privnet.com > .
PrivNet's founder says that "if the advertisers want to pay for a
high-speed Net connection to my house, then I would take the ads, but right
now it is costing me money to look at their ads."  On the other side, a
Time Inc. new media editor says that the current ad model on the Web "is
non-intrusive and users understand there is an implicit bargain that ads
come with free content."

<H3>VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES FOR PRIVACY PROTECTION ON NET</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Interactive Services Association, which represents online information
services, and the Direct Marketing Association are proposing guidelines to
limit unwanted e-mail and direct-mail solicitations and to protect the
unauthorized collection of personal information.  Online solicitations would
be required to conform with the stated policies of the newsgroups or forums
on which they are posted, to disclose the identity of the distributors of
the solicitation, and to provide recipients a way of refusing to receive
solicitations.  Civil liberties and privacy groups say the proposals would
fail to check online abuses and that government regulation will be necessary
to protect individual privacy on the Internet.

Ever have trouble finding that can of cream of mushroom soup amidst the sea

are catching on, and Campbell's will be testing an electronic solution in 75
supermarkets this summer.  It will install an interactive touch-screen kiosk
in the middle of its display which will produce a map showing where the soup
you're hunting for is on the shelves.  The kiosk will also print recipes and
coupons to plug new products.  "The idea is to influence the sale right at
the point of decision," says a VP for production at Inter Media, the company
that conceived and developed the kiosk.  Initial testing shows it works --
over a 32-day test period, one kiosk was accessed 4,200 times, printed 700
coupons and produced 400 recipes.

Another example:  AT&T and Sprint both have bought the word "telephone" from

Proctor & Gamble recently joined the madding crowd of companies advertising
on the World Wide Web, but it cut a better deal than most when it told
Yahoo! it would pay only when a user actually used its ad to click to P&G's
own Web site.  Most companies pay based on the number of "eyes" that view
their ad, similar to the way TV and print advertising is priced.  "People
think Yahoo! has put a stake in the heart of the industry," by agreeing to
P&G's terms, says a VP at Lycos, which turned P&G down.  WebTrack
Information Services says only about 1% to 2% of Web ads are compelling
enough for viewers to want to investigate further.

<H3>WEB ADVERTISING IS HIT-AND-RUN</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Marketing expert Bill Cleary says that Web advertising is more like the
model of journal journalism than the model of traditional broadcast media
advertising.  "The ad agency of the future is going to function more like
CNN, deploying information in real time."  Journalist Peter Fabris describes
the Web as "a terrific medium to respond to breaking events like the
baseball strike," which inspired a Borden's Cracker Jack Web site featuring
fan reaction to the strike.  The site leveraged its baseball connection in
the old song "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," which mentions Cracker Jacks as
part of the baseball experience.  When the strike was over, the ad agency
soon had nothing new to add, so it took the site down.  The likely trend is
for Web advertising to be focused on quick-response, short-term marketing
initiatives.

Although "there are a lot of wealthy people in Africa," Sutton says that "in

at a postal telegraph office.  Our system would allow entrepreneurs all

machines...  The lines are very long,"  says a spokesman for the Zambian
embassy in Washington.  And smart cards provide valuable access to other
technological advances:  "Developing nations are using smart cards to
leapfrog the need to build telecommunications infrastructures," says a Visa

Telesat Canada's ambitious $1.6-billion satellite program has run into
fierce opposition from American broadcasters who want to stop competitors
from using Canadian satellites to beam into the lucrative U.S. market.  At
least five major direct-to-home companies (including AT&T, MCI, DirecTV,
Echostar Satellite and United States Satellite Broadcasting) want the
Federal Communications Commission to block rivals Tele-Communications Inc.
and Telquest Communications from using Telesat Canada satellites since
neither company can find space on American satellites.  Although the FCC has

<H3>INTERNET LONG-DISTANCE TO FIGHT PHONE FEES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
New Internet long-distance provider ShadowTel vowed to fight a Canadian
regulatory commission decision that it must pay contribution fees to phone
companies to help keep local rates low.  The company's position is that
rules for long-distance resellers should not apply to it because it uses
Internet technology from beginning to end.

<H3>ISLAM AND THE INTERNET</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Seven private Internet providers are now offering their services in Egypt,
and in Jordan an online service offers a forum where local residents can
talk to senior government officials;  however, a number of government
officials, religious conservatives, and intellectuals in those countries do
not wish to the public to be exposed by the Internet to pornographic
materials or subjected to an invasion of ideas that could threaten
political stability and undermine Islamic culture.  "If you have certain
values you don't want them to be neglected," says the secretary-general of
Egypt's Labor Party.  "Our society is Islamic, and we have our own values,
which may not be the same as the West."  The Monitor's new web site is at

<BLOCKQUOTE>
American trade negotiators gave in to Japan's insistence that the U.S.
cease trying to provide oversight of Japanese imports.  In any event, most
analysts think that such bilateral pacts are no longer relevant to the chip
industry, which economic forces have made more competitive (with countries
such as Taiwan and China now prominent in chip manufacture) and at the same
time more cooperative (with companies in various nations working together
to develop new chips).  In 1986 the trade agreement called for Japan to
import 20% of its chips;  now one-third of all its chip purchases are
imported.

In an apparent paradox, Microsoft is pursuing an extensive
technology-sharing strategy in China, a country known for its software
piracy problems.  The company is spending $2 million a year to train Chinese
technicians and programmers and is plowing millions more into a number of
cooperative arrangements with government ministries, local computer makers
and universities.  "The pirates are actually helping Microsoft greatly,"
says a Dataquest analyst.  "They are creating a huge installed base of
customers."  In a country where copies of Chinese-version Windows sell for
about $5 before they're even officially released, Microsoft is looking to
the long term, figuring that with China's burgeoning technology needs,
they'll make their money back on sales of applications, upgrades and service
contracts.

Several Taiwanese firms are gearing up to produce Macintosh clones, giving a
boost to Apple efforts to build market share.  Umax Group began shipping its
high-end clones this month, with systems based on the 150-MHz and 180-MHz
PowerPC chips, and IBM's recent agreement to license the Mac operating
system will allow it to sublicense MacOS to two Taiwanese system makers.
IBM doesn't plan to build the machines itself, but hopes that bundling the
Mac software with its PowerPC chip will encourage other component makers to
comply with the PowerPC platform, freeing clone makers from exclusive
reliance on Apple for parts.

that scenario is optimistic, given that it's unknown if viewers will be
willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for the set-top boxes required to
receive the new channels.

The Japanese company Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation (NTT) has
begun selling a two-chip set containing encryption technology that is far
more powerful than the "Clipper Chip" technology favored by the Clinton
Administration, which wants to make it possible for law enforcement agencies
to conduct wiretaps providing they have court-ordered warrants.  The NTT
chips have no such provision.   The chief executive of RSA Data Security, a
California company negotiating with NTT to resell the chips in the U.S.,
says:  "If there is anyone in the government who hasn't already seen the
writing on the wall, here it is."

"There are few matters that can slow or distort the emerging global
information society and create transnational frictions more than issues of
security, privacy and intellectual property, including copyrights," says the
report.  It calls for convening an international conference to coordinate
activities in cryptography and the protection of intellectual property, and
to discuss issues such as jurisdiction in cyberspace, and the importance of
maintaining linguistic and cultural diversity.

<H3>COMPUTER INDUSTRY SEEKS FREE TRADE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The computer industry is pushing for a broad, multilateral agreement on free
trade of computers and components, with the eventual goal of achieving zero
tariffs.  Japan already has zero tariffs and Europe's are fairly low at 4%,
but the big challenge is in countries such as Korea, Taiwan and the South
American countries that make up the Mercosur customs union, which maintain
high tariffs to keep U.S. products out.  Other industries are taking notes,

<H3>SEC WINS ORDER TO HALT FRAUDULENT SALE ON THE NET</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has won a temporary restraining
order against a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., man accused of fraudulently selling
promissory notes through an Internet bulletin board.  The SEC said the notes
falsely purported to be backed by U.S. government securities and were
supposedly guaranteed to earn tax-free annual returns of between 12% and
22%.

Researchers at the Institut fuer Physik in Basel, Switzerland are using a
model based on hydrodynamics to track the way that information cascades from
long to short timescales in financial markets.  The dissipation of
hydro-energy through a hierarchy of eddies of decreasing sizes mirrors the
actions of long-term foreign exchange traders and their influence on
short-term traders.  Based on the model, the scientists believe they have
found a conceptual framework for understanding the short-term dynamics of
speculative markets.

<H3>WIRED:  BUSINESS OR HOBBY?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Financial analysts are not of one mind when it comes to evaluating the
Initial Public Offering being made by Wired Ventures, the owner of Wired
magazine and various Internet-focused activities.  Although the valuation is
17.9 times the company's revenues for last year and the company continues to
post losses, Wired Ventures is felt by analyst Richard Shaffer to "have done
well at positioning itself in the middle of the Internet hype because it's
caused a lot of the Internet hype."  Another analyst, Tony Perkins, is more
skeptical:  "The bottom line is if you're doing $7.5 million in revenues and
you're losing $3.5 million, you're still pursuing a hobby, not a business."
Shaffer's view of that issue is that Wired "has real advertisers, real
paying subscribers, and an audience.  There is a real business there;  it
just doesn't happen to make money."

<H3>IDEAS FOR THIS YEAR'S $2000 IRA CONTRIBUTION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With April 15 approaching rapidly, many will face the annual decision of where to put their $2000 IRA contribution.  For those who like to manage their own money, the dividend re-investment plans (or DRIPs) offered by many companies provide an economical way to buy a relatively small number of shares (with DRIPs, the investor buys shares directly from the company, thus avoiding costly brokerage fees.)  George Sauter, who oversees Vanguard's 17 stock index funds, recommends investing in value oriented mutual funds.  Mr. Sauter points out that the fat dividend yields typical of value funds will outperform the capital gains of growth funds when sheltered from taxes, as is the case in an IRA.  Another strategy is to invest IRA money in high-yield bonds; such bonds normally generate high levels of taxable income but in an IRA, this problem disappears.

<H3>MAYBE THERE'S A FUEL CELL IN YOUR FUTURE</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Fuel cell technology has been called "the power technology for the next
century," and it certainly could go a long way toward solving the problems
of pollution and overdependence on fossil fuels.  The only problem is, it's
still very expensive.  Researchers in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Europe are
working to bring the costs down, and the first big market -- stationary
power for use by utilities, hospitals, etc. -- is about ready for testing.
Last month, the largest fuel cell ever built in the U.S. began supplying
power to 1,000 homes in Santa Clara, Calif., and Kaiser Permanente has
installed units in three of its California hospitals.  This month, Daimler
Benz unveiled a Mercedes minivan powered by a fuel cell, and the company
believes it may be able to begin limited production within 10 years.
Meanwhile, Toyota says "it won't be long" until it produces its own
fuel-cell-powered car, and in the U.S. the Big Three automakers are
developing fuel cells as part of their Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles.  "I've never been as confident as now that fuel cells are going to
make a breakthrough," says one engineer.

<H3>FUEL CELLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the most promising possibilities for replacing petroleum used for
transportation is fuel cells -- small modular devices that generate
electricity and heat with high efficiency and little pollution.  Running on
hydrogen converted from natural gas and other fuels, the cells were used by
NASA on space missions, and will soon be developed for use to power cars,
trucks, utilities, commercials buildings and industries.  "Domestic jobs
will be created if money that might have gone overseas to buy foreign oil
goes instead to manufacturing superefficient cars and trucks or domestic
biofuels."

<H3>NANOSYRINGES TAKE AIM AT ERRANT CELLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. have built
a hypodermic needle one-millionth of a hair's thickness and capable of
piercing the wall of a single cell to deliver the drug needed to combat a
particular disease.  The nanosyringe uses rings of amino acids that stack
and bind themselves into tiny tubes.  By varying the number and type of
amino acids, they can control the nanosyringe's diameter and other
properties so that, for instance, it could fit only into a cancer-cell or
bacteria.  These nanosyringes may be packed into a pill that's ingested, and
then travel through the blood stream until they find and bind into the cells
they're intended for.  "When we can target particular types of cells,
nanosyringes may be useful against fungal and bacterial infection," or as
cell-destroying agents for fighting cancer, says one of the researchers.

<H3>IMPLANTS THAT HEAL</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While surgical implants today are often rejected by human cells that fight
the invasive presence of a foreign object, researchers are now looking ways
to make implants that the body embraces and that can promote healing.
Scientists at the University of Washington are working on two projects --
one that focuses on the molecular-structure codes that trigger the body's
immune system reaction to foreign objects, and one that explores the
proteins that promote healing with the goal of incorporating them into
man-made prostheses.  The end result would be an implant that participated
actively in the healing process rather than triggering the growth of harmful
scar tissue.

ears, cartilage and other body tissues.  While some products are still in
the theoretical stage, a few, such as the skin, are already available on a
limited basis.  The tissues are grown from the living skin cells of infant
foreskins and then grafted onto the patient.  Polymer scaffolds are used to
shape the growing cells, and then degrade, leaving the newly grown
engineered-tissue product.  Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have even
formed a liver, and begun animal trials, but human trials are still a few

<H3>GRATEFUL MED ON THE INTERNET</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The National Library of Medicine's Grateful Med electronic retrieval service
is moving to the Internet, making the vast storehouse of electronic
databases available via the Web.  The service, dubbed Internet Grateful Med,
does not require users to have any special software, and will be priced per
character shipped, with a typical physician's search costing about $1.25.
Would-be users need to sign up for the service and receive a user-ID code
and a password.  < http://igm.nlm.nih.gov/ > or 800-638-8480.

<H3>PORTABLE HEALTH INSURANCE NOT A PANACEA</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The portable health insurance plan being debated by the senate will help address insurance problems faced by employees changing or losing jobs, but it will not solve everything.  While the bill makes it easier for a recently laid-off worker to get an individual policy, such policies could easily cost $600 per month for a family with any health risks.  On the positive side, the bill limits the insurers' practice of requiring a waiting period on pre-existing conditions when workers change jobs and health plans.

<H3>BREEDING GOATS TO PRODUCE DRUGS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. has hired Genzyme Transgenics Corp. to produce an
experimental anti-cancer drug.  But this time the drug won't be swirled
around in test tubes in a modern pharmaceutical facility.  Instead, it will
be a byproduct of the milk given by a genetically engineered goat named
Grace.  While still an embryo, scientists inserted a special gene into Grace
that can "piggyback" on the normal milk production mechanism, instructing
the goat's mammary glands to produce BR-96, a monoclonal antibody that
delivers chemotherapy drugs directly to cancer tumors, along with the milk.
Similar methods are being used to produce antithrombin III, an anticoagulant
made from blood plasma, and a drug for Gaucher disease, a debilitating
genetic disorder.  And statistically, mating the goats that produce the
drugs should produce 50% of offspring with similar capabilities.

<H3>RADIO IDENTIFICATION CHIPS COULD REPLACE SOME BAR CODES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chipmaker Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, has developed a "radio
identification" chip likely to replace the traditional product bar code for
such uses as remote tracking of shipping containers.  With support from the
Federal Aviation Agency, the company plans to develop an airline luggage
security system that would use the new chips to track every package on an
airplane, identify its owner, and call attention to possible bombs in
packages not properly identified.  The chips are expected to be produced
for less than $1 each.

<H3>A SEAT WITH A VIEW</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
British Airways is testing a video system made by Kansas-based
Puritan-Bennett Aero Systems that allows passengers sitting in non-window
seats to enjoy the view via a video screen on the seatback in front of them.
The system features both forward- and downward-facing cameras, and a more
advanced "World View" model will include a 180-degree panning device.  "We
see two positive elements," says a British Airways spokeswoman.  "The
passengers get an incredible view of the terrain, and there's also an added
safety factor because the flight crew can scan the underbelly as well as the
overwing and underwing areas."  A similar system made by Toulouse-based
Latecoere is being tested on Airbus A340 jetliners.  Depending on options
installed by the airline, passengers can switch back and forth between the
two views, or between a normal focus and a zoom shot.

Hotel experts say the next big thing in the industry will be the

the concept indicated that the food courts complement rather than compete
with a hotel's full-service restaurants.  The courts capture the business of
guests in a hurry, who would go to the nearest McDonald's rather than wait
in the hotel dining room.  The trend represents a large new market for fast

<H3>PAPERLESS LOANS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gone are the days of waiting a week or more for a car loan application
approval.  IBM, with some help from Chase Manhattan Automotive Finance
Corp., has developed an electronic loan application system that offers
one-minute turnaround on credit checking and loan approval.  So far, about
100 dealerships are pioneering the system beginning this month, and IBM
plans to expand the system to include other processes involved in auto
purchasing, such as the acquisition of auto and credit life insurance and
license plates.  (Information Week 1 Jul 96 p40)  Meanwhile, proponents of
Automatic Loan Machines, modeled on the ubiquitous ATM, say the ALM may soon
find its way into shopping malls, jewelry and furniture stores, and retail
outlets like Wal-Mart and Kmart.  Using an ALM, a customer can get an
unsecured loan of up to $10,000 in as little as 10 minutes, with the cash
deposited into a designated account, or issued on the spot as a certified
check.

automated driving could triple the number of cars the freeway could
comfortably handle.

budget;  and its population density.  "Any system of vouchers or fund caps
based on per pupil allotments (whether adjusted or not) fails to recognize
the premise behind the Universal Service Fund, that is, to equalize the
cost factors associated with providing services in low density, high cost
areas.  The FCC's goal should be to ensure equity of access, not parity in

<H3>SATELLITE TIME IS GETTING EXPENSIVE FOR SCHOOLS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Universities that transmit courses and other educational programs via
satellite are getting hit with charges of up to $1,000 per hour of live
transmission, almost double the cost two years ago, and some are resorting
to mailing out videotapes rather than pay for live shows.  "Since the
mid-'80s, there has been a 1,000% increase in satellite costs," says
Oklahoma State University's Marshall Allen.  Soaring prices have forced OSU
to drop two advanced placement courses it offered to high school students.
The problem stems from a shortage in satellites combined with more
competition in the spot market, where many educators buy their time.
Satellite brokers and consultants predict the shortage will ease over the
next few years as users migrate from analog transmission to digital, which
can be compressed to one-fourth the transponder space requirement of a
full-motion analog signal.  Meanwhile educators are looking to
videoconferencing over phone lines and eventually the Internet as lower-cost
alternatives.

<H3>"SECURITY IS NO. 1 PROBLEM" FOR UNIVERSITY COMPUTER SYSTEMS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
University computer systems administrators are spending more and more time
and resources on tracking computer vandals and cleaning up the messes they
leave.  "Security is the No. 1 problem I worry about," says a Clemson
University systems programmer.  "Universities face a particularly daunting
challenge, because we require openness," says a University of Maryland
computing administrator.  "As of this moment, the hackers are actually
winning the battle."  The problem could lead to more universities installing
corporate-like firewalls to foil crackers, such as the one recently added to
Cornell University's computer science department.  Cornell's computer
security policy is left up to individual departments -- there is no
university-wide firewall.  "It's politically impossible," says a Tufts
University professor.  "It's difficult to justify security measures, even if
they're obviously needed, because of the potential cost, and in particular
the cost of supporting such a measure."

<H3>EXPIRING EXPIRATION DATES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Those expiration dates on packages of perishable foods may soon be headed
for an IQ boost.  New "smart" labels developed by New Jersey-based Lifeline
Technologies change color to indicate when the food may have gone bad.  The
label tracks the conditions under which the food's been stored, so that if a
frozen product has thawed for any significant time period, the label would
indicate that, even though the expiration date might be weeks off.

<H3>ROLLING IN (AND OUT) A SATELLITE LOCATION</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One explanation for the developing trend of kiosk- and cart-selling at
shopping malls, a practice cultivated in about three-fourths of the nation's
malls, is that merchants are able to cut the expense and risk of starting a
retail operation or experimenting with a new concept.  Costs?  Monthly
rentals range from tens of thousands of dollars in the Christmas season to
as little as several hundred dollars in off-peak seasons.  When used by
existing retailers, the carts and kiosks allow for adjustments to seasonal
cycles, and provide two complementary streams of income.  Service providers
could use the same approach to respond to many different kinds of shrinking
and swelling client demands.

IBM has created a Web site called World Avenue with the idea that merchants
will derive "cross traffic" from other stores at the cybermall, in the same

Hudson Bay department store chain are the first merchants, with about 20
more expected this fall.  An Express executive says the company is
participating in World Avenue because its standalone Web site was not
getting sufficient traffic on its own.

shopping cart video display/scanners that would alert shoppers of special
offers and tally up what's in the cart for painless checkout.  Before
leaving the store, all you'd have to do is pass through a gate that makes
sure that everything in your cart has been scanned.  The total is added to

<H3>CUSTOM SHOES FIT THE BILL</H3>

Connecticut-based Custom Foot uses a computer, scanner and software to
provide buyers with custom-made shoes for just a little more than they'd pay
for off-the rack.  Customers place each foot on an electronic scanner, which
measures the foot in 14 different ways.  Then the sales person goes through
a series of questions and answers, clicking on a computer screen to select
shoe style, type and grade of leather, a color, an outsole, a lining, etc.
The software turns all the information into an electronic order (in Italian)
which is then zapped off to subcontractors in Milan, Florence and Ancona.
The shoes are ready for shipping within two to three weeks, priced between
$99 and $250.

Ever have trouble finding that can of cream of mushroom soup amidst the sea

are catching on, and Campbell's will be testing an electronic solution in 75
supermarkets this summer.  It will install an interactive touch-screen kiosk
in the middle of its display which will produce a map showing where the soup
you're hunting for is on the shelves.  The kiosk will also print recipes and
coupons to plug new products.  "The idea is to influence the sale right at
the point of decision," says a VP for production at Inter Media, the company
that conceived and developed the kiosk.  Initial testing shows it works --
over a 32-day test period, one kiosk was accessed 4,200 times, printed 700
coupons and produced 400 recipes.

<H3>FORGET THE BIG BOX -- JUST TELL ME WHAT TO BUY</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Big-box retailers are starting to feel the squeeze -- not only are consumers
shopping less this year than in the past; they're tiring of the "category
killer" approach to marketing.  Consumers say they've less time to shop,
much less drive long distances, park far away in oversized lots, and
negotiate cavernous stores for just a few items.  "What's so convenient
about offering 112 different kinds of something?" asks a VP at a real estate
investment firm.  "Retailers seem to think that if they get as much stuff as
possible into a store, they can call it convenient.  But shoppers resent
this.  `Just give me the best assortment of what you've got.'"  Hammacher
Schlemmer has taken the hint -- it focuses on a much smaller selection of
products it labels "The Best," which have been approved by the company's own
product testers, in effect saying, I've done the research and here's what I
recommend.

<H3>A Bad Credit Record Can Rule Out Auto Insurance</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under an increasingly common and controversial practice, many insurers are denying auto insurance coverage to those with bad credit histories. Insurers have discovered that credit blemishes are better predictors of future claims than even a bad driving record. Regulators and consumer activists charge that the use of credit reports disproportionately affects the poor. Heart-rending special cases fuel the controversy, such as an auto insurer rejecting coverage of a woman because she previously couldn't pay her newborn son's hospital bill. Backers of the credit check hold that the practice assures consistency in the decision making process.  Attempts to change state insurance laws to specifically ban the use of credit histories have largely been stymied by the industry's lobbying power coupled with objective studies supporting the validity of the practice.

<H3>NEW THEORIES ON PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPUTERS</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Stanford University economist has some new ideas on why investment in
computers doesn't necessarily translate into identifiable economic growth.
The Stanford Computer Industry Project has interviewed more than 80
mid-level managers in large companies, and findings indicate several reasons
why effective use of technology lags well behind its invention:  1)
Information technology must be localized before it has its greatest impact,
and 2)  Technology often isn't used to lower costs, but to improve quality.
For instance, ATM machines allow people to bank around the clock, but don't
necessarily lower costs.  The good news, according to the director, is that
research suggests many companies haven't put technology to its fullest use,
which means potentially large benefits may still be reaped.

<H3>VISA TEAMS WITH VERISIGN ON ENCRYPTED PAYMENT SYSTEM</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Visa International and VeriSign are launching a new system that will allow
Visa credit card users to make secure purchases over the Internet.  The new
system handles the transactions by allowing the would-be buyer to fill out a
three-part e-mail message containing a special decoder key, a description of
the merchandise to be purchased and cost, and a "digital certificate," which
contains the user's identity, partial credit card number and the bank that
issued the credit card.  The merchant uses the key to unlock the message,
and uses the other information to complete the transaction.  The merchant
never actually gets the full credit card number - rather, that part of the
transaction is handled by VeriSign.  "This is probably 100 times safer than
what's done off-line in the mail-order and telephone-order businesses," says
VeriSign's president.

<H3>PAPERLESS LOANS</H3>

Gone are the days of waiting a week or more for a car loan application
approval.  IBM, with some help from Chase Manhattan Automotive Finance
Corp., has developed an electronic loan application system that offers
one-minute turnaround on credit checking and loan approval.  So far, about
100 dealerships are pioneering the system beginning this month, and IBM
plans to expand the system to include other processes involved in auto
purchasing, such as the acquisition of auto and credit life insurance and
license plates.  (Information Week 1 Jul 96 p40)  Meanwhile, proponents of
Automatic Loan Machines, modeled on the ubiquitous ATM, say the ALM may soon
find its way into shopping malls, jewelry and furniture stores, and retail
outlets like Wal-Mart and Kmart.  Using an ALM, a customer can get an
unsecured loan of up to $10,000 in as little as 10 minutes, with the cash
deposited into a designated account, or issued on the spot as a certified
check.

When it comes to full-scale trials of smart card technology, developing
countries such as Zambia and Thailand are way ahead of the U.S.  The new
payment systems are finding greater acceptance in countries where
traditional banking practices are not so firmly entrenched.  "No one's in a
hurry for a new payment system here because our system already works," says
a U.S. programmer who designed Zambia's smart card system.  "Our country is
expanding, and we don't have enough banks and no automated teller
machines...  The lines are very long,"  says a spokesman for the Zambian
embassy in Washington.  And smart cards provide valuable access to other
technological advances:  "Developing nations are using smart cards to
leapfrog the need to build telecommunications infrastructures," says a Visa

<H3>GLEICK ON DIGITAL CASH AND NON-NETWORKED HOTDOGS</H3>

Writing about digital cash, Internet entrepreneur and author James Gleick
says that "as money enters a new age, so does counterfeiting.  The ultimate
threat is the perfect copy -- the virtual coin that proves mathematically
identical to the real thing.  If money is a string of bits, then someone,
somewhere, can make a perfect copy, and another and another.  An arms race
is already raging between those working to armor-plate digital cash with
doubly and triply secure cryptography and those working to pierce the armor.
Security experts assume that nefarious characters, in search of an unending
stream of money, are already investing millions in the next stages of
research and development."  His advice for the moment:  "For now, if it's
not too inconvenient, why not reach into your pocket for a few last
vestigial dollar bills, make sure you have exact change for the bus and buy
yourself a secret, non-networked hotdog."

<H3>SYSTEM TESTING BEGINS WHEN SYSTEM IS TESTED</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Complaining about the computer system that failed in the opening days of the
Olympics to provide timely and accurate information about competitive
events, journalists asked Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta Olympics
Organizing Committee, "Why wasn't the technology system tested?" Payne
replied that "there is no way to duplicate the totality of the Olympic
condition before the start of the games."

<H3>A COMPUTER IN EVERY WALLET, A MOUSE IN EVERY TABLE?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Researchers at IBM's Almaden, Calif. lab have come up with several ideas for
21st century information appliances, including a wallet with a pager sewn
into one side, plus a scanner and a tiny keyboard.  Add a 3-oz. battery
pack, and the wallet could double as a cell phone.  Meanwhile at the MIT
Media Lab, scientists have built a table that detects the position of your
hands in the air above it, allowing you to move objects on a computer screen
just by waving your hands around.  And at Xerox, they've come up with a desk
that's connected to cameras on the ceiling and can be used to automatically
transfer documents to the Net and organize them.

<H3>SOLAR POWER</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A chemistry professor at the University of Southern California has developed
a way to convert sunlight to energy patterned after the way that plants use
sunlight to convert carbon dioxide to cellulose.  "Chemophyll," as he calls
it, uses two thin layers of organic compounds on an ultrathin gold sheet to
produce an electrical current as the electrons, activated by the sun, flow
between the layers.  Chemophyll currently produces less power than a typical
silicon device, but with better materials, the process could generate higher
voltages, leading to cells that can act as catalysts to separate
clean-burning hydrogen from oxygen in sea water, for instance.

<H3>CARPAL TUNNEL GLOVES</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The latest fashion for those suffering from keyboard-related stress injuries
is fingerless spandex gloves with cushions inside that elevate the median
nerve at the base of the palm.  The Florida doctor who developed them claims
the SoftFlex Computer Glove reduces pain and swelling by cushioning the
palm, which otherwise would rest against a keyboard or mouse and cause pain.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Shortly after the McDonald's fast food chain began a $1 million-prize trivia
contest last month, answers started appearing on the Internet.  About a
dozen Web sites have sizable answer lists to the contest, for which prizes
are being redeemed through May.  One teenage McWebmeister explained:
''Everyone here in the office was playing the game. It was a big deal for
people to try to remember the answers.  The more I thought about it, the
more I thought what a great Web page, and the next thing I know I've got
hundreds of people coming to my page every day.''

<H3>DROWSY DRIVER'S WAKE-UP CALL</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A scientist at Carnegie Mellon University has developed a system for keeping
truck drivers awake and alert at the wheel.  Drowsy Driver uses a
combination of computerized sensors to detect driver fatigue (for instance,
if the vehicle is weaving or a driver's head is nodding).  The system then
issues a series of warnings, beginning with a gentle "Wake up," and
proceeding to annoying beeps and alarms, and finally to the scent of
peppermint spray (which has been shown in studies to have an alerting
effect).  A working model of the system will be tested next month.

<H3>VOCABULARY TEST</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Peter Lyman, the Librarian of the University of California-Berkeley notes a
linguistic paradox:  "We always talk about new technology using old
vocabulary.  'Electronic publishing', 'digital library', 'information
highway':  to our grandchildren these terms will probably sound as peculiar
as 'horseless carriage'."

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>TRENDS

ATTENTION WANDERING?  TRY OUTSOURCING
In past years, outsourcing of "non-core" activities was used mainly when
organizations were in trouble.  Now the trend is to use outsourcing as a
strategic management tool, and a Cooper & Lybrand study of 400 small firms
found that two-thirds were using it.   Another trend is to use a very
generous definition of the term "non-core"  -- and outsource not only
peripheral activities but many functions that are critical to the
organization's success.  Just because they're important to you doesn't mean
you're the one who should be doing them.  The head of one management
services company says:  "Anything that isn't revenue-generating should be
regarded as a distraction."  (Nation's Business Dec 96 p18)

YOUR WORLD WILL BE 90% DIFFERENT
Frank Ogden, who runs his trend-tracking business from a high-tech houseboat
in Vancouver, says that 90% of everything we'll interact with by the start
of the third millennium has not yet been developed, and that in the next
century virtual reality will affect humanity more profoundly than the
automobile did in this one.  Meanwhile, the world's body of knowledge is
doubling approximately every 18 months, with most of it coming from outside
North America, so rather than attempting to know everything, the better
strategy is to know how to access information efficiently.  And rather than
specializing in one area, the successful worker of the future should train
for a flexible attitude and an open mind.  (Forbes ASAP 4 Dec 95 p20)

HOW FAST DOES WORD TRAVEL?
Whereas word of mouth used to travel at a comparatively leisurely pace when
transmission systems were limited to print, telephone and fax, the advent of
e-mail has sped the process up considerably.  Some students at Middlebury
College found that the process depends on several factors:  how many people
initially and eventually receive the message;  how often people check their
e-mail;  and how many people are in the total population.  For example, with
a population of 1,600 users, each of whom checks e-mail twice a day, if one
person sends a message to two people, and half of those forward three
copies, in about six days half the population will have received the
original message.  (Inc. Technology No. 4 95 p24)

ONLINE SPORTS FANTASY
Fantasy sports, the pastime of fans who assemble their own "ultimate" teams
and spend hours analyzing player performance and crunching statistics, has
gone online.  An estimated 2- to 6-million people already participate in the
non-electronic games, but game developers see millions more flocking to such
sites as the ESPNet SportsZone Fantasy Football.  The fit is natural -- the
online population is already weighted toward young-to-middle-age males with
time and money on their hands, and while the four major sports leagues have
steered clear of fantasy gaming because of perceptions it constitutes
gambling, the potential revenue is enticing.  "If our concerns about
gambling can be substantially minimized, if not eliminated, we would be
interested in pursuing discussions," says the NBA's chief legal officer.
(Wall Street Journal 8 Dec 95 B8)

WHERE ARE THE TRAINERS WHEN YOU NEED THEM?
Everyone believes in training --  but somehow no one has time for it.  That
fact is bringing about an increasing interest in "just-in-time" training --
also called "performance support" -- as opposed to traditional
"just-in-case" training.  Training programs need to be relevant, and when
employees or their managers resist them, it's probably because the training
they're being offered is only marginally related to the real demands of
their jobs.  So now, increasingly, trainers are turning into performance
technologists, who facilitate the use of computer-based programs of very
small instructional modules delivered in incremental pieces just when the
worker is most motivated to learn them.  (Chris Lee & Ron Zemke, "No Time To
Train," Training Nov 95 p29)


 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>STRATEGIES

KNOW THYSELF IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE
Although business is often compared to war, it's not like war at all:
"Success in business derives from adding value of one's own, not diminishing
that of one's competitors, and it is based on distinctive capability, not
destructive capability."  In war, size and scale count for almost
everything, because they can be used to crush the enemy and to withstand the
enemy's assaults;  whereas in business, size and scale can often be a
disadvantage.  "The smallness of Switzerland, Sweden, and Singapore explains
why their military forces will never conquer the world.  But it is no
obstacle to their firms doing precisely that."  Competitive advantage in
business relies not on size but on a strong, distinctive sense of vision and
mission that come from within the organization and are built on its unique
capabilities.  (J.A. Kay, "Why Firms Succeed,"  Oxford University Press 1995)

QUICK DECISIONS MEAN SAFE DECISIONS
Marketing researcher Stephen Nowlis says that when shoppers are pressured
for time they will tend to purchase higher-quality brands and
top-of-the-line models with expanded features, rather than risk buying Brand
X -- and spend all the time it takes to make a Brand X decision. So when you
go holiday shopping, allow plenty of time (unless you're a top-of-the-line
kind of shopper anyway).  And if you're selling rather than buying?  If
you're managing a major brand, you should encourage consumers to make quick
decisions, and should avoid making frequent changes to packaging, pricing,
and ingredients or offering new product features that will slow up the
purchase.  Otherwise, you'll lose your natural advantage -- and encourage
the consumer to wonder whether Brand X isn't just as good as or even better
than yours.  But if you're managing Brand X?  Why, then -- slooowww down.
(S.M. Nowlis, "The Effect of Time Pressure on the Choice Between Brands That
Differ in Quality, Price, and Product," Marketing Letters 6:4 1995 p287)

YOU NEED TO SPEAK THE LOCAL LANGUAGE
There's no such thing as cookie-cutter leadership;  leadership needs to be
matched with and tailored to particular circumstances.  A study of how
organizational symbols functioned in corporate communications concludes that
leadership can be explained in terms of "symbolic behavior," and argues that
different organizational cultures "may be more or less receptive to one
style of leadership over another because of the values, beliefs, and norms
that are embedded within the culture."  And so if your organization is, for
example, a Mormon community, you need to understand that "the religious
culture of the surrounding community has an effect on the use and
effectiveness of the organization's symbols."  If you want to communicate,
you can't just speak the language;  you need to speak the dialect.  (M.A.
Vaughn, "Organizational Symbols,"  Management Communication Quarterly 9(2)
Nov 95 p219)

SPECIAL TEAMS:  GETTING AND KEEPING THE BEST PEOPLE
In reorganization projects, the biggest source of managerial conflict
involves the staffing of cross-functional teams, because executives have a
direct, personal interest in keeping their best people working at their
regular jobs -- even though they're just the ones needed on special teams.
One way to solve the problem is to make a rule requiring that every team
member proposed by a function head has to be accepted by all the other
function heads -- and no team member can be shifted off the project without
the unanimous consent of the executive group.  In addition to ensuring a
higher-powered team, the rule will force top managers to learn more about
the middle managers throughout the whole organization, not just their own
parts.   (Thomas M. Hout & John C. Carter, "Getting It Done:  New Roles For
Senior Executives,"  Harvard Business Review Nov/Dec 95 p133)


 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>INNOVATIONS

A SOFTWARE SYSTEM IS THE SUM OF ALL ITS LICENSED PARTS
Policy expert Richard Nelson of Columbia University says that software is a
"systems" technology and that almost all software programs involve a
combination of subprograms that fit together.  Since different parties tend
to hold rights on different parts of the system, putting together a
state-of-the-art system and using it may require a considerable deal of
licensing, which may be difficult to obtain.  Nelson says that the patent
codes of several other countries contain a provision for compulsory
licensing of technology when it is needed to enable a company to exploit own
invention, and he asks:  "Should something like this be considered in the
U.S.A.?"  (R.N. Nelson, "Why Should Managers Be Thinking About Technology
Policy?",  Strategic Management Journal v16 1995 p581)

MULTIPLEX IN THE SKY
Italy's Alitalia Airlines is using technology from Interactive Flight
Technologies to offer its passengers a choice of 30 in-flight movies.
Passengers will each have a personal screen, and will be able to start, stop
or pause movies at any time.  The system also offers casino-style gaming.
Alitalia has outfitted one jet with the new system and is conducing a 90-day
trial to see how passengers like it.  If the results are positive, the
company will equip seven more jets with the system.  (Investor's Business
Daily 6 Dec 95 A6)

NASAL NETWORK SNIFFS OUT INTRUDERS
Two Tufts University researchers are developing a sensing system to grant
access to a building or room based on a person's personal body odor.  The
system combines fiber-optic sensors and neural network software to identify
specific smells.  By analyzing the reaction of a bundle of 10 sensors, the
neural network software can sort out up to a million chemical compounds.  By
increasing the number of sensors and fine-tuning the dye that's used to
react to the chemical substances, the electronic sniffer may in the future
be able to pick up scents that no biological nose can detect.  (Business
Week 11 Dec 95 p115)

SPIN DOCTORS TACKLE BRAKE TECHNOLOGY
First came antilock brakes.  Now, a new technology can eliminate those
dangerous and heart-stopping spinouts so common in icy weather.  The
Electronic Stability Program will be standard equipment on next year's
top-of-the-line Mercedes models and can be purchased as an option for $1,000
to $2,000 on other models.  BMW and Cadillac will offer similar packages in
the next few years.  ESP improves on the hardware and software of antilock
brake systems by comparing where the driver wants to go with where the
vehicle is actually headed, and compensates by adjusting the powertrain and
the brake system accordingly.  Without the driver having to touch the brake
pedal, the ESP system uses automatic one-wheel braking to apply what
technicians call a corrective yaw torque.  The result is just the correct
amount of hydraulic pressure applied directly where it's needed most to
steer clear of treacherous skids.  (Popular Science Dec 95 p95)

CYBERTOGS
Clothing manufacturer ShieldWorks has a new twist on the latest fashion --
it makes clothing with built-in protection against harmful radiation emitted
by computer monitors, cellular phones and TVs.  One best-selling item is the
CyberCap, made from radio-frequency-reflecting material to shield your
brain.  The company also makes scarves, aprons, and eye masks.  <
http://www.poynter.org/ads/cybercap/ >  (Information Week 11 Dec 95 p10)

I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE -- AND I'M SCARED
In the wonderful old English movie called "The Man In The White Suit," a
young Alec Guinness plays a laboratory worker in a textile mill who invents
a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.  Is the young innovator
hailed as a genius?  No, he's reviled by both management and labor, because
his invention promises to destroy the whole textile business.  Yet who could
be surprised?  Fear of innovation is inevitable.  A new study by Sheffield
University and the London School of Economics finds that, although most
companies have been getting "leaner,"  very few are allowing significant
decision-making to be delegated below senior-management levels to middle
managers and young innovators.  If you're an innovator ... rent the movie.

<H2>Sticker Shock at the Gas Pump</H2>
<H3>By Tom Thurman</H3>
</CENTER>

April 30, 1996

<P><IMG SRC="gas1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=175 HSPACE=10>
The average price for a gallon of gas has risen 5 cents in the past two weeks and 14 cents in the past year to $1.36/gal..  While our friends in Washington blow a lot of smoke about who is responsible, the facts seem to be there really isn't anyone to blame. Basically, supply was low because the unusually cold winter prompted oil producers to make heating oil rather than gas.   Then, a spike in demand occurred when spring-happy drivers took to the highways.   Finally, reduced inventories at oil companies attempting to operate leanly and more meanly, meant that there was no buffer to counter the scissoring effect of low supply and high demand.  Prices went up.

<P>Government-bashers (namely Republicans) point to Clinton's 1993 tax hike on a gallon of gas, despite the fact that the tax increase went into effect long before the recent price rise.  Nevertheless, the Republicans are taking this opportunity to point out that any cut in the federal gas tax (at 18 cents per gallon after Clinton's 4-cent hike), would cut gas prices and so it must be good.  

<P>Californians have more right to be indignant about government regulation as their prices are about 20 cents above the national average.  Oil executives estimate that the California law mandating new "clean" gas adds 6 cents per gallon to the cost.  California's problems were exacerbated by problems at several California refineries.

<P>Corporation -bashers (namely Democrats) blame greedy oil companies.  But oil companies are not likely making windfall profits.  The world price of crude oil has risen 33% since February increasing the costs of producing a gallon of gas by about 14 cents -- more than the increase in gas prices.

<P>Then there's Clinton's much publicized attempt to lower prices by tapping the strategic petroleum reserve.  Before the recent price rise, Congress forced Clinton to sell 12 million barrels of reserve oil to pay for the administration's education programs.  Shortly after the price rise hit the media, Clinton decided to make the best of the situation and announced he was "ordering" the sale to help lower gas prices.  While brilliant politics, most analysts agree the sale is but a drop in the bucket and will do little to affect prices.  

<P>Analysts say that prices may go up some more then eventually come down in a month or two.  But these fluctuations will not happen because of anything anyone is doing or not doing but because of supply and demand.  The winners in all this (besides the press) may be the Iraqis.  Given high world oil prices, the UN may soon find the Iraqis have redeemed themselves enough to sell a few boatloads.

<H2>The Budget that Could</H2>
<H3>By Tom Thurman</H3>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
April 26, 1996

<P>At last, the boys from Washington have a budget.  After the dust settled, the new 1996 budget was $23 billion lower than that of 1995, reducing the deficit by almost 10%.  Clinton got about $5 billion returned to environment and educational programs in exchange for giving the Republicans cuts in other programs.  Both sides agree on two things -- that it was a tremendous bi-partisan achievement and that they, not the other guys, deserve re-election.

<P><IMG SRC="pl-clin1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>
The Republicans take much of the credit.  Their rabid single-mindedness defined big government and the associated budget deficit as <EM>the</EM> issue in 1995.  Yet without the "flexible" Mr. Clinton, a compromise would have been impossible.  Our man Clinton started his term by proposing a massive new government healthcare program and his 1996 budget was $7 billion higher than the prior year.  But in his 1996 State of the Union address, he didn't even blush when he announced that "the era of big government is over" -- as if he was waiting for everyone else to catch on.  Politician that he is, Clinton's moderating influence prevented the Republicans, in the throes of their vision, from further segregating America into the haves and the have-nots.  

<P>The dirty little secret is that all the brouhaha of the past six months is over only 15% of the total federal budget.  Any meaningful budget debate would have to include the huge and politically sensitive entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; yet these remain untouched.  As most pollsters give Clinton the political victory in the budget fight, the Republicans are wary of going another round during the election year.  In the end, both sides could get their wish and be re-elected as America may well prefer the balance (and the spectacle) of having a Democrat as president and a Republican congress.

<H2>EDGAR Comes of Age</H2>

Now investors have easy access to corporate information on virtually all companies traded on the U.S. Stock Exchanges.  As of Monday, May 6, the last and largest group of companies, including America Online and Sun Healthcare, are required to file their annual 10-K reports and other SEC documents electronically with the SEC's EDGAR system.  Using the world wide web or other electronic means, investors can get critical financial, marketing, and related corporate information on all of the companies in the stock market.

<P>While EDGAR is great for investors, many companies grumble that converting word processing documents to the standard ASCII format required by the SEC is time consuming.  Companies also complain that the plain-vanilla filings are not very attractive.  EDGAR was designed twelve years ago before many of the current capabilities of electronic publishing were created.

<P>Despite the complaints from the corporations, the ASCII format makes it easy to search the documents and distribute them on the World Wide Web to investors at a very low cost.  While the documents are not very pretty, they do contain much of the information found in the annual report.  The 10-K documents for example contain financials, management discussion, a description of the business and competitors, and other useful information.

<H2>Fidelity Magellan Underperforms</H2>
<H3>By Tom Thurman</H3>

May 2, 1996

<P><IMG SRC="fidel1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=175 HSPACE=10>
The three-year performance of Fidelity's Magellan Fund has dropped below that of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.  As many investors use three-year returns when comparing mutual funds, the drop past the S&P 500 milestone is expected to further erode investor enthusiasm for the once-stellar fund.

<P>In the three years through April 30, the S&P 500 gained 17.23% a year while Magellan gained 16.08% a year, according to Lipper Analytical.  The lower performance is attributable  largely to Magellan manager Jeffrey Vinik's recent defensive strategy of investing in bonds and cash rather than high-tech stocks.  Bonds and cash, now making up 35% of the Fund's portfolio, have lagged far behind the buoyant stock market.  Fidelity has suffered from lower returns in many of its largest funds, prompting investors to divert their regular contributions to competitors.  Some speculate that Mr. Vinik may not be managing the fund past the summer while Fidelity maintains that his job is not at risk.

<P>Mark Hulbert, who publishes a newsletter tracking performance of investment newsletters, holds that 80% of all money managers underperform the market in the long term.  This means whether an investor invests for himself or puts his money in an actively managed mutual fund, he has an 80% chance of underperforming something like the S&P 500 index.  This is partly because active money managers buy and sell frequently, incurring commission costs, capital gains liabilities, and other transaction costs.  Many now argue that most investors are better off putting their money in low-cost index funds, such as Vanguard's popular line.  Index funds attempt to mimic the performance of the market at the least possible cost rather than attempt to beat it.

<title>GCRL GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/gcrl.gif" align=left></h1>
<h1>GCRL GENERAL INFORMATION


	The <b>Gulf Coast Research Laboratory</b> (<b>GCRL</b>) was founded by the Mississippi Academy of Sciences in 1947 to provide teaching and research facilities in the marine sciences, which were then unavailable along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  An act of the Mississippi Legislature in 1950 (<a href="/gcrl/mosaic/mscode.html">Mississippi Code 37-101-21</a>) made GCRL a permanently funded Institution of Higher Learning of the State and a teaching affiliate of the state supported colleges and universities.  To achieve its chartered purpose GCRL has pursued research, education, and public service as its primary goals. <p>
	In 1989 the State Board of Institutions of Higher Learning transferred administration of GCRL to the <a href="/gcrl/mosaic/construction.html">University of Southern Mississippi</a> and incorporated its academic program into that of <a href="/gcrl/mosaic/cms.001.html">USM's Marine Sciences Department</a>, located at the Stennis Space Center.<p>

<h1>Workshop to identify potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico and to determine research needs for these species</h1><p>

It is the intent of this project to utilize existing archival collections as an initial step toward identifying potentially endangered species and to use these collection resources to document specific habitats and localities that are clearly in decline.  These habitats and localities may likely harbor other at-risk species whose biology is much more poorly known.  The workshop will also use other information resources that can be brought to bear on this difficult problem.  Results of these efforts will be summarized in the form of a workshop and accompanying documents, as well as presented in on-line information and database systems that will be needed to further address the status of species identified as potentially endangered or likely to be at risk in the future.  Such systems must be an integral part of efforts such as this, if a sufficiently broad segment of the public is to be provided with an awareness and understanding of the importance of such studies that provide for the maintenance of ecosystem health essential to the public welfare and the sustainability of commercial and recreational fisheries.<p><hr>

<h1>GCRL ACADEMIC PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h1>



<b>GCRL</b> conducts a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses in the marine sciences that provide students with the opportunity to engage in field studies.  Course work is directed at plants, animals, and their habitats, as well as study of physical and chemical processes that occur in the estuarine and nearshore environments of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  Although directed at the marine sciences, courses are not limited to students majoring in marine science.<p>

Classes are usually taught by <b>GCRL</b> staff scientists or by visiting scientists, with extensive field knowledge, as well as laboratory and classroom experience.  Classes are held during two summer sessions, each 5 weeks in duration.  Class sizes are typically small, with less than 15 students.

Courses are conducted on <b>GCRL</b>'s <a href="construction.html">Ocean Springs Campus</a>, but also make use of the <a href="construction.html">Marine Education Center</a> on the <a href="construction.html">Biloxi Campus</a> and the GCRL boat fleet, including the <a href="boats.001.html">R/V TOMMY MUNRO</a>, the <a href="hermes.html">HERMES</a>, and the <a href="demoran.html">BILL DEMORAN</a>.<p>

<title>Summer Overview 1993</title>
<h1>1993 GCRL Summer Program Overview</h1>

<h2>Enrollment figures</h2>
Our summer enrollment included 187 students (counted twice, if they took two classes) representing nine Mississippi colleges and universities, 14 out-of-state affiliated insitutions in eight states, and several other out-of-state schools.  Of these students, 36 were from Mississippi, 38 were from out-of-state affiliate institutions, and 70 were from other colleges and universities.  There were 93 graduate students and 51 undergraduates.  Students were able to earn up to 12 semester hours of credit during the two consecutive five-week terms.<p>

Some students worked on special topics or special problems in marine science under the direction of senior members of the GCRL faculty.  Resident faculty members who directed students in special topics or special problems were Dr. William Walker, Harriet Perry, Dr. Stuart Poss, Dr. William Hawkins, and Dr. Robin Overstreet.<p>

<h2>Summer session at GCRL</h2>
Courses offered during the summmer program are taught in an accellerated manner, as a full semester of work is compressed into five busy weeks.<p>

Student learning activities included lectures, hands-on laboratory sessions, some library research, and extensive field trips to collect and/or study animals, plants, and processes in the marine environment.<p>

Field trips, tailored to the requirements of each class, included trips to the barrier islands, Mississippi Sound, bays, salt marshes, bayous, and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as visits to public aquariums, marine parks, federal research centeres, and aquaculture farms.<p>


<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/ap1993d.gif"><b>Marine Science I: Oceanography</b><p>


Students immersed themselves in their subjects figuratively, and sometimes quite litterally, as they frequently found themselves in the marine waters collecting samples and observing the myriad of marine life.<p>

While physically demanding, students said the field trips aboard the Laboratory's research vesseslls into Mississippi Sound and the Gulf of Mexico to collect specimens were the highlights of their summer at GCRL.  During these trips, instructors continued to lecture, demonstrate, and expl.ain as the "great outdoors" is just a normal extension of the classroom at GCRL.  It is here that all the classroom lectures, laboratory exercies, and reading become focused.  consensus among the students was that it is primarily the emphasis that GCRL places on hands-on learning and field-oriented courses that influenced to participate in our summer program.  The GCRL curriculum is intended to complement, not to compete with academic program at the student's college or university.<p>

Class sessions were augmented by weekly evening seminars given by GCRL faculty and staff and visiting scientists from nearby federal laboratories, federal agencies, and other state institutions.  Students were encouraged to visit GCRL reserach laboratories and talk with members of the GCRL faculty regarding ongoing research. Students worked together as teams during laboratory sessions and field trips where close coordination is required.<p>

They learned to operate instrumentation, commonly used in the marine science field, including expendable bathythermographs, conductivity-temperature-depth profilers, refractometers, and assorted microscopes.<p>

They used gear such as trawls, seines, cast nets, plankton nets, grabs, corers and water samplers.<p>

Students became familiar with shipboard procedures, navigation instrumentation, and the heavy, powerful winches and cranes which handle the sampling gear.<p>

Many students collected marine animals and sea shells to take back to their schools.<p>

<h2>Independent Study</h2>

Some students elected to work on special topics in an area of mutual interest with a senior faculty member at GCRL.  As required by some of the regular classes, reports were prepared by the students on a chosen topic.  Preparation of a report provides the students with a modicum of knowledge concerning what will be expected of them as practicing professionals in marine science.<p>

Among the students who worked on special topics, Ginger Sams of Northeastern State University in Oklahoma learned histological techniques used for electron microscopy; Harry Cullom of Tennessee State University studied the areal and depth distribution of commercially-important rockfishes; and Kelly Prince of Southeast Missouri State University studied the effects of mineralization in the blue crab on the calcium concentration in closed culture systems.<p>

<h2>Minority scholarships</h2>

This summer the laboratory awarded four full scholarships funded by the National Science Foundation to minority students.<p>

Scholarship recipients were Sencery Rose of Tennessee Tech University, Jason McMiller of Delta State University, Harry Cullom, Jr. of Tennessee State University, and Ginger Sams of Northeastern State University, Oklahoma.<p>

Without exception, these students proved their academic mettle in earning among the highest scores recorded.  Dr. Thomas D. McIlwain, GCRL director, hopes that he will be again be able to obtain funds for 1994 to support this worthy effort.<p>

<h2>Teacher Enrichment</h2>

In addition to GCRL's regular academic summer program, Dr. Sharon Walker conducted two classes of a National Science Foundation supported course, Global Environmental Education, at the laboratory's J.L. Scott Marine Education Center.  Enrollment in the classes was open to selected middle school teachers from Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana.  Like other courses offered by GCRL, the classes were filled and there was a waiting list of applicants.<p>

Additionally, minority elementary and middle school teachers from around the country received scholarships to participate in a two-week introduction to oceanography and coastal processes funded by the Office of the Oceanographer of the Navy, in cooperation with GCRL and the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium.<p>

The 17 educators hailed from Alabama, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.  They were selected from the 15 chapters of the National Marine Educators Association.<p>

<h2>Leisure activities</h2>

Friendships developed among the students and an air of camaraderie prevailed during their relatively short stay at GCRL.<p>

Despite academic demands, students were able to find time for volleyball, basketball, fishing, snorkeling, hiking, swimming, and biking.  Students made weekend visits to Mobile, Alabama, New Orleans, Louisiana, the west Florida beaches, and to many sites and activities along the Mississippi's Gulf Coast.<p>

Occasionally students cooked and feasted on part of their biological samples, including tasty shrimp, crabs, and fish!<p>

A challenge volleyball match between the vigorous, youthful students and the more experienced, and somehwat less youthful GCRL faculty and staff was a close contest.<p>

<h2>Student evaluation</h2>

Student assessment of the couse content and teaching methods of the instructors were conducted at the end of each term for the purpose of strengthening any perceived weaknesses.  The students gave high marks to both content and instructors often bestowing many compliments.  The faculty were no less impressed with the quality of students that participated this summer.  A student survey was also conducted to solicit information for the purpose of planning the summer '94 course offerings and for future curriculum development.  A large majority of the students indicated that they will be back for the summer of 1994.<p>
