<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Alendronate is an aminobisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor
of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs
of pyrophosphate that bind to the hydroxyapatite found in bone. Alendronate
sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1- hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic
acid monosodium salt trihydrate. The empirical formula of alendronate sodium
is C4H12NNaO7P23H2O and its formula weight is 325.12. Alendronate sodium
is a white, crystalline, nonhygroscopic powder. It is soluble in water,
very slightly soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode
of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization
to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts
adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is
indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast
recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies
in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed
about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces.
Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats
and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the
alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated
in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate
must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed
resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate
treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone
is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these
remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean
oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.7% for doses ranging
from 5 to 40 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours
before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet
in men (0.59%) was similar to that in women (0.78%) when administered after
an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. </p>

<p>A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability
of alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability
was decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered
either 0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to
dosing 2 hours before eating. Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate
was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast.
Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced
bioavailability by approximately 60%. </p>

<p>In a trial in elderly patients given 5 mg of alendronate (n = 86) 30
minutes before breakfast, similar bone mineral density changes were noted
when compared to the pivotal trials, in which one of the treatment arms
was 5 mg alendronate administered 60 minutes before breakfast. </p>

<p>Distribution Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate
transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg IV administration
but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The
mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least
28 l in humans. Concentrations of drug in plasma following therapeutic
oral doses are too low (less than 5 ng/ml) for analytical detection. Protein
binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. </p>

<p>Metabolism There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals
or humans. Excretion Following a single IV dose of [14C]alendronate, approximately
50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and
little or no radioactivity was recovered in the feces. Following a single
10 mg IV dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/min, and systemic
clearance did not exceed 200 ml/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more
than 95% within 6 hours following IV administration. The terminal half-life
in humans is estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release
of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that
after 10 years of oral treatment with Alendronate (10 mg daily) the amount
of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of
that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. </p>

<p>Special Populations </p>

<p>Pediatric: Alendronate pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in
patients &lt;18 years of age. </p>

<p>Gender: Bioavailability and the fraction of an IV dose excreted in urine
were similar in men and women. Geriatric: Bioavailability and disposition
(urinary excretion) were similar in elderly (&amp;6265 years of age) and
younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p>Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
</p>

<p>Renal Insufficiency: Preclinical studies show that, in rats with kidney
failure, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen,
and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly
excreted in the urine. No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found
after 3 weeks dosing with cumulative IV doses of 35 mg/kg in young male
rats. Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that,
as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced
in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation
of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal
function. </p>

<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate
renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 ml/min). Alendronate
is not recommended for patients with more severe renal insufficiency (creatinine
clearance &lt;35 ml/min) due to lack of experience. </p>

<p>Hepatic Insufficiency: As there is evidence that alendronate is not
metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients
with hepatic insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is necessary. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions (also see PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS) Intravenous
ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate.
The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether
similar increases will occur in patients given oral H2-antagonists is unknown;
no other specific drug interaction studies were performed. </p>

<p>Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations likely will
interfere with absorption of alendronate (TABLE 1). </p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics </p>

<p>Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women Osteoporosis is characterized by
low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis
can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture
on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis,
indicative of vertebral fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and
females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone
turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone
formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis
in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of
the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to
age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the
risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately
40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related
fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes.
Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity,
disability, and mortality. </p>

<p>Alendronate is an aminobisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite
and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing
cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone
formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone
resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. Alendronate
thus reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover observed in postmenopausal
women to approximate more closely that in premenopausal women. </p>

<p>Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in
postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose- dependent
inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and
urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline
and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). </p>

<p>These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as
early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate
and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. </p>

<p>In long-term (two- or three-year) studies, Alendronate 10 mg/day reduced
urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, including deoxypyridinoline
and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen, by approximately 50-60%
to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. The
decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was
evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau
that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with Alendronate.
In addition, the markers of bone formation, serum osteocalcin and alkaline
phosphatase, were also reduced by approximately 50% and 25 to 30%, respectively,
to a plateau after 6 to 12 months. </p>

<p>These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-
state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate
deposited within bone. </p>

<p>As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions
in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following
treatment with Alendronate. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline
in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%)
were evident the first month after the initiation of Alendronate 10 mg,
but no further decreases were observed for the three-year duration of the
studies. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive
bone mineral balance due to Alendronate but also a decrease in renal phosphate
reabsorption. </p>

<p>Paget's disease Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal
disorder characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling.
Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new
bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture
by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure. </p>

<p>Clinical manifestations of Paget's disease range from no symptoms to
severe morbidity due to bone pain, bone deformity, pathological fractures,
and neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the
most frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an
objective measure of disease severity and response to therapy. </p>

<p>Alendronate decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads
to an indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, Alendronate
40 mg once daily for six months produced highly significant decreases in
serum alkaline phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen
degradation. As a result of the inhibition of bone resorption, Alendronate
induced generally mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum
calcium phosphate. </p>

<p>Clinical Studies </p>

<p>Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women The efficacy of Alendronate 10
mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis
(lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations
below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical studies of two or three years' duration. These included two large
three-year, multicenter studies of virtually identical design, one performed
in the United States (U.S.) and the other in 15 different countries (Multinational),
which enrolled 478 and 516 patients, respectively. </p>

<p>Highly significant increases inn BMD, relative both to baseline and
placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who
received Alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly
in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine
and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases
in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the
three years of treatment. </p>

<p>Thus, Alendronate appears to reverse the progression of osteoporosis.
Alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate
of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard
deviations below the premenopausal mean). </p>

<p>To assess the effects of Alendronate on vertebral fracture incidence,
the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared
placebo to the pooled dosage groups of Alendronate (5 or 10 mg for three
years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was
a significant 48% reduction in the proportion of patients treated with
Alendronate experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to
those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%). A reduction in the total number
of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed.
In the pooled analysis, patients who received Alendronate had a statistically
significant smaller loss in stature than those who received placebo (-3.0
mm vs. -4.6 mm). Furthermore, of patients who sustained any vertebral fracture,
those treated with Alendronate experienced less height loss (5.9 mm vs.
23.3 mm) due to a reduction in both the number and severity of fractures.
</p>

<p>The effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed in a study that included
patients treated with Alendronate for one or two years. Following discontinuation,
neither further increases in bone mass nor accelerated rate of bone loss
was noted. These data indicate that continuous daily treatment with Alendronate
is required to maintain the effect of the drug. Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal
patients with osteoporosis treated with Alendronate at doses ranging from
1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization
and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative
to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased
bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate
treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with
Alendronate is of normal quality. </p>

<p>Paget's disease The efficacy of Alendronate 40 mg once daily for six
months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and
female patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease (alkaline phosphatase
at least twice the upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled multinational
study and a U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day.
</p>

<p>At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated
with Alendronate was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate
and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients.
Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase
or decrease from baseline &amp;6260%) occurred in approximately 85% of
patients treated with Alendronate in the combined studies vs. 30% in the
etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. Alendronate was similarly
effective irrespective of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates,
or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice
the upper limit of normal). </p>

<p>Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget's disease treated
with Alendronate 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for osteoporosis
(see Clinical Studies, Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women), Alendronate
did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of
bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment
with Alendronate, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized.
Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during
treatment with Alendronate is of normal quality. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY The relative inhibitory activities on bone resorption
and mineralization of alendronate and etidronate were compared in the Schenk
assay, which is based on histological examination of the epiphyses of growing
rats. In this assay, the lowest dose of alendronate that interfered with
bone mineralization (leading to osteomalacia) was 6000-fold the antiresorptive
dose. The corresponding ratio for etidronate was one to one. These data
suggest that alendronate administered in therapeutic doses is highly unlikely
to induce osteomalacia. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Alendronate is indicated for the treatment of: Osteoporosis in postmenopausal
women Osteoporosis may be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass (for
example, at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) or
by the presence or history of osteoporotic fracture. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Pharmacodynamics.) </p>

<p>Paget's disease of bone </p>

<p>Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone having
alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those
who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their
disease. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any component of this product Hypocalcemia (see
PRECAUTIONS, General) 
<br><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General Alendronate is not recommended for patients with renal insufficiency
(creatinine clearance &lt;35 ml/min). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>As with other bisphosphonates, caution should be used when Alendronate
is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such
as dysphagia, symptomatic esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or
ulcers. </p>

<p>Causes of osteoporosis other than estrogen deficiency and aging should
be considered. </p>

<p>Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with Alendronate
(see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Other disturbances of mineral metabolism (such
as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. Presumably
due to the effects of Alendronate on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic
decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients
with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may
be greatly elevated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be ensured
to provide for these enhanced needs. </p>

<p>Information for Patients Patients should be instructed that the expected
benefits of Alendronate may only be obtained when each tablet is taken
with plain water the first thing in the morning at least 30 minutes before
the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. </p>

<p>Patients should also be instructed that waiting longer than 30 minutes
will improve the absorption of Alendronate. Even dosing with orange juice
or coffee has been shown to markedly reduce the absorption of Alendronate
(see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Absorption). Patients should
be instructed to take Alendronate with a full glass of water (6-8 oz.)
and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes following administration to
facilitate delivery to the stomach and reduce the potential for esophageal
irritation. </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin
D, if daily dietary intake is inadequate. Weight-bearing exercise should
be considered along with the modification of certain behavioral factors,
such as excessive cigarette smoking, and/or alcohol consumption, if these
factors exist. </p>

<p>Physicians should instruct their patients to read the patient package
insert before starting therapy with Alendronate and to reread it each time
the prescription is renewed. </p>

<p><a name="Drug Interactions"></a><b>Drug Interactions </b></p>

<p>(also see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions)
</p>

<p>Estrogen A small number of postmenopausal women in the osteoporosis
trials received estrogen (intravaginal, transdermal, or oral) while taking
Alendronate. No adverse experiences attributable to their concomitant use
were identified. </p>

<p>Concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy and Alendronate in the
treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is not recommended because
of lack of clinical experience. </p>

<p>Calcium Supplements/Antacids It is unlikely that calcium supplements,
antacids, and some oral medications will interfere with absorption of Alendronate.
Therefore, patients must wait at least one-half hour after taking Alendronate
before taking any other drug. NSAIDS/Aspirin The risk of upper gastrointestinal
adverse events associated with NSAIDS does not appear to be greater with
concomitant treatment with Alendronate 10 mg/day. However, in patients
receiving concomitant therapy with doses of Alendronate greater than 10
mg/day and aspirin-containing compounds, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal
adverse events was increased. </p>

<p>Other Although specific interaction studies were not performed, Alendronate
10 mg/day was used in postmenopausal osteoporosis studies with a wide range
of commonly prescribed drugs without evidence of clinical adverse interactions.
These included antacids, anticholinergics, aspirin-containing compounds,
benzodiazepines, beta- blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, gastric
acid secretion inhibitors, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDS), sedative hypnotics, thiazides, thyroid hormones, vasoconstrictors,
and vasodilators. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Harderian gland
(a retroorbital gland not present in human) adenomas were increased in
high-dose female mice (p=0.003) in a 92-week carcinogenicity study at doses
of alendronate of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (males) or 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day
(females). These doses are equivalent to 0.5 to 4 times the 10 mg human
dose based on surface area, mg/m2. </p>

<p>Parafollicular cell (thyroid) adenomas were increased in high-dose male
rats (p=0.003) in a 2-year carcinogenicity study at doses of 1 and 3.75
mg/kg body weight. These doses are equivalent to 1 and 3 times the 10 mg
human dose based on body surface area. </p>

<p>Alendronate was not genotoxic in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis
assay with and without metabolic activation, in an in vitro mammalian cell
mutagenesis assay, in an in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes,
and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mice. In an in vitro
chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, alendronate
was weakly positive at concentrations &amp;625 mM in the presence of cytotoxicity.
</p>

<p>Alendronate had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at oral
doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (four times the 10 mg human dose based on surface
area). </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C: Reproduction studies in rats showed decreased
postimplantation survival at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain
in normal pups at 1 mg/kg/day. Sites of incomplete fetal ossification were
statistically significantly increased in rats beginning at 10 mg/kg/day
in vertebral (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), skull, and sternebral bones.
The above doses ranged from 1 times (1 mg/kg) to 9 times (10 mg/kg) the
10 mg human dose based on surface area, mg/m2. No similar fetal effects
were seen when pregnant rabbits were treated at doses up to 35 mg/kg/day
(50 times the 10 mg human dose based on surface area, mg/m2). </p>

<p>Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats at 15 mg/kg/day
(13 times the 10 mg human dose based on surface area) resulting in delays
and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia
occurred in rats at doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the recommended
human dose) when rats were treated from before mating through gestation.
Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) occurred in the female rats treated
with 15 mg/kg/day for varying periods of time ranging from treatment only
during pre-mating to treatment only during early, middle, or late gestation;
these deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment.
Calcium supplementation either in the drinking water or by minipump could
not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent maternal and neonatal deaths
due to delays in delivery; calcium supplementation IV prevented maternal,
but not fetal deaths. There are no studies in pregnant women. Alendronate
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to the mother and fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers Alendronate was secreted in the milk of rats after an
IV dose. It is not known whether alendronate is excreted in human milk.
Alendronate has not been studied in nursing women and should not be given
to them. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not
been established. </p>

<p>Use in the Elderly Of the patients receiving Alendronate in the two
large osteoporosis studies and Paget's disease studies (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Clinical Studies), 45% and 70%, respectively, were 65 years of age or over.
No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these
patients and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals
cannot be ruled out. Use in Men Safety and effectiveness in male osteoporosis
have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse experiences associated with Alendronate usually have been mild,
and generally have not required discontinuation of therapy. Osteoporosis
in postmenopausal women Alendronate has been evaluated for safety in clinical
studies in more than 1800 postmenopausal patients. In two large, three-year,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and
Multinational), discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse
experience occurred in 4.1% of 196 patients treated with Alendronate 10
mg/day and 6.0% of 397 patients treated with placebo. Adverse experiences
reported by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug
related in &amp;621% of patients treated with either Alendronate 10 mg/day
or placebo are presented in the following table (TABLE 2). </p>

**Considered possibly, probably, or definitively drug related as 
assessed by the investigators </pre>

<p>Rarely, rash and erythema have occurred. </p>

<p>One patient treated with Alendronate (10 mg/day), who had a history
of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant
aspirin developed an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was
considered drug related. Aspirin and Alendronate were discontinued and
the patient recovered. </p>

<p>The adverse experience profile was similar for the 401 patients treated
with either 5 or 20 mg doses of Alendronate in the United States and Multinational
studies. </p>

<p>Paget's disease In clinical studies (osteoporosis and Paget's disease),
adverse experiences reported in 175 patients taking Alendronate 40 mg/day
for 3-12 months were similar to those in postmenopausal women treated with
Alendronate 10 mg/day. However, there was an apparent increased incidence
of upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences in patients taking Alendronate
40 mg/day (17.7% Alendronate vs. 10.2% placebo. One case of esophagitis
and two cases of gastritis resulted in discontinuation of treatment. </p>

<p>Additionally, musculoskeletal pain, which has been described in patients
with Paget's disease treated with other bisphosphonates, was reported by
the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in
approximately 6% of patients treated with Alendronate 40 mg/day versus
approximately 1% of patients treated with placebo, but rarely resulted
in discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical
adverse experience occurred in 6.4% of patients with Paget's disease treated
with Alendronate 40 mg/day and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo. </p>

<p>Laboratory Test Findings In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies,
asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate
were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking
Alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However,
the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to &lt;8.0 mg/dl (2.0 mM)
and serum phosphate to &amp;602.0 mg/dl (0.65 mM) were similar in both
treatment groups. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Significant lethality after single oral doses was seen in female rats
and mice at 552 mg/kg (3256 mg/m2) and 966 mg/kg (2898 mg/m2), respectively.
In males, these values were slightly higher, 626 and 1280 mg/kg, respectively.
There was no lethality in dogs at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (4000 mg/m2).
</p>

<p>No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage
with Alendronate. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal
adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis,
or ulcer, may result from oral overdosage. Administration of milk or antacids,
to bind alendronate, should be considered. </p>

<p>Dialysis would not be beneficial. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Alendronate must be taken at least one-half hour before the first food,
beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only (see PRECAUTIONS,
Information for Patients). Other beverages (including mineral water), food,
and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of Alendronate
(see PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS). Waiting longer than 30 minutes before
eating will improve the absorption of Alendronate. Waiting less than 30
minutes, or taking Alendronate with food, beverages (other than plain water)
or other medications will lessen the effect of Alendronate by decreasing
its absorption into the body. To facilitate delivery to the stomach, Alendronate
should be taken with a full glass of water (6-8 oz.) and patients should
avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes thereafter (see PRECAUTIONS, Information
for Patients). Patients with osteoporosis or Paget's disease should receive
supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if dietary intake is inadequate (see
PRECAUTIONS, General). </p>

<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with
mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 ml/min).
Alendronate is not recommended for patients with more severe renal insufficiency
(creatinine clearance &lt;35 ml/min) due to lack of experience. </p>

<p>Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women The recommended dosage is 10 mg
once a day. </p>

<p>Safety of treatment with Alendronate for longer than four years has
not been studied; extension studies are ongoing. </p>

<p>Paget's disease of bone The recommended treatment regimen is 40 mg once
a day for six months. </p>

<p>Retreatment of Paget's disease In clinical studies in which patients
were followed every six months, relapses during the 12 months following
therapy occurred in 9% (3 out of 32) of patients who responded to treatment
with Alendronate. Specific retreatment data are not available, although
responses to Alendronate were similar in patients who had received prior
bisphosphonate therapy and those who had not. Retreatment with Alendronate
may be considered, following a six-month post-treatment evaluation period
in patients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase,
which should be measured periodically. Retreatment may also be considered
in those who failed to normalize their serum alkaline phosphatase. </p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 

</b> <p>

WARNING 

 
<p>
THE USE OF MEDROXYPROGESTERONE DURING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS

OF PREGNANCY IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  <p>

 

Progestational agents have been used beginning with the first trimester of

pregnancy in an attempt to prevent habitual abortion. There is no adequate

evidence that such use is effective when such drugs are given during the first

four months of pregnancy. Furthermore, in the vast majority of women, the cause 

of abortion is a defective ovum, which progestational agents could not be

expected to influence. In addition, the use of progestational agents with their 

uterine-relaxant properties, in patients with fertilized defective ova may

cause a delay in spontaneous abortion. Therefore, the use of such drugs during

the first four months of pregnancy is not recommended.  

 <p>

Several reports suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to

progestational drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy and genital

abnormalities in male and female fetuses. The risk of hypospadias, 5 to 8 per 1 

000 male births in the general population, may be approximately doubled with

exposure to these drugs. There are insufficient data to quantify the risk to

exposed female fetuses, but insofar as some of these drugs induce mild

virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus, and because of the

increased association of hypospadias in the male fetus, it is prudent to avoid

the use of these drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy.  

 
<p>
If the patient is exposed to Medroxyprogesterone Tablets  

during the first four months of pregnancy or if she becomes pregnant while

taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus. 

 

 <p>

Medroxyprogesterone tablets contain medroxyprogesterone 

acetate, which is a derivative of

progesterone. It is a white to off-white, odorless crystalline powder, stable

in air, melting between 200 and 210 deg C. It is freely soluble in chloroform,

soluble in acetone and in dioxane, sparingly soluble in alcohol and in methanol 

slightly soluble in ether, and insoluble in water.  
<p>
 

The chemical name for medroxyprogesterone acetate is Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 17 

(acetyloxy)-6-methyl-, (6alpha)-.  
<p>
 

<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 

</b> 
<p>
Medroxyprogesterone acetate, administered orally or parenterally in the

recommended doses to women with adequate endogenous estrogen, transforms

proliferative into secretory endometrium. Androgenic and anabolic effects have

been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic

activity. While parenterally administered medroxyprogesterone acetate inhibits

gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and

ovulation, available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually

recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses.  
<p>
 

<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

</b> <p>

Secondary amenorrhea; abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in

the absence of organic pathology, such as fibroids or uterine cancer.  

 <p>

<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 

</b> <p>

1. Thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders, cerebral apoplexy or patients

with a past history of these conditions.  

 
<p>
2. Liver dysfunction or disease.

WARNING 

 <p>

THE USE OF MEDROXYPROGESTERONE DURING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS

OF PREGNANCY IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  

 <p>

Progestational agents have been used beginning with the first trimester of

 <p>

If the patient is exposed to Medroxyprogesterone tablets  

during the first four months of pregnancy or if she becomes pregnant while

taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus. 


<p>
1. The physician should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thrombotic

disorders (thrombophlebitis, cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary embolism, and 

retinal thrombosis). Should any of these occur or be suspected, the drug should 

be discontinued immediately.  

 <p>

2. Beagle dogs treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate developed mammary

nodules some of which were malignant. Although nodules occasionally appeared in 

control animals, they were intermittent in nature, whereas the nodules in the

drug-treated animals were larger, more numerous, persistent, and there were

some breast malignancies with metastases. Their significance with respect to

humans has not been established.  
<p>
 

3. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or

complete loss of vision, or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia

or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions,

medication should be withdrawn.  

 <p>

4. Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the milk of mothers

receiving the drug. The effect of this on the nursing infant has not been

determined.  

 <p>

5. Usage in pregnancy is not recommended (See WARNING Box).  

 <p>

6. Retrospective studies of morbidity and mortality in Great Britain and

studies of morbidity in the United States have shown a statistically

significant association between thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and

cerebral thrombosis and embolism and the use of oral contraceptives. (REF. 1-4) 

The estimate of the relative risk of thromboembolism in the study by Vessey and 

Doll (REF. 3) was about sevenfold, while Sartwell and associates (REF. 4) in

the United States found a relative risk of 4.4, meaning that the users are

several times as likely to undergo thromboembolic disease without evident cause 

as nonusers. The American study also indicated that the risk did not persist

after discontinuation of administration, and that it was not enhanced by long

continued administration. The American study was not designed to evaluate a

difference between products.  

 <p>

<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 

</b> <p>

1. The pretreatment physical examination should include special reference to

breast and pelvic organs, as well as Papanicolaou smear.  

 <p>

2. Because progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions

which might be influenced by this factor, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma,

cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful observation.  

 <p>
3. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding per 

vaginum, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In cases of undiagnosed

vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated.  

 <p>

4. Patients who have a history of psychic depression should be carefully

observed and the drug discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious

degree.  

 <p>

5. Any possible influence of prolonged progestin therapy on pituitary, ovarian, 

adrenal, hepatic or uterine functions awaits further study.  
<p>
                             

6. A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in a small percentage of

patients on estrogen-progestin combination drugs. The mechanism of this

decrease is obscure. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully

observed while receiving progestin therapy.  

 <p>
7. The age of the patient constitutes no absolute limiting factor although

treatment with progestins may mask the onset of the climacteric.  

 <p>

8. The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant

specimens are submitted.  
<p>
 

9. Because of the occasional occurrence of thrombotic disorders,

(thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, retinal thrombosis, and cerebrovascular

disorders) in patients taking estrogen-progestin combinations and since the

mechanism is obscure, the physician should be alert to the earliest

manifestation of these disorders.  

 <p>

10. Studies of the addition of a progestin product to an estrogen replacement

regimen for seven or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration have

reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia. Morphological and

biochemical studies of endometrium suggest that 10-13 days of a progestin are

needed to provide maximal maturation of the endometrium and to eliminate any

hyperplastic changes. Whether this will provide protection from endometrial

carcinoma has not been clearly established. There are possible additional risks 

which may be associated with the inclusion of progestin in estrogen replacement 

regimen. The potential risks include adverse effects on carbohydrate and lipid

metabolism. The dosage used may be important in minimizing these adverse

effects.  

 <p>

11. Aminoglutethimide administered concomitantly with Medroxyprogesterone may significantly 

depress the bioavailability of Medroxyprogesterone.  

 <p>

CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY.  

 <p>

Long-term intramuscular administration of Medroxyprogesterone has been shown to produce

mammary tumors in beagle dogs (see WARNINGS). There was no evidence of a

carcinogenic effect associated with the oral administration of Medroxyprogesterone to rats

and mice. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was not mutagenic in a battery of In

Vitro or In Vivo genetic toxicity assays.  
<p>
 

Medroxyprogesterone acetate at high doses is an antifertility drug and high

doses would be expected to impair fertility until the cessation of treatment.

<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

</b> <p>

SECONDARY AMENORRHEA--Medroxyprogesterone Tablets may be given in dosages of 5 to 10 mg

daily for from 5 to 10 days. A dose for inducing an optimum secretory

transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either

endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of 

Medroxyprogesterone daily for 10 days. In

cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time.

withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after

discontinuing Medroxyprogesterone therapy.  

 <p>

ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING DUE TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE IN THE ABSENCE OF ORGANIC

PATHOLOGY--Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 

5 to 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for from 5 to 10

days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has 

been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of

medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the

cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three

to seven days after discontinuing therapy with 

Medroxyprogesterone. Patients with a past

history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from

planned menstrual cycling with Medroxyprogesterone.

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> 
Warfarin , a vitamin K dependent factor
anticoagulant, is chemically crystalline sodium warfarin isopropanol clathrate. 
The crystallization of warfarin sodium virtually eliminates trace impurities
present in amorphous warfarin sodium, thus achieving a crystalline product of
the highest purity. Warfarin is the coined generic name for 3-(alpha-
acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin. Its empirical formula is C19H15NaO4.  
 

 
Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder, is 
discolored by light and is very soluble in water; freely soluble in alcohol;
very slightly soluble in chloroform and in ether.  
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> 
Warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants act by inhibiting the synthesis of
vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. The resultant In Vivo effect is a
sequential depression of Factors VII, IX, X and II Activities. The degree of
depression is dependent upon the dosage administered. Anticoagulants have no
direct effect on an established thrombus, nor do they reverse ischemic tissue
damage. However, once a thrombosis has occurred, anticoagulant treatment aims
to prevent further extension of the formed clot and prevents secondary
thromboembolic complications which may result in serious and possible fatal
sequelae.  
 
&quot;After oral administration of Warfarin, absorption is essentially complete, and 
maximal plasma concentrations are reached in 1 to 9 hours. Approximately 97% is 
bound to albumin within the plasma. An anticoagulation effect generally occurs
within 24 hours. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96
hours and its duration of action may persist for 4 to 5 days, thus producing a
smooth, long lasting response curve. Warfarin is metabolized by hepatic
microsomal enzymes to inactive metabolites that are excreted into the bile,
reabsorbed and excreted into the urine. Warfarin is a potent drug with a half-
life of 2 1/2 days; therefore its effects may become more pronounced as daily
maintenance doses overlap.&quot; 
 
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> 
Warfarin is indicated for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of venous thrombosis 
and its extension, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolism associated with atrial
fibrillation, and as an adjunct in the prophylaxis of systemic embolism after
myocardial infarction.  
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 

</b>Anticoagulation is contraindicated in any localized or general physical
condition or personal circumstance in which the hazard of hemorrhage might be
greater than the potential clinical benefits of anticoagulation, such as:  
 
PREGNANCY: Warfarin is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant
because the drug passes through the placental barrier and may cause fatal
hemorrhage to the fetus In Utero. Furthermore, there have been reports of birth 
malformations in children born to mothers who have been treated with warfarin
during pregnancy.  
 
Embryopathy characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled
epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) has been reported in pregnant women
exposed to warfarin during the first trimester. Central nervous system
abnormalities also have been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia
characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation,
and midline cerebellar atrophy. Ventral midline dysplasia, characterized by
optic atrophy, and eye abnormalities have been observed. Mental retardation,
blindness, and other central nervous system abnormalities have been reported in 
association with second and third trimester exposure. Although rare,
teratogenic reports following In Utero exposure to warfarin include urinary
tract anomalies such as single kidney, asplenia, anencephaly, spina bifida,
cranial nerve palsy, hydrocephalus, cardiac defects and congenital heart
disease, polydactyly, deformities of toes, diaphragmatic hernia, and corneal
leukoma.  
 
Spontaneous abortion and still birth are known to occur and a higher risk of
fetal mortality is associated with the use of warfarin.  
 
Women of childbearing potential who are candidates for anticoagulant therapy
should be carefully evaluated and the indications critically reviewed with the
patient. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be
apprised of the potential risks to the fetus, and the possibility of
termination of the pregnancy should be discussed in light of those risks.  
 
HEMORRHAGIC TENDENCIES OR BLOOD DYSCRASIAS.  
 
RECENT OR CONTEMPLATED SURGERY OF:  (1) central nervous system; (2) eye; (3)
traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces.  
 
BLEEDING TENDENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVE ULCERATION OR OVERT BLEEDING OF: 
(1) gastrointestinal, genitourinary or respiratory tracts; (2) cerebrovascular
hemorrhage; (3) aneurysms-cerebral, dissecting aorta; (4) pericarditis and
pericardial effusions; (5) bacterial endocarditis.  
 
THREATENED ABORTION, eclampsia and preeclampsia.  
 
INADEQUATE LABORATORY FACILITIES or unsupervised senility, alcoholism,
psychosis; or lack of patient cooperation.  
 
SPINAL PUNCTURE and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential
for uncontrollable bleeding.  
 
MISCELLANEOUS:  major regional, lumbar block anesthesia and malignant
hypertension.  
 
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 

</b>The most serious risks associated with anticoagulant therapy with sodium
warfarin are hemorrhage in any tissue or organ and, less frequently, necrosis
and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues. The risk of hemorrhage is related to 
the level of intensity and the duration of anticoagulant therapy. Hemorrhage
and necrosis have in some cases been reported to result in death or permanent
disability. Necrosis appears to be associated with local thrombosis and usually 
appears within a few days of the start of anticoagulant therapy. In severe
cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected
tissue, limb, breast or penis has been reported. Careful diagnosis is required
to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Warfarin
therapy should be discontinued when warfarin is suspected to be the cause of
developing necrosis and heparin therapy may be considered for anticoagulation.
Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has
been considered uniformly effective. See below for information on predisposing
conditions. These and other risks associated with anticoagulant therapy must be 
weighed against the risk of thrombosis or embolization in untreated cases.  
 
It cannot be emphasized too strongly that treatment of each patient is a highly 
individualized matter. Dosage should be controlled by periodic determinations
of prothrombin time (PT) or other suitable coagulation tests. Determinations of 
whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for control
of therapy. Heparin prolongs the one-stage PT. When heparin and Warfarin are
administered concomitantly, refer below to CONVERSION FROM HEPARIN THERAPY for
recommendations.  
 
Caution should be observed when Warfarin is administered in any situation or in 
the presence of any predisposing condition where added risk of hemorrhage or
necrosis is present.  
 
Anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin may enhance the release of atheromatous
plaque emboli, thereby increasing the risk of complications from systemic
cholesterol microembolization, including the &quot;purple toes syndrome.&quot;
Discontinuation of Warfarin therapy is recommended when such phenomena are
observed.  
 
Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of 
signs and symptoms including purple toes syndrome, livedo reticularis, rash,
gangrene, abrupt and intense pain in the leg, foot, or toes, foot ulcers,
myalgia, penile gangrene, abdominal pain, flank or back pain, hematuria, renal
insufficiency, hypertension, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord infarction,
pancreatitis, symptoms simulating polyarteritis, or any other sequelae of
vascular compromise due to embolic occlusion. The most commonly involved
visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. 
Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death.  
 
Purple toes syndrome is a complication of oral anticoagulation characterized by 
a dark, purplish or mottled color of the toes, usually occurring between 3-10
weeks, or later, after the initiation of therapy with warfarin or related
compounds. Major features of this syndrome include purple color of plantar
surfaces and sides of the toes that blanches on moderate pressure and fades
with elevation of the legs; pain and tenderness of the toes; waxing and waning
of the color over time. While the purple toes syndrome is reported to be
reversible, some cases progress to gangrene or necrosis which may require
debridement of the affected area, or may lead to amputation.  
 
The decision to administer anticoagulants in the following conditions must be
based upon clinical judgment in which the risks of anticoagulant therapy are
weighed against the benefits:  
 
LACTATION:  Warfarin  appears in the milk of
nursing mothers in an inactive form. Infants nursed by Warfarin treated mothers 
had no change in prothrombin times (PTs). Effects in premature infants have not 
been evaluated.  
 
SEVERE TO MODERATE HEPATIC OR RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.  
 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES OR DISTURBANCES OF INTESTINAL FLORA: sprue, antibiotic
therapy.  
 
TRAUMA which may result in internal bleeding.  
 
SURGERY OR TRAUMA resulting in large exposed raw surfaces.  
 
INDWELLING CATHETERS.  
 
SEVERE TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION.  
 
KNOWN OR SUSPECTED DEFICIENCY IN PROTEIN C:  This hereditary or acquired
condition, which should be suspected if there is a history of recurrent
episodes of thromboembolic disorders in the patient or in the family, has been
associated with an increased risk of developing necrosis following warfarin
administration.  Tissue necrosis may occur in the absence of protein C
deficiency. It has been reported that concurrent anticoagulation therapy with
heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with Warfarin may minimize 
the incidence of this reaction. Warfarin therapy should be discontinued when
warfarin is suspected to be the cause of developing necrosis and heparin
therapy may be considered for anticoagulation.  
 
MISCELLANEOUS:  polycythemia vera, vasculitis, severe diabetes, severe allergic 
and anaphylactic disorders.  
 
Patients with congestive heart failure may become more sensitive to Warfarin,
thereby requiring more frequent laboratory monitoring, and reduced doses of
Warfarin.  
 
Concurrent use of anticoagulants with streptokinase or urokinase is not
recommended and may be hazardous. (Please note recommendations accompanying
these preparations.) 
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> 
PERIODIC DETERMINATION OF PT OR OTHER SUITABLE COAGULATION TEST IS ESSENTIAL. 
 
NUMEROUS FACTORS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION, INCLUDING TRAVEL, CHANGES IN DIET,
ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL STATE AND MEDICATION MAY INFLUENCE RESPONSE OF THE
PATIENT TO ANTICOAGULANTS. IT IS GENERALLY GOOD PRACTICE TO MONITOR THE
PATIENT'S RESPONSE WITH ADDITIONAL PT DETERMINATIONS IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY
AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, AND WHENEVER OTHER MEDICATIONS ARE INITIATED 
DISCONTINUED OR TAKEN HAPHAZARDLY. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS ARE LISTED FOR
REFERENCE; HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE ANTICOAGULANT RESPONSE.

*Increased and decreased PT responses have been reported.                       
Because a patient may be exposed to a combination of the above factors, the net 
effect of Warfarin on PT response may be unpredictable. More frequent PT
monitoring is therefore advisable. Medications of unknown interaction with
coumarins are best regarded with caution. When these medications are started or 
stopped, more frequent PT monitoring is advisable.  
 
Coumarins may also affect the action of other drugs. Hypoglycemic agents
(chlorpropamide and tolbutamide) and anticonvulsants (phenytoin and
phenobarbital) may accumulate in the body as a result of interference with
either their metabolism or excretion.  
 
It has been reported that concomitant administration of warfarin and
ticlopidine may be associated with cholestatic hepatitis.  
 
SPECIAL RISK PATIENTS:  Caution should be observed when warfarin sodium is
administered to certain patients such as the elderly or debilitated or when
administered in any situation or physical condition where added risk of
hemorrhage is present.  
 
Intramuscular (I.M.) injections of concomitant medications should be confined
to the upper extremities which permits easy access for manual compression,
inspections for bleeding and use of pressure bandages.  
 
Caution should be observed when Warfarin (or warfarin) is administered
concomitantly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including
aspirin, to be certain that no change in anticoagulation dosage is required. In 
addition to specific drug interactions that might affect PT, NSAIDs, including
aspirin, can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can cause gastrointestinal
bleeding, peptic ulceration and/or perforation.  
 
<b>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS:  </b>The objective of anticoagulant therapy is to control 
the coagulation mechanism so that thrombosis is prevented, while avoiding
spontaneous bleeding. Effective therapeutic levels with minimal complications
are in part dependent upon cooperative and well-instructed patients who
communicate effectively with their physician. Various Warfarin (crystalline
warfarin sodium) patient educational guides are available to physicians on
request. Patients should be advised: Strict adherence to prescribed dosage
schedule is necessary. Do not take or discontinue any other medication, except
on advice of physician. Avoid alcohol, salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical
analgesics), large amounts of green leafy vegetables and/or drastic changes in
dietary habits, because they may affect Warfarin therapy. Warfarin may cause a
red-orange discoloration of alkaline urine. The patient should notify the
physician if any illness, such as diarrhea, infection or fever develops or if
any unusual symptoms, such as pain, swelling or discomfort appear or if
prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding,
nosebleeds or bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red 
or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools or diarrhea occurs.  
 
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:  Carcinogenicity and
mutagenicity studies have not been performed with Warfarin. The reproductive
effects of Warfarin have not been evaluated.  
 
USE IN PREGNANCY:  Pregnancy Category X-See CONTRAINDICATIONS.  
 
PEDIATRIC USE:  Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 18 have
not been established.  
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> 
Potential adverse reactions to Warfarin may include:  
 
-- Hemorrhage from any tissue or organ. This is a consequence of the
anticoagulant effect. The signs and symptoms will vary according to the
location and degree or extent of the bleeding. Hemorrhagic complications may
present as paralysis; headache, chest, abdomen, joint or other pain; shortness
of breath, difficult breathing or swallowing; unexplained swelling; or
unexplained shock.  Therefore, the possibility of hemorrhage should be
considered in evaluating the condition of any anticoagulated patient with
complaints which do not indicate an obvious diagnosis. Bleeding during
anticoagulant therapy does not always correlate with prothrombin activity. 
(See OVERDOSAGE-Treatment.) 
 
-- Bleeding which occurs when the PT is within the therapeutic range warrants
diagnostic investigation since it may unmask a previously unsuspected lesion,
e.g., tumor, ulcer, etc.  
 
-- Necrosis of skin and other tissues. (See WARNINGS.) 
 
-- Other adverse reactions are infrequent and consist of alopecia, urticaria,
dermatitis, fever, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, systemic cholesterol
microembolization, purple toes syndrome, cholestatic hepatic injury, and
hypersensitivity reactions.  
 
-- Priapism has been associated with anticoagulant administration, however, a
causal relationship has not been established.  
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> 
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:  Suspected or overt abnormal bleeding (e.g., appearance of
blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena,
petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries)
are early manifestations of anticoagulation beyond a safe and satisfactory
level.  
 
TREATMENT:  Excessive anticoagulation, with or without bleeding, may be
controlled by discontinuing Warfarin therapy and if necessary, by
administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1. (Please see recommendations
accompanying vitamin K1 preparations prior to use.) 
 
Such use of vitamin K1 reduces response to subsequent Warfarin therapy.
Patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid
reversal of a prolonged PT. Resumption of Warfarin administration reverses the
effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic PT can again be obtained by careful
dosage adjustment. If rapid anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be
preferable for initial therapy.  
 
If minor bleeding progresses to major bleeding, give 5 to 25 mg (rarely up to
50 mg) parenteral vitamin K1. In emergency situations of severe hemorrhage,
clotting factors can be returned to normal by administering 200 to 500 mL of
fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, or by giving commercial Factor IX
complex.  
 
A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of
these blood products; Factor IX complex is also associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in
exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to Warfarin
overdosage.  
 
Purified Factor IX preparations should not be used because they cannot increase 
the levels of prothrombin, Factor VII and Factor X which are also depressed
along with the levels of Factor IX as a result of Warfarin treatment. Packed
red blood cells may also be given if significant blood loss has occurred.
Infusions of blood or plasma should be monitored carefully to avoid
precipitating pulmonary edema in elderly patients or patients with heart
disease.  
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> 
DOSAGE AND LABORATORY CONTROL 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
 
The dosage and administration of Warfarin must be individualized for each
patient according to the particular patient's sensitivity to the drug. The
dosage should be adjusted based upon the results of the one-stage PT. Different 
thromboplastin reagents vary substantially in their responsiveness to sodium
warfarin-induced effects on PT. To define the appropriate therapeutic regimen
it is important to be familiar with the sensitivity of the thromboplastin
reagent used in the laboratory and its relationship to the International
Reference Preparation (IRP)*, a sensitive thromboplastin reagent prepared from
human brain.  
 
Early clinical studies of oral anticoagulants, which formed the basis for
recommended therapeutic ranges of 1.5 to 2.5 times control PT, used sensitive
human brain thromboplastin. When using the less sensitive rabbit brain
thromboplastins commonly employed in PT assays today, adjustments must be made
to the targeted PT range that reflect this decrease in sensitivity.  
 
Available clinical evidence indicates that an INR of 2.0-3.0 (e.g., PT ratio of 
1.2-1.5 when measuring with the less sensitive thromboplastin reagents, ISI=2.8 
(Table 1)) is sufficient for prophylaxis and treatment of venous
thromboembolism and minimizes the risk of hemorrhage associated with higher
INRs. Five recent clinical trials (REF. 1-5) evaluated the effects of warfarin
in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Meta-analysis findings
of these studies revealed that the effects of warfarin in reducing
thromboembolic events including stroke were similar at either moderately high:
INR (2.0-4.5) or low INR (1.4-3.0). There was a significant reduction in minor
bleeds at the low INR.  Similar data from clinical studies in valvular atrial
fibrillation patients are not available. The trials in non-valvular atrial
fibrillation support The American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP)
recommendation (REF. 6) that an INR of 2.0-3.0 be used for long term warfarin
therapy in appropriate AF Patients. In cases where the risk of thromboembolism
is great, such as in patients with recurrent systemic embolism, a higher INR
may be required. A PT ratio of greater than 2.0 appears to provide no
additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher 
risk of bleeding.  
 
The proceedings and recommendations of the 1986 National Conference on
Antithrombotic Therapy (REF. 7-9) review and evaluate issues related to oral
anticoagulant therapy and the sensitivity of thromboplastin reagents and
provide additional guidelines for defining the appropriate therapeutic regimen. 
 
The conversion of the INR to PT ratios for the less-intense (INR 2.0-3.0) and
more intense (INR 2.5-3.5) therapeutic range recommended by the ACCP for
thromboplastins over a range of ISI values is shown in Table 1. (REF. 10)

*  A System Of Standardizing The PT In Oral Anticoagulant Control Was           
    Introduced By The World Health Organization In 1983. It Is Based Upon The   
    Determination Of An International Normalized Ratio (INR) Which Provides A   
    Common Basis For Communication Of PT Results And Interpretations Of         
    Therapeutic Ranges. The INR Is Derived From Calibrations Of Commercial      
    Thromboplastin Reagents Against A Sensitive Human Brain Thromboplastin,     
    The IRP. For The Three Commercial Rabbit Brain Thromboplastins Currently    
    Used In North America, A PT Ratio Of 1.3 To 2.0 Is Equivalent To An INR Of  
    2.0 To 4.0. For Other Thromboplastins, The INR Can Be Calculated As:        
                         INR = (Observed PT Ratio)ISI                           
   Where The ISI (International Sensitivity Index) Is The Calibration Factor    
    And Is Available From The Manufacturers Of The Thromboplastin Reagent.      
    (REF. 11)                                                 </pre>

<pre>                  
INITIAL DOSAGE:  The dosing of Warfarin  must be
individualized according to patient's sensitivity to the drug as indicated by
the INR and/or PT ratio. Use of a large loading dose may increase the incidence 
of hemorrhagic and other complications, does not offer more rapid protection
against thrombi formation, and is not recommended. Low initiation doses are
recommended for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with increased 
sensitivity to Warfarin (see PRECAUTIONS). It is recommended that Warfarin
therapy be initiated with a dose of 2 to 5 mg per day with dosage adjustments
based on the results of INR and/or PT ratio determinations.  
 
MAINTENANCE:  Most patients are satisfactorily maintained at a dose of 2 to 10
mg daily. Flexibility of dosage is provided by breaking scored tablets in half. 
The individual dose and interval should be gauged by the patient's prothrombin
response.  
 
DURATION OF THERAPY:  The duration of therapy in each patient should be
individualized. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the 
danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed.  
 
LABORATORY CONTROL  The PT reflects the depression of vitamin K dependent
Factors VII, IX, X and II. There are several modifications of the one-stage PT
and the physician should become familiar with the specific method used in his
laboratory. The degree of anticoagulation indicated by any range of PTs may be
altered by the type of thromboplastin used; the appropriate therapeutic range
must be based on the experience of each laboratory. The PT should be determined 
daily after the administration of the initial dose until PT results stabilize
in the therapeutic range. Intervals between subsequent PT determinations should 
be based upon the physician's judgment of the patient's reliability and
response to Warfarin in order to maintain the individual within the therapeutic 
range.  Acceptable intervals for PT determinations are normally within the
range of one to four weeks after a stable dosage has been determined. To ensure 
adequate control, it is recommended that additional PT tests are done when
other warfarin products are interchanged with Warfarin and also if other
medications are coadministered with Warfarin (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 
TREATMENT DURING DENTISTRY AND SURGERY The management of patients who undergo
dental and surgical procedures requires close liaison between attending
physicians, surgeons and dentists. In patients who must be anticoagulated prior 
to, during, or immediately following dental or surgical procedures, adjusting
the dosage of Warfarin to maintain the PT at the low end of the therapeutic
range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. The operative site should 
be sufficiently limited and accessible to permit the effective use of local
procedures for hemostasis. Under these conditions, dental and surgical
procedures may be performed without undue risk of hemorrhage.  
 
CONVERSION FROM HEPARIN THERAPY Since the onset of the Warfarin effect is
delayed, heparin is preferred initially for rapid anticoagulation. Conversion
to Warfarin may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 
6 days. As heparin may affect the PT, patients receiving both heparin and
Warfarin should have blood for PT determination drawn at least:  
 
-- 5 hours after the last IV bolus dose of heparin, or 
 
-- 4 hours after cessation of a continuous IV infusion of heparin, or 
 
-- 24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.  
 
When Warfarin has produced the desired therapeutic range or prothrombin
activity, heparin may be discontinued.

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <P></P>
Beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate, is an anti-inflammatory steroid having the chemical
name 9-Chloro-11beta,17,21-trihydroxy-16beta-methylpregna-1, 4-diene-3, 20-dione 17,21-
dipropionate, monohydrate.  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate is a white to creamy-white, odorless
powder with a molecular weight of 539.06. It is very slightly soluble in water; 
very soluble in chloroform; and freely soluble in acetone and in alcohol.  
 <P></P>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <P></P>
Beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate is a diester of beclomethasone, a synthetic
halogenated corticosteroid. Animal studies show that beclomethasone
dipropionate has potent glucocorticosteroid and weak mineralocorticosteroid
activity. The mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of beclomethasone
dipropionate are unknown. The precise mechanism of the aerosolized drug's
action in the nose is also unknown. Biopsies of nasal mucosa obtained during
clinical studies showed no histopathologic changes when beclomethasone
dipropionate was administered intranasally.  <P></P>
 
The effects of beclomethasone dipropionate on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) function have been evaluated in adult volunteers by other routes of
administration. Studies with beclomethasone dipropionate by the intranasal
route may demonstrate that there is more or that there is less absorption by
this route of administration. There was no suppression of early morning plasma
cortisol concentrations when beclomethasone dipropionate was administered in a
dose of 1000 mcg/day for one month as an oral aerosol or for three days by
intramuscular injection. However, partial suppression of plasma cortisol
concentration was observed when beclomethasone dipropionate was administered in 
doses of 2000 mcg/day either by oral aerosol or intramuscular injection. 
Immediate suppression of plasma cortisol concentrations was observed after
single doses of 4000 mcg of beclomethasone dipropionate. Suppression of HPA
function (reduction of early morning plasma cortisol levels) has been reported
in adult patients who received 1600 mcg daily doses of oral beclomethasone
dipropionate for one month. In clinical studies using beclomethasone
dipropionate aerosol intranasally, there was no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency. The effect of Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray on HPA function was not
evaluated but would not be expected to differ from intranasal beclomethasone
dipropionate aerosol.  <P></P>
 
In one study in asthmatic children, the administration of inhaled
beclomethasone at recommended daily doses for at least one year was associated
with a reduction in nocturnal cortisol secretion. The clinical significance of
this finding is not clear. It reinforces other evidence, however, that topical
beclomethasone may be absorbed in amounts that can have systemic effects and
that physicians should be alert for evidence of systemic effects, especially in 
chronically treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS).  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone dipropionate is sparingly soluble. When given by nasal
inhalation in the form of an aqueous or aerosolized suspension, the drug is
deposited primarily in the nasal passages. A portion of the drug is swallowed.
Absorption occurs rapidly from all respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues.
There is no evidence of tissue storage of beclomethasone dipropionate or its
metabolites. In Vitro studies have shown that tissue other than the liver (lung 
slices) can rapidly metabolize beclomethasone dipropionate to beclomethasone 17 
monopropionate and more slowly to free beclomethasone (which has very weak
anti- inflammatory activity). However, irrespective of the route of entry the
principal route of excretion of the drug and its metabolites is the feces. In
humans, 12% to 15% of an orally administered dose of beclomethasone
dipropionate is excreted in the urine as both conjugated and free metabolites
of the drug.  <P></P>
 
Studies have shown that the degree of binding to plasma proteins is 87%.  
 <P></P>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of
seasonal or perennial allergic and non-allergic (vasomotor) rhinitis. Results
from two clinical trials have shown that significant symptomatic relief was
obtained within three days. However, symptomatic relief may not occur in some
patients for as long as two weeks. Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should not be
continued beyond three weeks in the absence of significant symptomatic
improvement.  Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should not be used in the presence of
untreated localized infection involving the nasal mucosa.  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray is also indicated for the prevention of recurrence of
nasal polyps following surgical removal.  <P></P>
            
Clinical studies have shown that treatment of the symptoms associated with
nasal polyps may have to be continued for several weeks or more before a
therapeutic result can be fully assessed. Recurrence of symptoms due to polyps
can occur after stopping treatment, depending on the severity of the disease. 
 <P></P>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation contraindicates
its use.  <P></P>
 
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <P></P>
The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray can
be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency.  <P></P>
 
When transferred to Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray, careful attention must be given
to patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic
corticosteroids. This is particularly important in those patients who have
associated asthma or other clinical conditions, where too rapid a decrease in
systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.  
 <P></P>
Studies have shown that the combined administration of alternate day prednisone 
systemic treatment and orally inhaled beclomethasone increased the likelihood
of HPA suppression compared to a therapeutic dose of either one alone.
Therefore, Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray treatment should be used with caution in
patients already on alternate day prednisone regimens for any disease.  
 <P></P>
If recommended doses of intranasal beclomethasone are exceeded or if
individuals are particularly sensitive or predisposed by virtue of recent
systemic steroid therapy, symptoms of hypercorticism may occur, including very
rare cases of menstrual irregularities, acneiform lesions, and cushingoid
features. If such changes occur, Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should be
discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral 
steroid therapy.  <P></P>
 
Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections
than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more
serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids.  
In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care 
should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster
immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as
appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral 
agents may be considered.  <P></P>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
GENERAL: During withdrawal from oral steroids, some patients may experience
symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude and
depression. Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after the
intranasal administration of beclomethasone.  <P></P>
            
Extremely rare instances of wheezing, nasal septum perforation and increased
intraocular pressure have been reported following the intranasal application of 
aerosolized corticosteroids. Although these have not been observed in clinical
trials with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray, vigilance should be maintained.  
 <P></P>
In clinical studies with beclomethasone dipropionate administered intranasally, 
the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida
Albicans has occurred only rarely. When such an infection develops, it may
require treatment with appropriate local therapy or discontinuance of treatment 
with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray.  <P></P>
 
If persistent nasopharyngeal irritation occurs, it may be an indication for
stopping Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray.  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone dipropionate is absorbed into the circulation. Use of excessive
doses of Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray may suppress HPA function.  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should be used with caution, if at all, in patients
with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; in
untreated fungal, bacterial, or systemic viral infections; or ocular herpes
simplex.  
 <P></P>
For Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray to be effective in the treatment of nasal polyps,
the spray must be able to enter the nose. Therefore, treatment of nasal polyps
with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should be considered adjunctive therapy to
surgical removal and/or the use of other medications which will permit
effective penetration of Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray into the nose. Nasal polyps
may recur after any form of treatment.  <P></P>
 
As with any long-term treatment, patients using Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray over
several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes
in the nasal mucosa.  <P></P>
 
Because of the inhibitory effect of cortiocosteroids on wound healing, patients 
who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or trauma
should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.  
 <P></P>
Although systemic effects have been minimal with recommended doses, this
potential increases with excessive doses. Therefore, larger than recommended
doses should be avoided.  <P></P>
 
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients being treated with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray
should receive the following information and instructions. This information is
intended to aid in the safe and effective use of medication. It is not a
disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Patients should use
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray at regular intervals since its effectiveness depends
on its regular use. The patient should take the medication as directed. It is
not acutely effective and the prescribed dosage should not be increased.
Instead, nasal vasoconstrictors or oral antihistamines may be needed until the
effects of Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray are fully manifested. One to two weeks may
pass before full relief is obtained. The patient should contact the doctor if
symptoms do not improve, or if the condition worsens, or if sneezing or nasal
irritation occurs. For the proper use of this unit and to attain maximum
improvement, the patient should read and follow the accompanying Patient's
Instructions carefully.  <P></P>
 
Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned 
to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and if exposed, to obtain medical
advice.  <P></P>
 
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Treatment of rats for a
total of 95 weeks, 13 weeks by inhalation and 82 weeks by the oral route,
resulted in no evidence of carcinogenic activity. Mutagenic studies have not
been performed.  <P></P>
 
Impairment of fertility, as evidenced by inhibition of the estrus cycle in dogs 
was observed following treatment by the oral route. No inhibition of the
estrus cycle in dogs was seen following treatment with beclomethasone
dipropionate by the inhalation route.  <P></P>
 
PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Like other corticosteroids, parenteral (subcutaneous)
beclomethasone dipropionate has been shown to be teratogenic and embryocidal in 
the mouse and rabbit when given in doses approximately ten times the human
dose.  In these studies beclomethasone was found to produce fetal resorption,
cleft palate, agnathia, microstomia, absence of tongue, delayed ossification,
and agenesis of the thymus. No teratogenic or embryocidal effects have been
seen in the rat when beclomethasone dipropionate was administered by inhalation 
at ten times the human dose or orally at 1000 times the human dose. There are
no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Beclomethasone
dipropionate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  <P></P>
 
NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers
receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully
observed.  <P></P>
 
NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether beclomethasone dipropionate is
excreted in human milk. Because other corticosteroids are excreted in human
milk, caution should be exercised when Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray is administered 
to nursing women.  <P></P>
 
PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 6 years
have not been established.  <P></P>
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
In general, side effects in clinical studies have been primarily associated
with irritation of the nasal mucous membranes. Rarely, immediate
hypersensitivity reactions may occur after the intranasal administration of
beclomethasone dipropionate.  <P></P>
 
Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials and open studies in
patients treated with Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray are described below.  
 <P></P>
Mild, transient nasopharyngeal irritation following the use of beclomethasone
aqueous nasal spray has been reported in up to 24% of patients treated,
including occasional sneezing attacks (about 4%) occurring immediately
following use of the inhaler. In patients experiencing these symptoms, none had 
to discontinue treatment. The incidence of irritation and sneezing was
approximately the same in the group of patients who received placebo in these
studies, implying that these complaints may be related to vehicle components of 
the formulation.  <P></P>
 
Fewer than 5 per 100 patients reported headache, nausea, or lightheadedness
following the use of Beclomethasone AQ (beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate)
Nasal Spray. Fewer than 3 per 100 patients reported nasal stuffiness,
nosebleeds, rhinorrhea, or tearing eyes.  <P></P>
 
Extremely rare instances of wheezing, nasal septum perforation and increased
intraocular pressure have been reported following the intranasal administration 
of aerosolized corticosteroids (see PRECAUTIONS).  <P></P>
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <P></P>
When used at excessive doses, systemic corticosteroid effects such as
hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur,
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with
accepted procedures for discontinuing oral steroid therapy. The oral LD50 of
beclomethasone dipropionate is greater than 1 g/kg in rodents. One bottle of
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray contains beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate
equivalent to 10.5 mg of beclomethasone dipropionate; therefore, acute
overdosage is unlikely.  <P></P>
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <P></P>
ADULTS AND CHILDREN 6 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER: The usual dosage is 1 or 2
inhalations (42 to 84 mcg) in each nostril 2 times a day (total dose 168 to 336 
mcg/day).  
 
In patients who respond to Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray, an improvement of the
symptoms of seasonal or perennial rhinitis usually becomes apparent within a
few days after the start of Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray therapy. However,
symptomatic relief may not occur in some patients for as long as two weeks.
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray should not be continued beyond three weeks in the
absence of significant symptomatic improvement.  <P></P>
 
The therapeutic effects of corticosteroids, unlike those of decongestants on
seasonal or perennial rhinitis, or on nasal polyps are not immediate. This
should be explained to the patient in advance in order to ensure cooperation
and continuation of treatment with the prescribed dosage regimen.  <P></P>
 
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray is not recommended for children below 6 years of age.  
            <P></P>
In the presence of excessive nasal mucus secretion or edema of the nasal mucosa 
the drug may fail to reach the site of intended action. In such cases, it is
advisable to use a nasal vasoconstrictor during the first 2 to 3 days of
Beclomethasone AQ Nasal Spray therapy.

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), chemically 
designated as 4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazole-propionic acid.  
 <p>
The empirical formula for oxaprozin is C18H15NO3, and the molecular weight is
293. Oxaprozin is a white to off-white powder with a slight odor and a melting
point of 162 deg C to 163 deg C. It is slightly soluble in alcohol and
insoluble in water, with an octanol/water partition coefficient of 4.8 at
physiologic pH (7.4). The pKa in water is 4.3.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been shown
to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties in animal
models. As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, all of the modes
of action of oxaprozin are not fully established. Oxaprozin is an inhibitor of
several steps along the arachidonic acid pathway of prostaglandin synthesis,
and one of its modes of action is presumed to be due to the inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis at the site of inflammation.  
 <p>
PHARMACODYNAMICS: Acute analgesic effects are demonstrable in humans after a
single 1200-mg dose of oxaprozin, but anti-inflammatory effects are not
reliably achieved after a single dose. Because of the long half-life of
oxaprozin, it takes several days of dosing to reach steady state (see
Pharmacokinetics).  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS: The pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin have been evaluated in
approximately 400 individuals, which have included patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, healthy elderly volunteers, and patients with
cardiac, renal, and hepatic disease.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin demonstrates high oral bioavailability (95%), with peak plasma
concentrations occurring between 3 and 5 hours after dosing. Food may reduce
the rate of absorption of oxaprozin, but the extent of absorption is unchanged. 
Antacids have no effect on the rate or extent of oxaprozin absorption.  
 <p>
As is true for most NSAIDs, approximately 99.9% of the oxaprozin present in
plasma is bound to albumin. The fraction of the drug present in the tissues
across the therapeutic dosage range ranges between 40% and 60% of the total
drug in the body and is proportional to dose, since the tissue sites are not
saturated with the usual clinical doses.  <p>
                              
Unbound oxaprozin is the pharmacologically active component; it is able to
distribute into tissues and to be cleared from the body. The average unbound
concentration is a function of the tissue-bound and plasma-bound drug, and it
increases proportionally with dose.  
 <p>
As the amount of oxaprozin in the tissues increases at higher dose, the plasma
concentration of oxaprozin is limited by saturation of plasma protein binding.  
In addition, the increase in free (unbound) oxaprozin results in an increase in 
clearance. Both of these contribute to the total plasma concentration of
oxaprozin increasing less than proportionately with dose.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin kinetics were modeled using a two-compartment model with first-order
absorption and protein binding that becomes saturable in the clinical dosage
range. As the dose is increased from 600 to 1200 mg daily, the steady state
clearance of total oxaprozin increases from 0.25 to 0.34 L/hr, the steady state 
apparent volume of distribution increases from 10 to 12.5 L, and the
accumulation half-life decreases from 25 to 21 hours. The terminal elimination
half-life is approximately twice as long as the accumulation half-life because
of the increased binding and decreased clearance at lower concentrations.
Steady state concentrations in clinical usage are achieved in 4 to 7 days.  
 <p>
Plasma levels of total oxaprozin (free and bound drug) in studies of patients
taking 600 to 1200 mg/day for several months ranged from 98 to 230 mcgm/mL,
corresponding to estimated levels of free drug ranging from about 0.10 to 0.40
mcgm/mL.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin is primarily metabolized in the liver, by both microsomal oxidation
(65%) and glucuronic acid conjugation (35%). A small amount (&lt;5%) of active
phenolic metabolites is produced, but the contribution to overall activity is
minimal. All conjugated metabolites are inactive.  
 <p>
Biliary excretion of unchanged oxaprozin is a minor elimination pathway, and
enterohepatic recycling of oxaprozin is insignificant. The glucuronide
metabolites can be recovered from the urine (65%) and feces (35%), while
unchanged oxaprozin is poorly excreted.  
 <p>
Renal dysfunction appears to alter oxaprozin binding and to reduce unbound
clearance and unbound volume of distribution; dosage reductions should be made
(see Precautions: General).  
 <p>
Age, gender, and well-compensated cardiac failure do not affect the plasma
protein binding or the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin.  
 <p>
Like other NSAIDs exhibiting a high degree of protein binding and a primarily
metabolic route of elimination, oxaprozin has the potential for drug-drug
interactions (see Precautions: Drug Interactions).  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Oxaprozin is indicated for acute and long-term use in the management of the signs
and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Oxaprozin should not be used in patients with previously demonstrated
hypersensitivity to oxaprozin or any of its components or in individuals with
the complete or partial syndrome of nasal polyps, angioedema, and
bronchospastic reactivity to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs).  
 <p>
Severe and occasionally fatal asthmatic and anaphylactic reactions have been
reported in patients receiving NSAIDs, and there have been rare reports of
anaphylaxis in patients taking oxaprozin.  
 <p>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <p>
RISK OF GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) ULCERATION, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION WITH
NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG THERAPY: Serious gastrointestinal toxicity, 
such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, can occur at any time, with or
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Although minor upper 
gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common, and usually develop
early in therapy, physicians should remain alert for ulceration and bleeding in 
patients treated chronically with NSAIDs, even in the absence of previous GI
tract symptoms. In patients observed in clinical trials for several months to 2 
years, symptomatic upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation appear to
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about
2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year. Physicians should inform patients
about the signs and/or symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take
if they occur.  
 <p>
Patients at risk for developing peptic ulceration and bleeding are those with a 
prior history of serious GI events, alcoholism, smoking, or other factors known 
to be associated with peptic ulcer disease. Elderly or debilitated patients
seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals, and
most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in these populations. Studies
to date are inconclusive concerning the relative risk of various nonsteroidal
anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in causing such reactions. High doses of any
NSAID probably carry a greater risk of these reactions, and substantial benefit 
should be anticipated to patients prior to prescribing maximal doses of Oxaprozin. 
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
HEPATIC EFFECTS:  As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of
patients. These abnormalities may progress, remain essentially unchanged, or
resolve with continued therapy. The SGPT (ALT) test is probably the most
sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Meaningful (3 times the upper limit
of normal) elevations of SGOT (AST) occurred in controlled clinical trials of
Oxaprozin in just under 1% of patients. A patient with symptoms and/or signs
suggesting liver dysfunction or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred
should be evaluated for evidence of the development of more severe hepatic
reaction while on therapy with this drug. Severe hepatic reactions including
jaundice have been reported with Oxaprozin, and there may be a risk of fatal
hepatitis with oxaprozin, such as has been seen with other NSAIDs. Although
such reactions are rare, if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, clinical
signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or systemic
manifestations occur (eosinophilia, rash, fever), Oxaprozin should be
discontinued.  
 <p>
Well-compensated hepatic cirrhosis does not appear to alter the disposition of
unbound oxaprozin, so dosage adjustment is not necessary. However, the primary
route of elimination of oxaprozin is hepatic metabolism, so caution should be
observed in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.  
 <p>
RENAL EFFECTS:  Acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and proteinuria have
been reported with Oxaprozin as with other NSAIDs. Long-term administration of
some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to animals has resulted in renal
papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. This was not observed
with oxaprozin, but the clinical significance of this difference is unknown.  
 <p>
A second form of renal toxicity has been seen in patients with preexisting
conditions leading to a reduction in renal blood flow, where the renal
prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In 
these patients administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may
cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and may precipitate 
overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are
those with previously impaired renal function, heart failure, or liver
dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of
nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug therapy is often followed by recovery to
the pretreatment state. Those patients at high risk who chronically take
oxaprozin should have renal function monitored if they have signs or symptoms
that may be consistent with mild azotemia, such as malaise, fatigue, or loss of 
appetite. As with all NSAID therapy, patients may occasionally develop some
elevation of serum creatinine and BUN levels without any signs or symptoms.  
 <p>
The pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin may be significantly altered in patients with 
renal insufficiency or in patients who are undergoing hemodialysis. Such
patients should be started on doses of 600 mg/day, with cautious dosage
increases if the desired effect is not obtained. Oxaprozin is not dialyzed
because of its high degree of protein binding.  
 <p>
Like other NSAIDs, Oxaprozin may worsen fluid retention by the kidneys in patients 
with uncompensated cardiac failure due to its effect on prostaglandins. It
should be used with caution in patients with a history of hypertension, cardiac 
decompensation, in patients on chronic diuretic therapy, or in those with other 
conditions predisposing to fluid retention.  
 <p>
PHOTOSENSITIVITY:  Oxaprozin has been associated with rash and/or mild
photosensitivity in dermatologic testing. An increased incidence of rash on sun 
exposed skin was seen in some patients in the clinical trials.  
 <p>
RECOMMENDED LABORATORY TESTING:  Because serious GI tract ulceration and
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should follow
chronically treated patients for the signs and symptoms of ulceration and
bleeding and should inform them of the importance of this follow-up (see
Warnings).  
 <p>
Anemia may occur in patients receiving oxaprozin or other NSAIDs. This may be
due to fluid retention, gastrointestinal blood loss, or an incompletely
described effect upon erythrogenesis. Patients on long-term treatment with
Oxaprozin should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit values determined at
appropriate intervals as determined by the clinical situation.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs, can affect platelet aggregation and prolong
bleeding time. Oxaprozin should be used with caution in patients with underlying
hemostatic defects or in those who are undergoing surgical procedures where a
high degree of hemostasis is needed.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS:  Oxaprozin, like other drugs of its class, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), is not free of side effects. The side effects 
of these drugs can cause discomfort and, rarely, serious side effects, such as
gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal
outcomes.  
 <p>
NSAIDs are often essential agents in the management of arthritis, but they may
also be commonly employed for conditions that are less serious.  
 <p>
Physicians may wish to discuss with their patients the potential risks (see
Warnings, Precautions, and Adverse Reactions) and likely benefits of Oxaprozin
treatment, particularly in less-serious conditions where treatment without
Oxaprozin may represent an acceptable alternative to both the patient and the
physician.  
 <p>
Patients receiving Oxaprozin may benefit from physician instruction in the
symptoms of the more common or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
hematologic, and dermatologic adverse effects.  
 <p>
LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS:  False positive urine drug screening tests for
benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking Oxaprozin. This is due to
cross-reactivity. Confirmatory testing is recommended when such screening test
results are positive.  
 <p>
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
ASPIRIN:  Concomitant administration of Oxaprozin and aspirin is not recommended
because oxaprozin displaces salicylates from plasma protein binding sites. 
Coadministration would be expected to increase the risk of salicylate toxicity. 
 <p>
ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS:  The anticoagulant effects of warfarin were not affected
by the coadministration of 1200 mg/day of Oxaprozin. Nevertheless, caution should
be exercised when adding any drug that affects platelet function to the regimen 
of patients receiving oral anticoagulants.  
 <p>
H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS:  The total body clearance of oxaprozin was reduced by
20% in subjects who concurrently received therapeutic doses of cimetidine or
ranitidine; no other pharmacokinetic parameter was affected. A change of
clearance of this magnitude lies within the range of normal variation and is
unlikely to produce a clinically detectable difference in the outcome of
therapy.  
 <p>
BETA-BLOCKERS:  Subjects receiving 1200 mg Oxaprozin qd with 100 mg metoprolol bid 
exhibited statistically significant but transient increases in sitting and
standing blood pressures after 14 days. Therefore, as with all NSAIDs, routine
blood pressure monitoring should be considered in these patients when starting
Oxaprozin therapy.  
 <p>
OTHER DRUGS:  The coadministration of oxaprozin and antacids, acetaminophen, or 
conjugated estrogens resulted in no statistically significant changes in
pharmacokinetic parameters in single- and/or multiple-dose studies. The
interaction of oxaprozin with lithium and cardiac glycosides has not been
studied.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:  In oncogenicity studies, 
oxaprozin administration for 2 years was associated with the exacerbation of
liver neoplasms (hepatic adenomas and carcinomas) in male CD mice, but not in
female CD mice or rats. The significance of this species-specific finding to
man is unknown.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin did not display mutagenic potential. Results from the Ames test,
forward mutation in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, DNA repair
testing in CHO cells, micronucleus testing in mouse bone marrow, chromosomal
aberration testing in human lymphocytes, and cell transformation testing in
mouse fibroblast all showed no evidence of genetic toxicity or cell
transforming ability.  
 <p>
Oxaprozin administration was not associated with impairment of fertility in
male and female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (1180 mg/M(square)); the 
usual human dose is 17 mg/kg/day (629 mg/M(square)). However, testicular
degeneration was observed in beagle dogs treated with 37.5 to 150 mg/kg/day
(750 to 3000 mg/M(square)) of oxaprozin for 6 months, or 37.5 mg/kg/day for 42
days, a finding not confirmed in other species. The clinical relevance of this
finding is not known.  
 <p>
PREGNANCY:  Teratogenic Effects--Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate or 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Teratology studies with oxaprozin
were performed in mice, rats, and rabbits. In mice and rats, no drug-related
developmental abnormalities were observed at 50 to 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin
(225 to 900 mg/M(square)). However, in rabbits, infrequent malformed fetuses
were observed in dams treated with 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (the usual
human dosage range). Oxaprozin should be used during pregnancy only if the
potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.  
 <p>
LABOR AND DELIVERY:  The effect of oxaprozin in pregnant women is unknown. 
NSAIDs are known to delay parturition, to accelerate closure of the fetal
ductus arteriosus, and to be associated with dystocia. Oxaprozin is known to
have caused decreases in pup survival in rat studies. Accordingly, the use of
oxaprozin during late pregnancy should be avoided.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS:  Studies of oxaprozin excretion in human milk have not been
conducted; however, oxaprozin was found in the milk of lactating rats. Since
the effects of oxaprozin on infants are not known, caution should be exercised
if oxaprozin is administered to nursing women.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE:  Safety and effectiveness of Oxaprozin in children have not been
established.  
 <p>
GERIATRIC USE:  No adjustment of the dose of Oxaprozin is necessary in the elderly 
for Pharmacokinetic reasons, although many elderly may need to receive a
reduced dose because of low body weight or disorders associated with aging. No
significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile for oxaprozin were seen
in studies in the healthy elderly.  
 <p>
Although selected elderly patients in controlled clinical trials tolerated
Oxaprozin as well as younger patients, caution should be exercised in treating the 
elderly, and extra care should be taken when choosing a dose. As with any NSAID 
the elderly are likely to tolerate adverse reactions less well than younger
patients.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <p>
ASPIRIN: Concomitant administration of Oxaprozin and aspirin is not recommended
because oxaprozin displaces salicylates from plasma protein binding sites. 
Coadministration would be expected to increase the risk of salicylate toxicity. 
 <p>
ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS:  The anticoagulant effects of warfarin were not affected
by the coadministration of 1200 mg/day of Oxaprozin. Nevertheless, caution should
be exercised when adding any drug that affects platelet function to the regimen 
of patients receiving oral anticoagulants.  
 <p>
H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS:  The total body clearance of oxaprozin was reduced by
20% in subjects who concurrently received therapeutic doses of cimetidine or
ranitidine; no other pharmacokinetic parameter was affected. A change of
clearance of this magnitude lies within the range of normal variation and is
unlikely to produce a clinically detectable difference in the outcome of
therapy.  
 <p>
BETA-BLOCKERS:  Subjects receiving 1200 mg Oxaprozin qd with 100 mg metoprolol bid 
exhibited statistically significant but transient increases in sitting and
standing blood pressures after 14 days. Therefore, as with all NSAIDs, routine
blood pressure monitoring should be considered in these patients when starting
Oxaprozin therapy.  
 <p>
OTHER DRUGS:  The coadministration of oxaprozin and antacids, acetaminophen, or 
conjugated estrogens resulted in no statistically significant changes in
pharmacokinetic parameters in single- and/or multiple-dose studies. The
interaction of oxaprozin with lithium and cardiac glycosides has not been
studied.

<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Adverse reaction data were derived from patients who received Oxaprozin in
multidose, controlled, and open-label clinical trials, and from worldwide
marketing experience. Rates for events occurring in more than 1% of patients,
and for most of the less common events, are based on 2253 patients who took
1200 to 1800 mg Oxaprozin per day in clinical trials. Of these, 1721 were treated
for at least 1 month, 971 for at least 3 months, and 366 for more than 1 year.
Rates for the rarer events and for events reported from worldwide marketing
experience are difficult to estimate accurately and are only listed as less
than 1%.  
 <p>
The adverse event rates below refer to the incidence in the first month of use. 
Most of the events were seen by this time for common adverse reactions.
However, the cumulative incidence can be expected to rise with continued
therapy, and some events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding (see Warnings),
seem to occur at a constant or possibly increasing rate over time.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 
 <p>
Oxaprozin is a non-narcotic drug. Usually reliable animal studies have indicated
that Oxaprozin has no known addiction potential in humans.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
No patient experienced either an accidental or intentional overdosage of Oxaprozin 
in the clinical trials of the drug. Symptoms following acute overdose with
other NSAIDs are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and 
epigastric pain and are generally reversible with supportive care. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding and coma have occurred following NSAID overdose. 
Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression are rare.  
 <p>
Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Gut decontamination may be
indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or
following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). This should be
accomplished via emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to
2 g/kg in children) with an osmotic cathartic. Forced diuresis, alkalization of 
the urine, or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to the high degree 
of protein binding of oxaprozin.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS:  The usual daily dose of Oxaprozin in the management of the
signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is 1200 mg (two 600-mg caplets) once 
a day. Both smaller and larger doses may be required in individual patients
(see Individualization Of Dosage).  
 <p>
OSTEOARTHRITIS:  The usual daily dose of Oxaprozin for the management of the signs 
and symptoms of moderate to severe osteoarthritis is 1200 mg (two 600-mg
caplets) once a day. For patients of low body weight or with milder disease, an 
initial dosage of one 600-mg caplet once a day may be appropriate (see
Individualization Of Dosage).  
 <p>
Regardless of the indication, the dosage should be individualized to the lowest 
effective dose of Oxaprozin to minimize adverse effects, and the maximum
recommended total daily dose is 1800 mg (or 26 mg/kg, whichever is LOWER) in
divided doses.  <p>
 
CLINICAL STUDIES 
 <p>
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS:  Oxaprozin was evaluated for managing the signs and symptoms 
of rheumatoid arthritis in placebo and active controlled clinical trials in a
total of 646 patients. Oxaprozin was given in single or divided daily doses of 600 
to 1800 mg/day and was found to be comparable to 2600 to 3900 mg/day of
aspirin.  At these doses there was a trend (over all trials) for oxaprozin to
be more effective and cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects than aspirin. 
 <p>
Oxaprozin was given as a once-a-day dose of 1200 mg in most of the clinical trials 
but larger doses (up to 26 mg/kg or 1800 mg/day) were used in selected
patients.  In some patients, Oxaprozin may be better tolerated in divided doses.
Due to its long half-life, several days of Oxaprozin therapy were needed for the
drug to reach its full effect (see Individualization Of Dosage).  
 <p>
OSTEOARTHRITIS:  Oxaprozin was evaluated for the management of the signs and
symptoms of osteoarthritis in a total of 616 patients in active controlled
clinical trials against aspirin (N=464), piroxicam (N=102), and other NSAIDs. 
Oxaprozin was given both in variable (600 to 1200 mg/day) and in fixed (1200
mg/day) dosing schedules in either single or divided doses. In these trials,
oxaprozin was found to be comparable to 2600 to 3200 mg/day doses of aspirin or 
20 mg/day doses of piroxicam. Oxaprozin was effective both in once-daily and in 
divided dosing schedules. In controlled clinical trials several days of
oxaprozin therapy were needed for the drug to reach its full effects (see
Individualization Of Dosage).  
 <p>
INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE 
 <p>
Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs, shows considerable interindividual differences in
both pharmacokinetics and clinical response (pharmacodynamics). Therefore, the
dosage for each patient should be individualized according to the patient's
response to therapy.  
 <p>
The usual starting dose for most normal weight patients with rheumatoid
arthritis is 1200 mg, once a day.  
 <p>
The usual starting dose for normal weight patients with mild to moderate
osteoarthritis is 600 mg, once a day.  
 <p>
In cases where a quick onset of action is important, the pharmacokinetics of
oxaprozin allow therapy to be started with a ONE-TIME loading dose of 1200 to
1800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg/kg).  
 <p>
Doses larger than 1200 mg/day should be reserved for patients who weigh more
than 50 kg, have normal renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic
ulcer, and whose severity of disease justifies maximal therapy. Physicians
should ensure that patients are tolerating doses in the 600 to 1200 mg/day
range without gastroenterologic, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse
effects before advancing to the larger doses.  
 <p>
The maximum recommended total daily dosage is 1800 mg in divided doses.  
 <p>
Most patients will tolerate once-a-day dosing with Oxaprozin, although divided
doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses. As with all
drugs of this class, the frequency and severity of adverse events will depend
on the dose of the drug, the age and physical condition of the patient, any
concurrent medical diagnoses, individual vulnerability, and the duration of
therapy. In clinical trials of oxaprozin, no clear dose-response relationship
was seen for serious adverse effects, but physicians are cautioned that the
reported safety data were developed in patients who had successfully taken
lower doses of Oxaprozin before being advanced above 1200 mg/day.  
 <p>
Experience with other NSAIDs has shown that starting therapy with maximal doses 
in patients at increased risk due to renal or hepatic disease, low body weight, 
advanced age, a known ulcer diathesis, or known sensitivity to NSAID effects is 
likely to increase the frequency of adverse events and is not recommended (see
Precautions).  <p>

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Nabumetone is a naphthylalkanone designated chemically as 4-(6- methoxy-2-naphthalenyl)-2-butanone.
</p>

<p>Nabumetone is a white to off-white crystalline substance with a molecular
weight of 228.3. It is nonacidic and practically insoluble in water, but
soluble in alcohol and most organic solvents. It has an n-octanol:phosphate
buffer partition coefficient of 2400 at pH 7.4. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits
anti inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties in pharmacologic
studies. As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, its mode
of action is not known. However, the ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis
may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect. </p>

<p>The parent compound is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation
to the active component, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is
a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. </p>

<p>It is acidic and has an n-octanol:phosphate buffer partition coefficient
of 0.5 at pH 7.4. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>After oral administration, approximately 80% of a radio-labelled dose
of nabumetone is found in the urine, indicating that nabumetone is well
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Nabumetone itself is not detected
in the plasma because, after absorption, it undergoes rapid biotransformation
to the principal active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA).
Approximately 35% of a 1000 mg oral dose of nabumetone is converted to
6MNA and 50% is converted into unidentified metabolites which are subsequently
excreted in the urine. Following oral administration of Nabumetone, 6MNA
exhibits pharmacokinetic characteristics that generally follow a one-compartment
model with first order input and first order elimination. </p>

<p>6MNA is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The free fraction is
dependent on total concentration of 6MNA and is proportional to dose over
the range of 1000 mg to 2000 mg. It is 0.2% to 0.3% at concentrations typically
achieved following administration of Nabumetone 1000 mg and is approximately
0.6% to 0.8% of the total concentrations at steady state following daily
administration of 2000 mg. </p>

<p>Steady-state plasma concentrations of 6MNA are slightly lower than predicted
from single-dose data. This may result from the higher fraction of unbound
6MNA which undergoes greater hepatic clearance. </p>

<p>Coadministration of food increases the rate of absorption and subsequent
appearance of 6MNA in the plasma but does not affect the extent of conversion
of nabumetone into 6MNA. Peak plasma concentrations of 6MNA are increased
by approximately one third. </p>

<p>Coadministration with an aluminum-containing antacid had no significant
effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. </p>

<p>6MNA undergoes biotransformation in the liver, producing inactive metabolites
that are eliminated as both free metabolites and conjugates. None of the
known metabolites of 6MNA has been detected in plasma. Preliminary In Vivo
and In Vitro studies suggest that unlike other NSAIDs, there is no evidence
of enterohepatic recirculation of the active metabolite. Approximately
75% of a radiolabelled dose was recovered in urine in 48 hours. Approximately
80% was recovered in 168 hours. A further 9% appeared in the feces. In
the first 48 hours, metabolites consisted of: </p>

  </pre>

<p>Total % Dose: 73% Following oral administration of dosages of 1000 mg
to 2000 mg to steady state, the mean plasma clearance of 6MNA is 20 to
30 mL/min. and the elimination half life is approximately 24 hours. </p>

<p>ELDERLY PATIENTS: Steady-state plasma concentrations in elderly patients
were generally higher than in young healthy subjects. (See Table 1 for
summary of pharmacokinetic parameters.) </p>

<p>RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: In studies of patients with renal insufficiency,
the mean terminal half-life of 6MNA was increased in patients with severe
renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min./1.73 M(square)).
In patients undergoing hemodialysis, steady-state plasma concentrations
of the active metabolite were similar to those observed in healthy subjects.
Due to extensive protein-binding, 6MNA is not dialyzable. </p>

<p>HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT: Data in patients with severe hepatic impairment
are limited. Biotransformation of nabumetone to 6MNA and the further metabolism
of 6MNA to inactive metabolites is dependent on hepatic function and could
be reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment (history of or biopsy-proven
cirrhosis). </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Nabumetone was compared to aspirin in inducing gastrointestinal
blood loss. Food intake was not monitored. Studies utilizing 51Cr-tagged
red blood cells in healthy males showed no difference in fecal blood loss
after 3 or 4 weeks' administration of Nabumetone 1000 mg or 2000 mg daily
when compared to either placebo-treated or nontreated subjects. In contrast,
aspirin 3600 mg daily produced an increase in fecal blood loss when compared
to the Nabumetone-treated, placebo-treated or nontreated subjects. The
clinical relevance of the data is unknown. </p>

<p>The following endoscopy trials entered patients who had been previously
treated with NSAIDs. These patients had varying baseline scores and different
courses of treatment. The trials were not designed to correlate symptoms
and endoscopy scores. The clinical relevance of these endoscopy trials,
i.e., either G.I. symptoms or serious G.I. events, is not known. </p>

<p>Ten endoscopy studies were conducted in 488 patients who had baseline
and post treatment endoscopy. In 5 clinical trials that compared a total
of 194 patients on Nabumetone 1000 mg daily or naproxen 250 mg or 500 mg
twice daily for 3 to 12 weeks, Nabumetone treatment resulted in fewer patients
with endoscopically detected lesions (&gt;3 mm). In 2 trials a total of
101 patients on Nabumetone 1000 mg or 2000 mg daily or piroxicam 10 mg
to 20 mg for 7 to 10 days, there were fewer Nabumetone patients with endoscopically
detected lesions. In 3 trials of a total of 47 patients on Nabumetone 1000
mg daily or indomethacin 100 mg to 150 mg daily for 3 to 4 weeks, the endoscopy
scores were higher with indomethacin. Another 12-week trial in a total
of 171 patients compared the results of treatment with Nabumetone 1000
mg/day to ibuprofen 2400 mg/day and ibuprofen 2400 mg/day plus misoprostol
800 mcg/day. The results showed that patients treated with Nabumetone had
a lower number of endoscopically detected lesions (&gt;5 mm) than patients
treated with ibuprofen alone but comparable to the combination of ibuprofen
plus misoprostol. The results did not correlate with abdominal pain. </p>

<p>OTHER: In 1-week repeat-dose studies in healthy volunteers, Nabumetone
1000 mg daily had little effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation
and no effect on bleeding time. In comparison, naproxen 500 mg daily suppressed
collagen- induced platelet aggregation and significantly increased bleeding
time. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Nabumetone is indicated for acute and chronic treatment of signs and
symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Nabumetone is contraindicated in patients who have previously exhibited
hypersensitivity to it. </p>

<p>Nabumetone is contraindicated in patients in whom Nabumetone, aspirin
or other NSAIDs induce asthma, urticaria or other allergic-type reactions.
Fatal asthmatic reactions have been reported in such patients receiving
NSAIDs. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>RISK OF G.I. ULCERATION, BLEEDING AND PERFORATION WITH NSAID THERAPY:
Serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as bleeding, ulceration and perforation
can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated
chronically with NSAID therapy. Although minor upper gastrointestinal problems,
such as dyspepsia, are common, usually developing early in therapy, physicians
should remain alert for ulceration and bleeding in patients treated chronically
with NSAIDs even in the absence of previous G.I. tract symptoms.</p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials involving 1,677 patients treated with
Nabumetone (1 140 followed for 1 year and 927 for 2 years), the cumulative
incidence of peptic ulcers was 0.3% (95% Cl; 0%, 0.6%) at 3 to 6 months,
0.5% (95% Cl; 0.1%, 0.9%) at 1 year and 0.8% (95% Cl; 0.3%, 1.3%) at 2
years. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and symptoms of
serious G.I. toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. In patients
with active peptic ulcer, physicians must weigh the benefits of Nabumetone
therapy against possible hazards, institute an appropriate ulcer treatment
regimen and monitor the patients' progress carefully. </p>

<p>Studies to date have not identified any subset of patients not at risk
of developing peptic ulceration and bleeding. Except for a prior history
of serious G.I. events and other risk factors known to be associated with
peptic ulcer disease, such as alcoholism, smoking, etc., no risk factors
(e.g., age, sex) have been associated with increased risk. Elderly or debilitated
patients seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals
and most spontaneous reports of fatal G.I. events are in this population.
</p>

<p>High doses of any NSAID probably carry a greater risk of these reactions,
although controlled clinical trials showing this do not exist in most cases.
In considering the use of relatively large doses (within the recommended
dosage range), sufficient benefit should be anticipated to offset the potential
increased risk of G.I. toxicity. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL RENAL EFFECTS: As a class, NSAIDs have been associated with
renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology during long-term
administration to animals. </p>

<p>A second form of renal toxicity often associated with NSAIDs is seen
in patients with conditions leading to a reduction in renal blood flow
or blood volume, where renal prostaglandins have a supportive role in the
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an
NSAID results in a dose- dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis
and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate
overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction
are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction,
those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy
is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. </p>

<p>Because nabumetone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, no adjustment
of Nabumetone dosage is generally necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
However, as with all NSAIDs, patients with impaired renal function should
be monitored more closely than patients with normal renal function (see
ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Studies). The oxidized and conjugated
metabolites of 6MNA are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The extent
to which these largely inactive metabolites may accumulate in patients
with renal failure has not been studied. As with other drugs whose metabolites
are excreted by the kidneys, the possibility that adverse reactions (not
listed in ADVERSE REACTIONS) may be attributable to these metabolites should
be considered. </p>

<p>HEPATIC FUNCTION: As with other NSAIDs, borderline elevations of one
or more liver function tests may occur in up to 15% of patients. These
abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may return
to normal with continued therapy. The ALT (SGPT) test is probably the most
sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Meaningful (3 times the upper
limit of normal) elevations of ALT (SGPT) or AST (SGOT) have occurred in
controlled clinical trials of Nabumetone in less than 1% of patients. A
patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in
whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence
of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on Nabumetone
therapy. Severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal hepatitis,
have been reported with other NSAIDs. Although such reactions are rare,
if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and symptoms
consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Nabumetone should be discontinued. Because
nabumetone's biotransformation to 6MNA is dependent upon hepatic function,
the biotransformation could be decreased in patients with severe hepatic
dysfunction. Therefore, Nabumetone should be used with caution in patients
with severe hepatic impairment (see Pharmacokinetics, Hepatic Impairment).
</p>

<p>FLUID RETENTION AND EDEMA: Fluid retention and edema have been observed
in some patients taking Nabumetone. Therefore, as with other NSAIDs, Nabumetone
should be used cautiously in patients with a history of congestive heart
failure, hypertension or other conditions predisposing to fluid retention.
</p>

<p>PHOTOSENSITIVITY: Based on U.V. light photosensitivity testing, Nabumetone
may be associated with more reactions to sun exposure than might be expected
based on skin tanning types. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Nabumetone, like other drugs of its class,
is not free of side effects. The side effects of these drugs can cause
discomfort and, rarely, there are more serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal
bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome. </p>

<p>NSAIDs are often essential agents in the management of arthritis, but
they also may be commonly employed for conditions which are less serious.
Physicians may wish to discuss with their patients the potential risks
(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS) and likely benefits of
NSAID treatment, particularly when the drugs are used for less serious
conditions where treatment without NSAIDs may represent an acceptable alternative
to both the patient and the physician. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: Because severe G.I. tract ulceration and bleeding
can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should follow chronically
treated patients for signs and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding, and
should inform them of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Risk
of G.I. Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation with NSAID Therapy). </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: In Vitro studies have shown that, because of its
affinity for protein, 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from
their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering Nabumetone
with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of an aluminum-containing antacid had no
significant effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. When administered with
food or milk, there is more rapid absorption; however, the total amount
of 6MNA in the plasma is unchanged (see Pharmacokinetics). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS: In two-year studies conducted in mice and
rats, nabumetone had no statistically significant tumorigenic effect. Nabumetone
did not show mutagenic potential in the Ames test and mouse micronucleus
test In Vivo. However, nabumetone- and 6MNA-treated lymphocytes in culture
showed chromosomal aberrations at 80 mcg/mL and higher concentrations (equal
to the average human exposure to Nabumetone at the maximum recommended
dose). </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Nabumetone did not impair fertility of male
or female rats treated orally at doses of 320 mg/kg/day (1888 mg/M(square))
before mating. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS. PREGNANCY CATEGORY C. Nabumetone did
not cause any teratogenic effect in rats given up to 400 mg/kg (2360 mg/M(square))
and in rabbits up to 300 mg/kg (3540 mg/M(square)) orally. However, increased
post- implantation loss was observed in rats at 100 mg/kg (590 mg/M(square))
orally and at higher doses (equal to the average human exposure to 6MNA
at the maximum recommended human dose). There are no adequate, well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only
if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Because of the known effect of prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibiting drugs
on the human fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus),
use of Nabumetone during the third trimester of pregnancy is not recommended.
</p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY: The effects of Nabumetone on labor and delivery
in women are not known. As with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin
synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition occurred
in rats treated throughout pregnancy. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Nabumetone is not recommended for use in nursing mothers
because of the possible adverse effects of prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibiting
drugs on neonates. It is not known whether nabumetone or its metabolites
are excreted in human milk; however, 6MNA is excreted in the milk of lactating
rats. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Nabumetone is not recommended for use in children because
the safety and efficacy in children have not been established. </p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE: Of the 1,677 patients in U.S. clinical studies who were
treated with Nabumetone, 411 patients (24%) were 65 years of age or older;
22 patients (1%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences
in efficacy or safety were observed between these older patients and younger
ones. Similar results were observed in a 1-year, non-U.S. postmarketing
surveillance study of 10,800 Nabumetone patients, of whom 4,577 patients
(42%) were 65 years of age or older. </p>

<br><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Since only 1 case of Nabumetone overdose has been reported, the experience
is limited. If acute overdose occurs, it is recommended that the stomach
be emptied by vomiting or lavage and general supportive measures be instituted,
as necessary. In addition, the use of activated charcoal, up to 60 grams,
may effectively reduce nabumetone absorption. Coadministration of nabumetone
with charcoal to man has resulted in an 80% decrease in maximum plasma
concentrations of the active metabolite. </p>

<p>The 1 overdose occurred in a 17-year-old female patient who had a history
of abdominal pain and was hospitalized for increased abdominal pain following
ingestion of 30 Nabumetone tablets (15 grams total). Stools were negative
for occult blood and there was no fall in serum hemoglobin concentration.
The patient had no other symptoms. She was given an H2-receptor antagonist
and discharged from the hospital without sequelae. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS </p>

<p>The recommended starting dose is 1000 mg taken as a single dose with
or without food. Some patients may obtain more symptomatic relief from
1500 mg to 2000 mg per day. Nabumetone can be given in either a single
or twice-daily dose. Dosages over 2000 mg per day have not been studied.
The lowest effective dose should be used for chronic treatment. </p>

<p><i>CLINICAL STUDIES </i></p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS OSTEOARTHRITIS: The use of Nabumetone in relieving the
signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was assessed in double-blind controlled
trials in which 1,047 patients were treated for 6 weeks to 6 months. In
these trials, Nabumetone in a dose of 1000 mg/day administered at night
was comparable to naproxen 500 mg/day and to aspirin 3600 mg/day. </p>

<p>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: The use of Nabumetone in relieving the signs and
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was assessed in double-blind, randomized,
controlled trials in which 770 patients were treated for 3 weeks to 6 months.
Nabumetone, in a dose of 1000 mg/day administered at night was comparable
to naproxen 500 mg/day and to aspirin 3600 mg/day. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients, Nabumetone
has been used in combination with gold, d-penicillamine and corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSING </p>

<p>There is considerable interpatient variation in response to Nabumetone.
Therapy is usually initiated at a Nabumetone dose of 1000 mg daily, then
adjusted, if needed, based on clinical response. </p>

<p>In clinical trials with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients,
most patients responded to Nabumetone in doses of 1000 mg/day administered
nightly; total daily dosages up to 2000 mg were used. In open-labelled
studies, 1,490 patients were permitted dosage increases and were followed
for approximately 1 year (mode). Twenty percent of patients (n=294) were
withdrawn for lack of effectiveness during the first year of these open-labelled
studies. The following table provides patient-exposure to doses used in
the U.S. clinical trials: </p>

<p>As with other NSAIDs, the lowest dose should be sought for each patient.
Patients weighing under 50 kg may be less likely to require dosages beyond
1000 mg. Therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy, the
dose should be adjusted to meet individual patients' requirements. </p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <P></P>
Amlodipine is the besylate salt of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel
blocker.  <P></P>
 
Amlodipine is chemically described as (R.S.) 3-ethyl-5-methyl-2-(2-
aminoethoxymethyl)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-
pyridinedicarboxylate benzenesulphonate. Its empirical formula is
C20H25CIN2O5.C6H6O3S.  <P></P>

 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <P></P>
MECHANISM OF ACTION:  Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium
ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx
of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental
data suggest that Amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine
binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth
muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these 
cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across 
cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle
cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected
In Vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic
doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by Amlodipine. Within the
physiologic pH range. Amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its
kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a
gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site,
resulting in a gradual onset of effect.  <P></P>
 
Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular
smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and
reduction in blood pressure.  <P></P>
 
The precise mechanisms by which Amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully
delineated, but are thought to include the following:  <P></P>
 
Exertional Angina:  In patients with exertional angina, Amlodipine reduces the
total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and
reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any
given level of exercise.  <P></P>
 
Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and
restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium,
potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental
animal models and in human coronary vessels In Vitro. This inhibition of
coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of Amlodipine in vasospastic
(Prinzmetal's or variant) angina.  <P></P>
 
PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM: After oral administration of therapeutic doses 
of Amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12
hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%.
The bioavailability of Amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food.  
 <P></P>
Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via
hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites
excreted in the urine. Ex Vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the 
circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. 
Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life
of about 30-50 hours. Steady state plasma levels of Amlodipine are reached after 7 
to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.  <P></P>
 
The pharmacokinetics of Amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal
impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial 
dose.  <P></P>
 
Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased
clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-
60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.  <P></P>
 
PHARMACODYNAMICS: Hemodynamics Following administration of therapeutic doses to 
patients with hypertension, Amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a
reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood
pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma
catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous
administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases
heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina,
chronic administration of oral amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to
clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive 
patients with angina.  <P></P>
 
With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is
maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect
in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood
pressure with Amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment
elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 
114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension 
(diastolic pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no
clinically significant change in blood pressures (-1/-2 mmHg).  <P></P>
 
As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac
function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal
ventricular function treated with Amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small
increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left
ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, Amlodipine
has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in
the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered 
with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in
normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing
significant negative inotropic effects.  <P></P>
 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 118 patients
with well compensated heart failure (NYHA Class II and Class III), treatment
with Amlodipine did not lead to worsened heart failure, based on measures of
exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical
symptomatology.  Studies in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure have not
been performed and, in general, all calcium channel blockers should be used
with caution in any patient with heart failure.  <P></P>
 
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of
Amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in
glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in
filtration fraction or proteinuria.  <P></P>
 
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS: Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function
or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with
chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not
significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after
pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving Amlodipine and
concomitant beta blockers. In clinical studies in which Amlodipine was
administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either
hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters
were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, Amlodipine therapy
did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV
blocks.  <P></P>
 
EFFECTS IN HYPERTENSION: The antihypertensive efficacy of Amlodipine has been
demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
studies involving 800 patients on Amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily
administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions
in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about
12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in
patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure
effect over the 24 hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in 
peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for
up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the 
reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the
recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young
and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older
patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were
similar in black and white patients.  <P></P>
 
EFFECTS IN CHRONIC STABLE ANGINA: The effectiveness of 5-10 mg/day of Amlodipine
in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-
blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684
Amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies
significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with
the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63
sec) for Amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% 
(38 sec) for Amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 
mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and
decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of Amlodipine in angina
patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina
there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg)
or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).  <P></P>
 
EFFECTS IN VASOSPASTIC ANGINA: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, Amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by
approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week
(p&lt;0.01). Two of 23 Amlodipine and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the
study due to lack of clinical improvement.  <P></P>


<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <P></P>
1. Hypertension 
 <P></P>
Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or 
in combination with other antihypertensive agents.  <P></P>
 <P></P>
2. Chronic Stable Angina 
 <P></P>
Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be 
used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.  <P></P>
 
3. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) 
 <P></P>
Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic
angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other
antianginal drugs.  <P></P>
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Amlodipine is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity to amlodipine.  
 <P></P>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <P></P>
INCREASED ANGINA AND/OR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Rarely, patients, particularly
those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed
documented increased frequency, duration and/or severity of angina or acute
myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the
time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.  
 <P></P>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
GENERAL: Since the vasodilation induced by Amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute
hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration of Amlodipine. 
Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when administering Amlodipine as with any 
other peripheral vasodilator particularly in patients with severe aortic
stenosis.  <P></P>
 
USE IN PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Although hemodynamic studies and 
a controlled trial in NYHA Class II-III heart failure patients have shown that
Amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise
tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction, and clinical symptomatology,
studies have not been performed in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure.
In general, all calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in
patients with heart failure.  <P></P>
 
BETA-BLOCKER WITHDRAWAL: Amlodipine is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no
protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such
withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker.  
 <P></P>
PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC FAILURE:  Since Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the 
liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) is 56 hours in patients with 
impaired hepatic function, caution should be exercised when administering
Amlodipine to patients with severe hepatic impairment.  <P></P>
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS: In Vitro data in human plasma indicate that Amlodipine has no
effect on the protein binding of drugs tested (digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin
and indomethacin). Special studies have indicated that the co-administration of 
Amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal
clearance in normal volunteers; that co-administration with cimetidine did not
alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine; and that co-administration with
warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.  <P></P>
 
In clinical trials, Amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide
diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting 
nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.  <P></P>
 
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: None known.  
 <P>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Rats and mice treated
with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to
provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence
of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* 
the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/M(square) basis), was
close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.  
 <P>
Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or
chromosome levels.  <P>
 
There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 
64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8
times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/M(square) basis).  
 <P>
PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal
toxicity was found when pregnant rats or rabbits were treated orally with up to 
10 mg/kg amlodipine (respectively 8 times* and 23 times* the maximum
recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/M(square) basis) during their
respective periods of major organogenesis. However, litter size was
significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths
was significantly increased (about 5- fold) in rats administered 10 mg/kg
amlodipine for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation.
Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration 
of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if
the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
 <P></P>
NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human milk.  
In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be
discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.  <P></P>
 
PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness of Amlodipine in children have not been
established.  <P></P>

<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and
foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with Amlodipine was well-tolerated
at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with 
Amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials
directly comparing Amlodipine (N=1730) in doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250),
discontinuation of Amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in only about
1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). 
The most common side effects are headache and edema. The incidence (%) of side

loose stools, coughing, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia, taste
perversion, abnormal visual accommodation, and xerophthalmia.  <P></P>
 
Other reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distinguished from
medications or concurrent disease states, such as myocardial infarction and
angina.  
 <P></P>
Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in
routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum
potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or liver function
tests.  <P></P>
 
Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, well compensated congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease 
diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.  <P></P>
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Single oral doses of 40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively,
caused deaths. A single oral dose of 4 mg/kg or higher in dogs caused a marked
peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.  <P></P>
 
Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with
marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience
with intentional overdosage of Amlodipine is limited. Reports of intentional
overdosage include a patient who ingested 250 mg and was asymptomatic and was
not hospitalized; another (120 mg) was hospitalized, underwent gastric lavage
and remained normotensive; the third (105 mg) was hospitalized and had
hypotension (90/50 mmHg) which normalized following plasma expansion. A patient 
who took 70 mg amlodipine and an unknown quantity of benzodiazepine in a
suicide attempt, developed shock which was refractory to treatment and died the 
following day with abnormally high benzodiazepine plasma concentration. A case
of accidental drug overdose has been documented in a 19 month old male who
ingested 30 mg amlodipine (about 2 mg/kg). During the emergency room
presentation, vital signs were stable with no evidence of hypotension, but a
heart rate of 180 bpm. Ipecac was administered 3.5 hours after ingestion and on 
subsequent observation (overnight) no sequelae were noted.  <P></P>
 
If massive overdose should occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring
should be instituted. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential.
Should hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the
extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If
hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration 
of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine), should be considered with attention to 
circulating volume and urine output. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help to
reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade. As Amlodipine is highly protein
bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.  <P></P>
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <P></P>
The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of Amlodipine is 5 mg once daily with 
a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly individuals, or
patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and
this dose may be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.  
 <P></P>
Dosage should be adjusted according to each patient's need. In general,
titration should proceed over 7 to 14 days so that the physician can fully
assess the patient's response to each dose level. Titration may proceed more
rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed
frequently.  <P></P>
 
The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5-10 mg, with
the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic
insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect. See
Adverse Reactions section for information related to dosage and side effects. 
 <P></P>
CO-ADMINISTRATION WITH OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AND/OR ANTIANGINAL DRUGS: Amlodipine 
has been safely administered with thiazides, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers,
long-acting nitrates, and/or sublingual nitroglycerin.  <P></P>

located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura by dampening their
activity and thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source. It begins
to act within 15 to 20 minutes and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours. Benzonatate
has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center in recommended dosage.
</P>

<P><A NAME="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></A><B>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </B></P>

<P>Benzonatate is indicated for the symptomatic relief of cough. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></A><B>CONTRAINDICATIONS </B></P>

<P>Hypersensitivity to benzonatate or related compounds. </P>

<P><A NAME="WARNINGS"></A><B>WARNINGS </B></P>

<P>Severe hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, laryngospasm
and cardiovascular collapse) have been reported which are possibly related
to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing the perle instead of swallowing
it. Severe reactions have required intervention with vasopressor agents
and supportive measures. </P>

<P>Isolated instances of bizarre behavior, including mental confusion and
visual hallucinations, have also been reported in patients taking Benzonatate
in combination with other prescribed drugs. </P>

<P><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS"></A><B>PRECAUTIONS </B></P>

<P>Benzonatate is chemically related to anesthetic agents of the para-amino-benzoic
acid class (e.g. procaine; tetracaine) and has been associated with adverse
CNS effects possibly related to a prior sensitivity to related agents or
interaction with concomitant medication. </P>

<P>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Release of Benzonatate from the perle in the
mouth can produce a temporary local anesthesia of the oral mucosa and choking
could occur. Therefore, the perles should be swallowed without chewing.
</P>

<P>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies
have not been conducted with Benzonatate. It is also not known whether
Benzonatate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman
or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzonatate should be given to a pregnant
woman only if clearly needed. </P>

<P>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be exercised
when Benzonatate is administered to a nursing woman. </P>

<P>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Carcinogenicity,
mutagenicity, and reproduction studies have not been conducted with Benzonatate.
</P>

<P>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
10 has not been established. </P>

<P><A NAME="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></A><B>ADVERSE REACTIONS </B></P>

<P>Potential Adverse Reactions to Benzonatate may include: </P>

<P>Hypersensitivity reactions including bronchospasm, laryngospasm, cardiovascular
collapse possibly related to local anesthesia from chewing or sucking the
perle. </P>

<P>CNS: sedation; headache; dizziness; mental confusion; visual hallucinations.
</P>

<P>GI: constipation, nausea, GI upset. </P>

<P>DERMATOLOGIC: pruritus; skin eruptions. </P>

<P>OTHER: nasal congestion; sensation of burning in the eyes; vague &quot;chilly&quot;
sensation; numbness of the chest; hypersensitivity. </P>

<P>Rare instances of deliberate or accidental overdose have resulted in
death. </P>

<P><A NAME="OVERDOSAGE"></A><B>OVERDOSAGE </B></P>

<P>Overdose may result in death. </P>

<P>The drug is chemically related to tetracaine and other topical anesthetics
and shares various aspects of their pharmacology and toxicology. Drugs
of this type are generally well absorbed after ingestion. </P>

<P>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS </P>

<P>If perles are chewed or dissolved in the mouth, oropharyngeal anesthesia
will develop rapidly. CNS stimulation may cause restlessness and tremors
which may proceed to clonic convulsions followed by profound CNS depression.
TREATMENT </P>

<P>Evacuate gastric contents and administer copious amounts of activated
charcoal slurry. Even in the conscious patient, cough and gag reflexes
may be so depressed as to necessitate special attention to protection against
aspiration of gastric contents and orally administered materials. Convulsions
should be treated with a short-acting barbiturate given intravenously and
carefully titrated for the smallest effective dosage. Intensive support
of respiration and cardiovascular-renal function is an essential feature
of the treatment of severe intoxication from overdosage. </P>

<P>Do not use CNS stimulants. </P>

<P><A NAME="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></A><B>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>

<P>Adults and Children over 10: Usual dose is one 100 mg perle t.i.d. as
required. If necessary, up to 6 perles daily may be given. </P>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets are film coated with cellulose
acetate phthalate to prevent disintegration of the tablet in the stomach
and thus reduce possible irritation of the gastric mucosa. </p>

<p>Sulfasalazine Tablets, 500 mg for Oral Administration </p>

<p>THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION: Anti-inflammatory agent. </p>

<p>CHEMICAL DESIGNATION: 5-((p-(2-Pyridylsulfamoyl) phenyl)azo) salicylic
acid. C18H14N405S </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>After oral administration, Sulfasalazine is partially absorbed and extensively
metabolized as described below. </p>

<p>About one-third of a given dose of sulfasalazine (SS) is absorbed from
the small intestine. The remaining two-thirds pass to the colon where the
compound is split (presumably by intestinal bacteria) into its components,
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine (SP). Most of the SP thus
liberated is absorbed whereas only about one-third of the 5-ASA is absorbed,
the remainder being excreted in the feces. The distribution, metabolism,
and excretion of SS and its two components are as follows: </p>

<p>Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets </p>

<p>SULFASALAZINE (SS): Detectable serum concentrations of SS have been
found in healthy subjects within 90 minutes after the ingestion of a single
2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets. Maximum concentrations
of SS occur between 3 and 12 hours, with the mean peak concentration (6
mcg/ml) occurring at 6 hours. Small amounts of SS are excreted unchanged
in the urine. </p>

<p>SULFAPYRIDINE (SP): Following absorption and distribution, SP is acetylated
and hydroxylated in the liver, and then conjugated with glucuronic acid.
After ingestion of a single 2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets
by healthy subjects, peak concentrations of SP and its various metabolites
appear in the serum between 12 and 24 hours, with peak concentration (13
mcg/ml) occurring at 12 and lasting until 24 hours. The total recovery
of SS and its SP metabolites from the urine of healthy subjects 3 days
after the administration of a single 2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Enteric
coated tablets averaged 81%. </p>

<p>5-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID (5-ASA): The serum concentration of 5-ASA in patients
with ulcerative colitis was found to range from 0 to 4 mcg/ml, and to exist
mainly in the form of free 5-ASA. The urinary recovery of this compound
was mostly in the acetylated form. </p>

<p>Sulfasalazine TABLETS: </p>

<p>SULFASALAZINE (SS): Detectable serum concentrations of SS have been
found in healthy subjects within 90 minutes after the ingestion of a single
2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Tablets. Maximum concentrations of SS occur between
1.5 and 6 hours, with the mean peak concentration (14 mcg/ml) occurring
at 3 hours. Small amounts of SS are excreted unchanged in the urine. </p>

<p>SULFAPYRIDINE (SP): Following absorption and distribution, SP is acetylated
and hydroxylated in the liver, and then conjugated with glucuronic acid.
After ingestion of a single 2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Tablets by healthy
subjects, SP and its various metabolites appear in the serum within 3 to
6 hours. Maximum concentrations of total SP occur between 6 and 24 hours,
with the mean peak concentration (21 mcg/ml) occurring at 12 hours. The
total recovery of SS and its SP metabolites from the urine of healthy subjects
3 days after the administration of a single 2 g dose of Sulfasalazine Tablets
averaged 91%. </p>

<p>5-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID (5-ASA): The serum concentration of 5-ASA in patients
with ulcerative colitis was found to range from 0 to 4 mcg/ml, and to exist
mainly in the form of free- 5-ASA. The urinary recovery of this compound
was mostly in the acetylated form. </p>

<p>Mean serum concentrations of total SP, i.e. SP and its metabolites,
tend to be significantly greater in patients with a slow acetylator phenotype
than in those with a fast acetylator phenotype. Total serum sulfapyridine
concentrations greater than 50 mcg/ml appear to be associated with an increased
incidence of adverse reactions. </p>

<p>The mode of action of Sulfasalazine is still under investigation. It
may be related to the immunosuppressant properties that have been observed
in animal and IN VITRO models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or
to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver
and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals.
Sulfasalazine has also been described as a highly efficient vehicle for
carrying its principal metabolites, SP and 5-ASA, to the colon, where a
local action for both of them has been postulated. Recent clinical studies
utilizing rectal administration of SS, SP, and 5-ASA have indicated that
the major therapeutic action may reside in the 5- ASA moiety. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Sulfasalazine is indicated: </p>

<p>a. in the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and as adjunctive
therapy in severe ulcerative colitis. </p>

<p>b. for the prolongation of the remission period between acute attacks
of ulcerative colitis. </p>

<p>Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets are particularly indicated in patients
who cannot take the regular Sulfasalazine tablet because of gastrointestinal
intolerance, and in whom there is evidence that this intolerance is not
primarily due to high blood levels of sulfapyridine and its metabolites,
e.g. patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, etc., when taking the first
few doses of the drug or patients in whom a reduction in dosage does not
alleviate the gastrointestinal side effects. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine, its metabolites, sulfonamides or
salicylates. In infants under 2 years of age. Intestinal and urinary obstruction.
Patients with porphyria should not receive sulfonamides as these drugs
have been reported to precipitate an acute attack. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Only after critical appraisal should Sulfasalazine be used in patients
with hepatic or renal damage or blood dyscrasias. Deaths associated with
the administration of Sulfasalazine have been reported from hypersensitivity
reactions, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, other blood dyscrasias, renal
and liver damage, irreversible neuromuscular and CNS changes, and fibrosing
alveolitis. The presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever,
pallor, purpura, or jaundice may be indications of serious blood disorders.
Complete blood counts as well as urinalysis with careful microscopic examination
should be done frequently in patients receiving Sulfasalazine. Oligospermia
and infertility have been observed in men treated with Sulfasalazine. Withdrawal
of the drug appears to reverse these effects. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General: Sulfasalazine should be given with caution to patients with
severe allergy or bronchial asthma. Adequate fluid intake must be maintained
in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency should be observed closely for signs of hemolytic
anemia. This reaction is frequently dose related. If toxic or hypersensitivity
reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued immediately. </p>

<p>Isolated instances have been reported when Sulfasalazine Enteric coated
tablets have passed undisintegrated. This may be due to a lack of intestinal
esterases in these patients. If this is observed, the administration of
Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets should be discontinued immediately.
</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be informed of the possibility
of adverse reactions and of the need for careful medical supervision. They
should also be made aware that ulcerative colitis rarely remits completely,
and that the risk of relapse can be substantially reduced by continued
administration of Sulfasalazine (at a maintenance dosage). </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to take Sulfasalazine in evenly divided
doses preferably after meals. Additionally, patients should be advised
that Sulfasalazine may produce an orange-yellow discoloration of the urine
or skin. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: The progress of the disease during treatment can be
evaluated by clinical criteria, including the presence of fever, weight
changes, degree and frequency of diarrhea and bleeding as well as by sigmoidoscopy
and the evaluation of biopsy samples. The determination of serum sulfapyridine
levels may be useful since concentrations greater than 50 mcg/ml appear
to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions. Complete
blood counts, as well as a urinalysis with careful microscopic examination
should be done frequently in patients receiving Sulfasalazine. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have
been reported when administered concomitantly with Sulfasalazine. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: The presence of Sulfasalazine or
its metabolites in body fluids has not been reported to interfere with
laboratory test procedures. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: There have been
no long- term studies of the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Sulfasalazine.
Impairment of male fertility was observed in reproductive studies performed
in rats and rabbits at doses up to six times the human dose. Oligospermia
and infertility have been described in men treated with Sulfasalazine.
Withdrawal of the drug appears to reverse these effects (see &quot;WARNINGS&quot;).
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats
and rabbits at doses up to 6 times the human dose and have revealed no
evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to Sulfasalazine.
</p>

<p>There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. A national survey evaluated the outcome of pregnancies associated
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a group of 186 women treated
with Sulfasalazine alone or Sulfasalazine and concomitant steroid therapy,
the incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality was comparable to that for
245 untreated IBD pregnancies as well as with population data from the
National Center for Health Statistics (REF. 1). Another study of 1,445
pregnancies associated with exposure to sulfonamides in which Sulfasalazine
was included indicated that this group of drugs appeared to be devoid of
any association with fetal malformation (REF. 2). A review of the medical
literature covering 1,155 pregnancies which occurred in women having ulcerative
colitis suggested that the outcome was similar to what was expected in
the general population (REF. 3). </p>

<p>No clinical studies have been performed which indicate the effect of
Sulfasalazine on the later growth, development and functional maturation
of children whose mothers received the drug during pregnancy. </p>

<p>NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Sulfasalazine and sulfapyridine pass the placental
barrier. Although sulfapyridine has been shown to have a poor bilirubin
displacing capacity, the potential for kernicterus in newborns should be
kept in mind. A case of agranulocytosis has been reported in an infant
whose mother was taking both Sulfasalazine and prednisone throughout pregnancy.
</p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Caution should be exercised when Sulfasalazine is administered
to a nursing woman. Sulfonamides are excreted in the milk. In the newborn,
they compete with bilirubin for binding sites on the plasma proteins and
may thus cause kernicterus. Insignificant amounts of uncleaved sulfasalazine
have been found in milk, whereas the sulfapyridine levels in milk are about
30-60 per cent of those in the serum. Sulfapyridine has been shown to have
a poor bilirubin displacing capacity. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
two years have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported when
administered concomitantly with Sulfasalazine. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The most common adverse reactions associated with Sulfasalazine are
anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and apparently reversible
oligospermia. These occur in about one-third of the patients. Less frequent
adverse reactions are skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, fever, Heinz body
anemia, hemolytic anemia and cyanosis which may occur at a frequency of
one in every thirty patients or less. Experience suggests that with a daily
dosage of 4 g or more, or total serum sulfapyridine levels above 50 mcg/ml,
the incidence of adverse reactions tends to increase. </p>

<p>Although the listing which follows includes a few adverse reactions
which have not been reported with this specific drug, the pharmacological
similarities among the sulfonamides require that each of these reactions
be considered when Sulfasalazine is administered. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions which occur rarely, in approximately 1 in 1000
patients or less are: </p>

<p>BLOOD DYSCRASIAS: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, megaloblastic
(macrocytic) anemia, purpura, thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinemia and
methemoglobinemia, congenital neutropenia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
</p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome),
exfoliative dermatitis, epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) with corneal
damage, anaphylaxis, serum sickness syndrome, pneumonitis with or without
eosinophilia, vasculitis, fibrosing alveolitis, pleuritis, pericarditis
with or without tamponade, allergic myocarditis, polyarteritis nodosa,
L.E. syndrome, hepatitis and hepatic necrosis with or without immune complexes,
parapsoriasis varioliformis acuta (Mucha-Haberman syndrome), rhabdomyolysis,
photosensitization, arthralgia, periorbital edema, conjunctival and scleral
injection and alopecia. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS: hepatitis, pancreatitis, bloody diarrhea,
impaired folic acid absorption, impaired digoxin absorption, stomatitis,
diarrhea, abdominal pains, and neutropenic enterocolitis. </p>

<p>CNS REACTIONS: transverse myelitis, convulsions, meningitis, transient
lesions of the posterior spinal column, cauda equina syndrome, Guillain-
Barre syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, mental depression, vertigo, hearing
loss, insomnia, ataxia, hallucinations, tinnitus and drowsiness. </p>

<p>RENAL REACTIONS: toxic nephrosis with oliguria and anuria, nephritis,
nephrotic syndrome, hematuria, crystalluria, proteinuria, and hemolytic-uremic
syndrome. </p>

<p>OTHER REACTIONS: urine discoloration and skin discoloration. The sulfonamides
bear certain chemical similarities to some goitrogens, diuretics (acetazolamide
and the thiazides), and oral hypoglycemic agents. Goiter production, diuresis,
and hypoglycemia have occurred rarely in patients receiving sulfonamides.
Cross-sensitivity may exist with these agents. </p>

<p>Rats appear to be especially susceptible to the goitrogenic effects
of sulfonamides and long-term administration has produced thyroid malignancies
in this species. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>None reported. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There is evidence that the incidence and severity of toxicity are directly
related to the total serum sulfapyridine concentration. Symptoms of overdosage
may include nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and abdominal pains. In
more advanced cases, CNS symptoms such as drowsiness, convulsions, etc.
may be observed. Serum sulfapyridine concentrations may be used to monitor
the progress of recovery from overdosage. </p>

<p>Experience suggests that with a daily dosage of 4g or more or total
serum sulfapyridine levels above 50 mcg/ml the incidence of adverse reactions
tends to increase. There are no documented reports of deaths due to ingestion
of large single doses of Sulfasalazine. </p>

<p>It has not been possible to determine the oral LD50 in laboratory animals
such as mice, since the highest daily oral dose which can be given (12
g/kg) is not lethal. Doses of Sulfasalazine of 16 g per day have been given
to patients without mortality. </p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OVERDOSAGE: Gastric lavage or emesis plus catharsis
as indicated. Alkalinize urine. If kidney function is normal, force fluids.
If anuria is present, restrict fluids and salt, and treat appropriately.
Catheterization of the ureters may be indicated for complete renal blockage
by crystals. The low molecular weight of Sulfasalazine and its metabolites
may facilitate their removal by dialysis. For agranulocytosis, discontinue
the drug immediately, hospitalize the patient and institute appropriate
therapy. For hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue treatment immediately.
Such reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary,
systemic corticosteroids. When in the physician's opinion, reinstitution
of Sulfasalazine is warranted, regimens modeled upon desensitization procedures
may be attempted approximately two weeks after Sulfasalazine has been discontinued
and symptoms have disappeared (see &quot;DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION&quot;).
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Dosage should be adjusted to each individual's response and tolerance.
The drug should be given in evenly divided doses over each 24-hour period;
intervals between nighttime doses should not exceed 8 hours, with administration
after meals recommended when feasible. Experience suggests that with daily
dosages of 4 g or more, the incidence of adverse reactions tends to increase;
hence, patients receiving these dosages should be instructed about and
carefully observed for the appearance of adverse effects. </p>

<p>Various desensitization-like regimens have been reported to be effective
in 34 of 53 patients (REF. 4), 7 of 8 patients (REF. 5) and 19 of 20 patients
(REF. 6). Upon reinstituting Sulfasalazine, such regimens comprise a total
daily dose of 50 to 250 mg which, every 4 to 7 days thereafter, is doubled
until the desired therapeutic level is achieved. If the symptoms of sensitivity
recur, Sulfasalazine should be discontinued. Desensitization should not
be attempted in patients who have a history of agranulocytosis or who have
experienced an anaphylactoid reaction while on a previous course of Sulfasalazine
therapy. </p>

<p>USUAL DOSAGE </p>

<p>INITIAL THERAPY </p>

<p>ADULTS: 3-4 g daily in evenly divided doses. In some cases it is advisable
to initiate therapy with a smaller dosage, e.g. 1-2 g daily, to lessen
adverse gastrointestinal effects. If daily doses exceeding 4 g are required
to achieve desired effects, the increased risk of toxicity should be kept
in mind. </p>

<p>CHILDREN, TWO YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER: 40-60 mg per kg body weight in
each 24- hour period, divided into 3-6 doses. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE THERAPY: ADULTS: 2 g daily. CHILDREN TWO YEARS OF AGE AND
OLDER: 30 mg per kg body weight in each 24-hour period, divided into 4
doses. Response to therapy and adjustment of dosage should be determined
by periodic examination. It is often necessary to continue medication,
even when clinical symptoms, including diarrhea, have been controlled.
When endoscopic examination confirms satisfactory improvement, dosage is
reduced to a maintenance level. If symptoms of gastric intolerance (anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, etc.) occur after the first few doses of Sulfasalazine,
they are probably due to mucosal irritation and may be alleviated by distributing
the total daily dose more evenly over the day or by giving enteric-coated
Enteric coated tablets. If diarrhea recurs, dosage should be increased
to previous effective levels. If such symptoms occur after the first few
days of treatment with Sulfasalazine Enteric coated tablets, they are probably
due to increased serum levels of total sulfapyridine, and may be alleviated
by halving the dose and subsequently increasing it gradually over several
days. If symptoms continue, the drug should be stopped for 5 to 7 days,
then reinstituted at a lower daily dose. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Hyoscyamine is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components
of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C17H23NO3)2.H2SO4.2H2O
and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid,
alpha- (hydroxymethyl)-,8-methyl- 8- azabicyclo(3.2.1.)oct-3-yl ester,(3(S)-
endo)-,sulfate(2:1),dihydrate. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Hyoscyamine inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures
innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that
respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral
cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the
smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular
node, and the exocrine glands. It is completely devoid of any action in
the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive
motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine also controls
excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. </p>

<p>Hyoscyamine is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration
as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, Hyoscyamine disappears rapidly
from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life
of Hyoscyamine is 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine is partly hydrolyzed to tropic
acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine
unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found
in breast milk. Hyoscyamine passes the blood brain barrier and the placental
barrier. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Hyoscyamine is effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic
ulcer. It can also be used to control gastric secretion, visceral spasm,
and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm,
and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders
to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis,
and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment
of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis)
and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also as adjunctive therapy in
the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances including
the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon. Also used in the treatment
of infant colic (elixir and drops). Hyoscyamine is indicated along with
morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal
colic; as a &quot;drying agent&quot; in the relief of symptoms of acute
rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors
and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in
the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents. </p>

<p>Parenterally administered Hyoscyamine is also effective in reducing
gastrointestinal motility to facilitate diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy
or hypotonic duodenography. Hyoscyamine may be used to reduce pain and
hypersecretion in pancreatitis. Hyoscyamine may also be used in certain
cases of partial heart block associated with vagal activity. </p>

<p>IN ANESTHESIA </p>

<p>Hyoscyamine Injection is indicated as a pre-operative antimuscarinic
to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions; to reduce
the volume and acidity of gastric secretions, and to block cardiac vagal
inhibitory reflexes during induction of anesthesia and intubation. Hyoscyamine
protects against the peripheral muscarinic effects such as bradycardia
and excessive secretions produced by halogenated hydrocarbons and cholinergic
agents such as physostigmine, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine given to
reverse the actions of curariform agents. </p>

<p>IN UROLOGY </p>

<p>Hyoscyamine Injection may also be used intravenously to improve radiologic
visibility of the kidneys. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction
due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal
tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal
atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status
in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating
ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration
can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating).
Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction,
especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment
with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other
anticholinergic agents, Hyoscyamine may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.
In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities
requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery
or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. </p>

<p>Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic
drugs. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short
term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, decreased
anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate
affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12-48 hours
after discontinuation of the drug. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism,
coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias,
hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving
any anticholinergic drug since they may increase the heart rate. Use with
caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis.
</p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients
should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other
tasks requiring mental alertness. </p>

<p>Use of Hyoscyamine may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration,
fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated
environmental temperatures should use caution. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur
when Hyoscyamine is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics,
amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors,
tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. </p>

<p>Antacids may interfere with the absorption of Hyoscyamine; take Hyoscyamine
before meals and antacids after meals. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>No long term studies in animals have been performed to determine the
carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of Hyoscyamine;
however, over 30 years of marketing experience shows no demonstrable evidence
of a problem. </p>

<p>Pregnancy--Pregnancy Category C </p>

<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Hyoscyamine.
It is also not known whether Hyoscyamine can cause fetal harm when administered
to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine should
be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Hyoscyamine is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when
Hyoscyamine is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur
when Hyoscyamine is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics,
amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors,
tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. </p>

<p>Antacids may interfere with the absorption of Hyoscyamine; take Hyoscyamine
before meals and antacids after meals. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Not all of the following adverse reactions have been reported with hyoscyamine
sulfate. The following adverse reactions have been reported for pharmacologically
similar drugs with anticholinergic/antispasmodic action. </p>

<p>Adverse reactions may include dryness of the mouth; urinary hesitancy
and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitations; mydriasis; cycloplegia;
increased ocular tension; loss of taste; headache; nervousness; drowsiness;
weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression
of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; allergic reactions or drug
idiosyncrasies; urticaria and other dermal manifestations; ataxia; speech
disturbance; some degree of mental confusion and/or excitement (especially
in elderly persons); and decreased sweating. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The signs and symptoms of overdose are headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred
vision, dilated pupils, hot dry skin, dizziness, dryness of the mouth,
difficulty in swallowing and CNS stimulation. </p>

<p>Measures to be taken are immediate lavage of the stomach and injection
of physostigmine 0.5 to 2 mg intravenously and repeated as necessary up
to a total of 5 mg. Fever may be treated symptomatically (tepid water sponge
baths, hypothermic blanket). Excitement to a degree which demands attention
may be managed with sodium thiopental 2% solution given slowly intravenously
or chloral hydrate (100-200 mL of a 2% solution) by rectal infusion. In
the event of progression of the curare-like effect to paralysis of the
respiratory muscles, artificial respiration should be instituted and maintained
until effective respiratory action returns. </p>

<p>In rats, the LD50 for Hyoscyamine is 375 mg/kg. Hyoscyamine is dialyzable.

Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although

the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other

alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the

difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce

the likelihood of implantation).

<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

</b> <p>

Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table I lists the typical accidental

pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods

of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except

sterilization, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct

and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

CIGARETTE SMOKING INCREASES THE RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR SIDE EFFECTS

FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE. THIS RISK INCREASES WITH AGE AND WITH HEAVY

SMOKING (15 OR MORE CIGARETTES PER DAY) AND IS QUITE MARKED IN WOMEN OVER 35

YEARS OF AGE. WOMEN WHO USE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES SHOULD BE STRONGLY ADVISED NOT

TO SMOKE.  

 
<p>
The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several

serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke,

hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious

morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying

factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the

presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias 

obesity and diabetes.  

 
<p>
Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the

following information relating to these risks.  

 
<p>
The information contained in this package insert is principally based on

studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher

formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The

effect of long term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of

both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.  

 
<p>
Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: 

retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case

control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a

Ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that

among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual

clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of

attributable risk, which is the Difference in the incidence of disease between

oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide

information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (adapted 

from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the

reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.  

 
<p>
1. THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND OTHER VASCULAR PROBLEMS 
<p>
 

a. Myocardial Infarction 

 
<p>
An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been associated with oral

contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other

underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension,

hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart

attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six 

(REF. 4-10). The risk is very low under the age of 30.  

 <p>

Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute 

substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid

thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases

(REF. 11). Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown

to increase substantially in smokers, especially in those 35 years of age and

older among women who use oral contraceptives.  

 
<p>
<! TABLE II. (Adapted from P.M. Layde and V. Beral, ref. #12.) > 

 <p>

Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such

as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity (REF. 13). In

particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause

glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism

(REF.  14-18). Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure

among users (see section 9 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have

been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives

must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.  

 
<p>
b. Thromboembolism 

 
<p>
An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the

use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found 

the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode

of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary 

embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous

thromboembolic disease (REF. 2,3,19-24). Cohort studies have shown the relative 

risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases

requiring hospitalization (REF. 25). The risk of thromboembolic disease

associated with oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and

disappears after pill use is stopped (REF. 2).  

 
<p>
A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic

complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives (REF. 9). 

The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing

conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions (REF. 26). If 

feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior

to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an

increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged

immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with

an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no

earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast feed. 

 <p>

c. Cerebrovascular diseases 
<p>
 

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and

attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic

strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years),

hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor

for both users and non-users, for both types of strokes, and smoking interacted 

to increase the risk of stroke (REF. 27-29).  

 
<p>
In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to

range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension

(REF. 30). The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for

non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral

contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for

normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension (REF. 30). The

attributable risk is also greater in older women (REF. 3).  

 
<p>
d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives 
<p>
 

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and

progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease (REF.  31

33). A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with

many progestational agents (REF. 14-16). A decline in serum high density

lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart

disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral

contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and

progestogen and the activity of the progestogen used in the contraceptive. The

activity and amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an

oral contraceptive.  

 
<p>
Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good

principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination 

the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of

estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the

needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptives agents

should be started on preparations containing 0.035 mg or less of estrogen.  

 
<p>
e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have

shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral

contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing

myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at

least 9 years for women 40-49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five

or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups 

(REF. 8). In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing

cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of 

oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small (REF. 34). However,

both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50

micrograms or higher of estrogens.  

 
<p>
2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE 

 
<p>
One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the

mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different

ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated 

with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event 

of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and

risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users

35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated

with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with

childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for

oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's (35). Current

clinical recommendation involved the use of lower estrogen dose formulations

and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and

Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral

contraceptives in women 40 years of age and older. The Committee concluded that 

although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive

use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer and low-dose 

formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with

pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical

procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective 

and acceptable means of contraception. The committee recommended that the

benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over

40 may outweigh the possible risks.  
<p>
 

Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take

a n oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and

progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient

needs.

3. CARCINOMA OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS 

<p> 

Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast 

endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. 

While there are conflicting reports most studies suggest that use of oral

contraceptives is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of

developing breast cancer. Some studies have reported an increased relative risk 

of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age. This increased

relative risk appears to be related to duration of use (REF. 36-43,79-89).  

 <p>

Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an

increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations

of women (REF. 45-48). However, there continues to be controversy about the

extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and

other factors.  

 
<p>
4. HEPATIC NEOPLASIA 
<p>
 

Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although

the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect

calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3

cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use

especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose (REF. 49). Rupture of benign 

hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (REF. 50

51).  

 <p>

Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular

carcinoma (REF. 52-54) in long-term (&gt;8 years) oral contraceptive users. 

However, these cancers are rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the

excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less

than one per million users.  

 
<p>
5. OCULAR LESIONS 

 <p>

There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the 

use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there 

is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or

diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and

therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.  

 <p>

6. ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE BEFORE OR DURING EARLY PREGNANCY 

 <p>

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth

defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy (REF.  56 

57). The majority of recent studies also do not indicate a teratogenic effect,

particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are

concerned (REF. 55,56,58,59), when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.  

 
<p>
The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should

not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used

during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.  

 
<p>
It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods

(or after 45 days from the last menstrual period if the progestogen-only oral

contraceptives are used), pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral

contraceptive use. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule,

the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first

missed period or upon missing one tablet. Oral contraceptive use

should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.  

 <p>

7. GALLBLADDER DISEASE 

 <p>

Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of

gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens (REF. 60,61). 

 <p>

More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing

gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal (REF. 62-64). 

The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral

contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and

progestogens.  

        <p>

8. CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID METABOLIC EFFECTS 

 
<p>
Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in 

a significant percentage of users (REF. 17). This effect has been shown to be

directly related to estrogen dose (REF. 65). Progestogens increase insulin

secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different

progestational agents (REF. 17,66). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral

contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (REF. 67). 

Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women in

particular should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.  
<p>
 

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on

the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a and 1d), changes in serum

triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive

users.  

 <p>

9. ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE 
<p>
 

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral

contraceptives (REF. 68) and this increase is more likely in older oral

contraceptive users (REF. 69) and with extended duration of use (REF. 61). Data 

from the Royal College of General Practitioners (REF. 12) and subsequent

randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with

increasing progestational activity.  

 
<p>
Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal 

disease (REF. 70) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.  

If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and 

if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should

be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal

after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is not difference in the

occurrence of hypertension between former and never users (REF. 68-71).  

 <p>

10. HEADACHE 

 <p>

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new

pattern which is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of

oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.  

 <p>

11. BLEEDING IRREGULARITIES 
<p>
 

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on

oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non

hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to

rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in

the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time 

or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of

amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. An alteration in menstrual patterns

is likely to occur in women using progestogen-only contraceptives. The amount

and duration of flow, cycle length, breakthrough bleeding, spotting and

amenorrhea will probably be quite variable. Bleeding irregularities occur more

frequently with the use of progestogen-only oral contraceptives than with the

combinations and the dropout rate due to such conditions is higher.  

 <p>

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially

when such a condition was preexistent.  

       <p> 

12. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY 
<p>
 

Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.  

However, in progestogen-only oral contraceptive failures, the ratio of ectopic

to intrauterine pregnancies is higher than in women who are not receiving oral

contraceptives, since the drugs are more effective in preventing intrauterine

than ectopic pregnancies.  


<p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 

</b> 
<p>
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND FOLLOW UP 

 <p>

A complete medical history and physical examination should be taken prior to

the initiation or reinstitution of oral contraceptives and at least annually

during use of oral contraceptives. These physical examinations should include

special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs,

including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of

undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate

diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a

strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be

monitored with particular care.  

 <p>

2. LIPID DISORDERS 

 
<p>
Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if

they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels 

and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.  

 
<p>
3. LIVER FUNCTION 

 
<p>
If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should

be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with

impaired liver function.  

 <p>

4. FLUID RETENTION 
<p>
 

Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be

prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with

conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.  

 
<p>
5. EMOTIONAL DISORDERS 

 <p>

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug

discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.  
<p>
 

6. CONTACT LENSES 

 <p>

Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance

should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.  

 <p>
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 

 
<p>
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual 

irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar 

association, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates,

phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, and possibly with griseofulvin, ampicillin

and tetracyclines (REF. 72).  

        <p>

8. INTERACTIONS WITH LABORATORY TESTS 

 <p>

Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected 

by oral contraceptives:  

 <p>

a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased

antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.  

 <p>

b. Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating

total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column

or by radio-immunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the

elevated TBG, free T4 concentration is unaltered.  

 <p>

c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.  

 <p>

d. Sex-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total

circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active

levels remain unchanged.  
<p>
 

e. Triglycerides may be increased.  

 <p>

f. Glucose tolerance may be decreased.  

 <p>

g. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may 

be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after

discontinuing oral contraceptives.  

 
<p>

10. PREGNANCY 

 <p>

Pregnancy Category X. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.  

 <p>

11. NURSING MOTHERS 
<p>
 

Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk

of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported,

including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives

given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the

quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be

advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception

until she has completely weaned her child.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES 

 <p>

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for

patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all 

cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be

borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from

the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or 

malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another

formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a

higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual

irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk 

of thromboembolic disease.  

 <p>

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:  

 <p>

1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility

of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period (or

upon missing one MICRONOR Tablet) and oral contraceptive use should be

discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.  
<p>
 

2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two

consecutive periods (or after 45 days from the last menstrual period if the

progestogen-only oral contraceptives are used), pregnancy should be ruled out

before continuing oral contraceptive use.

<P><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION </B></P>

<P>Haloperidol is the first of the butyrophenone series of major tranquilizers.
The chemical designation is 4-(4-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidino)-4'-
fluorobutyrophenone. </P>

<P><A NAME="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></A><B>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</B></P>

<P>The precise mechanism of action has not been clearly established. </P>

<P><A NAME="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></A><B>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </B></P>

<P>Haloperidol haloperidol is indicated for use in the management of manifestations
of psychotic disorders. </P>

<P>Haloperidol is indicated for the control of tics and vocal utterances
of Tourette's Disorder in children and adults. </P>

<P>Haloperidol is effective for the treatment of severe behavior problems
in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be
accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also effective
in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive
motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or
all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention,
aggressivity, mood lability and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol
should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure
to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></A><B>CONTRAINDICATIONS </B></P>

<P>Haloperidol is contraindicated in severe toxic central nervous system
depression or comatose states from any cause and in individuals who are
hypersensitive to this drug or have Parkinson's disease. </P>

<P><A NAME="WARNINGS"></A><B>WARNINGS </B></P>

<P>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA </P>

<P>A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic
movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although
the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly,
especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates
to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients
are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products
differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. </P>

<P>Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that
it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of
treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered
to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much
less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. </P>

<P>There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia,
although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic
treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress
(or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby
may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression
has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown </P>

<P>Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed
in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia.
Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients
who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic
drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially
less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who
do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration
of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought.
The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. </P>

<P>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics,
drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require
treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. </P>

<P>(For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia
and its clinical detection, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </P>

<P>NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS) </P>

<P>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic
Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic
drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity,
altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic
instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis,
and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine
phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.
</P>

<P>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.
In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the
clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia,
systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal
signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential
diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever
and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. </P>

<P>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of
antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy,
2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment
of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments
are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological
treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. </P>

<P>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from
NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.
The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have
been reported. </P>

<P>Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom
complex, have also been reported with Haloperidol. </P>

<P>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </P>

<P>Rodents given 2 to 20 times the usual maximum human dose of haloperidol
by oral or parenteral routes showed an increase in incidence of resorption,
reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality. No teratogenic effect
has been reported in rats, rabbits or dogs at dosages within this range,
but cleft palate has been observed in mice given 15 times the usual maximum
human dose. Cleft palate in mice appears to be a non-specific response
to stress or nutritional imbalance as well as to a variety of drugs, and
there is no evidence to relate this phenomenon to predictable human risk
for most of these agents. </P>

<P>There are no well controlled studies with Haloperidol haloperidol in
pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations
observed following maternal use of Haloperidol along with other drugs which
have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Causal relationships were not established in these cases. Since such experience
does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to Haloperidol, this
drug should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant
only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants
should not be nursed during drug treatment. </P>

<P>COMBINED USE OF Haloperidol AND LITHIUM </P>

<P>An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever,
tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated
serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS) followed by irreversible brain damage has
occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus Haloperidol. A causal
relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of
lithium and Haloperidol has not been established; however, patients receiving
such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of
neurological toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs
appear. </P>

<P>GENERAL </P>

<P>A number of cases of bronchopneumonia, some fatal, have followed the
use of antipsychotic drugs, including Haloperidol. It has been postulated
that lethargy and decreased sensation of thirst due to central inhibition
may lead to dehydration, hemoconcentration and reduced pulmonary ventilation.
Therefore, if the above signs and symptoms appear, especially in the elderly,
the physician should institute remedial therapy promptly. </P>

<P>Although not reported with Haloperidol, decreased serum cholesterol
and/or cutaneous and ocular changes have been reported in patients receiving
chemically-related drugs. </P>

<P>Haloperidol may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required
for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving
a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be warned accordingly. </P>

<P>The use of alcohol with this drug should be avoided due to possible
additive effects and hypotension. </P>

<P><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS"></A><B>PRECAUTIONS </B></P>

<P>Haloperidol haloperidol should be administered cautiously to patients:
</P>

<P>--with severe cardiovascular disorders, because of the possibility of
transient hypotension and/or precipitation of anginal pain. Should hypotension
occur and a vasopressor be required, epinephrine should not be used since
Haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further
lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine
or norepinephrine should be used. </P>

<P>--receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures,
or with EEG abnormalities, because Haloperidol may lower the convulsive
threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly
maintained. </P>

<P>--with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs.
</P>

<P>--receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of interference
occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant (phenindione). </P>

<P>If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to
be continued after Haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference
in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal
symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase
in intraocular pressure when anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson
agents, are administered concomitantly with Haloperidol. </P>

<P>As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that Haloperidol
may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates,
and alcohol. </P>

<P>When Haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there
may be a rapid mood swing to depression. </P>

<P>Severe neurotoxicity (rigidity, inability to walk or talk) may occur
in patients with thyrotoxicosis who are also receiving antipsychotic medication,
including Haloperidol. </P>

<P>No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames Salmonella
microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings
have been obtained in In Vitro and In Vivo studies of effects of haloperidol
on chromosome structure and number. The available cytogenetic evidence
is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time. </P>

<P>Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar
rats (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 24 months) and in Albino Swiss mice
(dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 18 months). In the rat study survival
was less than optimal in all dose groups, reducing the number of rats at
risk for developing tumors. However, although a relatively greater number
of rats survived to the end of the study in high dose male and female groups,
these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors than control animals.
Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of
a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at
doses up to 20 times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant
patients. </P>

<P>In female mice at 5 and 20 times the highest initial daily dose for
chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically significant increase
in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence; at 20 times the same
daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary
gland neoplasia. In male mice, no statistically significant differences
in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. </P>

<P>Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists
during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that
approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent
In Vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these
drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer.
Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and
impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum
prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms
has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic
drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to
date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration
of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered
too limited to be conclusive at this time. </P>

<P><A NAME="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></A><B>ADVERSE REACTIONS </B></P>

<P>CNS EFFECTS: </P>

<P>Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)--EPS during the administration of Haloperidol
have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment.
EPS can be categorized generally as Parkinson-like symptoms, akathisia,
or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can
occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater
severity at higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions
or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate USP
or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride USP. It should be noted that persistent
EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases.
</P>

<P>Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs--Generally, patients receiving
short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of
antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience
transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these
cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome
described below under &quot;Tardive Dyskinesia&quot; except for duration.
It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will
reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs
but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually
withdraw use of Haloperidol. </P>

<P>Tardive Dyskinesia--As with all antipsychotic agents Haloperidol has
been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome
consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements,
may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug
therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly
patients on high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent
and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized
by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g.,
protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements).
Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities
and the trunk. </P>

<P>There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson
agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested
that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear.
Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage
of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome
may be masked. </P>

<P>It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may
be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped
at that time the full syndrome may not develop. </P>

<P>Tardive Dystonia--Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome,
has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is characterized by delayed onset
of choreic or dystonic movements, is often persistent, and has the potential
of becoming irreversible. </P>

<P>Other CNS Effects--Insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, euphoria, agitation,
drowsiness, depression, lethargy, headache, confusion, vertigo, grand mal
seizures, exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations,
and catatonic-like behavioral states which may be responsive to drug withdrawal
and/or treatment with anticholinergic drugs. </P>

<P>BODY AS A WHOLE: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), hyperpyrexia
and heat stroke have been reported with Haloperidol. (See WARNINGS for
further information concerning NMS.) </P>

<P>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS: Tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension and ECG
changes including prolongation of the Q-T interval and ECG pattern changes
compatible with the polymorphous configuration of torsades de pointes </P>

<P>HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS: Reports have appeared citing the occurrence of
mild and usually transient leukopenia and leukocytosis, minimal decreases
in red blood cell counts, anemia, or a tendency toward lymphomonocytosis.
Agranulocytosis has rarely been reported to have occurred with the use
of Haloperidol, and then only in association with other medication. </P>

<P>LIVER EFFECTS: Impaired liver function and/or jaundice have been reported.
</P>

<P>DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Maculopapular and acneiform skin reactions and
isolated cases of photosensitivity and loss of hair. </P>

<P>ENDOCRINE DISORDERS: Lactation, breast engorgement, mastalgia, menstrual
irregularities, gynecomastia, impotence, increased libido, hyperglycemia,
hypoglycemia and hyponatremia. </P>

<P>GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS: Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, hypersalivation,
dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting. </P>

<P>AUTONOMIC REACTIONS: Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, diaphoresis
and priapism. </P>

<P>RESPIRATORY EFFECTS: Laryngospasm, bronchospasm and increased depth
of respiration. </P>

<P>SPECIAL SENSES: Cataracts, retinopathy and visual disturbances. </P>

<P>OTHER: Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association
with the administration of Haloperidol. The nature of the evidence makes
it impossible to determine definitively what role, if any, Haloperidol
played in the outcome of the reported cases. The possibility that Haloperidol
caused death cannot, of course, be excluded, but it is to be kept in mind
that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients when they
go untreated or when they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs. </P>

<P>POSTMARKETING EVENTS: Hyperammonemia has been reported in a 5 1/2 year
old child with citrullinemia, an inherited disorder of ammonia excretion,
following treatment with Haloperidol. </P>

<P><A NAME="OVERDOSAGE"></A><B>OVERDOSAGE </B></P>

<P>MANIFESTATIONS </P>

<P>In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known
pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which
would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation.
The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension
which could be severe enough to produce a shock-like state. The extrapyramidal
reaction would be manifest by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized
or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans types respectively.
With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred
in a two-year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with torsades
de pointes should be considered. (For further information regarding torsades
de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </P>

<P>TREATMENT </P>

<P>Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out immediately
followed by administration of activated charcoal. Since there is no specific
antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. A patent airway must be established
by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged
cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted
by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and circulatory
collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated
albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and
norepinephrine. Epinephrine should not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal
reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital
signs should be monitored especially for signs of Q-T prolongation or dysrhythmias
and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. Severe arrhythmias
should be treated with appropriate anti-arrhythmic measures. </P>

<P><A NAME="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></A><B>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>

<P>There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount
of medication required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs,
dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of
each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be
carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.
</P>

<P>To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the
patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic
drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated
or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions
to antipsychotic drugs, may require less Haloperidol haloperidol. The optimal
response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage
adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below. </P>

<P>Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations: </P>

<P>ORAL ADMINISTRATION </P>

<P>Initial Dosage Range </P>

<P>Adults</P>

To achieve prompt control, higher doses may be required in some cases.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Geriatric or Debilitated Patients                          0.5 mg to 2.0 mg
                                                              b.i.d. or t.i.d.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></PRE>

<P>PATIENTS WHO REMAIN SEVERELY DISTURBED OR INADEQUATELY CONTROLLED MAY
REQUIRE DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT. DAILY DOSAGES UP TO 100 MG MAY BE NECESSARY
IN SOME CASES TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL RESPONSE. INFREQUENTLY, Haloperidol
HAS BEEN USED IN DOSES ABOVE 100 MG FOR SEVERELY RESISTANT PATIENTS; HOWEVER,
THE LIMITED CLINICAL USAGE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THE SAFETY OF PROLONGED
ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH DOSES. </P>

<P>Children </P>

<P>The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of
3 and 12 years (weight range 15 to 40 kg). Haloperidol is not intended
for children under 3 years old. Therapy should begin at the lowest dose
possible (0.5 mg per day). If required, the dose should be increased by
an increment of 0.5 mg at 5 to 7 day intervals until the desired therapeutic
effect is obtained. (See chart below). The total dose may be divided, to
be given b.i.d. or t.i.d.</P>

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></PRE>

<P>SEVERELY DISTURBED PSYCHOTIC CHILDREN MAY REQUIRE HIGHER DOSES. IN SEVERELY
DISTURBED, NON-PSYCHOTIC CHILDREN OR IN HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN WITH ACCOMPANYING
CONDUCT DISORDERS, WHO HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND TO PSYCHOTHERAPY OR MEDICATIONS
OTHER THAN ANTIPSYCHOTICS, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT SINCE THESE BEHAVIORS
MAY BE SHORT-LIVED, SHORT-TERM ADMINISTRATION OF Haloperidol MAY SUFFICE.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE ESTABLISHING A MAXIMUM EFFECTIVE DOSAGE. THERE IS
LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT BEHAVIOR IMPROVEMENT IS FURTHER ENHANCED IN DOSAGES
BEYOND 6 MG PER DAY. </P>

<P>MAINTENANCE DOSAGE </P>

<P>Upon achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response, dosage should then
be gradually reduced to the lowest effective maintenance level. </P>

<P>INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION </P>

<P>Adults </P>

<P>Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to
5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated patient with
moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of
the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every
hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory. </P>

<P>Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular
administration in children have not been conducted. </P>

<P>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate
matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and
container permit. </P>

<P>SWITCHOVER PROCEDURE </P>

<P>The oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable.
In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between
these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested.
For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral
dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose
is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring
of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation,
and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several
days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments,
either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the
patient's clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12-24
hours following the last parenteral dose. </P>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 

</b><p>USE IN PREGNANCY 

 <p>

WHEN USED IN PREGNANCY DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, ACE INHIBITORS<p>

CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH TO THE DEVELOPING FETUS. When pregnancy is

detected, Captopril should be discontinued as soon as possible. SEE WARNINGS: 

FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.  
<p>
 

 

Captopril  is a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin I-

converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of

angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  

 
<p>
Captopril  is designated chemically as 1-((2S)-3-mercapto-2-

methylpropionyl)-L-proline (MW 217.29).  

 
<p>
Captopril is a white to off-white crystalline powder that may have a slight

sulfurous odor; it is soluble in water (approx. 160 mg/mL), methanol, and

ethanol and sparingly soluble in chloroform and ethyl acetate.  

 <p>

<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 

</b> <p>

MECHANISM OF ACTION 

 
<p>
The mechanism of action of Captopril  has not yet been fully

elucidated. Its beneficial effects in hypertension and heart failure appear to

result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  

However, there is no consistent correlation between renin levels and response

to the drug. Renin, an enzyme synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the

circulation where it acts on a plasma globulin substrate to produce angiotensin 

I, a relatively inactive decapeptide. Angiotensin I is then converted by

angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II, a potent endogenous

vasoconstrictor substance. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion 

from the adrenal cortex, thereby contributing to sodium and fluid retention.  

 <p>

Captopril  prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II

by inhibition of ACE, a peptidyldipeptide carboxy hydrolase. This inhibition

has been demonstrated in both healthy human subjects and in animals by showing

that the elevation of blood pressure caused by exogenously administered

angiotensin I was attenuated or abolished by captopril. In animal studies,

captopril did not alter the pressor responses to a number of other agents,

including angiotensin II and norepinephrine, indicating specificity of action.  

 <p>

ACE is identical to &quot;bradykininase&quot;, and Captopril  may also interfere 

with the degradation of the vasodepressor peptide, bradykinin. Increased

concentrations of bradykinin or prostaglandin E2 may also have a role in the

therapeutic effect of Captopril.  

 <p>

Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II and increased

plasma renin activity (PRA), the latter resulting from loss of negative

feedback on renin release caused by reduction in angiotensin II. The reduction

of angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion, and, as a result,

small increases in serum potassium may occur along with sodium and fluid loss.  

 <p>

The antihypertensive effects persist for a longer period of time than does

demonstrable inhibition of circulating ACE. It is not known whether the ACE

present in vascular endothelium is inhibited longer than the ACE in circulating 

blood.  

<p> 

PHARMACOKINETICS 
<p>
 

After oral administration of therapeutic doses of Captopril , rapid

absorption occurs with peak blood levels at about one hour. The presence of

food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces absorption by about 30 to 40

percent; captopril therefore should be given one hour before meals. Based on

carbon-14 labeling, average minimal absorption is approximately 75 percent. In

a 24-hour period, over 95 percent of the absorbed dose is eliminated in the

urine; 40 to 50 percent is unchanged drug; most of the remainder is the

disulfide dimer of captopril and captopril-cysteine disulfide.  

 <p>

Approximately 25 to 30 percent of the circulating drug is bound to plasma

proteins. The apparent elimination half-life for total radioactivity in blood

is probably less than 3 hours. An accurate determination of half-life of

unchanged captopril is not, at present, possible, but it is probably less than

2 hours. In patients with renal impairment, however, retention of captopril

occurs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  

 <p>

PHARMACODYNAMICS 

 <p>

Administration of Captopril  results in a reduction of peripheral

arterial resistance in hypertensive patients with either no change, or an

increase, in cardiac output. There is an increase in renal blood flow following 

administration of Captopril  and glomerular filtration rate is usually 

unchanged.  

 <p>

Reductions of blood pressure are usually maximal 60 to 90 minutes after oral

administration of an individual dose of Captopril . The duration of

effect is dose related. The reduction in blood pressure may be progressive, so

to achieve maximal therapeutic effects, several weeks of therapy may be

required. The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and thiazide-type

diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and beta-blockers have a less

than additive effect.  

<p> 

Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine

positions. Orthostatic effects and tachycardia are infrequent but may occur in

volume-depleted patients. Abrupt withdrawal of Captopril has not been associated

with a rapid increase in blood pressure.  
<p>
 

In patients with heart failure, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic

vascular) resistance and blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary

capillary wedge pressure (preload) and pulmonary vascular resistance, increased 

cardiac output, and increased exercise tolerance time (ETT) have been

demonstrated.  These hemodynamic and clinical effects occur after the first

dose and appear to persist for the duration of therapy. Placebo controlled

studies of 12 weeks duration in patients who did not respond adequately to

diuretics and digitalis show no tolerance to beneficial effects on ETT; open

studies, with exposure up to 18 months in some cases, also indicate that ETT

benefit is maintained.  Clinical improvement has been observed in some patients 

where acute hemodynamic effects were minimal.  

 <p>

The Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study was a multicenter,

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2,231 patients

(age 21-79 years) who survived the acute phase of a myocardial infarction and

did not have active ischemia. Patients had left ventricular dysfunction (LVD),

defined as a resting left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or =40%, but at the time 

of randomization were not sufficiently symptomatic to require ACE inhibitor

therapy for heart failure. About half of the patients had had symptoms of heart 

failure in the past. Patients were given a test dose of 6.25 mg oral Captopril

 and were randomized within 3-16 days post-infarction to receive

either Captopril or placebo in addition to conventional therapy. Captopril was

initiated at 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg tid and after two weeks titrated to a target

maintenance dose of 50 mg tid. About 80% of patients were receiving the target

dose at the end of the study. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years 

and for up to five years, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years.  

 <p>

Baseline blood pressure was 113/70 mm Hg and 112/70 mm Hg for the placebo and

Captopril groups, respectively. Blood pressure increased slightly in both

treatment groups during the study and was somewhat lower in the Captopril group

(119/74 vs. 125/77 mm Hg at 1 yr).  

 <p>
Therapy with Captopril improved long-term survival and clinical outcomes compared 

to placebo. The risk reduction for all cause mortality was 19% (P=0.02) and for 

cardiovascular death was 21% (P=0.014). Captopril treated subjects had 22%

(P=0.034) fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure. Compared to placebo,

22% fewer patients receiving captopril developed symptoms of overt heart

failure. There was no significant difference between groups in total

hospitalizations for all cause (2056 placebo; 2036 captopril).  

 <p>

Captopril was well tolerated in the presence of other therapies such as aspirin,

beta blockers, nitrates, vasodilators, calcium antagonists and diuretics.  

 <p>

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 409 patients, age 18- 

49 of either gender, with or without hypertension, with type I (juvenile type,

onset before age 30) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, retinopathy,

proteinuria &gt;/=500 mg per day and serum creatinine &lt; or =2.5 mg/dL, were

randomized to placebo or Captopril (25 mg tid) and followed for up to 4.8 years

(median 3 years). To achieve blood pressure control, additional

antihypertensive agents (diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents, or

vasodilators) were added as needed for patients in both groups.  
<p>
 

The Captopril group had a 51% reduction in risk of doubling of serum creatinine

(P &lt;0.01) and a 51% reduction in risk for the combined endpoint of end-stage

renal disease (dialysis or transplantation) or death (P &lt;0.01). Captopril

treatment resulted in a 30% reduction in urine protein excretion within the

first 3 months (P &lt;0.05), which was maintained throughout the trial. The

Captopril group had somewhat better blood pressure control than the placebo group 

but the effects of Captopril on renal function were greater than would be

expected from the group differences in blood pressure reduction alone. Captopril

was well-tolerated in this patient population.  

 <p>

In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, a total of 235

normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, retinopathy and 

microalbuminuria (20-200 mcgm/min) were randomized to placebo or Captopril (50 mg 

bid) and followed for up to 2 years. Captopril delayed the progression to overt

nephropathy (proteinuria &gt;/=500 mg/day) in both studies (risk reduction 67% to

76%; P &lt;0.05). Captopril also reduced the albumin excretion rate. However, the

long term clinical benefit of reducing the progression from microalbuminuria to 

proteinuria has not been established.  

 <p>

Studies in rats and cats indicate that Captopril  does not cross the

blood-brain barrier to any significant extent.  

 
<p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

</b> <p>

HYPERTENSION:  Captopril  is indicated for the treatment of

hypertension.  
<p>
 

In using Captopril, consideration should be given to the risk of

neutropenia/agranulocytosis (see WARNINGS).  

 <p>

Captopril may be used as initial therapy for patients with normal renal function, 

in whom the risk is relatively low. In patients with impaired renal function,

particularly those with collagen vascular disease, captopril should be reserved 

for hypertensives who have either developed unacceptable side effects on other

drugs, or have failed to respond satisfactorily to drug combinations.  

 <p>

Captopril is effective alone and in combination with other antihypertensive

agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects 

of captopril and thiazides are approximately additive.  

 <p>

HEART FAILURE:  Captopril is indicated in the treatment of congestive heart

failure in combination with diuretics and digitalis. The beneficial effect of

captopril in heart failure does not require the presence of digitalis, however, 

most controlled clinical trial experience with captopril has been in patients

receiving digitalis, as well as diuretic treatment.  

 <p>

LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Captopril is indicated

to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable

patients with left ventricular dysfunction manifested as an ejection fraction

&lt; or =40% and to reduce the incidence of overt heart failure and subsequent

hospitalizations for congestive heart failure in these patients.  
<p>
 

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY:  Captopril is indicated for the treatment of diabetic

nephropathy (proteinuria &gt;500 mg/day) in patients with type I insulin-dependent 

diabetes mellitus and retinopathy. Captopril decreases the rate of progression of 

renal insufficiency and development of serious adverse clinical outcomes (death 

or need for renal transplantation or dialysis).  

 <p>

<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 

</b> <p>

Captopril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product

or any other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (e.g., a patient who has

experienced angioedema during therapy with any other ACE inhibitor).  

 <p>

<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 

</b> <p>

ANGIOEDEMA 

 <p>

Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue,

glottis or larynx has been seen in patients treated with ACE inhibitors,

including captopril. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx,

airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Emergency therapy, including but not

necessarily limited to, subcutaneous administration of a 1:1000 solution of

epinephrine should be promptly instituted.  

 <p>

Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and

extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of captopril; some cases

required medical therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and

ADVERSE REACTIONS.) 

 
<p>
NEUTROPENIA/AGRANULOCYTOSIS 

 <p>

Neutropenia (&lt;1000/mm(cube)) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of

captopril. About half of the neutropenic patients developed systemic or oral

cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis.  

 
<p>
The risk of neutropenia is dependent on the clinical status of the patient:  

 <p>

In clinical trials in patients with hypertension who have normal renal function 

(serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular disease),

neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed.  

 
<p>
In patients with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6

mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the risk of neutropenia in clinical

trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that for uncomplicated

hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients,

particularly in view of their diminished renal function. In foreign marketing

experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly

with captopril has been associated with neutropenia but this association has

not appeared in U.S. reports.  

 <p>

In patients with collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus 

scleroderma) and impaired renal function, neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent

of patients in clinical trials.  

 <p>

While none of the over 750 patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure

developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the subsequent clinical

experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine &gt;/= 1.6 mg/dL 

and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart 

failure, it appears that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present.  

 <p>

The neutropenia has usually been detected within three months after captopril

was started. Bone marrow examinations in patients with neutropenia consistently 

showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid hypoplasia and

decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and

pancytopenia); anemia and thrombocytopenia were sometimes seen.  

 <p>

In general, neutrophils returned to normal in about two weeks after captopril

was discontinued, and serious infections were limited to clinically complex

patients. About 13 percent of the cases of neutropenia have ended fatally, but

almost all fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen

vascular disease, renal failure, heart failure or immunosuppressant therapy, or 

a combination of these complicating factors.  

 <p>

EVALUATION OF THE HYPERTENSIVE OR HEART FAILURE PATIENT SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE<p>

ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION.  

 <p>

If captopril is used in patients with impaired renal function, white blood cell 

and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at

approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically.  

 <p>

In patients with collagen vascular disease or who are exposed to other drugs

known to affect the white cells or immune response, particularly when there is

impaired renal function, captopril should be used only after an assessment of

benefit and risk, and then with caution.  

 <p>

All patients treated with captopril should be told to report any signs of

infection (e.g., sore throat, fever). If infection is suspected, white cell

counts should be performed without delay.  

 
<p>
Since discontinuation of captopril and other drugs has generally led to prompt

return of the white count to normal, upon confirmation of neutropenia

(neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm(cube)) the physician should withdraw captopril and

closely follow the patient's course.  

 <p>

PROTEINURIA 
<p>
 

Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in about 0.7 percent

of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected patients had

evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril

(in excess of 150 mg/day), or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about

one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or

cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters of 

renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients 

with proteinuria.  

 
<p>
HYPOTENSION 
<p>
 

Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a

possible consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as

those treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those

patients undergoing renal dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.) 

 <p>

In heart failure, where the blood pressure was either normal or low, transient

decreases in mean blood pressure greater than 20 percent were recorded in about 

half of the patients. This transient hypotension is more likely to occur after

any of the first several doses and is usually well tolerated, producing either

no symptoms or brief mild lightheadedness, although in rare instances it has

been associated with arrhythmia or conduction defects. Hypotension was the

reason for discontinuation of drug in 3.6 percent of patients with heart

failure.  
<p>
 

BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FALL IN BLOOD PRESSURE IN THESE PATIENTS, THERAPY

SHOULD BE STARTED UNDER VERY CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. A starting dose of 6.25 

or 12.5 mg tid may minimize the hypotensive effect. Patients should be followed 

closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of captopril 

and/or diuretic is increased. In patients with heart failure, reducing the dose 

of diuretic, if feasible, may minimize the fall in blood pressure.  

 <p>

Hypotension is not Per Se a reason to discontinue captopril. Some decrease of

systemic blood pressure is a common and desirable observation upon initiation

of Captopril  treatment in heart failure. The magnitude of the

decrease is greatest early in the course of treatment; this effect stabilizes

within a week or two, and generally returns to pretreatment levels, without a

decrease in therapeutic efficacy, within two months.  

<p>

FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY 

 <p>

ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when

administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the

world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be

discontinued as soon as possible.  

 <p>

The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy

has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension,

neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure,

and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from

decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been

associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and

hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and 

patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear

whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.  

 <p>

These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-

inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose

embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first

trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant,

physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of captopril as soon 

as possible.  

 <p>

Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no

alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers

should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial

ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic

environment.  

 
<p>
If oligohydramnios is observed, captopril should be discontinued unless it is

considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non- 

stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending 

upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however,

that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained

irreversible injury.  

 <p>

Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely 

observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs,

attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal

perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as a means of

reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. While

captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is

inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it

from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not

effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange

transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation.  

 
<p>
When captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0.8 to 70 times (on a mg/kg

basis) the maximum recommended human dose, low incidences of craniofacial

malformations were seen. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in

studies of pregnant rats and hamsters. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up 

to 150 times (in hamsters) and 625 times (in rats) the maximum recommended

human dose.  <p>

 

HEPATIC FAILURE 
<p>


Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with

cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and

(sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients

receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic

enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical

follow-up.  

 <p>

<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 

</b> <p>

GENERAL 
<p>
 

Impaired Renal Function 

 <p>
Hypertension--Some patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe

renal artery stenosis, have developed increases in BUN and serum creatinine

after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. Captopril dosage reduction

and/or discontinuation of diuretic may be required. For some of these patients, 

it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal

perfusion.  

 <p>

Heart Failure--About 20 percent of patients develop stable elevations of BUN

and serum creatinine greater than 20 percent above normal or baseline upon long 

term treatment with captopril. Less than 5 percent of patients, generally those 

with severe preexisting renal disease, required discontinuaton of treatment due 

to progressively increasing creatinine; subsequent improvement probably depends 

upon the severity of the underlying renal disease.  

 
<p>
See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, ADVERSE REACTIONS:

Altered Laboratory Findings.  
<p>
 

Hyperkalemia:  Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some

patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. When treated with

ACE inhibitors, patients at risk for the development of hyperkalemia include

those with: renal insufficiency; diabetes mellitus; and those using concomitant 

potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt 

substitutes; or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium. In a

trial of type I diabetic patients with proteinuria, the incidence of withdrawal 

of treatment with captopril for hyperkalemia was 2% (4/207). In two trials of

normotensive type I diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, no captopril group 

subjects had hyperkalemia (0/116). (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients

and Drug Interactions; ADVERSE REACTIONS: Altered Laboratory Findings.) 

 <p>

Cough:  Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. 

Characteristically, the cough is nonproductive, persistent and resolves after

discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered as 

part of the differential diagnosis of cough.  

 <p>

Valvular Stenosis:  There is concern, on theoretical grounds, that patients

with aortic stenosis might be at particular risk of decreased coronary

perfusion when treated with vasodilators because they do not develop as much

afterload reduction as others.  
<p>
 

Surgery/Anesthesia:  In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia

with agents that produce hypotension, captopril will block angiotensin II

formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is 

considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume

expansion.  

<p>

HEMODIALYSIS 

 
<p>
Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like 

(anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes 

(e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. In these patients,

consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or 

a different class of medication.  

 
<p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 

 
<p>
Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs

or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue,

larynx and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and

to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS.) 
<p>
 

Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g.,

sore throat, fever), which may be a sign of neutropenia, or of progressive

edema which might be related to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.  
<p>
 

All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration

may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid

volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also

lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with

the physician.  

 <p>

Patients should be advised not to use potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium

supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes without consulting their

physician. (See PRECAUTIONS: General and Drug Interactions; ADVERSE REACTIONS.) 

 <p>

Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of medication 

unless instructed by the physician.  

 
<p>
Heart failure patients on captopril therapy should be cautioned against rapid

increases in physical activity.  

 <p>

Patients should be informed that Captopril  should be taken one hour

before meals (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  

 <p>

PREGNANCY.  Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the

consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and

they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted 

from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first

trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their

physicians as soon as possible.  

 <p>

DRUG INTERACTIONS 

 <p>

Hypotension--Patients On Diuretic Therapy:  Patients on diuretics and

especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as

those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally

experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first

hour after receiving the initial dose of captopril.  

 
<p>
The possibility of hypotensive effects with captopril can be minimized by

either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately

one week prior to initiation of treatment with Captopril or

initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg). Alternatively, provide

medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose. If

hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if

necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. This transient

hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which can be

given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume

expansion.  
<p>
 

Agents Having Vasodilator Activity:  Data on the effect of concomitant use of

other vasodilators in patients receiving Captopril for heart failure are not

available; therefore, nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management

of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be

discontinued before starting Captopril. If resumed during Captopril therapy, such

agents should be administered cautiously, and perhaps at lower dosage.  

 <p>

Agents Causing Renin Release:  Captopril's effect will be augmented by

antihypertensive agents that cause renin release. For example, diuretics (e.g., 

thiazides) may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  
<p>
 

Agents Affecting Sympathetic Activity:  The sympathetic nervous system may be

especially important in supporting blood pressure in patients receiving

captopril alone or with diuretics. Therefore, agents affecting sympathetic

activity (e.g., ganglionic blocking agents or adrenergic neuron blocking

agents) should be used with caution. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs add some

further antihypertensive effect to captopril, but the overall response is less

than additive.  

 
<p>
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium:  Since captopril decreases aldosterone

production, elevation of serum potassium may occur. Potassium-sparing diuretics 

such as spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride, or potassium supplements

should be given only for documented hypokalemia, and then with caution, since

they may lead to a significant increase of serum potassium. Salt substitutes

containing potassium should also be used with caution.  

 
<p>
Inhibitors Of Endogenous Prostaglandin Synthesis:  It has been reported that

indomethacin may reduce the antihypertensive effect of captopril, especially in 

cases of low renin hypertension. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents

(e.g., aspirin) may also have this effect.  

 <p>

Lithium:  Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have

been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor

therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent

monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used,

it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity.  
<p>
 

DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTION 

 <p>

Captopril may cause a false-positive urine test for acetone.  

 <p>

CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 

 
<p>
Two-year studies with doses of 50 to 1350 mg/kg/day in mice and rats failed to

show any evidence of carcinogenic potential. The high dose in these studies is

150 times the maximum recommended human dose of 450 mg, assuming a 50-kg

subject. On a body-surface-area basis, the high doses for mice and rats are 13

and 26 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively.  

<p>

Studies in rats have revealed no impairment of fertility.  

 <p>

ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY 

 
<p>
Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years), dogs (47 weeks; 

1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related

toxicity included effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration

of the stomach, and variation of retinal blood vessels.  

 <p>

Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen in mice, rats, and

monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of

450 mg, assuming a 50-mg subject. On a body-surface-area, these doses are 5 to

25 times maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia,

thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 

times MRHD on a body-weight basis (4 to 15 times MRHD on a surface-area basis). 

The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only

significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end

of the study. Marked anemia was seen at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in 

dogs, whereas moderate to marked leukopenia was noted only at 15 and 30 times

MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon

discontinuation of dosing. Bone marrow suppression occurred to a varying degree 

being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund

condition in the 1 year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times 

MRHD, bone marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug

administration.  <p>

 

Captopril caused hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys in 

mice and rats at doses 7 to 200 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (0.6 to 35

times MRHD on a surface-area basis); in monkeys at 20 to 60 times MRHD on a

body-weight basis (7 to 20 times MRHD on a surface-area basis); and in dogs at

30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (15 times MRHD on a surface-area basis). 

 <p>

Gastric erosions/ulcerations were increased in incidence in male rats at 20 to

200 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (3.5 and 35 times MRHD on a surface-area

basis); in dogs at 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (15 times on MRHD on a

surface-area basis); and in monkeys at 65 times MRHD on a body-weight basis (20 

times MRHD on a surface-area basis). Rabbits developed gastric and intestinal

ulcers when given oral doses approximately 30 times MRHD on a body-weight basis 

(10 times MRHD on a surface-area basis) for only 5 to 7 days.  

 <p>

In the two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the

caliber of retinal vessels (focal sacculations and constrictions) occurred at

all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) on a body-weight basis; 1 to 35 times

MRHD on a surface-area basis in a dose-related fashion. The effect was first

observed in the 88th week of dosing, with a progressively increased incidence

thereafter, even after cessation of dosing.  
<p>

<p>
 

SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.  

 <p>

NURSING MOTHERS 

 <p>

Concentrations of captopril in human milk are approximately one percent of

those in maternal blood. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions 

in nursing infants from captopril, a decision should be made whether to

discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the

importance of Captopril to the mother. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use.) 

 <p>

PEDIATRIC USE 

 
<p>
Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. There is

limited experience reported in the literature with the use of captopril in the

pediatric population; dosage, on a weight basis, was generally reported to be

comparable to or less than that used in adults.  

 <p>

Infants, especially newborns, may be more susceptible to the adverse

hemodynamic effects of captopril. Excessive, prolonged and unpredictable

decreases in blood pressure and associated complications, including oliguria

and seizures, have been reported.  

 <p>

Captopril  should be used in children only if other measures for

controlling blood pressure have not been effective.  <p>

Renal: About one of 100 patients developed proteinuria (see WARNINGS).  
<p>
 

Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000

patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency,

renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency.

maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears

within a few days of dosage reduction, short-term treatment with an

antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if 

captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100

patients. Between 7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown an

eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid

like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported.  

 <p>

Flushing or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients.  
<p>

Cardiovascular: Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug

Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy.  

 
<p>
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in

approximately 1 of 100 patients.  

 <p>

Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud's syndrome, and congestive

heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients.  

 <p>

Dysgeusia: Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100

patients developed a diminution or loss of taste perception. Taste impairment

is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug 

administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste.  

<p>

Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, 

tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000

patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused fatal airway

obstruction. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients.) 

 <p>

Cough: Cough has been reported in 0.5-2% of patients treated with captopril in

clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General, Cough).  

 <p>

The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but did

not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used

in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness,

headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia,

paresthesias.

FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY 
<p>
 

SEE WARNINGS: FETAL/NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY.  
<p>
 

ALTERED LABORATORY FINDINGS 

<p>

Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia:  small increases in serum potassium,

especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).  
<p>
 

Hyponatremia:  particularly in patients receiving a low sodium diet or

concomitant diuretics.  

 <p>

BUN/Serum Creatinine:  Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine

especially in volume or salt depleted patients or those with renovascular

hypertension may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated

blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and,

in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine.  
<p>
 

Hematologic:  A positive ANA has been reported.  

 <p>

Liver Function Tests:  Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, 

and serum bilirubin have occurred.  
<p>
 

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 

</b> <p>

Correction of hypotension would be of primary concern. Volume expansion with an 

intravenous infusion of normal saline is the treatment of choice for

restoration of blood pressure.  

 
<p>
While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis,

there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for

removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis

is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning

exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation.  

 <p>

<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

</b> <p>

Captopril  should be taken one hour before meals. Dosage must be

individualized.  <p>

 

HYPERTENSION--Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent

antihypertensive drug treatment, the extent of blood pressure elevation, salt

restriction, and other clinical circumstances. If possible, discontinue the

patient's previous antihypertensive drug regimen for one week before starting

Captopril.  

 <p>

The initial dose of Captopril  is 25 mg bid or tid. If satisfactory

reduction of blood pressure has not been achieved after one or two weeks, the

dose may be increased to 50 mg bid or tid. Concomitant sodium restriction may

be beneficial when Captopril is used alone.  

 <p>

The dose of Captopril in hypertension usually does not exceed 50 mg tid. 

Therefore, if the blood pressure has not been satisfactorily controlled after

one to two weeks at this dose, (and the patient is not already receiving a

diuretic), a modest dose of a thiazide-type diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 

25 mg daily), should be added. The diuretic dose may be increased at one- to

two-week intervals until its highest usual antihypertensive dose is reached.  

 <p>

If Captopril is being started in a patient already receiving a diuretic, Captopril

therapy should be initiated under close medical supervision (see WARNINGS and

PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) regarding hypotension), with dosage and

titration of Captopril as noted above.  

<p>

If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of Captopril may be

increased to 100 mg bid or tid and then, if necessary, to 150 mg bid or tid

(while continuing the diuretic). The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg bid or

tid. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg Captopril should not be exceeded.  

 <p>

For patients with severe hypertension (e.g., accelerated or malignant

hypertension), when temporary discontinuation of current antihypertensive

therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more

normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, diuretic should be continued

but other current antihypertensive medication stopped and Captopril dosage

promptly initiated at 25 mg bid or tid, under close medical supervision.  

 <p>

When necessitated by the patient's clinical condition, the daily dose of

Captopril may be increased every 24 hours or less under continuous medical

supervision until a satisfactory blood pressure response is obtained or the

maximum dose of Captopril is reached. In this regimen, addition of a more potent

diuretic, e.g., furosemide, may also be indicated.  

 
<p>
Beta-blockers may also be used in conjunction with Captopril therapy (see

PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions), but the effects of the two drugs are less than 

additive.  

 <p>

HEART FAILURE--Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent diuretic

therapy and the possibility of severe salt/volume depletion. In patients with

either normal or low blood pressure, who have been vigorously treated with

diuretics and who may be hyponatremic and/or hypovolemic, a starting dose of

6.25 or 12.5 mg tid may minimize the magnitude or duration of the hypotensive

effect (see WARNINGS: Hypotension); for these patients, titration to the usual

daily dosage can then occur within the next several days.  

 
<p>
For most patients the usual initial daily dosage is 25 mg tid. After a dose of

50 mg tid is reached, further increases in dosage should be delayed, where

possible, for at least two weeks to determine if a satisfactory response

occurs.  Most patients studied have had a satisfactory clinical improvement at

50 or 100 mg tid. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg of Captopril  should

not be exceeded.  

 
<p>
Captopril should generally be used in conjunction with a diuretic and digitalis.  

Captopril therapy must be initiated under very close medical supervision.  

 <p>

LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The recommended dose

for long-term use in patients following a myocardial infarction is a target

maintenance dose of 50 mg tid.  

 <p>

Therapy may be initiated as early as three days following a myocardial

infarction. After a single dose of 6.25 mg, Captopril therapy should be initiated 

at 12.5 mg tid. Captopril should then be increased to 25 mg tid during the next

several days and to a target dose of 50 mg tid over the next several weeks as

tolerated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).  

 <p>

Captopril may be used in patients treated with other post-myocardial infarction

therapies, e.g., thrombolytics, aspirin, beta blockers.  

 <p>

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY:  The recommended dose of Captopril for long term use to

treat diabetic nephropathy is 25 mg tid.  

<p>

Other antihypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting

agents or vasodilators may be used in conjunction with Captopril if additional

therapy is required to further lower blood pressure.  

 <p>
DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT IN RENAL IMPAIRMENT--Because Captopril  is excreted

primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired 

renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril 

levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than

patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to

smaller or less frequent doses.  

 <p>

Accordingly, for patients with significant renal impairment, initial daily

dosage of Captopril  should be reduced, and smaller increments

utilized for titration, which should be quite slow (one- to two-week

intervals). After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose

should be slowly back-titrated to determine the minimal effective dose. When

concomitant diuretic therapy is required, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide),

rather than a thiazide diuretic, is preferred in patients with severe renal

impairment. (See also PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis.) <p>

<br><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION</b> 
<br> 
<br>Diltiazem  is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow
<br>channel blocker or calcium antagonist). Chemically, diltiazem hydrochloride
is
<br>1,5-Benzothiazepin-4(5H)one,3-(acetyloxy)-5-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-2,3-
<br>dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, monohydrochloride, (+)-cis-.  
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Diltiazem hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder
with a
<br>bitter taste. It is soluble in water, methanol, and chloroform. It
has a
<br>molecular weight of 450.98. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

<br></b> 
<br>The therapeutic effects of Diltiazem CD are believed to be related
to its
<br>ability to inhibit the influx of calcium ions during membrane depolarization
of 
<br>cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.  
<br> 
<br><b>MECHANISMS OF ACTION 
<br></b> 
<br>HYPERTENSION. Diltiazem CD produces its antihypertensive effect primarily
by
<br>relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and the resultant decrease in
peripheral
<br>vascular resistance. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related
to
<br>the degree of hypertension, thus hypertensive individuals experience
an
<br>antihypertensive effect, whereas there is only a modest fall in blood
pressure
<br>in normotensives.  
<br> 
<br>ANGINA. Diltiazem CD has been shown to produce increases in exercise
tolerance,
<br>probably due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. This
is
<br>accomplished via reductions in heart rate and systemic blood pressure
at
<br>submaximal and maximal work loads. Diltiazem has been shown to be a
potent
<br>dilator of coronary arteries, both epicardial and subendocardial. Spontaneous
<br>and ergoinovine-induced coronary artery spasm are inhibited by diltiazem.
 
<br> 
<br>In animal models, diltiazem interferes with the slow inward (depolarizing)
<br>current in excitable tissue. It causes excitation-contraction uncoupling
in
<br>various myocardial tissues without changes in the configuration of
the action
<br>potential. Diltiazem produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth
muscle and 
<br>dilation of both large and small coronary arteries at drug levels which
cause
<br>little or no negative inotropic effect. The resultant increases in
coronary
<br>blood flow (epicardial and subendocardial) occur in ischemic and nonischemic
<br>models and are accompanied by dose-dependent decreases in systemic
blood
<br>pressure and decreases in peripheral resistance.  
<br> 
<br>HEMODYNAMIC AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS 
<br> 
<br>Like other calcium channel antagonists, diltiazem decreases sinoatrial
and
<br>atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative
inotropic
<br>effect in isolated preparations. In the intact animal, prolongation
of the AH
<br>interval can be seen at higher doses.  
<br> 
<br>In man, diltiazem prevents spontaneous and ergonovine-provoked coronary
artery
<br>spasm. It causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a
modest fall 
<br>in blood pressure in normotensive individuals and, in exercise tolerance
<br>studies in patients with ischemic heart disease, reduces the heart
rate-blood
<br>pressure product for any given work load. Studies to date, primarily
in
<br>patients with good ventricular function, have not revealed evidence
of a
<br>negative inotropic effect; cardiac output, ejection fraction, and left
<br>ventricular end diastolic pressure have not been affected. Such data
have no
<br>predictive value with respect to effects in patients with poor ventricular
<br>function, and increased heart failure has been reported in patients
with
<br>preexisting impairment of ventricular function. There are as yet few
data on
<br>the interaction of diltiazem and beta- blockers in patients with poor
<br>ventricular function. Resting heart rate is usually slightly reduced
by
<br>diltiazem.  
<br> 
<br>In hypertensive patients, Diltiazem CD produces antihypertensive effects
both in 
<br>the supine and standing positions. In a double-blind, parallel, dose-response
<br>study utilizing doses ranging from 90 to 540 mg once daily, Diltiazem
CD lowered 
<br>supine diastolic blood pressure in an apparent linear manner over the
entire
<br>dose range studied. The changes in diastolic blood pressure, measured
at trough 
<br>for placebo, 90 mg, 180 mg, 360 mg, and 540 mg were -2.9, -4.5, -6.1,
-9.5,
<br>and -10.5 mm Hg, respectively. Postural hypotension is infrequently
noted upon
<br>suddenly assuming an upright position. No reflex tachycardia is associated
with 
<br>the chronic antihypertensive effects. Diltiazem CD decreases vascular
resistance 
<br>increases cardiac output (by increasing stroke volume), and produces
a slight
<br>decrease or no change in heart rate. During dynamic exercise, increases
in
<br>diastolic pressure are inhibited while maximum achievable systolic
pressure is
<br>usually reduced. Chronic therapy with Diltiazem CD produces no change
or an
<br>increase in plasma catecholamines. No increased activity of the renin-
<br>angiotensin-aldosterone axis has been observed. Diltiazem CD reduces
the renal
<br>and peripheral effects of angiotension II. Hypertensive animal models
respond
<br>to diltiazem with reductions in blood pressure and increased urinary
output and 
<br>natriuresis without a change in urinary sodium/potassium ratio.  
<br> 
<br>In a double-blind, parallel dose response study of doses from 60 mg
to 480 mg
<br>once daily, Diltiazem CD increased time to termination of exercise
in a linear
<br>manner over the entire dose range studied. The improvement in time
to
<br>termination of exercise utilizing a Bruce exercise protocol, measured
at trough 
<br>for placebo, 60 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg was 29, 40,
56, 51, 69
<br>and 68 seconds, respectively. As doses of Diltiazem CD were increased
overall
<br>angina frequency was decreased. Diltiazem CD, 180 mg once daily, or
placebo was
<br>administered in a double-blind study to patients receiving concomitant
<br>treatment with long-acting nitrates and/or beta-blockers. A significant
<br>increase in time to termination of exercise and a significant decrease
in
<br>overall angina frequency was observed. In this trial the overall frequency
of
<br>adverse events in the Diltiazem CD treatment group was the same as
the placebo
<br>group.  
<br> 
<br>Intravenous diltiazem in doses of 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time
and AV node 
<br>functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. In
a study
<br>involving single oral doses of 300 mg of Diltiazem in six normal volunteers,
the 
<br>average maximum PR prolongation was 14% with no instances of greater
than first 
<br>degree AV block. Diltiazem-associated prolongation of the AH interval
is not
<br>more pronounced in patients with first-degree heart block. In patients
with
<br>
<br>sick sinus syndrome, diltiazem significantly prolongs sinus cycle length
(up to 
<br>50% in some cases).  
<br> 
<br>Chronic oral administration of Diltiazem to patients in doses of up
to 540
<br>mg/day has resulted in small increases in PR interval, and on occasion
produces 
<br>abnormal prolongation. (See WARNINGS.) 
<br> 
<br>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM 
<br> 
<br>Diltiazem is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is subject
to an 
<br>extensive first-pass effect, giving an absolute bioavailability (compared
to
<br>intravenous administration) of about 40%. Diltiazem undergoes extensive
<br>metabolism in which only 2% to 4% of the unchanged drug appears in
the urine. 
<br> 
<br>Drugs which induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes may alter
diltiazem
<br>disposition.  
<br> 
<br>Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in
healthy
<br>volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites
which attain 
<br>higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated;
<br>half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 hours compared to 2 to
5 hours for 
<br>diltiazem.  
<br> 
<br>In vitro binding studies show Diltiazem is 70% to 80% bound to plasma
proteins.  
<br>Competitive in vitro ligand binding studies have also shown Diltiazem
binding is 
<br>not altered by therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide,
<br>phenylbutazone, propranolol, salicylic acid, or warfarin. The plasma
<br>elimination half-life following single or multiple drug administration
is
<br>approximately 3.0 to 4.5 hours. Desacetyl diltiazem is also present
in the
<br>plasma at levels of 10% to 20% of the parent drug and is 25% to 50%
as potent
<br>as a coronary vasodilator as diltiazem. Minimum therapeutic plasma
diltiazem
<br>concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. There
is a
<br>departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased; the half-life
is
<br>slightly increased with dose. A study that compared patients with normal
<br>hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis found an increase in half-life
and
<br>a 69% increase in bioavailability in the hepatically impaired patients.
A
<br>single study in patients with severely impaired renal function showed
no
<br>difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem compared to
patients
<br>with normal renal function.  
<br> 
<br>Diltiazem CD CAPSULES. When compared to a regimen of Diltiazem tablets
at steady- 
<br>state, more than 95% of drug is absorbed from the Diltiazem CD formulation.
A
<br>single 360-mg dose of the capsule results in detectable plasma levels
within 2
<br>hours and peak plasma levels between 10 and 14 hours; absorption occurs
<br>throughout the dosing interval. When Diltiazem CD was coadministered
with a high 
<br>fat content breakfast, the extent of diltiazem absorption was not affected.

<br>Dose-dumping does not occur. The apparent elimination half-life after
single or 
<br>multiple dosing is 5 to 8 hours. A departure from linearity similar
to that
<br>seen with Diltiazem tabets and Diltiazem SR capsules is observed. As
the dose of
<br>Diltiazem CD capsules is increased from a daily dose of 120 mg to 240
mg, there
<br>is an increase in the area-under-the-curve of 2.7 times. When the dose
is
<br>increased from 240 mg to 360 mg there is an increase in the area-under-the
<br>curve of 1.6 times.

<br>1. CARDIAC CONDUCTION. Diltiazem prolongs AV node refractory periods
without
<br>significantly prolonging sinus node recovery time, except in patients
with sick 
<br>sinus syndrome. This effect may rarely result in abnormally slow heart
rates
<br>(particularly in patients with sick sinus syndrome) or second- or third-degree
<br>AV block (13 of 3,290 patients or 0.40%). Concomitant use of diltiazem
with
<br>beta-blockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac
<br>conduction.  A patient with Prinzmetal's angina developed periods of
asystole
<br>(2 to 5 seconds) after a single dose of 60 mg of diltiazem.  
<br> 
<br>2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. Although diltiazem has a negative inotropic
effect 
<br>in isolated animal tissue preparations, hemodynamic studies in humans
with
<br>normal ventricular function have not shown a reduction in cardiac index
nor
<br>consistent negative effects on contractility (dp/dt). An acute study
of oral
<br>diltiazem in patients with impaired ventricular function (ejection
fraction 24% 
<br>+/- 6%) showed improvement in indices of ventricular function without
<br>significant decrease in contractile function (dp/dt). Worsening of
congestive
<br>heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impairment
of
<br>ventricular function. Experience with the use of Diltiazem (diltiazem
<br>hydrochloride) in combination with beta-blockers in patients with impaired
<br>ventricular function is limited. Caution should be exercised when using
this
<br>combination.  
<br> 
<br>3. HYPOTENSION. Decreases in blood pressure associated with Diltiazem
therapy
<br>may occasionally result in symptomatic hypotension.  
<br> 
<br>4. ACUTE HEPATIC INJURY. Mild elevations of transaminases with and
without
<br>concomitant elevation in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin have been
observed
<br>in clinical studies. Such elevations were usually transient and frequently
<br>resolved even with continued diltiazem treatment. In rare instances,
<br>significant elevations in enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase. LDH,
SGOT, SGPT 
<br>and other phenomena consistent with acute hepatic injury have been
noted.
<br>These reactions tended to occur early after therapy initiation (1 to
8 weeks)
<br>and have been reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. The
relationship 
<br>to Diltiazem is uncertain in some cases, but probable in some. (See
<br>PRECAUTIONS.) 
<br> 
<br><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
<br></b> 
<br>GENERAL 
<br> 
<br>Diltiazem  is extensively metabolized by the liver and
<br>excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged
<br>periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should
be
<br>monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution
in
<br>patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic
dog
<br>and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazen
were
<br>associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies,
oral doses 
<br>of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes
in
<br>the liver which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In
dogs, doses
<br>of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these
changes
<br>were reversible with continued dosing.  
<br> 
<br>Dermatological events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section) may be transient
and may
<br>disappear despite continued use of Diltiazem. However, skin eruptions
<br>progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have
also been 
<br>infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the
drug should
<br>be discontinued.  
<br> 
<br>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
<br> 
<br>Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration
are
<br>warranted in patients receiving Diltiazem concomitantly with other
agents known
<br>to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction. (See WARNINGS.)
<br>Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in
prolonging 
<br>AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with
<br>Diltiazem. (See WARNINGS.) 
<br> 
<br>As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients
with
<br>multiple medications. Diltiazem undergoes biotransformation by cytochrome
P-450
<br>mixed function oxidase. Coadministration of Diltiazem with other agents
which
<br>follow the same route of biotransformation may result in the competitive
<br>inhibition of metabolism. Dosages of similarly metabolized drugs such
as
<br>cyclosporin, particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients
with
<br>renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require adjustment when starting
or
<br>stopping concomitantly administered Diltiazem to maintain optimum therapeutic
<br>blood levels. Especially in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment,
<br>dosages of similarly metabolized drugs, particularly those of low therapeutic
<br>ratio, may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly
<br>administered diltiazem to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.
 
<br> 
<br>BETA-BLOCKERS. Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest
that
<br>concomitant use of Diltiazem and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated,
but
<br>available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant
<br>treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac
conduction
<br>abnormalities.  
<br> 
<br>Administration of Diltiazem  concomitantly with
<br>propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol
levels
<br>in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately
<br>50%. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding
sites by
<br>diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction
with 
<br>propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted.
(See
<br>WARNINGS.) 
<br> 
<br>CIMETIDINE. A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant
increase
<br>in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%)
after a 1
<br>week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem
60
<br>mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect
may be
<br>mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450,
the
<br>enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem.
Patients
<br>currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored
for a
<br>change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing
therapy with 
<br>cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted. 

<br> 
<br>DIGITALIS. Administration of Diltiazem with digoxin in 24 healthy male
subjects
<br>increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Another
investigator 
<br>found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery
<br>disease.  Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect
of
<br>digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored
when
<br>initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing Diltiazem therapy to avoid
possible
<br>over- or under- digitalization. (See WARNINGS.) 
<br> 
<br>ANESTHETICS. The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity,
and
<br>automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics
may
<br>be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly,
<br>anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.  
<br> 
<br>CYCLOSPORINE. A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine
<br>has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant
<br>patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of
<br>cyclosporine dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain
<br>cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the
addition
<br>of diltiazem.  If these agents are to be administered concurrently,
<br>cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem
<br>therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.  
<br> 
<br>The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not
been
<br>evaluated.  
<br> 
<br>CARBAMAZEPINE. Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine
has
<br>been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40%
to 72%
<br>increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving
these drugs
<br>concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction.
 
<br> 
<br>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
<br> 
<br>A 24-month study in rats at oral dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day
and a 21
<br>month study in mice at oral dosage levels of up to 30 mg/kg/day showed
no
<br>evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response in
vitro or
<br>in vivo in mammalian cell assays or in vitro in bacteria. No evidence
of
<br>impaired fertility was observed in a study performed in male and female
rats at 
<br>oral dosages of up to 100 mg/kg/day.  
<br> 
<br>PREGNANCY 
<br> 
<br>Category C. Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats,
and
<br>rabbits.  Administration of doses ranging from five to ten times greater
(on a
<br>mg/kg basis) than the daily recommended therapeutic dose has resulted
in embryo 
<br>and fetal lethality. These doses, in some studies, have been reported
to cause
<br>skeletal abnormalities. In the perinatal/postnatal studies, there was
an
<br>increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose
or
<br>greater.  
<br> 
<br>There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore,
use Diltiazem 
<br>in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
risk to 
<br>the fetus.  
<br> 
<br>NURSING MOTHERS. Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report suggests
that
<br>concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels. If use
of Diltiazem
<br>is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should
be
<br>instituted.  
<br> 
<br>PEDIATRIC USE. Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

<br>In clinical trials of Diltiazem CD Capsules, Diltiazem Tablets, and
Diltiazem SR
<br>Capsules involving over 3200 patients, the most common events (ie,
greater than

<br>angina or hypertension trials:  
<br> 
<br>CARDIOVASCULAR: Angina, arrhythmia, AV block (second- or third-degree),
bundle
<br>branch block, congestive heart failure, ECG abnormalities, hypotension,
<br>palpitations, syncope, tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles 
<br> 
<br>NERVOUS SYSTEM: Abnormal dreams, amnesia, depression, gait abnormality,
<br>hallucinations, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, personality change,
<br>somnolence, tinnitus, tremor 
<br> 
<br>GASTROINTESTINAL: Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysgeusia,
<br>dyspepsia, mild elevations of SGOT, SGPT, LDH, and alkaline phosphatase
(see
<br>hepatic warnings), thirst, vomiting, weight increase 
<br>

<br>OTHER: Amblyopia, CPK increase, dyspnea, epistaxis, eye irritation,
<br>hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, impotence, muscle cramps, nasal congestion,
<br>nocturia, osteoarticular pain, polyuria, sexual difficulties 
<br> 
<br>The following postmarketing events have been reported infrequently
in patients
<br>receiving Diltiazem: alopecia, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermititis,
<br>extrapyramidal symptoms, gingival hyperplasia, hemolytic anemia, increased
<br>bleeding time, leukopenia, purpura, retinopathy, and thrombocytopenia.
In
<br>addition, events such as myocardial infarction have been observed which
are not 
<br>readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in
these
<br>patients. A number of well-documented cases of generalized rash, characterized
<br>as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, have been reported. However, a definitive
cause 
<br>and effect relationship between these events and Diltiazem therapy
is yet to be
<br>established.  
<br> 
<br><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
<br></b> 
<br>The oral LD50's in mice and rats range from 415 to 740 mg/kg and from
560 to
<br>810 mg/kg respectively. The intravenous LD50's in these species were
60 and 38
<br>mg/kg, respectively. The oral LD50 in dogs is considered to be in excess
of 50
<br>mg/kg, while lethality was seen in monkeys at 360 mg/kg.  
<br> 
<br>The toxic dose in man is not known. Due to extensive metabolism, blood
levels
<br>after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, limiting
the
<br>usefulness of blood levels in overdose cases.  
<br> 
<br>There have been 29 reports of diltiazem overdose in doses ranging from
less
<br>than 1 gm to 10.8 gm. Sixteen of these reports involved multiple drug
<br>ingestions.  
<br> 
<br>Twenty-two reports indicated patients had recovered from diltiazem
overdose
<br>ranging from less than 1 gm to 10.8 gm. There were seven reports with
a fatal
<br>outcome; although the amount of diltiazem ingested was unknown, multiple
drug
<br>ingestions were confirmed in six of the seven reports.  
<br> 
<br>Events observed following diltiazem overdose included bradycardia,
hypotension, 
<br>heart block, and cardiac failure. Most reports of overdose described
some
<br>supportive medical measure and/or drug treatment. Bradycardia frequently
<br>responded favorably to atropine as did heart block, although cardiac
pacing was 
<br>also frequently utilized to treat heart block. Fluids and vasopressors
were
<br>used to maintain blood pressure, and in cases of cardiac failure, inotropic
<br>agents were administered. In addition, some patients received treatment
with
<br>ventilatory support, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and/or intravenous
<br>calcium. Evidence of the effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration
to 
<br>reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose was conflicting.
 
<br> 
<br>In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive
<br>measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination.

<br>Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.
Based on 
<br>the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical
<br>experiences, the following measures may be considered:  
<br> 
<br>BRADYCARDIA: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response
to
<br>vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously 
<br> 
<br>HIGH-DEGREE AV BLOCK: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree
AV
<br>block should be treated with cardiac pacing 
<br> 
<br>CARDIAC FAILURE: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine,
or
<br>dobutamine) and diuretics 
<br> 
<br>HYPOTENSION: Vasopressors (eg, dopamine or levarterenol bitartrate)

<br> 
<br>Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical
<br>situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
 
<br> 
<br><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

<br></b> 
<br>Patients controlled on diltiazem alone or in combination with other
medications 
<br>may be switched to Diltiazem CD capsules at the nearest equivalent
total daily
<br>dose. Higher doses of Diltiazem CD may be needed in some patients.
Patients
<br>should be closely monitored. Subsequent titration to higher or lower
doses may
<br>be necessary and should be initiated as clinically warranted. There
is limited
<br>general clinical experience with doses above 360 mg, but doses to 540
mg have
<br>been studied in clinical trials. The incidence of side effects increases
as the 
<br>dose increases with first-degree AV block, dizziness, and sinus bradycardia
<br>bearing the strongest relationship to dose.  
<br> 
<br>HYPOTENSION. Dosage needs to be adjusted by titration to individual
patient
<br>needs. When used as monotherapy, reasonable starting doses are 180
to 240 mg
<br>once daily, although some patients may respond to lower doses. Maximum
<br>antihypertensive effect is usually observed by 14 days of chronic therapy,
<br>therefore, dosage adjustments should be scheduled accordingly. The
usual dosage 
<br>range studied in clinical trials was 240 to 360 mg once daily. Individual
<br>patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once daily.  
<br> 
<br>ANGINA.  Dosages for the treatment of angina should be adjusted to
each
<br>patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 or 180 mg once daily.
Individual
<br>patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once daily. When
necessary 
<br>titration may be carried out over a 7 to 14 day period.  
<br> 
<br>CONCOMITANT USE WITH OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS 
<br> 
<br>1. SUBLINGUAL NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks
<br>during Diltiazem CD  therapy.  
<br> 
<br>2. PROPHYLACTIC NITRATE THERAPY--Diltiazem CD may be safely coadministered
with
<br>short- and long-acting nitrates.  
<br> 
<br>3. BETA-BLOCKERS. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.) 
<br> 
<br>4. ANTIHYPERTENSIVES--Diltiazem CD has an additive antihypertensive
effect when
<br>used with other antihypertensive agents. Therefore, the dosage of Diltiazem
CD
<br>or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when adding
one to 
<br>the other.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>acyclovir is an antiviral drug. The chemical name of acyclovir is 9-((2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl)guanine.
Acyclovir is a white, crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 225
daltons and a maximum solubility in water of 2.5 mg/mL at 37 deg C. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS: Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside
analogue with in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against human herpes
viruses including herpes simplex types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella
zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
In cell culture, acyclovir has the highest antiviral activity against HSV-1,
followed in decreasing order of potency against HSV-2, VZV, EBV and CMV.
(REF. 1) </p>

<p>The inhibitory activity of acyclovir for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and EBV
is highly selective. The enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) of normal uninfected
cells does not effectively use acyclovir as a substrate. However, TK encoded
by HSV, VZV, and EBV (REF. 2) converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate,
a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate
by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular
enzymes. (REF. 3) Acyclovir triphosphate interferes with herpes simplex
virus DNA polymerase and inhibits viral DNA replication. Acyclovir triphosphate
also inhibits cellular alpha-DNA polymerase, but to a lesser degree. in
vitro, acyclovir triphosphate can be incorporated into growing chains of
DNA by viral DNA polymerase and to a much smaller extent by cellular alpha-DNA
polymerase. (REF. 4) When incorporation occurs, the DNA chain is terminated.
(REF. 5,6) Acyclovir is preferentially taken up and selectively converted
to the active triphosphate form by herpesvirus-infected cells. Thus, acyclovir
is much less toxic in vitro for normal uninfected cells because: 1) less
is taken up; 2) less is converted to the active form; 3) cellular alpha-DNA
polymerase is less sensitive to the effects of the active form. The mode
of acyclovir phosphorylation in cytomegalovirus-infected cells is not clearly
established, but may involve virally induced cell kinases or an unidentified
viral enzyme. Acyclovir is not efficiently activated in cytomegalovirus
infected cells, which may account for the reduced susceptibility of cytomegalovirus
to acyclovir in vitro. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY: The quantitative relationship between the in vitro susceptibility
of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses to acyclovir and the clinical
response to therapy has not been established in man, and virus sensitivity
testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity testing results, expressed
as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus
in cell culture (ID50), vary greatly depending upon the particular assay
used, (REF. 7) the cell type employed, (REF. 8) and the laboratory performing
the test. (REF. 1) The ID50 of acyclovir against HSV-1 isolates may range
from 0.02 mcgm/mL (plaque reduction in Vero cells) to 5.9 to 13.5 mcgm/mL
(plaque reduction in green monkey kidney (GMK) cells). (REF. 1) The ID50
against HSV-2 ranges from 0.01 mcgm/mL to 9.9 mcgm/mL (plaque reduction
in Vero and GMK cells), respectively. </p>

<p>Using a dye-uptake method in Vero cells, (REF. 9) which gives ID50 values
approximately 5- to 10-fold higher than plaque reduction assays, 1417 HSV
isolates (553 HSV-1 and 864 HSV-2) from approximately 500 patients were
examined over a 5-year period. (REF. 10) These assays found that 90% of
HSV-1 isolates were sensitive to &lt; or = 0.9 mcgm/mL acyclovir and 50%
of all isolates were sensitive to &lt; or = 0.2 mcgm/mL acyclovir. For
HSV-2 isolates, 90% were sensitive to &lt; or = 2.2 mcgm/mL and 50% of
all isolates were sensitive to &lt; or = 0.7 mcgm/mL of acyclovir. Isolates
with significantly diminished sensitivity were found in 44 patients. It
must be emphasized that neither the patients nor the isolates were randomly
selected and, therefore, do not represent the general population. </p>

<p>Most of the less sensitive HSV clinical isolates have been relatively
deficient in the viral TK. (REF. 11-19) Strains with alterations in viral
TK (REF. 20) or viral DNA polymerase (REF. 21) have also been reported.
Prolonged exposure to low concentrations (0.1 mcgm/mL) of acyclovir in
cell culture has resulted in the emergence of a variety of acyclovir-resistant
strains. (REF. 22) </p>

<p>The ID50 against VZV ranges from 0.17 to 1.53 mcgm/mL (yield reduction,
human foreskin fibroblasts) to 1.85 to 3.98 mcgm/mL (foci reduction, human
embryo fibroblasts (HEF)). Reproduction of EBV genome is suppressed by
50% in superinfected Raji cells or P3HR-1 lymphoblastoid cells by 1.5 mcgm/mL
acyclovir. CMV is relatively resistant to acyclovir with ID50 values ranging
from 2.3 to 17.6 mcgm/mL (plaque reduction, HEF cells) to 1.82 to 56.8
mcgm/mL (DNA hybridization, HEF cells). The latent state of the genome
of any of the human herpesviruses is not known to be sensitive to acyclovir.
(REF. 1) </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after oral administration
have been evaluated in 6 clinical studies involving 110 adult patients.
In one uncontrolled study of 35 immunocompromised patients with herpes
simplex or varicella-zoster infection, Acyclovir Capsules were administered
in doses of 200 to 1000 mg every 4 hours, 6 times daily for 5 days, and
steady-state plasma levels were reached by the second day of dosing. Mean
steady-state peak and trough concentrations following the final 200 mg
dose were 0.49 mcgm/mL (0.47 to 0.54 mcgm/mL) and 0.31 mcgm/mL (0.18 to
0.41 mcgm/mL), respectively, and following the final 800 mg dose were 2.8
mcgm/mL (2.3 to 3.1 mcgm/mL) and 1.8 mcgm/mL (1.3 to 2.5 mcgm/mL), respectively.
In another uncontrolled study of 20 younger immunocompetent patients with
recurrent genital herpes simplex infections, Acyclovir Capsules were administered
in doses of 800 mg every 6 hours 4 times daily for 5 days; the mean steady-state
peak and trough concentrations were 1.4 mcgm/mL (0.66 to 1.8 mcgm/mL) and
0.55 mcgm/mL (0.14 to 1.1 mcgm/mL), respectively. </p>

<p>In general, the pharmacokinetics of acyclovir in children is similar
to adults. Mean half-life after oral doses of 300 mg/m(square) and 600
mg/m(square), in children ages 7 months to 7 years, was 2.6 hours (range
1.59 to 3.74 hours). </p>

<p>A single oral dose bioavailability study in 23 normal volunteers showed
that Acyclovir Capsules 200 mg are bioequivalent to 200 mg acyclovir in
aqueous solution; and in a separate study in 20 volunteers, it was shown
that Acyclovir Suspension is bioequivalent to Acyclovir Capsules. In a
different single-dose bioavailability/bioequivalence study in 24 volunteers,
one Acyclovir 800 mg Tablet was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to four
Acyclovir 200 mg Capsules. </p>

<p>In a multiple-dose crossover study where 23 volunteers received Acyclovir
as one 200 mg capsule, one 400 mg tablet and one 800 mg tablet 6 times
daily, absorption decreased with increasing dose and the estimated bioavailabilities
of acyclovir were 20% 15% and 10%, respectively. The decrease in bioavailability
is believed to be a function of the dose and not the dosage form. It was
demonstrated that acyclovir is not dose proportional over the dosing range
200 mg to 800 mg. In this study, steady-state peak and trough concentrations
of acyclovir were 0.83 and 0.46 mcgm/mL, 1.21 and 0.63 mcgm/mL, and 1.61
and 0.83 mcgm/mL for the 200, 400, and 800 mg dosage regimens, respectively.
</p>

<p>In another study in 6 volunteers, the influence of food on the absorption
of acyclovir was not apparent. </p>

<p>Following oral administration, the mean plasma half-life of acyclovir
in volunteers and patients with normal renal function ranged from 2.5 to
3.3 hours. The mean renal excretion of unchanged drug accounts for 14.4%
(8.6% to 19.8%) of the orally administered dose. The only urinary metabolite
(identified by high performance liquid chromatography) is 9 ((carboxymethoxy)methyl)guanine.
The half-life and total body clearance of acyclovir are dependent on renal
function. A dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with reduced
renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Orally administered acyclovir in children less than 2 years of age has
not yet been fully studied. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Acyclovir Capsules, Tables, and Suspension are indicated for the treatment
of initial episodes and the management of recurrent episodes of genital
herpes in certain patients. </p>

<p>Acyclovir Capsules, Tablets, and Suspension are indicated for the acute
treatment of herpes zoster (shingles) and chickenpox (varicella). </p>

<p>GENITAL HERPES INFECTIONS: The severity of disease is variable depending
upon the immune status of the patient, the frequency and duration of episodes,
and the degree of cutaneous or systemic involvement. These factors should
determine patient management, which may include symptomatic support and
counseling only, or the institution of specific therapy. The physical,
emotional, and psycho- social difficulties posed by herpes infections as
well as the degree of debilitation, particularly in immunocompromised patients,
are unique for each patient, and the physician should determine therapeutic
alternatives based on his or her understanding of the individual patient's
needs. Thus, orally administered Acyclovir is not appropriate in treating
all genital herpes infections. The following guidelines may be useful in
weighing the benefit/risk considerations in specific disease categories:
</p>

<p>FIRST EPISODES (primary and nonprimary infections--commonly known as
initial genital herpes): </p>

<p>Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (REF. 23,24,25) have demonstrated
that orally administered Acyclovir significantly reduced the duration of
acute infection (detection of virus in lesions by tissue culture) and lesion
healing. The duration of pain and new lesion formation was decreased in
some patient groups. The promptness of initiation of therapy and/or the
patient's prior exposure to herpes simplex virus may influence the degree
of benefit from therapy. Patients with mild disease may derive less benefit
than those with more severe episodes. In patients with extremely severe
episodes, in which prostration, central nervous system involvement, urinary
retention, or inability to take oral medication require hospitalization
and more aggressive management, therapy may be best initiated with intravenous
Acyclovir. </p>

<p>RECURRENT EPISODES: </p>

<p>Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (REF. 16,26-32) in patients
with frequent recurrences (6 or more episodes per year) have shown that
orally administered Acyclovir given daily for 4 months to 3 years prevented
or reduced the frequency and/or severity of recurrences in greater than
95% of patients. </p>

<p>In a study of 283 patients who received 400 mg (two 200 mg capsules)
twice daily for 3 years, 45%, 52% and 63% of patients remained free of
recurrences in the first, second, and third years, respectively. Serial
analyses of the 3 month recurrence rates for the 283 patients showed that
71% to 87% were recurrence- free in each quarter, indicating that the effects
are consistent over time. </p>

<p>The frequency and severity of episodes of untreated genital herpes may
change over time. After 1 year of therapy, the frequency and severity of
the patient's genital herpes infection should be re-evaluated to assess
the need for continuation of acyclovir therapy. Re-evaluation will usually
require a trial off acyclovir to assess the need for reinstitution of suppressive
therapy. Some patients, such as those with very frequent or severe episodes
before treatment, may warrant uninterrupted suppression for more than a
year. </p>

<p>Chronic suppressive therapy is most appropriate when, in the judgement
of the physician, the benefits of such a regimen outweigh known or potential
adverse effects. In general, orally administered Acyclovir should not be
used for the suppression of recurrent disease in mildly affected patients.
Unanswered questions concerning the relevance to humans of in vitro mutagenicity
studies and reproductive toxicity studies in animals given high parenteral
doses of acyclovir for short periods (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,
Impairment of Fertility) should be borne in mind when designing long-term
management for individual patients. Discussion of these issues with patients
will provide them the opportunity to weigh the potential for toxicity against
the severity of their disease. Thus, this regimen should be considered
only for appropriate patients with annual re-evaluation. </p>

<p>Limited studies (REF. 31,32) have shown that there are certain patients
for whom intermittent short-term treatment of recurrent episodes is effective.
This approach may be more appropriate than a suppressive regimen in patients
with infrequent recurrences. </p>

<p>Immunocompromised patients with recurrent herpes infections can be treated
with either intermittent or chronic suppressive therapy. Clinically significant
resistance, although rare, is more likely to be seen with prolonged or
repeated therapy in severely immunocompromised patients with active lesions.
</p>

<p>HERPES ZOSTER INFECTIONS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
of 187 normal patients with localized cutaneous zoster infection (93 randomized
to Acyclovir and 94 to placebo), Acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 10
days) shortened the times to lesion scabbing, healing, and complete cessation
of pain and reduced the duration of viral shedding and the duration of
new lesion formation. (REF. 33) </p>

<p>In a similar double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 83 normal patients
with herpes zoster (40 randomized to Acyclovir and 43 to placebo), Acyclovir
(800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) shortened the times to complete lesion
scabbing, healing, and cessation of pain, reduced the duration of new lesion
formation, and reduced the prevalence of localized zoster-associated neurologic
symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia, or hyperesthesia). (REF. 34) </p>

<p>CHICKENPOX: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy study in
110 normal patients, ages 5 to 16 years, who presented WITHIN 24 HOURS
of the onset of a typical chickenpox rash, Acyclovir was administered orally
4 times daily for 5 to 7 days at doses of 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg depending
on the age group. Acyclovir treatment reduced the maximum number of lesions
(336 vs. greater than 500; lesions beyond 500 were not counted). Acyclovir
treatment also shortened the mean time to 50% healing (7.1 days vs. 8.7
days), reduced the number of vesicular lesions by the second day of treatment
(49 vs. 113), and decreased the proportion of patients with fever (temperature
greater than 100 deg F) by the second day (19% vs. 57%). Acyclovir treatment
did not affect the antibody response to varicella-zoster virus measured
one month and one year following the treatment. (REF. 35) </p>

<p>In two concurrent double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, a total
of 883 normal patients, ages 2 to 18 years, were enrolled WITHIN 24 HOURS
of the onset of a typical chickenpox rash, and Acyclovir was administered
at 20 mg/kg orally up to 800 mg 4 times daily for 5 days. In the larger
study of 815 children ages 2 to 12 years, Acyclovir treatment reduced the
median maximum number of lesions (277 vs. 386), reduced the median number
of vesicular lesions by the second day of treatment (26 vs. 40), and reduced
the proportion of patients with moderate to severe itching by the third
day of treatment (15% vs. 34%). (REF. 36) In addition, in both studies
(883 patients ages 2 to 18 years), Acyclovir treatment also decreased the
proportion of patients with fever (temperature greater than 100 deg F),
anorexia, and lethargy by the second day of treatment, and decreased the
mean number of residual lesions on Day 28. (REF. 36,37) There were no substantial
differences in VZV-specific humoral or cellular immune responses measured
at one month following treatment in patients receiving Acyclovir compared
to patients receiving placebo. (REF. 38) </p>

<p>DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is confirmed by virus isolation. Accelerated viral
culture assays or immunocytology allow more rapid diagnosis than standard
viral culture. For patients with initial episodes of genital herpes, appropriate
examinations should be performed to rule out other sexually transmitted
diseases. While cutaneous lesions associated with herpes simplex and varicella
zoster infections are often characteristic, the finding of multinucleated
giant cells in smears prepared from lesion exudate or scrapings may provide
additional support to the clinical diagnosis. (REF. 35) </p>

<p>Multi-nucleated giant cells in smears do not distinguish varicella-zoster
from herpes simplex infections. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Acyclovir Capsules, Tablets, and Suspension are contraindicated for
patients who develop hypersensitivity or intolerance to the components
of the formulations. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Acyclovir Capsules, Tablets, and Suspension are intended for oral ingestion
only. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Acyclovir has caused decreased spermatogenesis at high parenteral
doses in some animals and mutagenesis in some acute studies at high concentrations
of drug (see PRECAUTIONS--Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).
The recommended dosage should not be exceeded (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p>Exposure of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster isolates to acyclovir
In Vitro can lead to the emergence of less sensitive viruses. The possibility
of the appearance of less sensitive viruses in humans must be borne in
mind when treating patients. The relationship between the in vitro sensitivity
of Herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus to acyclovir and clinical response
to therapy has yet to be established (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Microbiology).
</p>

<p>Because of the possibility that less sensitive virus may be selected
in patients who are receiving acyclovir, all patients should be advised
to take particular care to avoid potential transmission of virus if active
lesions are present while they are on therapy. In severely immunocompromised
patients, the physician should be aware that prolonged or repeated courses
of acyclovir may result in selection of resistant viruses which may not
fully respond to continued acyclovir therapy. </p>

<p>Caution should be exercised when administering Acyclovir to patients
receiving potentially nephrotoxic agents since this may increase the risk
of renal dysfunction. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients are instructed to consult with their
physician if they experience severe or troublesome adverse reactions, they
become pregnant or intend to become pregnant, they intend to breastfeed
while taking orally administered Acyclovir, or they have any other questions.
</p>

<p>GENITAL HERPES INFECTIONS: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted
disease and patients should avoid intercourse when visible lesions are
present because of the risk of infecting intimate partners. Acyclovir Capsules,
Tablets, and Suspension are for oral ingestion only. Medication should
not be shared with others. The prescribed dosage should not be exceeded.
Acyclovir does not eliminate latent viruses. Patients are instructed to
consult with their physician if they do not receive sufficient relief in
the frequency and severity of their genital herpes recurrences. </p>

<p>There are still unanswered questions concerning reproductive/gonadal
toxicity and mutagenesis; long-term studies are continuing. Decreased sperm
production has been seen at high doses in some animals; a placebo-controlled
clinical study using 400 mg or 1000 mg of Acyclovir per day for six months
in humans did not show similar findings. (REF. 40) Chromosomal breaks were
seen in vitro after brief exposure to high concentrations. Some other currently
marketed medications also cause chromosomal breaks, and the significance
of this finding is unknown. A placebo-controlled clinical study using 800
mg of Acyclovir per day for one year in humans did not show any abnormalities
in structure or number of chromosomes. (REF. 28) </p>

<p>HERPES ZOSTER INFECTIONS: Adults age 50 or older tend to have more severe
shingles, and Acyclovir treatment showed more significant benefit for older
patients. Treatment was begun within 72 hours of rash onset in these studies,
and was more useful if started within the first 48 hours. </p>

<p>CHICKENPOX: Although chickenpox in otherwise healthy children is usually
a self limited disease of mild to moderate severity, adolescents and adults
tend to have more severe disease. Treatment was initiated within 24 hours
of the typical chickenpox rash in the controlled studies, and there is
no information regarding the effects of treatment begun later in the disease
course. It is unknown whether the treatment of chickenpox in childhood
has any effect on long term immunity. However, there is no evidence to
indicate that Acyclovir treatment of chickenpox would have any effect on
either decreasing or increasing the incidence or severity of subsequent
recurrences of herpes zoster (shingles) later in life. Intravenous Acyclovir
is indicated for the treatment of varicella- zoster infections in immunocompromised
patients. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Co-administration of probenecid with intravenous
acyclovir has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under
the concentration-time curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance were
correspondingly reduced. (REF. 41) The clinical effects of this combination
have not been studied. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: The data presented
below include references to peak steady-state plasma acyclovir concentrations
observed in humans treated with 800 mg given orally 6 times a day (dosing
appropriate for treatment of herpes zoster) or 200 mg given orally 6 times
a day (dosing appropriate for treatment of genital herpes). Plasma drug
concentrations in animal studies are expressed as multiples of human exposure
to acyclovir at the higher and lower dosing schedules (see Pharmacokinetics).
</p>

<p>Acyclovir was tested in lifetime bioassays in rats and mice at single
daily doses of up to 450 mg/kg administered by gavage. There was no statistically
significant difference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control
animals, nor did acyclovir shorten the latency of tumors. At 450 mg/kg/day,
plasma concentrations were 3 to 6 times human levels in the mouse bioassay
and 1 to 2 times human levels in the rat bioassay. </p>

<p>Acyclovir was tested in two in vitro cell transformation assays. Positive
results were observed at the highest concentration tested (31 to 63 times
human levels) in one system and the resulting morphologically transformed
cells formed tumors when inoculated into immunosuppressed, syngeneic, weanling
mice. Acyclovir was negative (40 to 80 times human levels) in the other,
possibly less sensitive, transformation assay. </p>

<p>In acute cytogenetic studies, there was an increase, though not statistically
significant, in the incidence of chromosomal damage at maximum tolerated
parenteral doses of acyclovir (100 mg/kg) in rats (62 to 125 times human
levels) but not in Chinese hamsters; higher doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg
were clastogenic in Chinese hamsters (380 to 760 times human levels). In
addition, no activity was found after 5 days dosing in a dominant lethal
study in mice (36 to 73 times human levels). In all 4 microbial assays,
no evidence of mutagenicity was observed. Positive results were obtained
in 2 of 7 genetic toxicity assays using mammalian cells in vitro. In human
lymphocytes, a positive response for chromosomal damage was seen at concentrations
150 to 300 times the acyclovir plasma levels achieved in human. At one
locus in mouse lymphoma cells, mutagenicity was observed at concentrations
250 to 500 times human plasma levels. Results in the other five mammalian
cell loci follow: at 3 loci in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, the results
were inconclusive at concentrations at least 1850 times human levels; at
2 other loci in mouse lymphoma cells, no evidence of mutagenicity was observed
at concentrations at least 1500 times human levels. </p>

<p>Acyclovir has not been shown to impair fertility or reproduction in
mice (450 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or in rats (25 mg/kg/day, s.c.). In the mouse
study plasma levels were 9 to 18 times human levels, while in the rat study
they were 8 to 15 times human levels. At a higher dose in the rat (50 mg/kg/day,
s.c.), there was a statistically significant increase in post-implantation
loss, but no concomitant decrease in litter size. In female rabbits treated
subcutaneously with acyclovir subsequent to mating, there was a statistically
significant decrease in implantation efficiency but no concomitant decrease
in litter size at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (16 to 31 times human levels).
No effect upon implantation efficiency was observed when the same dose
was administered intravenously (53 to 106 times humans levels). In a rat
peri- and postnatal study at 50 mg/kg/day s.c. (11 to 22 times human levels),
there was a statistically significant decrease in the group mean numbers
of corpora lutea, total implantation sites and live fetuses in the F1 generation.
Although not statistically significant, there was also a dose-related decrease
in group mean numbers of live fetuses and implantation sites at 12.5 mg/kg/day
and 25 mg/kg/day, s.c. The intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg/day,
a dose known to cause obstructive nephropathy in rabbits, caused a significant
increase in fetal resorptions and a corresponding decrease in litter size
(plasma levels were not measured). However, at a maximum tolerated intravenous
dose of 50 mg/kg/day in rabbits (53 to 106 times human levels), no drug-related
reproductive effects were observed. </p>

<p>Intraperitoneal doses of 80 or 320 mg/kg/day acyclovir given to rats
for 6 and 1 months, respectively, caused testicular atrophy. Plasma levels
were not measured in the one month study and were 24 to 48 times human
levels in the six month study. Testicular atrophy was persistent through
the 4-week postdose recovery phase after 320 mg/kg/day; some evidence of
recovery of sperm production was evident 30 days postdose. Intravenous
doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg/day acyclovir given to dogs for 31 days caused
aspermatogenesis. At 100 mg/kg/day plasma levels were 47 to 94 times human
levels, while at 200 mg/kg/day they were 159 to 317 times human levels.
No testicular abnormalities were seen in dogs given 50 mg/kg/day i.v. for
one month (21 to 41 times human levels) and in dogs given 60 mg/kg/day
orally for one year (6 to 12 times human levels). </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Acyclovir was
not teratogenic in the mouse (450 mg/kg/day, p.o.), rabbit (50 mg/kg/day,
s.c. and i.v.), or in standard tests in the rat (50 mg/kg/day, s.c.). These
exposures resulted in plasma levels 9 and 18, 16 and 106, and 11 and 22
times, respectively, human levels. In a non-standard test in rats, there
were fetal abnormalities, such as head and tail anomalies, and maternal
toxicity. (REF. 42) In this test, rats were given 3 s.c. doses of 100 mg/kg
acyclovir on gestation day 10, resulting in plasma levels 63 and 125 times
human levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Acyclovir should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Although acyclovir was
not teratogenic in standard animal studies, the drug's potential for causing
chromosome breaks at high concentration should be taken into consideration
in making this determination. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed
to systemic acyclovir in Pregnancy Registry. Physicians are encouraged
to register patients by calling (800) 722-9292, ext. 8465. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Acyclovir concentrations have been documented in breast
milk in two women following oral administration of Acyclovir and ranged
from 0.6 to 4.1 times corresponding plasma levels. (REF. 43,44) These concentrations
would potentially expose the nursing infant to a dose of acyclovir up to
0.3 mg/kg/day. Caution should be exercised when Acyclovir is administered
to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children less than 2 years
of age have not been adequately studied. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Co-administration of probenecid with intravenous acyclovir has been
shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time
curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance were correspondingly reduced.
(REF. 41) The clinical effects of this combination have not been studied.
</p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>HERPES SIMPLEX: Short-Term Administration: The most frequent adverse
events reported during clinical trials of treatment of genital herpes with
orally administered Acyclovir were nausea and/or vomiting in 8 of 298 patient
treatments (2.7%) and headache in 2 of 298 (0.6%). Nausea and/or vomiting
occurred in 2 of 287 (0.7%) patients who received placebo. </p>

<p>Less frequent adverse events, each of which occurred in 1 of 298 patient
treatments with orally administered Acyclovir (0.3%), included diarrhea,
dizziness, anorexia, fatigue, edema, skin rash, leg pain, inguinal adenopathy,
medication taste, and sore throat. </p>

<p>LONG-TERM ADMINISTRATION: The most frequent adverse events reported
in a clinical trial for the prevention of recurrences with continuous administration
of 400 mg (two 200 mg capsules) 2 times daily for 1 year in 586 patients
treated with Acyclovir were: nausea (4.8%), diarrhea (2.4%), headache (1.9%),
and rash (1.7%). The 589 control patients receiving intermittent treatment
of recurrences with Acyclovir for 1 year reported diarrhea (2.7%), nausea
(2.4%), headache (2.2%), and rash (1.5%). </p>

<p>The most frequent adverse events reported during the second year by
390 patients who elected to continue daily administration of 400 mg (two
200 mg capsules) 2 times daily for 2 years were headache (1.5%), rash (1.3%),
and paresthesia (0.8%). Adverse events reported by 329 patients during
the third year include asthenia (1.2%), paresthesia (1.2%), and headache
(0.9%). </p>

<p>HERPES ZOSTER: The most frequent adverse events reported during three
clinical trials of treatment of herpes zoster (shingles) with 800 mg of
oral Acyclovir 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days in 323 patients were: malaise
(11.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.9%), vomiting (2.5%), diarrhea (1.5%),
and constipation (0.9%). The 323 placebo recipients reported malaise (11.1%),
nausea (11.5%), headache (11.1%), vomiting (2.5%), diarrhea (0.3%), and
constipation (2.4%). </p>

<p>CHICKENPOX: The most frequent adverse events reported during three clinical
trials of treatment of chickenpox with oral Acyclovir in 495 patients were:
diarrhea (3.2%), abdominal pain (0.6%), rash (0.6%), vomiting (0.6%), and
flatulence (0.4%). The 498 patients receiving placebo reported: diarrhea
(2.2%) flatulence (0.8%), and insomnia (0.4%). </p>

<p>OBSERVED DURING CLINICAL PRACTICE: Based on clinical practice experience
in patients treated with oral Acyclovir in the U.S., spontaneously reported
adverse events are uncommon. Data are insufficient to support an estimate
of their incidence or to establish causation. These events may also occur
as part of the underlying disease process. Voluntary reports of adverse
events which have been received since market introduction include: </p>

<p>GENERAL: fever, headache, pain, peripheral edema, and rarely, anaphylaxis
</p>

<p>NERVOUS: confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, paresthesia, somnolence
(These symptoms may be marked, particularly in older adults.) </p>

<p>DIGESTIVE: diarrhea, elevated liver function tests, gastrointestinal
distress, nausea </p>

<p>HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC: leukopenia, lymphadenopathy </p>

<p>MUSCULOSKELETAL: myalgia </p>

<p>SKIN: alopecia, pruritus, rash, urticaria </p>

<p>SPECIAL SENSES: visual abnormalities </p>

<p>UROGENITAL: elevated creatinine </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Patients have ingested intentional overdoses of up to 100 capsules (20
g) of Acyclovir, with no unexpected adverse effects. </p>

<p>Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility
(2.5 mg/mL) in the intratubular fluid is exceeded. Renal lesions considered
to be related to obstruction of renal tubules by precipitated drug crystals
occurred in the following species: rats treated with i.v. and i.p. doses
of 20 mg/kg/day for 21 and 31 days, respectively, and at s.c. doses of
100 mg/kg/day for 10 days; rabbits at s.c. and i.v. doses of 50 mg/kg/day
for 13 days; and dogs at i.v. doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 31 days. A-6 hr
hemodialysis results in a 60% decrease in plasma acyclovir concentration.
Data concerning peritoneal dialysis are incomplete but indicate that this
method may be significantly less efficient in removing acyclovir from the
blood. In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may
benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored (see DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>TREATMENT OF INITIAL GENITAL HERPES: 200 mg (one 200 mg capsule or one
teaspoonful (5 mL) suspension) every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 10 days.
</p>

<p>CHRONIC SUPPRESSIVE THERAPY FOR RECURRENT DISEASE: 400 mg (two 200 mg
capsules, one 400 mg tablets, or two teaspoonfuls (10 mL) suspension) 2
times daily for up to 12 months, followed by re-evaluation. See INDICATIONS
AND USAGE and PRECAUTIONS for considerations on continuation of suppressive
therapy beyond 12 months. Alternative regimens have included doses ranging
from 200 mg 3 times daily to 200 mg 5 times daily. </p>

<p>INTERMITTENT THERAPY: 200 mg (one 200 mg capsule or one teaspoonful
(5 mL) suspension) every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 5 days. Therapy should
be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom (prodrome) of recurrence.
</p>

<p>ACUTE TREATMENT OF HERPES ZOSTER: 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules, two
400 mg tablets, one 800 mg tablet, or four teaspoonfuls (20 mL) suspension)
every 4 hours orally 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days. </p>

<p>TREATMENT OF CHICKENPOX: 20 mg/kg (not to exceed 800 mg) orally, 4 times
daily for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom.
</p>

<p>PATIENTS WITH ACUTE OR CHRONIC RENAL IMPAIRMENT: Comprehensive pharmacokinetic
studies have been completed following intravenous acyclovir infusions in
patients with renal impairment. Based on these studies, dosage adjustments
are recommended in the following chart for genital herpes and herpes zoster
indications: </p>

<pre>                                                   Adjusted Dosage Regimen

 200 mg every              &gt;10                   200        every 4 hours,      
   4 hours                                                        5x daily      
                           0-10                  200        every 12 hours

   12 hours                0-10                  200        every 12 hours      
 800 mg every              &gt;25                   800        every 4 hours,      
   4 hours                                                        5x daily      
                          10-25                  800        every 8 hours       
                           0-10                  800        every 12 hours      </pre>

<p>HEMODIALYSIS: For patients who require hemodialysis, the mean plasma
half-life of acyclovir during hemodialysis is approximately 5 hours. This
results in a 60% decrease in plasma concentrations following a six-hour
dialysis period. Therefore, the patient's dosing schedule should be adjusted
so that an additional dose is administered after each dialysis. (REF. 45,46)
</p>

<p>PERITONEAL DIALYSIS: No supplemental dose appears to be necessary after
adjustment of the dosing interval. (REF. 47,48) </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Clonidine HCl is a centrally acting antihypertensive agent.. The 0.1
mg tablet is equivalent to 0.087 mg of the free base. Clonidine hydrochloride
is an imidazoline derivative and exists as a mesomeric compound. The chemical
name is 2-(2,6-dichlorophenylamino)-2-imidazoline hydrochloride. Clonidine
hydrochloride is an odorless, bitter, white crystalline substance soluble
in water and alcohol. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Clonidine acts relatively rapidly. The patient's blood pressure declines
within 30 to 60 minutes after an oral dose, the maximum decrease occurring
within 2 to 4 hours. The plasma level of Clonidine peaks in approximately
3 to 5 hours and the plasma half- life ranges from 12 to 16 hours. The
half-life increases up to 41 hours in patients with severe impairment of
renal function. Following oral administration about 40-60% of the absorbed
dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 hours. About 50%
of the absorbed dose is metabolized in the liver. </p>

<p>Clonidine stimulates alpha-adrenoreceptors in the brain stem, resulting
in reduced sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and a decrease
in peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood
pressure. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate remain essentially
unchanged. Normal postural reflexes are intact and therefore orthostatic
symptoms are mild and infrequent. Acute studies with clonidine hydrochloride
in humans have demonstrated a moderate reduction (15% to 20%) of cardiac
output in the supine position with no change in the peripheral resistance;
at a 45 deg tilt there is a smaller reduction in cardiac output and a decrease
of peripheral resistance. During long- term therapy, cardiac output tends
to return to control values, while peripheral resistance remains decreased.
Slowing of the pulse rate has been observed in most patients given clonidine,
but the drug does not alter normal hemodynamic response to exercise. </p>

<p>Other studies in patients have provided evidence of a reduction in plasma
renin activity and in the excretion of aldosterone and catecholamines,
but the exact relationship of these pharmacologic actions to the antihypertensive
effect has not been fully elucidated. </p>

<p>Clonidine acutely stimulates growth hormone release in both children
and adults, but does not produce a chronic elevation of growth hormone
with long-term use. Tolerance may develop in some patients, necessitating
a reevaluation of therapy. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>TOXICOLOGY </p>

<p>In several studies, oral clonidine hydrochloride produced a dose-dependent
increase in the incidence and severity of spontaneously occurring retinal
degeneration in albino rats treated for 6 months or longer. Tissue distribution
studies in dogs and monkeys revealed that clonidine hydrochloride was concentrated
in the choroid of the eye. In view of the retinal degeneration observed
in rats, eye examinations were performed in 908 patients prior to the start
of clonidine hydrochloride therapy, who were then examined periodically
thereafter. In 353 of these 908 patients, examinations were performed for
periods of 24 months or longer. Except for some dryness of the eyes, no
drug- related abnormal ophthalmologic findings were recorded and clonidine
hydrochloride did not alter retinal function as shown by specialized tests
such as the electroretinogram and macular dazzle. In rats, clonidine hydrochloride
in combination with amitriptyline produced corneal lesions within 5 days.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Clonidine is indicated in the treatment of hypertension. Clonidine may
be employed alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>None known. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization
to Clonidine-TTS (patch), substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride
therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash.
In patients who develop an allergic reaction from Clonidine-TTS that extends
beyond the local patch site (such as generalized skin rash, urticaria,
or angioedema), oral clonidine hydrochloride substitution may elicit a
similar reaction. </p>

<p>As with all antihypertensive therapy, Clonidine should be used with
caution in patients with severe coronary insufficiency, recent myocardial
infarction, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. </p>

<p><a name="WITHDRAWAL"></a><b>WITHDRAWAL</b> Patients should be instructed
not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. Sudden cessation
of clonidine treatment has resulted in subjective symptoms such as nervousness,
agitation and headache, accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood
pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma, but such
occurrences have usually been associated with previous administration of
high oral doses (exceeding 1.2 mg/day) and/or with continuation of concomitant
beta-blocker therapy. Rare instances of hypertensive encephalopathy and
death have been reported. When discontinuing therapy with Clonidine, the
physician should reduce the dose gradually over 2 to 4 days to avoid withdrawal
symptomatology. </p>

<p>An excessive rise in blood pressure following Clonidine discontinuance
can be reversed by administration of oral clonidine or by intravenous phentolamine.
If therapy is to be discontinued in patients receiving beta-blockers and
clonidine concurrently, beta-blockers should be discontinued several days
before the gradual withdrawal of Clonidine. </p>

<p>PERIOPERATIVE USE Administration of Clonidine should be continued to
within four hours of surgery and resumed as soon as possible thereafter.
The blood pressure should be carefully monitored and appropriate measures
instituted to control it as necessary. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients who engage in potentially hazardous
activities, such as operating machinery or driving, should be advised of
a potential sedative effect of clonidine. Patients should be cautioned
against interruption of Clonidine therapy without a physician's advice.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is
also taking tricyclic antidepressants, the effect of clonidine may be reduced,
thus necessitating an increase in dosage. Clonidine hydrochloride may enhance
the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedatives.
Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation
of corneal lesions in rats (see TOXICOLOGY). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY In a 132-week (fixed
concentration) dietary administration study in rats, clonidine hydrochloride
administered at 32 to 46 times the maximum recommended daily human dose
was unassociated with evidence of carcinogenic potential. Fertility of
male or female rats was unaffected by clonidine hydrochloride doses as
high as 150 mcg/kg or about 3 times the maximum recommended daily human
dose (MRDHD). Fertility of female rats did, however, appear to be affected
(in another experiment) at dose levels of 500 to 2000 mcg/kg or 10 to 40
times the MRDHD. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: </p>

<p>Reproduction studies performed in rabbits at doses up to approximately
3 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRDHD) of clonidine hydrochloride
have revealed no evidence of teratogenic or embryotoxic potential in rabbits.
In rats, however, doses as low as 1/3 the MRDHD were associated with increased
resorptions in a study in which dams were treated continuously from 2 months
prior to mating. Increased resorptions were not associated with treatment
at the same or at higher dose levels (up to 3 times the MRDHD) when dams
were treated days 6-15 of gestation. Increased resorptions were observed
at much higher levels (40 times the MRDHD) in rats and mice treated days
1-14 of gestation (lowest dose employed in that study was 500 mcg/kg).
There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS As clonidine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk,
caution should be exercised when Clonidine is administered to a nursing
woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have
not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is also taking tricyclic
antidepressants, the effect of clonidine may be reduced, thus necessitating
an increase in dosage. Clonidine hydrochloride may enhance the CNS-depressive
effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedatives. Amitriptyline in combination
with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats (see
TOXICOLOGY). (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Most adverse effects are mild and tend to diminish with continued therapy.
The most frequent (which appear to be dose-related) are dry mouth, occurring
in about 40 of 100 patients; drowsiness, about 33 in 100; dizziness, about
16 in 100; constipation and sedation, each about 10 in 100. The following
less frequent adverse experiences have also been reported in patients receiving
Clonidine , but in many cases patients were receiving concomitant medication
and a causal relationship has not been established. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL Nausea and vomiting, about 5 in 100 patients; anorexia
and malaise, each about 1 in 100; mild transient abnormalities in liver
function tests, about 1 in 100; rare reports of hepatitis; parotitis, rarely.
</p>

<p>METABOLIC Weight gain, about 1 in 100 patients; gynecomastia, about
1 in 1000; transient elevation of blood glucose or serum creatine phosphokinase,
rarely. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Nervousness and agitation, about 3 in 100 patients;
mental depression, about 1 in 100; headache, about 1 in 100; insomnia,
about 5 in 1000. Vivid dreams or nightmares, other behavioral changes,
restlessness, anxiety, visual and auditory hallucinations and delirium
have been reported. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR Orthostatic symptoms, about 3 in 100 patients; palpitations
and tachycardia, bradycardia, each about 5 in 1000. Raynaud's phenomenon,
congestive heart failure, and electrocardiographic abnormalities, i.e.,
conduction disturbances and arrhythmias have been reported rarely. Rare
cases of sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block have been reported,
both with and without the use of concomitant digitalis. </p>

<p>DERMATOLOGICAL Rash, about 1 in 100 patients; pruritus, about 7 in 1000;
hives, angioneurotic edema and urticaria, about 5 in 1000; alopecia, about
2 in 1000. </p>

<p>GENITOURINARY Decreased sexual activity, impotence and loss of libido,
about 3 in 100 patients; nocturia, about 1 in 100; difficulty in micturition,
about 2 in 1000; urinary retention, about 1 in 1000. </p>

<p>OTHER Weakness, about 10 in 100 patients; fatigue, about 4 in 100; discontinuation
syndrome, about 1 in 100; muscle or joint pain, about 6 in 1000 and cramps
of the lower limbs, about 3 in 1000. Dryness, burning of the eyes, blurred
vision, dryness of the nasal mucosa, pallor, weakly positive Coombs' test,
increased sensitivity to alcohol and fever have been reported. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The signs and symptoms of clonidine hydrochloride overdosage include
hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy, irritability, weakness, somnolence,
diminished or absent reflexes, miosis, vomiting and hypoventilation. With
large overdoses, reversible cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias,
apnea, seizures and transient hypertension have been reported. The oral
LD50 of clonidine in rats was 465 mg/kg, and in mice 206 mg/kg. </p>

<p>The general treatment of Clonidine overdosage may include intravenous
fluids as indicated. Bradycardia can be treated with intravenous atropine
sulfate and hypotension with dopamine infusion in addition to intravenous
fluids. Hypertension, associated with overdosage, has been treated with
intravenous furosemide or diazoxide or alpha-blocking agents such as phentolamine.
Tolazoline, an alpha- blocker, in intravenous doses of 10 mg at 30-minute
intervals, may reverse clonidine's effects if other efforts fail. Routine
hemodialysis is of limited benefit, since a maximum of 5% of circulating
clonidine is removed. </p>

<p>In a patient who ingested 100 mg clonidine hydrochloride, plasma clonidine
levels were 60 ng/ml (one hour), 190 ng/ml (1.5 hours), 370 ng/ml (two
hours) and 120 ng/ml (5.5 and 6.5 hours). This patient developed hypertension
followed by hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, hallucinations, semicoma,
and premature ventricular contractions. The patient fully recovered after
intensive treatment. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>ADULTS: The dose of Clonidine must be adjusted according to the patient's
individual blood pressure response. </p>

<p>The following is a general guide to its administration. </p>

<p>INITIAL DOSE 0.1 mg tablet twice daily (morning and bedtime). Elderly
patients may benefit from a lower initial dose. </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE DOSE Further increments of 0.1 mg per day may be made if
necessary until the desired response is achieved. Taking the larger portion
of the total daily dose at bedtime may minimize transient adjustment effects
of dry mouth and drowsiness. The therapeutic doses most commonly employed
have ranged from 0.2 mg to 0.6 mg per day given in divided doses. Studies
have indicated that 2.4 mg is the maximum effective daily dose, but doses
as high as this have rarely been employed. </p>

<p>RENAL IMPAIRMENT Dosage must be adjusted according to the degree of
impairment, and patients should be carefully monitored. Since only a minimal
amount of clonidine is removed during routine hemodialysis, there is no
need to give supplemental clonidine following dialysis. </p>

ARRHYTHMIA 
 <p>
RARE CASES OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR ADVERSE EVENTS, INCLUDING DEATH, CARDIAC
ARREST, TORSADES DE POINTES, AND OTHER VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS, HAVE BEEN
OBSERVED IN THE FOLLOWING CLINICAL SETTINGS, FREQUENTLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH
INCREASED TERFENADINE LEVELS WHICH LEAD TO ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC QT
PROLONGATION:  <p>
 
1. CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF KETOCONAZOLE (NIZORAL) OR ITRACONAZOLE
(SPORANOX) <p>
 
2. OVERDOSE, INCLUDING SINGLE DOSES AS LOW AS 360 MG 
 <p>
3. CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF CLARITHROMYCIN, ERYTHROMYCIN, OR
TROLEANDOMYCIN 
 <p>
4. SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION 
 <p>
TERFENADINE IS CONTRAINDICATED IN PATIENTS TAKING KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE,
ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, OR TROLEANDOMYCIN, AND IN PATIENTS WITH
SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION.  
 <p>
DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSE.  
 <p>
IN SOME CASES, SEVERE ARRHYTHMIAS HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY EPISODES OF SYNCOPE. 
SYNCOPE IN PATIENTS RECEIVING TERFENADINE SHOULD LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION OF
TREATMENT AND FULL EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL ARRHYTHMIAS.  
 <p>
(SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, AND
PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) 
 <p>
 
Terfenadine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist with the chemical name alpha- 
(4-(1,1-Dimethylethyl) phenyl)-4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinebutanol
(+/). The molecular weight is 471.68. The molecular formula is C32H41NO2.  
 <p>
Terfenadine occurs as a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is freely
soluble in chloroform, soluble in ethanol, and very slightly soluble in water.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Terfenadine is chemically distinct from other antihistamines.
<p>
Histamine skin wheal studies have shown that Terfenadine in single and repeated
doses of 60 mg in 64 subjects has an antihistaminic effect beginning at 1-2
hours, reaching its maximum at 3-4 hours, and lasting in excess of 12 hours. 
The correlation between response on skin wheal testing and clinical efficacy is 
unclear. The four best controlled and largest clinical trials each lasted 7
days and involved about 1,000 total patients in comparisons of Terfenadine (60 mg
b.i.d.) with an active drug (chlorpheniramine, 4 mg t.i.d.; dexchlorpheniramine 
2 mg t.i.d.; or clemastine 1 mg b.i.d.). About 50-70% of Terfenadine or other
antihistamine recipients had moderate to complete relief of symptoms, compared
with 30-50% of placebo recipients. The frequency of drowsiness with Terfenadine was 
similar to the frequency with placebo and less than with other antihistamines.  
None of these studies showed a difference between Terfenadine and other
antihistamines in the frequency of anticholinergic effects. In studies which
include 52 subjects in whom EEG assessments were made, no depressant effects
have been observed.  
 <p>
Animal studies have demonstrated that terfenadine is a histamine H1-receptor
antagonist. In these animal studies, no sedative or anticholinergic effects
were observed at effective antihistaminic doses. Radioactive disposition and
autoradiographic studies in rats and radioligand binding studies with guinea
pig brain H1-receptors indicate that, at effective antihistamine doses, neither 
terfenadine nor its metabolites penetrate the blood brain barrier well.  
 <p>
On the basis of a mass balance study using 14C labeled terfenadine the oral
absorption of terfenadine was estimated to be at least 70%. Terfenadine itself
undergoes extensive (99%) first pass metabolism to two primary metabolites, an
active acid metabolite and an inactive dealkylated metabolite. Therefore,
systemic availability of terfenadine is low under normal conditions, and parent 
terfenadine is not normally detectable in plasma at levels &gt;10 ng/mL. Although
in rare cases there was measurable plasma terfenadine in apparently normal
individuals without identifiable risk factors, the implications of this finding 
with respect to the variability of terfenadine metabolism in the normal
population cannot be assessed without further study. Further studies of
terfenadine metabolism in the general population are pending. From information
gained in the 14C study it appears that approximately forty percent of the
total dose is eliminated renally (40% as acid metabolite, 30% dealkyl
metabolite, and 30% minor unidentified metabolites). Sixty percent of the dose
is eliminated in the feces (50% as the acid metabolite, 2% unchanged
terfenadine, and the remainder as minor unidentified metabolites). Studies
investigating the effect of hepatic and renal insufficiency on the metabolism
and excretion of terfenadine are incomplete. Preliminary information indicates
that in cases of hepatic impairment, significant concentrations of unchanged
terfenadine can be detected with the rate of acid metabolite formation being
decreased. A single- dose study in patients with hepatic impairment revealed
increased parent terfenadine and impaired metabolism, suggesting that
additional drug accumulation may occur after repetitive dosing in such
patients. Terfenadine is contraindicated for use in patients with significant
hepatic dysfunction. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) In subjects with
normal hepatic function, unchanged terfenadine plasma concentrations have not
been detected. ELEVATED LEVELS OF PARENT TERFENADINE, WHETHER DUE TO
SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION, CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS, OR OVERDOSE, HAVE
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION AND SERIOUS CARDIAC ADVERSE
EVENTS. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) In controlled clinical trials in
otherwise normal patients with rhinitis, small increases in QTc interval were
observed at doses of 60 mg b.i.d.  In studies at 300 mg b.i.d. a mean increase
in QTc of 10% (range -4% to +30%) (mean increase of 46 msec) was observed.  <p>

Data have been reported demonstrating that compared to young subjects, elderly
subjects experience a 25% reduction in clearance of the acid metabolite after
single-dose oral administration of 120 mg. Further studies are necessary to
fully characterize pharmacokinetics in the elderly.  <p>
 
In vitro studies demonstrate that terfenadine is extensively (97%) bound to
human serum protein while the acid metabolite is approximately 70% bound to
human serum protein. Based on data gathered from in vitro models of
antihistaminic activity, the acid metabolite of terfenadine has approximately
30% of the H1 blocking activity of terfenadine. The relative contribution of
terfenadine and the acid metabolite to the pharmacodynamic effects have not
been clearly defined. Since unchanged terfenadine is usually not detected in
plasma, and active acid metabolite concentrations are relatively high, the acid 
metabolite may be the entity responsible for the majority of efficacy after
oral administration of terfenadine.  
 <p>
In a study involving the administration of a single 60 mg Terfenadine tablet to 24
subjects, mean peak plasma levels of the acid metabolite were 263 ng/mL (range
133-423 ng/mL) and occurred approximately 2.5 hours after dosing. Plasma
concentrations of unchanged terfenadine were not detected. The elimination
profile of the acid metabolite was biphasic in nature with an initial mean
plasma half-life of 3.5 hours followed by a mean plasma half-life of 6 hours. 
Ninety percent of the plasma level time curve was associated with these half-
lives. Although the elimination profile is somewhat complex, the effective
pharmacokinetic half-life can be estimated at approximately 8.5 hours. However, 
receptor binding and pharmacologic effects, both therapeutic and adverse, may
persist well beyond that time.  <p>

SIGNIFICANT HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION.  
 <p>
DO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSE.  
 <p>
IN SOME CASES, SEVERE ARRHYTHMIAS HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY EPISODES OF SYNCOPE. 
SYNCOPE IN PATIENTS RECEIVING TERFENADINE SHOULD LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION OF

 <p>
(SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, AND
PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) 
 <p>
 
Terfenadine undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver by a specific
cytochrome P450 isoenzyme. This metabolic pathway may be impaired in patients
with hepatic dysfunction (alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis) or who are taking
drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or clarithromycin, erythromycin, or
troleandomycin (macrolide antibiotics), or other potent inhibitors of this
isoenzyme.  Interference with this metabolism can lead to elevated terfenadine
plasma levels associated with QT prolongation and increased risk of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias (such as torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and
ventricular fibrillation) at the recommended dose. Terfenadine is contraindicated
for use by patients with these conditions (see WARNING BOX, CONTRAINDICATIONS,
and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).  
 <p>
Other patients who may be at risk for these adverse cardiovascular events
include patients who may experience new or increased QT prolongation while
receiving certain drugs or having conditions which lead to QT prolongation. 
These include patients taking certain antiarrhythmics, bepridil, certain
psychotropics, probucol, or astemizole; patients with electrolyte abnormalities 
such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or taking diuretics with potential for
inducing electrolyte abnormalities; and patients with congenital QT syndrome. 
Terfenadine is not recommended for use by patients with these conditions.  
 <p>
The relationship of underlying cardiac disease to the development of
ventricular tachyarrhythmias while on Terfenadine therapy is unclear; nonetheless,
Terfenadine should also be used with caution in these patients.  <p>

<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
Information For Patients 
 <p>
Patients taking Terfenadine should receive the following information and
instructions. Antihistamines are prescribed to reduce allergic symptoms. 
Patients should be advised to take Terfenadine only as needed and NOT TO EXCEED THE 
PRESCRIBED DOSE. Patients should be questioned about use of any other
prescription or over-the-counter medication, and should be cautioned regarding
the potential for life-threatening arrhythmias with concurrent use of
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or troleandomycin. 
Patients should be advised to consult the physician before concurrent use of
other medications with terfenadine. Patients should be questioned about
pregnancy or lactation before starting Terfenadine therapy, since the drug should
be used in pregnancy or lactation only if the potential benefit justifies the
potential risk to fetus or baby. Patients should also be instructed to store
this medication in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place, away from
heat or direct sunlight, and away from children.  <p>
 
Drug Interactions 
 <p>
KETOCONAZOLE 
 <p>
Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant
ketoconazole with recommended doses of terfenadine demonstrate QT interval
prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g. death, cardiac arrest, and
ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes. Pharmacokinetic data
indicate that ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of terfenadine,
resulting in elevated plasma terfenadine levels. Presence of unchanged
terfenadine is associated with statistically significant prolongation of the QT 
and QTc intervals. CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF KETOCONAZOLE AND TERFENADINE
IS CONTRAINDICATED (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).  
 <p>
ITRACONAZOLE 
 <p>
Torsades de pointes and elevated parent terfenadine levels have been reported
during concomitant use of terfenadine and itraconazole in clinical trials of
itraconazole and from foreign post-marketing sources. One death has also been
reported from foreign post-marketing sources. CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF
ITRACONAZOLE AND TERFENADINE IS CONTRAINDICATED (see CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).  
 <p>
Due to the clinical similarity of other azole-type antifungal agents (including 
fluconazole, metronidazole, and miconazole) to ketoconazole and itraconazole,
concomitant use of these products with terfenadine is not recommended pending
full examination of potential interactions.  
 <p>
MACROLIDES 
 <p>
Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that erythromycin and clarithromycin 
can exert an effect on terfenadine metabolism by a mechanism which may be
similar to that of ketoconazole, but to lesser extent. Although erythromycin
measurably decreases the clearance of the terfenadine acid metabolite, its
influence on terfenadine plasma levels is still under investigation. A few
spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia
including torsades de pointes have been reported in patients receiving
erythromycin or troleandomycin.  <p>
 
CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF TERFENADINE WITH CLARITHROMYCIN, ERYTHROMYCIN, OR 
TROLEANDOMYCIN IS CONTRAINDICATED (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS). Pending full characterization of potential interactions,
concomitant administration of terfenadine with other macrolide antibiotics,
including azithromycin, is not recommended. Studies to evaluate the potential
interaction of terfenadine with azithromycin are in progress.  <p>
 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility 
 <p>
Oral doses of terfenadine, corresponding to 63 times the recommended human
daily dose, in mice for 18 months or in rats for 24 months, revealed no
evidence of tumorigenicity. Microbial and micronucleus test assays with
terfenadine have revealed no evidence of mutagenesis.  
 <p>
Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female
fertility at oral doses of up to 21 times the human daily dose. At 63 times the 
human daily dose there was a small but significant reduction in implants and at 
125 times the human daily dose reduced implants and increased post-implantation 
losses were observed, which were judged to be secondary to maternal toxicity. 
 <p>
Pregnancy Category C <p>
 
There was no evidence of animal teratogenicity. Reproduction studies have been
performed in rats at doses 63 times and 125 times the human daily dose and have 
revealed decreased pup weight gain and survival when terfenadine was
administered throughout pregnancy and lactation. There are no adequate and well 
controlled studies in pregnant women. Terfenadine should be used during pregnancy
only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
 <p>
Nonteratogenic Effects 
 <p>
Terfenadine is not recommended for nursing women. The drug has caused decreased pup 
weight gain and survival in rats given doses 63 times and 125 times the human
daily dose throughout pregnancy and lactation. Effects on pups exposed to
Terfenadine only during lactation are not known, and there are no adequate and well 
controlled studies in women during lactation.  
 <p>
Pediatric Use 
 <p>
Safety and effectiveness of Terfenadine in children below the age of 12 years have
not been established.

Cardiovascular Adverse Events <p>
 
Rare reports of severe cardiovascular adverse effects have been received which
include ventricular tachyarrhythmias (torsades de pointes, ventricular
tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest), hypotension,
palpitations, syncope, and dizziness. Rare reports of deaths resulting from
ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been received (see CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Hypotension, palpitations,
syncope, and dizziness could reflect undetected ventricular arrhythmia. IN SOME 
PATIENTS, DEATH, CARDIAC ARREST, OR TORSADES DE POINTES HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY
EPISODES OF SYNCOPE. (See WARNING BOX.) Rare reports of serious cardiovascular
adverse events have been received, some involving QT prolongation and torsades
de pointes, in apparently normal individuals without identifiable risk factors; 
there is not conclusive evidence of a causal relationship of these events with
terfenadine. Although in rare cases there was measurable plasma terfenadine,
the implications of this finding with respect to the variability of terfenadine 
metabolism in the normal population cannot be assessed without further study.
In controlled clinical trials in otherwise normal patients with rhinitis, small 
increases in QTc interval were observed at doses of 60 mg b.i.d. In studies at
300 mg b.i.d. a mean increase in QTc of 10% (range -4% to +30%) (mean increase
of 46 msec) was observed.  
 <p>
General Adverse Events 
 <p>
Experience from clinical studies, including both controlled and uncontrolled
studies involving more than 2,400 patients who received Terfenadine, provides
information on adverse experience incidence for periods of a few days up to six 
months. The usual dose in these studies was 60 mg twice daily, but in a small
number of patients, the dose was as low as 20 mg twice a day, or as high as 600 
mg daily.  
 <p>
In controlled clinical studies using the recommended dose of 60 mg b.i.d., the
incidence of reported adverse effects in patients receiving Terfenadine was similar 
to that reported in patients receiving placebo. (See Table below.)

possibly associated with drug administration. These include: alopecia (hair
loss or thinning), anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, confusion, depression 
galactorrhea, insomnia, menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea),
musculoskeletal symptoms, nightmares, paresthesia, photosensitivity, rapid
flare of psoriasis, seizures, sinus tachycardia, sweating, thrombocytopenia,
tremor, urinary frequency, and visual disturbances.  
 <p>
In clinical trials, several instances of mild, or in one case, moderate

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Signs and symptoms of overdosage may be absent or mild (e.g. headache, nausea,
confusion); but adverse cardiac events including cardiac arrest, ventricular
arrhythmias including torsades de pointes and QT prolongation have been
reported at overdoses of 360 mg or more and occur more frequently at doses in
excess of 600 mg, and QTc prolongations of up to 30% have been observed at a
dose of 300 mg b.i.d. Seizures and syncope have also been reported. USE OF
DOSES IN EXCESS OF 60 MG B.I.D. IS NOT RECOMMENDED. (See WARNING BOX,
ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) 
 <p>
In overdose cases, where ventricular arrhythmias are associated with
significant QTc prolongation, treatment with antiarrhythmics known to prolong
QTc intervals is not recommended.  
 <p>
Therefore, in cases of overdosage, cardiac monitoring for at least 24 hours is
recommended and for as long as QTc is prolonged, along with standard measures
to remove any unabsorbed drug. Limited experience with the use of hemoperfusion 
(N = 1) or hemodialysis (N=3) was not successful in completely removing the
acid metabolite of terfenadine from the blood.  
 <p>
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of overdosage should be symptomatic and
supportive after the acute stage.  
 <p>
Oral LD50 values for terfenadine were greater than 5000 mg/kg in mature mice
and rats. The oral LD50 was 438 mg/kg in newborn rats.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
One tablet (60 mg) twice daily for adults and children 12 years and older.

GENERIC NAME:  <p>
 
TERFENADINE (TER-FEN-A-DEEN) 
 <p>
60 MG TABLETS 
 <p>
This leaflet is a summary of important information about Terfenadine. Be sure to
ask your doctor if you have any questions or want to know more.  
 <p>
WHAT IS Terfenadine AND WHAT IS IT USED FOR?  
 <p>
Terfenadine is an antihistamine. It is used to relieve symptoms of seasonal
allergies or hay fever. These symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, itching of 
the nose or throat, and itchy, watery eyes.  
 <p>
Clinical studies conducted to date with Terfenadine have not demonstrated
effectiveness in relieving the symptoms of the common cold.  
 <p>
HOW DO I TAKE Terfenadine?  
 <p>
--Take Terfenadine only as needed when you have symptoms of seasonal allergy or hay 
fever.  <p>
 
--The recommended dose of Terfenadine is one tablet taken twice a day. DO NOT TAKE
MORE OFTEN THAN ONE TABLET EVERY TWELVE HOURS 
 <p>
--Follow any other instructions your doctor gives you.  
 <p>
WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT WARNINGS ABOUT USING Terfenadine?  
<p>
WARNING: DO NOT USE Terfenadine IF YOU ARE USING KETOCONAZOLE (NIZORAL),
ITRACONAZOLE (SPORANOX), ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN (BIAXIN), OR
TROLEANDOMYCIN (TAO). IF YOU HAVE ANY LIVER OR HEART PROBLEMS, TALK TO YOUR
DOCTOR BEFORE YOU USE Terfenadine.  <p>
 
Do not use Terfenadine with any other prescription or nonprescription medicines
without first talking to your doctor and pharmacist.  
 <p>
If you faint, become dizzy, have any unusual heartbeats, or any other unusual
symptoms while using Terfenadine, contact your doctor.  
 <p>
If you become pregnant or are nursing a baby, talk to your doctor about whether 
you should take Terfenadine. Your doctor will decide whether you should take
Terfenadine based on the benefits and the risks.  
 <p>
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF USING Terfenadine?  
 <p>
The side effects which occur most often are headaches and mild stomach or
intestinal problems.  
 <p>
In rare cases, Terfenadine has caused IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS which may cause serious
problems like fainting, dizziness, cardiac arrest, or death. In these rare
cases, this occurred when Terfenadine was taken:  
 <p>
--in more than the recommended dose (remember, do not take more often than one
tablet every twelve hours.); 
 <p>
--with the antifungal drugs ketoconazole (Nizoral) or itraconazole (Sporanox);
 <p>
--with the antibiotic drugs erythromycin, clarithromycin (Biaxin), or
troleandomycin (TAO); 
 <p>
--by patients with serious liver disease.  <p>
 
HOW DO I STORE Terfenadine?  <p>
 
Terfenadine should be stored in a tightly closed container, in a cool place, out of 
direct sunlight. It should be kept away from children.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory benzeneacetic acid derivative,
designated chemically as 2-((2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino) benzeneacetic acid,
monosodium salt. </p>

<p>Diclofenac sodium is a faintly yellow-white to light beige, virtually
odorless, slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble
in methanol, sparingly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in acetonitrile,
and insoluble in chloroform and in 0.1N hydrochloric acid. Its molecular
weight is 318.14. In water, diclofenac sodium has a single dissociation
constant (pKa) of 4.0. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>In pharmacologic studies, Diclofenac has shown anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
and antipyretic activity. As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents, its mode of action is not known; however, its ability to inhibit
prostaglandin synthesis may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect.
</p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after
fasting oral administration, with peak plasma levels occurring in 1-4 hours.
However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose
is systemically available. The mean terminal half-life in plasma is approximately
2 hours, but early elimination is much more rapid. Area under the plasma
concentration curve (AUC) is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg
to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately
1.0, 1.5, and 2 mcg/ml for 25-mg, 50-mg, and 75-mg doses, respectively.
It should be noted that the administration of several individual tablets
may not yield equivalent results in peak concentration as the administration
of one tablet of a higher strength. This is due to the uncertainty of complete
gastric emptying of all tablets at once to the duodenum. Clearance and
volume of distribution were about 350 ml/min and 550 ml/kg, respectively.
After repeated oral administration of 50 mg b.i.d., Diclofenac did not
accumulate in plasma. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites
is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity. More than 99% of
diclofenac is reversibly bound to human plasma albumin. </p>

<p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and
biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the
metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine, and
approximately 35% in the bile. </p>

<p>Conjugates of the principal metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, account
for 20 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10-20% of the dose
excreted in the bile. Conjugates of three other metabolites (5-hydroxy-,3'-hydroxy-,
and 4' 5-dihydroxy-diclofenac) together account for 10-20% of the dose
excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. Conjugates
of unchanged diclofenac account for 5-10% of the dose excreted in the urine
and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated
drug is excreted. It is not known whether there is genetic polymorphism
in the enzymes responsible for metabolism of diclofenac. </p>

<p>The extent of absorption of Diclofenac is not significantly affected
when the drug is taken with food; however, there is usually a delay in
the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours, with delays as long as 10 hours
in some patients. There is also a reduction in peak plasma levels. </p>

<p>A 4-week study comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg
b.i.d.) in younger (26-46) versus older (66-81) adults did not show differences
between age groups (10 patients per age group). </p>

<p>Single-dose studies of the effects of renal function impairment (50
mg intravenously) or hepatic impairment (100 mg oral solution) have been
performed in small numbers of patients. To date no differences in the pharmacokinetics
of diclofenac have been detected in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
</p>

<p>In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42
ml/min), AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy
subjects. </p>

<p>In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis
(variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubins, N=10),
diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values were comparable
to those in healthy subjects. </p>

<p>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into
the joint occurs during the first 4 hours following a dose, while plasma
levels are higher than those in synovial fluid, after which the process
reverses and synovial fluid levels are slightly higher than plasma levels.
It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness
of Diclofenac. </p>

<p>In healthy subjects, the daily administration of 150 mg of Diclofenac
for 3 weeks resulted in a mean fecal blood loss less than that observed
with 3.0 g of aspirin daily. In repeated-dose studies, mean fecal blood
loss with 150 mg of Diclofenac was also less than that observed with 750
mg of naproxen or 150 mg of indomethacin. Repeated-dose endoscopic studies
in normal volunteers showed that daily doses of 75 mg or 100 mg of Diclofenac
for 1 week caused fewer gastric lesions, and those that did occur had lower
scores than those which occurred following 500 mg daily doses of naproxen.
The clinical significance of these </p>

<p>findings is unknown since there is no evidence available to indicate
that diclofenac is less likely than other drugs of its class to cause serious
gastrointestinal lesions when used in chronic therapy. </p>

<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Diclofenac has been administered
safely in combination with gold or corticosteroids. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Diclofenac is indicated for acute and chronic treatment of the signs
and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Diclofenac is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it.
Diclofenac should not be given to patients in whom Diclofenac, aspirin,
or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce asthma, urticaria,
or other allergic-type reactions because severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like
reactions to Diclofenac have been reported in such patients. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS </p>

<p>Peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported in
patients receiving Diclofenac. Physicians and patients should therefore
remain alert for ulceration and bleeding in patients treated chronically
with diclofenac sodium, even in the absence of previous G.I. tract symptoms.
It is recommended that patients be maintained on the lowest dose of diclofenac
sodium possible consistent with achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response.
</p>

<p>RISK OF G.I. ULCERATIONS, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION WITH NSAID THERAPY:
Serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation
can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated
chronically with NSAID therapy. Although minor upper gastrointestinal problems,
such as dyspepsia, are common, usually developing early in therapy, physicians
should remain alert for ulceration and bleeding in patients treated chronically
with NSAIDs even in the absence of previous G.I. tract symptoms. In patients
observed in clinical trials of several months to 2 years duration, symptomatic
upper G.I. ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation appear to occur in approximately
1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated
for 1 year. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms
of serious G.I. toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. </p>

<p>Studies to date have not identified any subset of patients not at risk
of developing peptic ulceration and bleeding. Except for a prior history
of serious G.I. events and other risk factors known to be associated with
peptic ulcer disease, such as alcoholism, smoking, etc., no risk factors
(e.g., age, sex) have been associated with increased risk. Elderly or debilitated
patients seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals
and most spontaneous reports of fatal G.I. events are in this population.
Studies </p>

<p>to date are inconclusive concerning the relative risk of various NSAIDs
in causing such reactions. High doses of any NSAID probably carry a greater
risk of these reactions, although controlled clinical trials showing this
do not exist in most cases. In considering the use of relatively large
doses (within the recommended dosage range), sufficient benefit should
be anticipated to offset the potential increased risk of G.I. toxicity.
</p>

<p>HEPATIC EFFECTS </p>

<p>As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, elevations of one
or more liver tests may occur during Diclofenac therapy. These laboratory
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with
continued therapy. Borderline elevations, (i.e., 1.2-3 times the upper
limit of normal (ULN)), or greater elevations of transaminases occurred
in about 15% of Diclofenac-treated patients. The SGPT (ALT) test is probably
the most sensitive indicator of liver injury. In clinical trials, meaningful
elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of SGOT (SGPT was not measured
in all studies) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5700 patients at
some time during Diclofenac treatment. In a large, open, controlled trial,
meaningful elevations of SGOT and/or SGPT occurred in about 4% of 3700
patients treated for 2-6 months, including marked elevations (i.e., more
than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3700 patients. In that open-label
study, a lower incidence of borderline (1.2-3 times the ULN), moderate
(3-8 times the ULN), and marked (&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of SGOT
or SGPT was observed in patients randomized to other NSAIDs. Transaminase
elevations were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than
in those with rheumatoid arthritis (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>Transaminase elevations were reversible on cessation of therapy, and
among 51 patients in all studies with marked elevations, signs and symptoms
of liver disease occurred in only 3 cases, and only 1 patient developed
jaundice. Most patients with borderline elevations did not have therapy
interrupted; transaminase elevations in most of these cases disappeared
or did not progress. There were no identifying features to distinguish
those patients who developed marked elevations from those who did not.
</p>

<p>In addition to the enzyme elevations seen in clinical trials, rare cases
of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis,
have been reported. </p>

<p>Because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing
symptoms, physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients
receiving long-term therapy with Diclofenac. The optimum times for making
the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. In the
largest U.S. trial (open-label), which involved 3700 patients monitored
first at 8 weeks and 1200 patients monitored again at 24 weeks, almost
all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients
became symptomatic. In 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed
marked transaminase elevations, abnormal tests occurred during the first
2 months of therapy with Diclofenac. Based on this experience the first
transaminase measurement should be made no later than 8 weeks after the
start of Diclofenac treatment. As with other NSAIDs, if abnormal liver
tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or </p>

<p>symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations
occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Diclofenac should be discontinued.
</p>

<p>To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between
transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning
signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy,
pruritus jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and &quot;flu-like&quot;
symptoms), and the appropriate action to take should these signs and symptoms
appear. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>ALLERGIC REACTIONS: As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Diclofenac.
Specific allergic manifestations consisting of swelling of eyelids, lips,
pharynx and larynx, urticaria, asthma, and bronchospasm, sometimes with
a concomitant fall in blood pressure (severe at times) have been observed
in clinical trials and/or the foreign marketing experience with Diclofenac.
Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely from foreign sources; in U.S. clinical
trials with Diclofenac in over 6000 patients, 1 case of anaphylaxis was
reported. In controlled clinical trials, allergic reactions have been observed
at an incidence of 0.5%. These reactions can occur without prior exposure
to the drug. </p>

<p>FLUID RETENTION AND EDEMA: Fluid retention and edema have been observed
in some patients taking Diclofenac. Therefore, as with other nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drugs, Diclofenac should be used with caution in patients
with a history of cardiac decompensation, hypertension, or other conditions
predisposing to fluid retention. </p>

<p>RENAL EFFECTS: As a class, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have
been associated with renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal
pathology in long-term administration to animals. Papillary necrosis was
observed only in 1 animal study with diclofenac, a 4-week study in baboons
in which the drug was administered intramuscularly. In oral studies some
evidence of renal toxicity was noted but papillary necrosis was not reported.
</p>

<p>A second form of renal toxicity generally associated with nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drugs is seen in patients with conditions leading to
a reduction in renal blood flow or blood volume, where renal prostaglandins
have a supportive role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these
patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug results
in a dose dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily,
in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal failure.
Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal
function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and
the elderly. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
is typically followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. </p>

<p>Cases of significant renal failure in patients receiving Diclofenac
have been reported from postmarketing experience, but were not observed
in over 4,000 patients in clinical trials during which serum creatinines
and BUNs were followed serially. There were only 11 patients (0.28%) whose
serum creatinines a Since Diclofenac metabolites are eliminated primarily
by the kidneys, patients with significantly impaired renal function should
be more closely monitored than subjects with normal renal function. </p>

<p>PORPHYRIA: The use of diclofenac in patients with hepatic porphyria
should be avoided. To date, 1 patient has been described in whom diclofenac
probably triggered a clinical attack of porphyria. The postulated mechanism
for causing such attacks by diclofenac, as well as some other NSAIDs, is
through stimulation of the porphyrin precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA, demonstrated in rats). </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Diclofenac, like other drugs of its class, is not free of side effects.
The side effects of these drugs can cause discomfort and, rarely, there
are more serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which
may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcomes. </p>

<p>NSAIDs are often essential agents in the management of arthritis, but
they also may be commonly employed for conditions which are less serious.
</p>

<p>Physicians may wish to discuss with their patients the potential risks
(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS) and likely benefits
of NSAID treatment, particularly when the drugs are used for less serious
conditions where treatment without NSAIDs may represent an acceptable alternative
to both the patient and physician. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Because serious G.I. tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without
warning symptoms, physicians should follow chronically treated patients
for the signs and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding and should inform
them of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Risk Of G.I. Ulcerations,
Bleeding, And Perforation With NSAID Therapy). </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>ASPIRIN: Concomitant administration of Diclofenac and aspirin is not
recommended because Diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during
the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations,
peak plasma levels, and AUC values. </p>

<p>ANTICOAGULANTS: While studies have not shown Diclofenac to interact
with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, caution should be exercised,
nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs. Because
prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect
platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including
Diclofenac, and warfarin requires close monitoring of patients to be certain
that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required. </p>

<p>DIGOXIN, METHOTREXATE, CYCLOSPORINE: Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs,
through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause increased toxicity of
certain drugs. Digoxin and methotrexate serum levels may be elevated as
well as cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Patients receiving these drugs who
are started on, or are given increased doses of, Diclofenac or any other
NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should
be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs.
In the case of digoxin, serum levels should be monitored. </p>

<p>LITHIUM: Diclofenac decreases lithium renal clearance and increases
lithium plasma levels. In patients taking Diclofenac and lithium concomitantly,
lithium toxicity may develop. </p>

<p>ORAL HYPOGLYCEMICS: Diclofenac does not alter glucose metabolism in
normal subjects nor are the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents altered
by the concomitant administration of Diclofenac. There are rare reports,
however, from postmarketing experiences of changes in effects of insulin
or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of diclofenac which necessitated
changes in the doses of such agents. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic effects
have been reported. A direct causal relationship has not been established,
but physicians should consider the possibility that diclofenac may alter
a diabetic patient's response to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. </p>

<p>DIURETICS: Diclofenac and other NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of diuretics.
Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated
with increased serum potassium levels. </p>

<p>OTHER DRUGS: In small groups of patients (7-10/interaction study), the
concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine,
prednisolone, doxycycline, or digitoxin did not significantly affect the
peak levels and AUC values of Diclofenac. </p>

<p>PROTEIN BINDING </p>

<p>In vitro, Diclofenac interferes minimally or not at all with the protein
binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone
(10% decrease in binding), or warfarin. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin,
chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole
have no influence in vitro on the protein binding of Diclofenac in human
serum. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>EFFECT ON BLOOD COAGULATION: Diclofenac increases platelet aggregation
time but does not affect bleeding time, plasma thrombin clotting time,
plasma fibrinogen or factors V and VII to XII. Statistically significant
changes in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times have been reported
in normal volunteers. The mean changes were observed to be less than 1
second in both instances, however, and are unlikely to be clinically important.
Diclofenac is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, however, and all drugs
that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis interfere with platelet function to
some degree; therefore, patients who may be adversely affected by such
an action should be carefully observed. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats given Diclofenac up to 2 mg/kg/day
(approximately the human dose) have revealed no significant increases in
tumor incidence. </p>

<p>There was a slight increase in benign mammary fibroadenomas in mid-dose
females (high-dose females had excessive mortality), but the increase was
not significant for this common rat tumor. Diclofenac did not show mutagenic
potential in various mutagenicity studies including the Ames test. Diclofenac
administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day did not affect fertility.
A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study is underway. </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: Reproduction studies have been performed in mice
given Diclofenac (up to 20 mg/kg/day) and in rats and rabbits given Diclofenac
(up to 10 mg/kg/day), and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity despite
the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity. In rats, maternally
toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced
fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been
shown to cross the placental barrier in mice and rats. </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Diclofenac should be used during pregnancy only if the benefits to the
mother justify the potential risk to the fetus. Because of the known effects
of prostaglandin inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure
of ductus arteriosus), use of Diclofenac during late pregnancy should be
avoided. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>The effects of Diclofenac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are
unknown. However, as with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, it
is possible that Diclofenac may inhibit uterine contraction. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Diclofenac has been found in the milk of nursing mothers. As with other
drugs that are excreted in milk, Diclofenac is not recommended for use
in nursing women. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Dosage recommendations and indications for use in children have not
been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>ASPIRIN: Concomitant administration of Diclofenac and aspirin is not
recommended because Diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during
the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations,
peak plasma levels, and AUC values. </p>

<p>ANTICOAGULANTS: While studies have not shown Diclofenac to interact
with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, caution should be exercised,
nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs. Because
prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect
platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including
Diclofenac, and warfarin requires close monitoring of patients to be certain
that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required. </p>

<p>DIGOXIN, METHOTREXATE, CYCLOSPORINE: Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs,
through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause increased toxicity of
certain drugs. Digoxin and methotrexate serum levels may be elevated as
well as cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Patients receiving these drugs who
are started on, or are given increased doses of, Diclofenac or any other
NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should
be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs.
In the case of digoxin, serum levels should be monitored. </p>

<p>LITHIUM: Diclofenac decreases lithium renal clearance and increases
lithium plasma levels. In patients taking Diclofenac and lithium concomitantly,
lithium toxicity may develop. </p>

<p>ORAL HYPOGLYCEMICS: Diclofenac does not alter glucose metabolism in
normal subjects nor are the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents altered
by the concomitant administration of Diclofenac. There are rare reports,
however, from postmarketing experiences of changes in effects of insulin
or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of diclofenac which necessitated
changes in the doses of such agents. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic effects
have been reported. A direct causal relationship has not been established,
but physicians should consider the possibility that diclofenac may alter
a diabetic patient's response to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. </p>

<p>DIURETICS: Diclofenac and other NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of diuretics.
Concomitant treatment with potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated
with increased serum potassium levels. </p>

<p>OTHER DRUGS: In small groups of patients (7-10/interaction study), the
concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine,
prednisolone, doxycycline, or digitoxin did not significantly affect the
peak levels and AUC values of Diclofenac. </p>

<p>PROTEIN BINDING </p>

<p>In vitro, Diclofenac interferes minimally or not at all with the protein
binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone
(10% decrease in binding), or warfarin. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin,
chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole
have no influence in vitro on the protein binding of Diclofenac in human
serum. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse reaction information is derived from blinded-controlled and
open-label clinical trials and worldwide marketing experience. In the description
below, rates of the more common events represent clinical study results;
rarer events are derived principally from marketing experience and publications,
and accurate rate estimates are generally impossible. </p>

<p>The incidence of common adverse reactions (greater than 1%) is based
upon controlled clinical trials in 1543 patients treated up to 13 weeks.
By far the most common adverse effects were gastrointestinal symptoms,
most of them minor, occurring in about 20%, and leading to discontinuation
in about 3%, of patients. Peptic ulcer or G.I. bleeding occurred in clinical
trials in less than 1% of approximately 1800 patients during their first
3 months of diclofenac treatment and in less than 2% of approximately 800
patients followed for 1 year. The only control group with sufficient patients
for comparison received aspirin and only for the first 30 days of treatment.
Comparative rates were 0.2% for peptic ulcer or G.I. bleeding in approximately
2000 diclofenac treated patients and 0.6% in approximately 600 aspirin-treated
patients. </p>

<p>In double-blind trials there were fewer minor gastrointestinal complaints
in 1227 patients treated with Diclofenac than in 721 patients treated with
aspirin, 22% vs 33% (compared to 13% on placebo). </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal symptoms were followed in frequency by central nervous
system side effects such as headache (7%) and dizziness (3%). </p>

<p>Meaningful (exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations
of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) occurred at an overall rate of about 2% during
the first 2 months of Diclofenac treatment. Unlike aspirin, where elevations
occur more frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, these elevations
were more frequently observed in patients with osteoarthritis (2.6%) than
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (0.7%). Marked elevations (exceeding
8 times the upper limit of normal) were seen in about 1% of patients treated
for 2-6 months (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with
Diclofenac: </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Worldwide reports on overdosage with diclofenac cover 27 cases. In 10
of these 27 cases, diclofenac was the only drug taken; all of these patients
recovered. The highest dose of diclofenac was 2.5 g in a 20-year-old male
who suffered acute renal failure as a consequence, and who was treated
with three dialysis sessions and recovered in 2 days. The next highest
dose was 2.35 g in a 17-year old girl who experienced vomiting and drowsiness.
A dose of 2.0 g of diclofenac was taken by a woman of unspecified age who
remained asymptomatic. </p>

<p>Animal LD50's show a wide range of susceptibilities to acute overdosage
with primates being more resistant to acute toxicity than rodents (LD50
in mg/kg- rats, 55; dogs, 500; monkeys, 3200). </p>

<p>In case of acute overdosage it is recommended that the stomach be emptied
by vomiting or lavage. Forced diuresis may theoretically be beneficial
because the drug is excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion
in the elimination of Diclofenac (99% protein bound, see ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY) remains unproven. In addition to supportive measures, the
use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption
of Diclofenac. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Diclofenac may be administered as 25-mg, 50-mg, and 75-mg enteric-coated
tablets. Patients should be generally maintained on the lowest dosage of
Diclofenac consistent with achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response.
</p>

<p>In osteoarthritis, the recommended dosage is 100-150 mg/day in divided
doses, 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., or 75 mg b.i.d. Dosages above 150 mg/day
have not been studied in patients with osteoarthritis. </p>

<p>In rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage is 150-200 mg/day in
divided doses, 50 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d., or 75 mg b.i.d. Dosages above 200
mg/day have not been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. </p>

<p>In ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended dosage is 100-125 mg/day,
administered as 25 mg q.i.d., with an extra 25 mg dose at bedtime if necessary.
Dosages above 125 mg/day have not been studied in patients with ankylosing
spondylitis. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Metformin hydrochloride
(N,N- dimethylimidodcarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride) is not chemically
or pharmacologically related to the oral sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>Metformin hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline compound
with a molecular formula of C4H11N5 -- HCl and a molecular weight of 165.63.
Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble
in acetone, ether or chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of
a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY </p>

<p>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance
in NIDDM subjects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.
Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from those of sulfonylureas.
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption
of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity (increases peripheral glucose
uptake and utilization). Unlike sulfonylureas, Metformin does not produce
hypoglycemia in either diabetic or nondiabetic subjects (except in special
circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With
metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin
levels and day- long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. </p>

<p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter U.S. clinical trial
involving obese NIDDM patients whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled
with dietary management alone (baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of
approximately 240 mg/dL), treatment with Metformin (up to 2.55 g/day) for
29 weeks resulted in significant mean net reduction in fasting and postprandial
plasma glucose (PPG) and HbA1c of 59 mg/dL, 83 mg/dL, and 1.8%, respectively,
compared to placebo group (see Table 1). </p>

<p>Monotherapy with Metformin may be effective in patients who have not
responded to sulfonylureas or who have only a partial response to sulfonylureas
or who have ceased to respond to sulfonylureas. In such patients, if adequate
glycemic control is not attained with Metformin monotherapy, the combination
of Metformin and a sulfonylurea may have a synergistic effect, since both
agents act to improve glucose tolerance by different but complimentary
mechanisms. </p>

<p>A 29-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Metformin and glyburide,
alone and in combination, was conducted in obese NIDDM patients who had
failed to achieve adequate glycemic control while on maximum doses of glyburide
(baseline FPG of approximately 250 mg/dL) (see Table 2). Patients randomized
to continue on glyburide experienced worsening of glycemic control, with
mean increases in FPG, PPG and HbA1c of 14 mg/dL, 3 mg/dL and 0.2%, respectively.
In contrast, those randomized to Metformin (up to 2.5 g/day) did not experience
a deterioration in glycemic control, but rather a slight improvement, with
mean reductions in FPG, PPG and HbA1c of 1 mg/dL, 6 mg/dL and 0.4%, respectively.
The combination of Metformin and glyburide was synergistic in reducing
FPG, PPG and HbA1c levels by 63 mg/dL, 65 mg/dL, and 1.7%, respectively.
Compared to the results of glyburide treatment alone, the net differences
with combined treatment were -77 mg/dL, -68 mg/dL and -1.9%, respectively
(see Table 2). </p>

<p>The magnitude of the decline in fasting blood glucose concentration
following the institution of Metformin therapy is proportional to the level
of fasting hyperglycemia. Non-insulin-dependent diabetics with higher fasting
glucose concentrations will experience greater declines in plasma glucose
and glycosylated hemoglobin. </p>

<p>Metformin has a modest favorable effect on serum lipids, which are often
abnormal in NIDDM patients. In clinical studies, particularly when baseline
levels were abnormally elevated, Metformin, alone or in combination with
a sulfonylurea, lowered mean fasting serum triglycerides, total cholesterol
and LDL cholesterol levels and had no adverse effects on other lipid levels
(see Table 3). </p>

<p>In contrast to sulfonylureas, body weight of individuals on Metformin
tends to remain stable or may even decrease somewhat (see Table 1 and 2).
In summary, metformin-treated patients showed significant improvement in
all parameters of glycemic control (FPG, PPG and HbA1c), stabilization
or decrease in body weight, and a tendency to improvement in the lipid
profile, particularly when baseline values are abnormally elevated. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>ABSORPTION AND BIOAVAILABILITY: </p>

<p>The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet
given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single
oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg and 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550mg,
indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses,
which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.
Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin,
as shown by approximately a 40% lower peak concentration and 25% lower
AUC in plasma and a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration
following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food,
compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical
relevance of these decreases is unknown. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION: </p>

<p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single
oral doses of 850 mg averaged 654+/- 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound
to plasma proteins in contrast to sulfonylureas which are more than 90%
protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a
function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of Metformin
, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48
hours and are generally &lt;1 mcgm/mL. During controlled clinical trials,
maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcgm/mL, even at maximum
doses. </p>

<p>METABOLISM AND ELIMINATION: </p>

<p>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that
metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic
metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary
excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater
than creatinine clearance which indicates that tubular secretion is the
major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately
90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first
24 hours, with a plasma elimination half- life of approximately 6.2 hours.
In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting
that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS: </p>

<p>NIDDM SUBJECTS: </p>

<p>In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between
single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between diabetics
and nondiabetics (see Table 4), nor is there any accumulation of metformin
in either group at usual clinical doses. </p>

<p>RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: </p>

<p>In subjects with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine
clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and
the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine
clearance (see Table 4). </p>

<p>HEPATIC INSUFFICIENCY: </p>

<p>No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in subjects with hepatic
insufficiency. </p>

<p>GERIATRICS: </p>

<p>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in
healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance is decreased,
the half-life is prolonged and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young
subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics
with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see
Table 4). </p>

</pre>

<p>PEDIATRICS: </p>

<p>No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in pediatric subjects.
</p>

<p>GENDER: </p>

<p>Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly in
diabetic and nondiabetic subjects when analyzed according to gender (males=19,
females=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with
NIDDM, the antihyperglycemic effect of Metformin was comparable in males
and females. </p>

<p>RACE: </p>

<p>No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race
have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of Metformin in patients
with NIDDM, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in whites (n=249),
blacks (n=51) and hispanics (n=24). </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Metformin , as monotherapy, is indicated as an adjunct to diet to lower
blood glucose in patients with NIDDM whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily
managed on diet alone. </p>

<p>Metformin may be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea when diet and
Metformin or a sulfonylurea alone do not result in adequate glycemic control.
In initiating treatment for NIDDM, diet should be emphasized as the primary
form of treatment. Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in
the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary management alone may be effective
in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia. Loss of
blood glucose control in diet-managed patients may be transient, thus requiring
only short-term pharmacologic therapy. The importance of regular physical
activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should
be identified and corrective measures taken where possible. If this treatment
program fails to reduce symptoms and/or blood glucose, the use of Metformin
alone or Metformin plus a sulfonylurea should be considered. </p>

<p>If, after a suitable trial of such treatments, glucose control still
has not been achieved, consideration should be given to the use of insulin.
Judgments should be based on regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Metformin is contraindicated in patients with: </p>

<p>1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine
levels &gt;/=1.5 mg/dL (males), &gt;/=1.4 mg/dL (females) or abnormal creatinine
clearance) which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular
collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicemia (see WARNINGS
and PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>2. Metformin should be temporarily withheld in patients undergoing radiologic
studies involving parenteral administration of iodinated contrast materials,
because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.
(See also PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>3. Known hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride. </p>

<p>4. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis,
with or without coma. Diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin.

<p><b>SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY: </b></p>

<p>THE ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AS COMPARED TO TREATMENT
WITH DIET ALONE OR DIET PLUS INSULIN. THIS WARNING IS BASED ON THE STUDY
CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY GROUP DIABETES PROGRAM (UGDP), A LONG- TERM
PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLUCOSE-LOWERING
DRUGS IN PREVENTING OR DELAYING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH
NON-INSULIN- DEPENDENT DIABETES. THE STUDY INVOLVED 1027 PATIENTS WHO WERE
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FIVE TREATMENT GROUPS (DIABETES, 19 (Suppl.2):747-830,
1970; DIABETES, 24 (Suppl.1):65-184, 1975). </p>

<p>THE UGDP REPORTED THAT PATIENTS TREATED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS WITH DIET PLUS
A FIXED DOSE OF TOLBUTAMIDE (1.5 G PER DAY) OR DIET PLUS A FIXED DOSE OF
PHENFORMIN (100 MG PER DAY), HAD A RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY APPROXIMATELY
2.5 TIMES THAT OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH DIET ALONE, RESULTING IN DISCONTINUATION
OF BOTH THESE TREATMENTS IN THE UGDP STUDY. TOTAL MORTALITY WAS INCREASED
IN BOTH THE TOLBUTAMIDE- AND PHENFORMIN-TREATED GROUPS AND THIS INCREASE
WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PHENFORMIN- TREATED GROUP. DESPITE
CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS, THE FINDINGS
OF THE UGDP STUDY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE BASIS FOR THIS WARNING. THE PATIENT
SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF Metformin AND
ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY. </p>

<p>ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE DRUG IN THE SULFONYLUREA CATEGORY (TOLBUTAMIDE) AND
ONE IN THE BIGUANIDE CATEGORY (PHENFORMIN) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY,
IT IS PRUDENT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT TO CONSIDER THAT THIS WARNING MAY
ALSO APPLY TO OTHER RELATED ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS, IN VIEW OF THE SIMILARITIES
IN MODE OF ACTION AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AMONG THE DRUGS IN EACH CATEGORY.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: </p>

<p>MONITORING OF RENAL FUNCTION--Metformin is known to be substantially
excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic
acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus,
patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for
their age should not receive Metformin. In patients with advanced age,
Metformin should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for
adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal
function. In elderly patients, renal function should be monitored regularly
and, generally, Metformin should not be titrated to the maximum dose (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Before initiation of Metformin therapy and at least annually thereafter,
renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in
whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should
be assessed more frequently and Metformin discontinued if evidence of renal
impairment is present. </p>

<p>USE OF CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT RENAL FUNCTION OR METFORMIN
DISPOSITION- -Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function
or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition
of Metformin, such as cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular
secretion (See Drug Interactions), should be used with caution. </p>

<p>RADIOLOGIC STUDIES INVOLVING THE USE OF IODINATED CONTRAST MATERIALS
(FOR EXAMPLE, INTRAVENOUS UROGRAM, INTRAVENOUS CHOLANGIOGRAPHY, ANGIOGRAPHY,
AND SCANS WITH CONTRAST MATERIALS)--Parenteral contrast studies with iodinated
materials can lead to acute renal failure and have been associated with
lactic acidosis in patients receiving Metformin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, Metformin should
be withheld for at least 48 hours prior to, and 48 hours subsequent to,
the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated
and found to be normal. </p>

<p>HYPOXIC STATES--Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause,
acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions
characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and
may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on
Metformin therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued. </p>

<p>SURGICAL PROCEDURES--Metformin therapy should be temporarily suspended
for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with
restricted intake of food and fluids ) and should not be restarted until
the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated
as normal. </p>

<p>ALCOHOL INTAKE--Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin
on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive
alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Metformin. </p>

<p>IMPAIRED HEPATIC FUNCTION--Since impaired hepatic function has been
asociated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Metformin should generally
be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic
disease. </p>

<p>VITAMIN B12 LEVELS--A decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal
serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, is observed
in approximately 7% of patients receiving Metformin in controlled clinical
trials of 29 weeks duration. Such decrease, possibly due to interference
with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however,
very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible
with discontinuation of Metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement
of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on
Metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated
and managed (see Laboratory Tests). </p>

<p>Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake
or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin
B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at
two- to three- year intervals may be useful. </p>

<p>CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS OF PREVIOUSLY CONTROLLED DIABETIC--A diabetic
patient previously well controlled on Metformin who develops laboratory
abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined
illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic
acidosis. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood
glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate and metformin levels.
If acidosis of either form occurs, Metformin must be stopped immediately
and other appropriate corrective measures initiated (see also WARNINGS).
</p>

<p>HYPOGLYCEMIA--Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving Metformin
alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake
is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation,
or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas)
or ethanol. </p>

<p>Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal
or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible
to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in
the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
</p>

<p>LOSS OF CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE--When a patient stabilized on any diabetic
regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery,
a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur. At such times, it may be
necessary to withhold Metformin and temporarily administer insulin. Metformin
may be reinstituted after the acute episode is resolved. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of oral antidiabetic drugs in lowering blood glucose
to a targeted level decreases in many patients over a period of time. This
phenomenon, which may be due to progression of the underlying disease or
to diminished responsiveness to the drug, is known as secondary failure,
to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective
during initial therapy. Should secondary failure occur with Metformin or
sulfonylurea monotherapy, combined therapy with Metformin and sulfonylurea
may result in a response. Should secondary failure occur with combined
Metformin/sulfonylurea therapy, it may be necessary to initiate insulin
therapy. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: </p>

<p>Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of
Metformin and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed
about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular
exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose, glycosylated
hemoglobin, renal function and hematologic parameters. </p>

<p>The risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose
to its development, as noted in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections should
be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue Metformin
immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained
hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence or other nonspecific
symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Metformin,
gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy,
are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms
could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. </p>

<p>Patients should be counselled against excessive alcohol intake, either
acute or chronic, while receiving Metformin. </p>

<p>Metformin alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia, although it may
occur when Metformin is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas. When
initiating combination therapy, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms
and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should
be explained to patients. (See Patient Labeling Printed Below) </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: </p>

<p>Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements
of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal
of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose
titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response.
Thereafter, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored.
Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating
long-term control (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit
and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should
be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has
rarely been seen with Metformin therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin
B12 deficiency should be excluded. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>GLYBURIDE: In a single-dose interaction study in NIDDM subjects, co-administration
of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and Cmax
were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this
study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic
effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Concomitant Metformin and Oral Sulfonylurea
Therapy). </p>

<p>FUROSEMIDE: A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study
in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both
compounds were affected by co- administration. Furosemide increased the
metformin plasma and blood Cmax by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any
significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with
metformin, the Cmax and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively,
than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased
by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No
information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide
when co-administered chronically. </p>

<p>NIFEDIPINE: A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study
in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine
increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and
increased the amount excreted in the urine. Tmax and half- life were unaffected.
Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption metformin. Metformin had minimal
effects on nifedipine. </p>

<p>CATIONIC DRUGS: Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine,
procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim,
and vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically
have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common
renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and
oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both
single- and multiple- dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies,
with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations
and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no
change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had
no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain
theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose
adjustment of Metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients
who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal
renal tubular secretory system. </p>

<p>OTHER: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss
of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazide and other diuretics,
corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives,
phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs,
and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving
Metformin, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate
glycemic control. </p>

<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol
and metformin and Ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose
interaction studies. </p>

<p>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore,
less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates,
sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas,
which are extensively bound to serum proteins. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </p>

<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing
duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses
up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These
doses are both approximately three times the maximum recommended human
daily dose on a body surface area basis. No evidence of carcinogenicity
with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there
was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. However,
an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps was seen in female
rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. No evidence of a mutagenic potential to
metformin was found in the Ames test (S. Typhimurium), gene mutation test
(mouse lymphoma cells), chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes),
or In-vivo micronuclei formation test (mouse bone marrow). </p>

<p>Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin administration
at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, or approximately two times the maximum
recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY B. Safety in pregnant women has not been established.
Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day,
or about two times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a body surface
area basis. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial
placental barrier to metformin. Because animal reproduction studies are
not always predictive of human response, any decision to use this drug
should be balanced against the benefits and risks. </p>

<p>Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels
during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities,
there is a consensus among experts that insulin be used during pregnancy
to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: </p>

<p>Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk
and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have
not been conducted in nursing mothers, but caution should be exercised
in such patients, and a decision should be made whether to discontinue
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance
of the drug to the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Studies
in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) have not been conducted.
</p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE: </p>

<p>Controlled clinical studies of Metformin did not include sufficient
numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently
from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has
not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger
patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney
and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater
in patients with impaired renal function, it should only be used in patients
with normal renal function (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Pharmacokinetics). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function,
Metformin should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be
taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring
of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to
the maximum dose of Metformin (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>GLYBURIDE: In a single-dose interaction study in NIDDM subjects, co-administration
of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and Cmax

renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and
oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both
single- and multiple- dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies,
with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations
and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no
change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had
no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain
theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose
adjustment of Metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients
who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal
renal tubular secretory system. </p>

<p>OTHER: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss
of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazide and other diuretics,
corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives,
phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs,
and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving
Metformin, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate
glycemic control. </p>

<p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol
and metformin and Ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose
interaction studies. </p>

<p>Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore,
less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates,
sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas,
which are extensively bound to serum proteins. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>LACTIC ACIDOSIS: See WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE Sections.
</p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence, and anorexia) are the most common
reactions to Metformin and are approximately 30% more frequent in patients
on Metformin monotherapy than in placebo-treated patients, particularly
during initiation of Metformin therapy. These symptoms are generally transient
and resolve spontaneously during continued treatment. Occasionally, temporary
dose reduction may be useful. In controlled trials, Metformin was discontinued
due to gastrointestinal reactions in approximately 4% of patients. </p>

<p>Because gastrointestinal symptoms during therapy initiation appear to
be dose-related, they may be decreased by gradual dose escalation and by
having patients take Metformin with meals (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p>Because significant diarrhea and/or vomiting may cause dehydration and
prerenal azotemia, under such circumstances, Metformin should be temporarily
discontinued. For patients who have been stabilized on Metformin, nonspecific
gastrointestinal symptoms should not be attributed to therapy unless intercurrent
illness or lactic acidosis have been excluded. </p>

<p>SPECIAL SENSES: During initiation of Metformin therapy, approximately
3% of patients may complain of an unpleasant or metallic taste, which usually
resolves spontaneously. </p>

<p>DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: The incidence of rash/dermatitis in controlled
clinical trials was comparable to placebo for Metformin monotherapy and
to sulfonylurea for Metformin/sulfonylurea therapy. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC: (See also PRECAUTIONS). During controlled clinical trials
of 29 weeks duration, approximately 9% of patients on Metformin monotherapy
and 6% of patients on Metformin/sulfonylurea therapy developed asymptomatic
subnormal serum vitamin B12 levels; serum folic acid levels did not decrease
significantly. However, only five cases of megaloblastic anemia have been
reported with metformin administration (none during U.S. clinical studies)
and no increased incidence of neuropathy has been observed. Therefore,
serum B12 levels should be appropriately monitored or periodic parenteral
B12 supplementation considered. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Metformin possesses no pharmacodynamic properties, either primary or
secondary, which could be expected to result in abuse as a recreational
drug or addiction. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Hypoglycemia has not been seen with ingestion of up to 85 grams of Metformin,
although lactic acidosis has occurred in such circumstances (see WARNINGS).
Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good
hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal
of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia
in diabetes mellitus with Metformin or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage
of Metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness
and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of
2550 mg. Metformin should be given in divided doses with meals and should
be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, as described below,
both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification
of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.
</p>

<p>During treatment initiation and dose titration (see below, USUAL STARTING
DOSE), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic
response to Metformin and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient.
Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of
approximately three months. THE THERAPEUTIC GOAL SHOULD BE TO DECREASE
BOTH FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS TO NORMAL
OR NEAR NORMAL BY USING THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF Metformin, EITHER
WHEN USED AS MONOTHERAPY OR IN COMBINATION WITH SULFONYLUREA. </p>

<p>Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit
detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose
at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e.,
loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period
of effectiveness. </p>

<p>Short-term administration of Metformin may be sufficient during periods
of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet
alone. </p>

<p>USUAL STARTING DOSE: </p>

<p>In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below
1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually
increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. </p>

<p>Metformin 500 MG TABLETS: </p>

<p>The usual starting dose of Metformin 500 mg tablets is one tablet b.i.d.,
given with the morning and evening meals. Dosage increases should be made
in increments of one tablet every week, given in divided doses, up to a
maximum of 2500 mg per day. Metformin can be administered twice a day up
to 2000 mg per day (e.g., 1000 mg b.i.d. with morning and evening meals).
If a 2500mg daily dose is required, it may be better tolerated given t.i.d.
with meals. </p>

<p>Metformin 850 MG TABLETS: </p>

<p>The usual starting dose of Metformin 850 mg tablets is one tablet daily,
given with the morning meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments
of one tablet every OTHER week, given in divided doses, up to a maximum
of 2550 mg per day. The usual maintenance dose is 850 mg b.i.d. with the
morning and evening meals. When necessary, patients may be given 850 mg
t.i.d. with meals. </p>

<p>TRANSFER FROM OTHER ANTIDIABETIC THERAPY: </p>

<p>When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other
than chlorpropamide to Metformin, no transition period generally is necessary.
While transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised
during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide
in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia.
</p>

<p>CONCOMITANT Metformin AND ORAL SULFONYLUREA THERAPY: </p>

<p>If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of
Metformin monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition
of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing Metformin at the maximum dose,
even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred.
Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug- drug interaction data are currently
available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). Published
clinical information exists for the use of metformin with either chlorpropamide,
tolbutamide or glipizide. No published clinical information exists regarding
concomitant use of metformin with acetohexamide or tolazamide. </p>

<p>With concomitant Metformin and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control
of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. However,
attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each
drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant Metformin and sulfonylurea
therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy
continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken.
(See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea). </p>

<p>If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months
of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of Metformin and the maximum
dose of an oral sulfonylurea, institution of insulin therapy and discontinuation
of these oral agents should be considered. </p>

<p>SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS: </p>

<p>Metformin is not recommended for use in pregnancy or for use in children.
The initial and maintenance dosing of Metformin should be conservative
in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal
function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a
careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should
not be titrated to the maximum dose of Metformin. </p>

<p>In debilitated or malnourished patients, the dosing should also be conservative
and based on a careful assessment of renal function. </p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<P></P>
<b>USE IN PREGNANCY 
</b> <P></P>
When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors
can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is
detected, Enalapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. See WARNINGS,
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality.  <P></P>
 
 
Enalapril  is the maleate salt of enalapril, the ethyl ester
of a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat.
Enalapril maleate is chemically described as (S)-1-(N-(1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-
phenylpropyl)-L-alanyl)-L-proline, (Z)-2-butenedioate salt (1:1). Its empirical 
formula is C20H28N2O5.C4H4O4.  <P></P>
 
Enalapril maleate is a white to off-white, crystalline powder with a molecular
weight of 492.53. It is sparingly soluble in water, soluble in ethanol, and
freely soluble in methanol.  <P></P>
 
Enalapril is a pro-drug; following oral administration, it is bioactivated by
hydrolysis of the ethyl ester to enalaprilat, which is the active angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor.  <P></P>
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </b></pre>
<P></P>
Mechanism Of Action 
 <P></P>
Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that
catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance,
angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the
adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart
failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin
II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone
secretion. Although the latter decrease is small, it results in small increases 
of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients treated with Enalapril alone for up
to 48 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of approximately 0.2 mEq/L were
observed. In patients treated with Enalapril plus a thiazide diuretic, there was
essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS.) Removal of
angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma
renin activity.  <P></P>
 
ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether
increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in
the therapeutic effects of Enalapril remains to be elucidated.  
 <P></P>
While the mechanism through which Enalapril lowers blood pressure is believed to
be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Enalapril
is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although
Enalapril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients
(usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to 
enalapril monotherapy than non-black patients.  <P></P>
 
Pharmacokinetics And Metabolism 
 <P></P>
Following oral administration of Enalapril, peak serum concentrations of
enalapril occur within about one hour. Based on urinary recovery, the extent of 
absorption of enalapril is approximately 60 percent. Enalapril absorption is
not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Following 
absorption, enalapril is hydrolyzed to enalaprilat, which is a more potent
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor than enalapril; enalaprilat is poorly
absorbed when administered orally. Peak serum concentrations of enalaprilat
occur three to four hours after an oral dose of enalapril maleate. Excretion of 
Enalapril is primarily renal. Approximately 94 percent of the dose is recovered
in the urine and feces as enalaprilat or enalapril. The principal components in 
urine are enalaprilat, accounting for about 40 percent of the dose, and intact
enalapril.  There is no evidence of metabolites of enalapril, other than
enalaprilat.  <P></P>
 
The serum concentration profile of enalaprilat exhibits a prolonged terminal
phase, apparently representing a small fraction of the administered dose that
has been bound to ACE. The amount bound does not increase with dose, indicating 
a saturable site of binding. The effective half-life for accumulation of
enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is 11 hours.  
 <P></P>
The disposition of enalapril and enalaprilat in patients with renal
insufficiency is similar to that in patients with normal renal function until
the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/min or less. With glomerular filtration 
rate &lt; or = 30 mL/min, peak and trough enalaprilat levels increase, time to peak
concentration increases and time to steady state may be delayed. The effective
half-life of enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is
prolonged at this level of renal insufficiency. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION.) Enalaprilat is dialyzable at the rate of 62 mL/min.  
 <P></P>
Studies in dogs indicate that enalapril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, 
if at all; enalaprilat does not enter the brain. Multiple doses of enalapril
maleate in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating 
rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C enalapril maleate.  
Radioactivity was found to cross the placenta following administration of
labeled drug to pregnant hamsters.  <P></P>

Pharmacodynamics And Clinical Effects 
 <P></P>
Hypertension: Administration of Enalapril to patients with hypertension of
severity ranging from mild to severe results in a reduction of both supine and
standing blood pressure usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic
postural hypotension is therefore infrequent, although it might be anticipated
in volume-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS.) 
 <P></P>
In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of
enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour with peak
reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours.  
 <P></P>
At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at
least 24 hours. In some patients the effects may diminish toward the end of the 
dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  <P></P>
 
In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require
several weeks of therapy.  <P></P>
 
The antihypertensive effects of Enalapril have continued during long term
therapy.  Abrupt withdrawal of Enalapril has not been associated with a rapid
increase in blood pressure.  <P></P>
 
In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure
reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with 
an increase in cardiac output and little or no change in heart rate. Following
administration of Enalapril, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular 
filtration rate is usually unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in
patients with renovascular hypertension.  
 <P></P>
When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering
effects of Enalapril are approximately additive.  
 <P></P>
In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to
hypertensive patients receiving Enalapril. In this study there was no evidence of 
a blunting of the antihypertensive action of Enalapril.  <P></P>
 
Heart Failure: In trials in patients treated with digitalis and diuretics,
treatment with enalapril resulted in decreased systemic vascular resistance,
blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart size, and
increased cardiac output and exercise tolerance. Heart rate was unchanged or
slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or increased. There
was a beneficial effect on severity of heart failure as measured by the New
York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and
fatigue.  Hemodynamic effects were observed after the first dose, and appeared
to be maintained in uncontrolled studies lasting as long as four months.
Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart
failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies lasting from eight weeks to 
over one year.  
<P></P>
Heart Failure, Mortality Trials: In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical
trial, 2569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and ejection 
fraction &lt; or = 35 percent were randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed
for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated with an
11 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and a 30 percent reduction in
hospitalization for heart failure. Diseases that excluded patients from
enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (&gt;2 attacks/day),
hemodynamically significant valvular or outflow tract obstruction, renal
failure (creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL), cerebral vascular disease (e.g., significant
carotid artery disease), advanced pulmonary disease, malignancies, active
myocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. The mortality benefit associated
with enalapril does not appear to depend upon digitalis being present.  
 <P></P>
A second multicenter trial used the SOLVD protocol for study of asymptomatic or 
minimally symptomatic patients. SOLVD-Prevention patients, who had left
ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or = 35% and no history of symptomatic heart
failure, were randomized to placebo (n=2117) or enalapril (n=2111) and followed 
for up to 5 years. The majority of patients in the SOLVD-Prevention trial had a 
history of ischemic heart disease. A history of myocardial infarction was
present in 80 percent of patients, current angina pectoris in 34 percent, and a 
history of hypertension in 37 percent. No statistically significant mortality
effect was demonstrated in this population. Enalapril-treated subjects had 32%
fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure, and 32% fewer total heart
failure hospitalizations. Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients
receiving enalapril developed symptoms of overt heart failure. Hospitalizations 
for cardiovascular reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant
reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group
(for enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 1201 first hospitalizations, 
2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to
look for such an effect.  <P></P>
 
The SOLVD-Prevention trial was not designed to determine whether treatment of
asymptomatic patients with low ejection fraction would be superior, with
respect to preventing hospitalization, to closer follow-up and use of enalapril 
at the earliest sign of heart failure. However, under the conditions of follow
up in the SOLVD-Prevention trial (every 4 months at the study clinic; personal
physician as needed), 68% of patients on placebo who were hospitalized for
heart failure had no prior symptoms recorded which would have signaled
initiation of treatment.  <P></P>
 
The SOLVD-Prevention trial was also not designed to show whether enalapril
modified the progression of underlying heart disease.  <P></P>
 
In another multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (CONSENSUS) limited to
patients with NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure and radiographic evidence
of cardiomegaly, use of enalapril was associated with improved survival. The
results are shown in the following table.  <P></P><PRE>

                      Six Months     One Year

 </PRE><P></P>
                                   
In both CONSENSUS and SOLVD-Treatment trials, patients were also usually
receiving digitalis, diuretics or both.  
 <P></P>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Hypertension 
 <P></P>
Enalapril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.  
 <P></P>
Enalapril is effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents 
especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of
Enalapril and thiazides are approximately additive.  
 <P></P>
Heart Failure 
 <P></P>
Enalapril is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, 
usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients Enalapril
improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of
hospitalization (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality
Trials for details and limitations of survival trials).  <P></P>
 
In using Enalapril consideration should be given to the fact that another
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, 
particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease,
and that available data are insufficient to show that Enalapril does not have a
similar risk. (See WARNINGS.) <P></P>
 
Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
 <P></P>
In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction
(ejection fraction &lt; or = 35 percent), Enalapril decreases the rate of development of 
overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart
failure. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials
for details and limitations of survival trials.) <P></P>
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Enalapril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product
and in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with 
an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.  <P></P>
 
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <P></P>
 <P></P>
USE IN PREGNANCY 
 <P></P>
When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors
can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is
detected, Enalapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. See WARNINGS,
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality.  
 <P></P>
ANGIOEDEMA 
 <P></P>
Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has
been reported in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
including Enalapril. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases
Enalapril should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring
should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and
symptoms has occurred. In instances where swelling has been confined to the
face and lips the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although
antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated
with laryngeal edema may be fatal. WHERE THERE IS INVOLVEMENT OF THE TONGUE,
GLOTTIS OR LARYNX, LIKELY TO CAUSE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, APPROPRIATE THERAPY,
E.G., SUBCUTANEOUS EPINEPHRINE SOLUTION 1:1000 (0.3 ML TO 0.5 ML) AND/OR
MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE A PATENT AIRWAY, SHOULD BE PROMPTLY PROVIDED. (See 
ADVERSE REACTIONS).  
 <P></P>
PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF ANGIOEDEMA UNRELATED TO ACE INHIBITOR THERAPY MAY BE 
AT INCREASED RISK OF ANGIOEDEMA WHILE RECEIVING AN ACE INHIBITOR (See Also
CONTRAINDICATIONS).  
 <P></P>
Hypotension 
 <P></P>
Excessive hypotension is rare in uncomplicated hypertensive patients treated
with Enalapril alone. Patients with heart failure given Enalapril commonly have
some reduction in blood pressure, especially with the first dose, but
discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is
not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be observed 
when initiating therapy. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Patients at risk for
excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive
azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, include those with
the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high
dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose,
renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may
be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), 
reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating
therapy with Enalapril in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able 
to tolerate such adjustments. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE
REACTIONS.) In patients at risk for excessive hypotension, therapy should be
started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be
followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of
enalapril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to
patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, in whom an excessive
fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or
cerebrovascular accident.  <P></P>
 
If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine
position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A 
transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of
Enalapril, which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure
has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or
discontinuation of Enalapril or concomitant diuretic may be necessary.  
 <P></P>
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis 
 <P></P>
Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to
cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated
patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment especially if
they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials 
of enalapril are insufficient to show that enalapril does not cause
agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed several
cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis in which a causal relationship to
enalapril cannot be excluded. Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in 
patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. 
 <P></P>
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity And Mortality 
 <P></P>
ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when
administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the
world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be
discontinued as soon as possible.  
 <P></P>
The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy
has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension,
neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure,
and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from
decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been
associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and
hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity intrauterine growth retardation, and
patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear
whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.  
 <P></P>
These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-
inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose
embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first
trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant,
physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of Enalapril as soon
as possible.  <P></P>
 
Rarely, (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no
alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers
should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial
ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic
environment.  
 <P></P>
If oligohydramnios is observed, Enalapril should be discontinued unless it is
considered lifesaving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-
stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending 
upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however,
that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained
irreversible injury.  <P></P>
 
Infants with histories of In Utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely 
observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs,
attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal
perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of
reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. 
Enalapril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal
circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and
theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no
experience with the latter procedure.  <P></P>
 
No teratogenic effects of oral enalapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats
and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 333 times (in rats),
and 50 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.  
 <P></P>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> 
General <P></P>
 <P></P>
Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible 
individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may
depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment
with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including Enalapril, may be
associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute
renal failure and/or death.  <P></P>
 
In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal 
artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were
observed in 20 percent of patients. These increases were almost always
reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril and/or diuretic therapy. In such
patients renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of
therapy.  <P></P>
 
Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent pre-existing
renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum
creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when Enalapril has been given 
concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with
pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the
diuretic and/or Enalapril may be required.  <P></P>
 
EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION OR HEART FAILURE SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE 
ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) <P></P>
 
Hemodialysis Patients: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients
dialyzed with high-flux membranes (e.g.,AN 69*) and treated concomitantly with
an ACE inhibitor. In these patients consideration should be given to using a
different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive
agent.  
 <P></P>
Hyperkalemia: Elevated serum potassium (greater than 5.7 mEq/L) was observed in 
approximately one percent of hypertensive patients in clinical trials. In most
cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. 
Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.28 percent of
hypertensive patients. In clinical trials in heart failure, hyperkalemia was
observed in 3.8 percent of patients but was not a cause for discontinuation.  
 <P></P>
Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency,
diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics,
potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which
should be used cautiously, if at all, with Enalapril. (See Drug Interactions.) 
 <P></P>
Cough: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. 
Characteristically, the cough is nonproductive, persistent and resolves after
discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered as 
part of the differential diagnosis of cough.  <P></P>
 
Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia
with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II
formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is 
considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume
expansion.  
 <P></P>
 
Information For Patients 
 <P></P>
Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during 
treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril. 
Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or
symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips,
tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until
they have consulted with the prescribing physician.  
 <P></P>
Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness, especially 
during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patients
should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the
prescribing physician.  <P></P>
 
All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration
may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid
volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also
lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with
the physician.  
 <P></P>
Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing
potassium without consulting their physician.  <P></P>

Neutropenia: Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of
infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign of neutropenia.  
 <P></P>
Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the
consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and
they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted 
from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first
trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their
physicians as soon as possible.  <P></P>
 
NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with
enalapril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and
effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible
adverse or intended effects.  
 <P></P>
Drug Interactions 
 <P></P>
Hypotension--Patients On Diuretic Therapy: Patients on diuretics and especially 
those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally
experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy 
with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be
minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake
prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue 
the diuretic, provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at
least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an
additional hour. (See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) <P></P>
 
Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of Enalapril is
augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g.,<P></P>
diuretics).  
 
Other Cardiovascular Agents: Enalapril has been used concomitantly with beta
adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking agents,
hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant
adverse interactions.  
 <P></P>
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Enalapril attenuates potassium loss caused by
thiazide-type diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone,
triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt 
substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if 
concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated
hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of
serum potassium. Potassium sparing agents should generally not be used in
patients with heart failure receiving Enalapril.  
 <P></P>
Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium
concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE
inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients
receiving concomitant Enalapril and lithium and were reversible upon
discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be
monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly with lithium. 
 <P></P>
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility 
 <P></P>
There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when enalapril was administered
for 106 weeks to rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day (150 times* the maximum daily 
human dose). Enalapril has also been administered for 94 weeks to male and
female mice at doses up to 90 and 180 mg/kg/day, respectively, (150 and 300
times* the maximum daily dose for humans) and showed no evidence of
carcinogenicity.  <P></P>
 
Neither enalapril maleate nor the active diacid was mutagenic in the Ames
microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. Enalapril was also 
negative in the following genotoxicity studies: rec-assay, reverse mutation
assay with E. Coli, sister chromatid exchange with cultured mammalian cells,
and the micronucleus test with mice, as well as in an In Vivo cytogenic study
using mouse bone marrow.  <P></P>
 
There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female
rats treated with 10 to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril.

Enalapril has been evaluated for safety in more than 10,000 patients, including
over 1000 patients treated for one year or more. Enalapril has been found to be
generally well tolerated in controlled clinical trials involving 2987 patients.

For the most part, adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature. In
clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences 
was required in 3.3 percent of patients with hypertension and in 5.7 percent of

Miscellaneous: A symptom complex has been reported which may include a positive 
ANA, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia, 
myositis, fever, serositis, vasculitis, leukocytosis, eosinophilia,
photosensitivity, rash and other dermatologic manifestations.  <P></P>
 
Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving Enalapril (0.2
percent). Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If
angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs 
treatment with Enalapril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy
instituted immediately. (See WARNINGS.) <P></P>
 
Hypotension: In the hypertensive patients, hypotension occurred in 0.9 percent
and syncope occurred in 0.5 percent of patients following the initial dose or
during extended therapy. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation 
of therapy in 0.1 percent of hypertensive patients. In heart failure patients,
hypotension occurred in 6.7 percent and syncope occurred in 2.2 percent of
patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in
1.9 percent of patients with heart failure. (See WARNINGS.) <P></P>
 
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity And Mortality: (See WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity 
And Mortality).  <P></P>
 
Cough: See PRECAUTIONS, Cough 
 <P></P>
Clinical Laboratory Test Findings 
 <P></P>
Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS), hyponatremia.  
 <P></P>
Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: In controlled clinical trials minor increases
in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of 
therapy, were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential
hypertension treated with Enalapril alone. Increases are more likely to occur in
patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery
stenosis. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In patients with heart failure who were also
receiving diuretics with or without digitalis increases in blood urea nitrogen
or serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of Enalapril and/or
other concomitant diuretic therapy, were observed in about 11 percent of
patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for
discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients.  <P></P>
 
Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of
approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently 
in either hypertension or congestive heart failure patients treated with
Enalapril but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia
coexists.  In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued
therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia, including cases of hemolysis in
patients with G-6- PD deficiency, has been reported; a causal relationship to
enalapril has not been established.  <P></P>
 
Liver Function Tests: Elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have
occurred.  <P></P>
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans.  
 <P></P>
The oral LD50 of enalapril is 2000 mg/kg in mice and rats.  
 <P></P>
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension, for which the 
usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution.  
 <P></P>
Enalaprilat may be removed from general circulation by hemodialysis and has
been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis.  
 <P></P>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <P></P>
Hypertension 
 <P></P>
In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic
hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of Enalapril. The
diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before
beginning therapy with Enalapril to reduce the likelihood of hypotension. (See
WARNINGS.) If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with Enalapril alone 
diuretic therapy may be resumed.  <P></P>
 
If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be used 
under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has
stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug 
Interactions.) <P></P>
 
The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is 5 mg once a day. 
Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual
dosage range is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single dose or two
divided doses.  In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive
effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an 
increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood 
pressure is not controlled with Enalapril alone, a diuretic may be added.  
 <P></P>
Concomitant administration of Enalapril with potassium supplements, potassium
salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum 
potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).  <P></P>
 
Dosage Adjustment In Hypertensive Patients With Renal Impairment 
 <P></P>
The usual dose of enalapril is recommended for patients with a creatinine
clearance &gt;30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For
patients with creatinine clearance &lt; or = 30 mL/min (serum creatinine &gt;/=3 mg/dL),
the first dose is 2.5 mg once daily. The dosage may be titrated upward until
blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily.  <P></P>

Heart Failure 
 <P></P>
Enalapril is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, 
usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis.  
 <P></P>
The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg administered once or twice daily. The
usual therapeutic dosing range is 5 to 20 mg daily, given as a single dose or
two divided doses; the majority of patient experience in clinical studies has
been with twice daily dosing. Dosage may be adjusted depending upon clinical
response (see WARNINGS). In the placebo-controlled studies which demonstrated
improved survival, the dose of Enalapril was titrated upward as tolerated by the
patient. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg.  
 <P></P>
Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
 <P></P>
In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice
daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in
divided doses).  <P></P>
 
After the initial dose of Enalapril, the patient should be observed under medical 
supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for
at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) 
If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may
diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the 
initial dose of Enalapril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration
with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.  
 <P></P>
Dosage Adjustment In Patients With Heart Failure And Renal Impairment Or
Hyponatremia <P></P>
 
In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than
130 mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be
initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)
The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as
needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage
adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of
renal function. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.  <P></P>

information!</b></p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Penicillin V is the phenoxymethyl analog of penicillin G. </p>

<p>Penicillin V potassium is the potassium salt of penicillin V. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Penicillin V exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-sensitive
microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through
the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell-wall mucopeptide. It is not active
against the penicillinase-producing bacteria, which include many strains
of staphylococci. The drug exerts high In Vitro activity against staphylococci
(except penicillinase-producing strains), streptococci (groups A, C, G,
H, L, and M), and pneumococci. Other organisms sensitive In Vitro to penicillin
V are Corynebacterium Diphtheriae, Bacillus Anthracis, Clostridia, Actinomyces
Bovis, Streptobacillus Moniliformis, Listeria Monocytogenes, Leptospira,
and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. Treponema Pallidum is extremely sensitive. </p>

<p>The potassium salt of penicillin V has the distinct advantage over penicillin
G in resistance to inactivation by gastric acid. It may be given with meals;
however, blood levels are slightly higher when the drug is given on an
empty stomach. Average blood levels are two to five times higher than the
levels following the same dose of oral penicillin G and also show much
less individual variation. </p>

<p>Once absorbed, penicillin V is about 80% bound to serum protein. Tissue
levels are highest in the kidneys, with lesser amounts in the liver, skin,
and intestines. Small amounts are found in all other body tissues and the
cerebrospinal fluid. The drug is excreted as rapidly as it is absorbed
in individuals with normal kidney function; however, recovery of the drug
from the urine indicates that only about 25% of the dose given is absorbed.
In neonates, young infants, and individuals with impaired kidney function,
excretion is considerably delayed. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Penicillin V potassium is indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately
severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy
should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests)
and by clinical response. </p>

<p>Note: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis,
and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute
stage. Streptococcal Infections (without bacteremia). Mild-to-moderate
infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.
</p>

<p>Note: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive
to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.
</p>

<p>Pneumococcal Infections. Mild to moderately severe infections of the
respiratory tract. </p>

<p>Staphylococcal Infections--penicillin-G-sensitive. Mild infections of
the skin and soft tissues. </p>

<p>Note: Reports indicate an increasing number of strains of staphylococci
resistant to penicillin G, emphasizing the need for culture and sensitivity
studies in treating suspected staphylococcal infections. </p>

<p>Fusospirochetosis (Vincent's gingivitis and pharyngitis)--Mild to moderately
severe infections of the oropharynx usually respond to therapy with oral
penicillin. </p>

<p>Note: Necessary dental care should be accomplished in infections involving
the gum tissue. </p>

<p>Medical conditions in which oral penicillin therapy is indicated as
prophylaxis: </p>

<p>For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea:
Prophylaxis with oral penicillin on a continuing basis has proven effective
in preventing recurrence of these conditions. </p>

<p>Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted,
penicillin V has been suggested by the American Heart Association and the
American Dental Association for use as an oral regimen for prophylaxis
against bacterial endocarditis in patients who have congenital heart disease
or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo
dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.
(Ref. 1) Oral penicillin should not be used in those patients at particularly
high risk for endocarditis (e.g., those with prosthetic heart valves or
surgically constructed systemic-pulmonary shunts). Penicillin V should
not be used as adjunctive prophylaxis for genitourinary instrumentation
or surgery, lower intestinal-tract surgery, sigmoidoscopy, and childbirth.
Since it may happen that Alpha hemolytic streptococci relatively resistant
to penicillin may be found when patients are receiving continuous oral
penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever, prophylactic agents
other than penicillin may be chosen for these patients and prescribed in
addition to their continuous rheumatic fever prophylactic regimen. </p>

<p>Note: When selecting antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis,
the physician or dentist should read the full joint statement of the American
Heart Association and the American Dental Association. (Ref. 1)</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>A previous hypersensitivity reaction to any penicillin is a contraindication.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions
have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis
is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients
on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals
with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. </p>

<p>There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history
of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity
reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. </p>

<p>Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning
previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and
other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued
and the patient treated with the usual agents, e.g., pressor amines, antihistamines
and corticosteroids. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories
of significant allergies and/or asthma. </p>

<p>The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients
with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm,
or intestinal hypermotility. </p>

<p>Occasional patients will not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered
penicillin. </p>

<p>In streptococcal infections, therapy must be sufficient to eliminate
the organism (10-day minimum); otherwise the sequelae of streptococcal
disease may occur. Cultures should be taken following completion of treatment
to determine whether streptococci have been eradicated. </p>

<p>Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible
organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures
should be taken. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Although the incidence of reactions to oral penicillins has been reported
with much less frequency than following parenteral therapy, it should be
remembered that all degrees of hypersensitivity, including fatal anaphylaxis,
have been reported with oral penicillin. </p>

<p>The most common reactions to oral penicillin are nausea, vomiting, epigastric
distress, diarrhea, and black hairy tongue. The hypersensitivity reactions
reported are skin eruptions (maculopapular to exfoliative dermatitis),
urticaria and other serum-sicknesslike reactions, laryngeal edema, and
anaphylaxis. Fever and eosinophilia may frequently be the only reaction
observed. Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia , neuropathy,
and nephropathy are infrequent reactions and usually associated with high
doses of parenteral penicillin. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The dosage of penicillin V should be determined according to the sensitivity
of the causative microorganisms and the severity of infection, and adjusted
to the clinical response of the patient. </p>

<p>The usual dosage recommendations for adults and children 12 years and
over are as follows: </p>

<p>Streptococcal Infections--mild to moderately severe--of the upper respiratory
tract and including scarlet fever and erysipelas: 125 to 250 mg (200,000
to 400 000 units) every 6 to 8 hours for 10 days. </p>

<p>Pneumococcal Infections--mild to moderately severe--of the respiratory
tract, including otitis media: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units)
every 6 hours until the patient has been afebrile for at least 2 days.
</p>

<p>Staphylococcal Infections--mild infections of skin and soft tissue (culture
and sensitivity tests should be performed): 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000
units) every 6 to 8 hours. </p>

<p>Fusospirochetosis (Vincent's Infection) of the oropharynx. Mild to moderately
severe infections: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to
8 hours. </p>

<p>For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea:
125 to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) twice daily on a continuing basis.
</p>

<p>For prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis (Ref. 1) in patients
with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart
disease when undergoing dental procedures or surgical procedures of the
upper respiratory tract: 2.0 gram of penicillin V (1.0 gram for children
under 60 lbs.) 1 hour before the procedure, and then, 1.0 gram (500 mg
for children under 60 lbs.) 6 hours later. </p>

<pre><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> 
Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class.
Chemically, zolpidem is N,N,6-trimethyl-2-p-tolyl-imidazo(1,2-a)pyridine-3-
acetamide L-(+)-tartrate (2:1).  
 
Zolpidem tartrate is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is sparingly
soluble in water, alcohol, and propylene glycol. It has a molecular weight of
764.88.  
 
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> 
PHARMACODYNAMICS:  Subunit modulation of the GABAA receptor chloride channel
macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for sedative,
anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and myorelaxant drug properties. The major
modulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex is located on its alpha subunit
and is referred to as the benzodiazepine (BZ) or omega receptor. At least three 
subtypes of the omega receptor have been identified.  
 
While zolpidem is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties,
it interacts with a GABA-BZ receptor complex and shares some of the
pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. In contrast to the
benzodiazepines, which nonselectively bind to and activate all three omega
receptor subtypes, zolpidem in vitro binds the (omega 1) receptor
preferentially. The (omega 1) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of
the sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata),
cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons,
inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. This selective binding of zolpidem on 
the (omega 1) receptor is not absolute, but it may explain the relative absence 
of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the
preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at
hypnotic doses.  
 
PHARMACOKINETICS: The pharmacokinetic profile of Zolpidem is characterized by
rapid absorption from the GI tract and a short elimination half-life (T1/2) in
healthy subjects. In a single-dose crossover study in 45 healthy subjects
administered 5- and 10-mg zolpidem tartrate tablets, the mean peak
concentrations (Cmax) were 59 (range: 29 to 113) and 121 (range: 58 to 272)
ng/mL, respectively, occurring at a mean time (Tmax) of 1.6 hours for both. The 
mean Zolpidem elimination half-life was 2.6 (range: 1.4 to 4.5) and 2.5 (range:
1.4 to 3.8) hours, for the 5- and 10-mg tablets, respectively. Zolpidem is
converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal
excretion. Zolpidem demonstrated linear kinetics in the dose range of 5 to 20 mg. 
Total protein binding was found to be 92.5+/- 0.1% and remained constant,
independent of concentration between 40 and 790 ng/mL. Zolpidem did not
accumulate in young adults following nightly dosing with 20-mg zolpidem
tartrate tablets for 2 weeks.  
 
A food-effect study in 30 healthy male volunteers compared the pharmacokinetics 
of Zolpidem 10 mg when administered while fasting or 20 minutes after a meal. 
Results demonstrated that with food, mean AUC and Cmax were decreased by 15%
and 25%, respectively, while mean Tmax was prolonged by 60% (from 1.4 to 2.2
hr).  The half-life remained unchanged. These results suggest that, for faster
sleep onset, Zolpidem should not be administered with or immediately after a
meal.  
 
In the elderly, the dose for Zolpidem should be 5 mg (see Precautions and Dosage
And Administration). This recommendation is based on several studies in which
the mean Cmax, T1/2, and AUC were significantly increased when compared to
results in young adults. In one study of eight elderly subjects (&gt;70 years),
the means for Cmax, T1/2, and AUC significantly increased by 50% (255 vs 384
ng/mL), 32% (2.2 vs 2.9 hr), and 64% (955 vs 1,562 ng.hr/mL), respectively, as
compared to younger adults (20 to 40 years) following a single 20-mg oral
zolpidem dose.  Zolpidem did not accumulate in elderly subjects following nightly 
oral dosing of 10 mg for 1 week.  
 
The pharmacokinetics of Zolpidem in eight patients with chronic hepatic
insufficiency were compared to results in healthy subjects. Following a single
20-mg oral zolpidem dose, mean Cmax and AUC were found to be two times (250 vs
499 ng/mL) and five times (788 vs 4,203 ng.hr/mL) higher, respectively, in
hepatically compromised patients. Tmax did not change. The mean half-life in
cirrhotic patients of 9.9 hr (range: 4.1 to 25.8 hr) was greater than that
observed in normals of 2.2 hr (range: 1.6 to 2.4 hr). Dosing should be modified 
accordingly in patients with hepatic insufficiency (see Precautions and Dosage
And Administration).  
 
The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end- 
stage renal failure (mean ClCr=6.5+/- 1.5 mL/min) undergoing hemodialysis three 
times a week, who were dosed with zolpidem 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21
days. No statistically significant differences were observed for Cmax, Tmax,
half-life, and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when
baseline concentration adjustments were made. On day 1, Cmax was 172+/- 29
ng/mL (range: 46 to 344 ng/mL). After repeated dosing for 14 or 21 days, Cmax
was 203+/- 32 ng/mL (range: 28 to 316 ng/mL). On day 1, Tmax was 1.7+/- 0.3 hr
(range: 0.5 to 3.0 hr); after repeated dosing Tmax was 0.8+/- 0.2 hr (range:
0.5 to 2.0 hr). This variation is accounted for by noting that last-day serum
sampling began 10 hours after the previous dose, rather than after 24 hours. 
This resulted in residual drug concentration and a shorter period to reach
maximal serum concentration. On day 1, T1/2 was 2.4+/- 0.4 hr (range 0.4 to 5.1 
hr). After repeated dosing, T1/2 was 2.5+/- 0.4 hr (range: 0.7 to 4.2 hr). AUC
was 796+/-159 ng.hr/mL after the first dose and 818+/- 170 ng.hr/mL after
repeated dosing. Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable. No accumulation of unchanged
drug appeared after 14 or 21 days. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not
significantly different in renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is
necessary in patients with compromised renal function. As a general precaution, 
these patients should be closely monitored.  
 
POSTULATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELIMINATION RATE OF HYPNOTICS AND THEIR PROFILE 
OF COMMON UNTOWARD EFFECTS:  The type and duration of hypnotic effects and the
profile of unwanted effects during administration of hypnotic drugs may be
influenced by the biologic half-life of administered drug and any active
metabolites formed. When half-lives are long, drug or metabolites may
accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with
impairment of cognitive and/or motor performance during waking hours; the
possibility of interaction with other psychoactive drugs or alcohol will be
enhanced. In contrast, if half-lives, including half-lives of active
metabolites, are short, drug and metabolites will be cleared before the next
dose is ingested, and carryover effects related to excessive sedation or CNS
depression should be minimal or absent. Zolpidem has a short half-life and no
active metabolites.  During nightly use for an extended period, pharmacodynamic 
tolerance or adaptation to some effects of hypnotics may develop. If the drug
has a short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency of 
the drug or its active metabolites (ie, in relationship to the receptor site)
may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use. This sequence 
of events may account for two clinical findings reported to occur after several 
weeks of nightly use of other rapidly eliminated hypnotics, namely, increased
wakefulness during the last third of the night, and the appearance of increased 
signs of daytime anxiety. Increased wakefulness during the last third of the
night as measured by polysomnography has not been observed in clinical trials
with Zolpidem.  
 
CONTROLLED TRIALS SUPPORTING SAFETY AND EFFICACY 
 
TRANSIENT INSOMNIA: Normal adults experiencing transient insomnia (n=462)
during the first night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double-blind,
parallel group, single-night trial comparing two doses of zolpidem (7.5 and 10
mg) and placebo. Both zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on objective
(polysomnographic) measures of sleep latency, sleep duration, and number of
awakenings.  
 
CHRONIC INSOMNIA: Adult outpatients with chronic insomnia (n=75) were evaluated 
in a double-blind, parallel group, 5-week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem 
tartrate (10 and 15 mg) and placebo. On objective (polysomnographic) measures
of sleep latency and sleep efficiency, zolpidem 15 mg was superior to placebo
for all 5 weeks; zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on sleep latency for
the first 4 weeks and on sleep efficiency for weeks 2 and 4. Zolpidem was
comparable to placebo on number of awakenings at both doses studied.  
 
Adult outpatients (n=141) with chronic insomnia were evaluated in a double-
blind, parallel group, 4-week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem (10 and 15
mg) and placebo. Zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on a subjective measure 
of sleep latency for all 4 weeks, and on subjective measures of total sleep
time, number of awakenings, and sleep quality for the first treatment week. 
Zolpidem 15 mg was superior to placebo on a subjective measure of sleep latency 
for the first 3 weeks, on a subjective measure of total sleep time for the
first week, and on number of awakenings and sleep quality for the first 2
weeks.  
 
NEXT-DAY RESIDUAL EFFECTS:  There was no evidence of residual next-day effects
seen with Zolpidem in several studies utilizing the Multiple Sleep Latency Test
(MSLT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and patient ratings of
alertness. In one study involving elderly patients, there was a small but
statistically significant decrease in one measure of performance, the DSST, but 
no impairment was seen in the MSLT in this study.  
 
REBOUND EFFECTS: There was no objective (polysomnographic) evidence of rebound
insomnia at recommended doses seen in studies evaluating sleep on the nights
following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate. There was subjective evidence
of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first posttreatment night at doses
above the recommended elderly dose of 5 mg.  
 
MEMORY IMPAIRMENT: Two small studies (n=6 and n=9) utilizing objective measures 
of memory yielded little evidence for memory impairment following the
administration of zolpidem tartrate. There was subjective evidence from adverse 
event data for anterograde amnesia occurring in association with the
administration of Zolpidem, predominantly at doses above 10 mg.  
 
EFFECTS ON SLEEP STAGES:  In studies that measured the percentage of sleep time 
spent in each sleep stage. Zolpidem has generally been shown to preserve sleep
stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was found comparable to 
placebo with only inconsistent, minor changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the 
recommended dose.  
 
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> 
Zolpidem is indicated for the short-term treatment of
insomnia. Hypnotics should generally be limited to 7 to 10 days of use, and
reevaluation of the patient is recommended if they are to be taken for more
than 2 to 3 weeks.  
 
Zolpidem should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a 1-month supply (see
Warnings).  
 
Zolpidem has been shown to decrease sleep latency and increase the duration of
sleep for up to 5 weeks in controlled clinical studies (see Actions/Clinical
Pharmacology).  
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> 
None known.  
 
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 

</b>Since sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical
and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be
initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of
insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of
a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness which should be evaluated.
Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior
abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical 
disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with
sedative/hypnotic drugs, including Zolpidem. Because some of the important
adverse effects of Zolpidem appear to be dose related (see Precautions and Dosage 
And Administration), it is important to use the smallest possible effective
dose, especially in the elderly.  
 
A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur 
in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. Some of these changes may be 
characterized by decreased inhibition (eg, aggressiveness and extroversion that 
seemed out of character), similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS
depressants. Other reported behavioral changes have included bizarre behavior,
agitation, hallucinations, and depersonalization. Amnesia and other
neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. In primarily depressed
patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thinking, has been
reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics.  
 
It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the 
abnormal behaviors listed above are drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a
result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the
emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and 
immediate evaluation.  
 
Following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of
sedative/hypnotics, there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to
those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs (see Drug
Abuse And Dependence).  
 
Zolpidem, like other sedative/hypnotic drugs, has CNS-depressant effects. Due to
the rapid onset of action, Zolpidem should only be ingested immediately prior to
going to bed. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous
occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as
operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug,
including potential impairment of the performance of such activities that may
occur the day following ingestion of Zolpidem. Zolpidem showed additive effects
when combined with alcohol and should not be taken with alcohol. Patients
should also be cautioned about possible combined effects with other CNS
depressant drugs.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary when Zolpidem is
administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects.  
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> 
GENERAL 
 
USE IN THE ELDERLY AND/OR DEBILITATED PATIENTS:  Impaired motor and/or
cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to
sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or
debilitated patients.  Therefore, the recommended Zolpidem dosage is 5 mg in such 
patients (see Dosage And Administration) to decrease the possibility of side
effects. These patients should be closely monitored.  
 
USE IN PATIENTS WITH CONCOMITANT ILLNESS:  Clinical experience with Zolpidem in
patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in
using Zolpidem in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect
metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Although preliminary studies did not
reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses of Zolpidem in normals,
precautions should be observed if Zolpidem is prescribed to patients with
compromised respiratory function, since sedative/hypnotics have the capacity to 
depress respiratory drive. Data in end-stage renal failure patients repeatedly
treated with Zolpidem did not demonstrate drug accumulation or alterations in
pharmacokinetic parameters. No dosage adjustment in renally impaired patients
is required; however, these patients should be closely monitored (see
Pharmacokinetics). A study in subjects with hepatic impairment did reveal
prolonged elimination in this group; therefore, treatment should be initiated
with 5 mg in patients with hepatic compromise, and they should be closely
monitored.  
 
USE IN DEPRESSION:  As with other sedative/hypnotic drugs, Zolpidem should be
administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of
depression. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective
measures may be required. Intentional overdosage is more common in this group
of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be
prescribed for the patient at any one time.  
 
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS:  Patient information is printed at the end of this
insert. To assure safe and effective use of Zolpidem, this information and
instructions provided in the patient information section should be discussed
with patients.  
 
LABORATORY TESTS:  There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.  
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 
CNS-ACTIVE DRUGS:  Zolpidem was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose
interaction studies for several CNS drugs. A study involving haloperidol and
zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or
pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced
no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of
imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, 
chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic
interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and
psychomotor performance. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose
administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration.  
 
An additive effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and zolpidem was
demonstrated.  

Since the systematic evaluations of zolpiden tartrate in combination with other 
CNS-active drugs have been limited, careful consideration should be given to
the pharmacology of any CNS-active drug to be used with zolpidem. Any drug with 
CNS- depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS-depressant effects of 
zolpidem.  
 
OTHER DRUGS:  A study involving cimetidine/zolpidem and ranitidine/zolpidem
combinations revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or
pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. Zolpidem had no effect on digoxin kinetics and
did not affect prothrombin time when given with warfarin in normal subjects. 
Zolpidem's sedative/hypnotic effect was reversed by flumazenil; however, no
significant alterations in zolpidem pharmacokinetics were found.  
 
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS:  Zolpidem is not known to interfere with
commonly employed clinical laboratory tests.  
 
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 
CARCINOGENESIS:  Zolpidem was administered to rats and mice for 2 years at
dietary dosages of 4, 18, and 80 mg/kg/day. In mice, these doses are 26 to 520
times or 2 to 35 times the maximum 10-mg human dose on a mg/kg or mg/M(square)
basis, respectively. In rats these doses are 43 to 876 times or 6 to 115 times
the maximum 10-mg human dose on a mg/kg or mg/M(square) basis, respectively. No 
evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice. Renal liposarcomas
were seen in 4/100 rats (3 males, 1 female) receiving 80 mg/kg/day and a renal
lipoma was observed in one male rat at the 18 mg/kg/day dose. Incidence rates
of lipoma and liposarcoma for zolpidem were comparable to those seen in
historical controls and the tumor findings are thought to be a spontaneous
occurrence.  
 
MUTAGENESIS:  Zolpidem did not have mutagenic activity in several tests
including the Ames test, genotoxicity in mouse lymphoma cells in vitro,
chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, unscheduled DNA
synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro, and the micronucleus test in mice.  
 
IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:  In a rat reproduction study, the high dose (100 mg
base/kg) of zolpidem resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged
precoital intervals, but there was no effect on male or female fertility after
daily oral doses of 4 to 100 mg base/kg or 5 to 130 times the recommended human 
dose in mg/M(square). No effects on any other fertility parameters were noted.  
 
PREGNANCY 
 
TERATOGENIC EFFECTS:  Pregnancy Category B. Studies to assess the effects of
zolpidem on human reproduction and development have not been conducted.  
 
Teratology studies were conducted in rats and rabbits.  
 
In rats, adverse maternal and fetal effects occurred at 20 and 100 mg base/kg
and included dose-related maternal lethargy and ataxia and a dose-related trend 
to incomplete ossification of fetal skull bones. Underossification of various
fetal bones indicates a delay in maturation and is often seen in rats treated
with sedative/hypnotic drugs. There were no teratogenic effects after zolpidem
administration. The no-effect dose for maternal or fetal toxicity was 4 mg
base/kg or 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/M(square) basis.  
 
In rabbits, dose-related maternal sedation and decreased weight gain occurred
at all doses tested. At the high dose, 16 mg base/kg, there was an increase in
postimplantation fetal loss and underossification of sternebrae in viable
fetuses. These fetal findings in rabbits are often secondary to reductions in
maternal weight gain. There were no frank teratogenic effects. The no-effect
dose for fetal toxicity was 4 mg base/kg or 7 times the maximum human dose on a 
mg/M(square) basis.  
 
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response 
this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  
 
NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS:  Studies to assess the effects on children whose
mothers took zolpidem during pregnancy have not been conducted. However,
children born of mothers taking sedative/hypnotic drugs may be at some risk for 
withdrawal symptoms from the drug during the postnatal period. In addition,
neonatal flaccidity has been reported in infants born of mothers who received
sedative/hypnotic drugs during pregnancy.  
 
LABOR AND DELIVERY:  Zolpidem has no established use in labor and delivery.  
 
NURSING MOTHERS:  Studies in lactating mothers indicate that the half-life of
zolpidem is similar to that in young normal volunteers (2.6+/- 0.3 hr). Between 
0.004 and 0.019% of the total administered dose is excreted into milk, but the
effect of zolpidem on the infant is unknown.  
 
In addition, in a rat study, zolpidem inhibited the secretion of milk. The no-
effect dose was 4 mg base/kg or 6 times the recommended human dose in
mg/M(square).  
 
The use of Zolpidem in nursing mothers is not recommended.  
 
PEDIATRIC USE:  Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 18 have
not been established.  
 
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> 
CNS-ACTIVE DRUGS:  Zolpidem was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose
interaction studies for several CNS drugs. A study involving haloperidol and
zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or
pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced
no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of
imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, 
chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic
interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and
psychomotor performance. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose
administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration.  
 
An additive effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and zolpidem was
demonstrated.  
 
Since the systematic evaluations of Zolpidem in combination with other CNS-active 
drugs have been limited, careful consideration should be given to the
pharmacology of any CNS-active drug to be used with zolpidem. Any drug with CNS 
depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS-depressant effects of
zolpidem.  
 
(See Also PRECAUTIONS) 
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> 
ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT: Approximately 4% of 1,701
patients who received zolpidem at all doses (1.25 to 90 mg) in U.S.
premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse
clinical event. Events most commonly associated with discontinuation from U.S.
trials were daytime drowsiness (0.5%), dizziness (0.4%), headache (0.5%),
nausea (0.6%), and vomiting (0.5%).  
 
Approximately 6% of 1,320 patients who received zolpidem at all doses (5 to 50
mg) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse
event. Events most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials
were daytime drowsiness (1.6%), amnesia (0.6%), dizziness (0.6%), headache
(0.6%), and nausea (0.6%).  
 
INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS 
 
MOST COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONTROLLED TRIALS: During short-term
treatment (up to 10 nights) with Zolpidem at doses up to 10 mg, the most commonly 
observed adverse events associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at
statistically significant differences from placebo-treated patients were
drowsiness (reported by 2% of zolpidem patients), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea
(1%). During longer-term treatment (28 to 35 nights) with zolpidem at doses up
to 10 mg, the most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of
zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo-treated 
patients were dizziness (5%) and drugged feelings (3%).  
 
ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED AT AN INCIDENCE OF &gt;/= 1% IN CONTROLLED TRIALS: The
following tables enumerate treatment-emergent adverse event frequencies that
were observed at an incidence equal to 1% or greater among patients with
insomnia who received Zolpidem in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Events reported 
by investigators were classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization 
(WHO) dictionary of preferred terms for the purpose of establishing event
frequencies. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used
to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical
practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those
that prevailed in these clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies
cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators
involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is
conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures
provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of
drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population
studied.  
 
The following table was derived from a pool of 11 placebo-controlled short-term 
U.S. efficacy trials involving zolpidem in doses ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg.
The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest

*   Events reported by at least 1% of patients treated with Zolpidem.             
DOSE RELATIONSHIP FOR ADVERSE EVENTS:  There is evidence from dose comparison
trials suggesting a dose relationship for many of the adverse events associated 
with zolpidem use, particularly for certain CNS and gastrointestinal adverse
events.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT INCIDENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE PREAPPROVAL DATABASE:  Zolpidem was
administered to 3,021 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada,
and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial
participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of
their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of
individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of
untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event
categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO)
dictionary of preferred terms. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent
the proportions of the 3,021 individuals exposed to zolpidem, at all doses, who 
experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving 
zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except
those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled 
studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and
those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that,
although the events reported did occur during treatment with Zolpidem, they were
not necessarily caused by it.  
 
Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and
enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: 
frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100
subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000
patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 
 
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE:  Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV
controlled substance by federal regulation.  
 
ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:  Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found
that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but
not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult
to distinguish from placebo.  
 
Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt 
discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia 
to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting 
sweating, tremors, and convulsions. The U.S. clinical trial experience from
zolpidem does not reveal any clear evidence for withdrawal syndrome. 
Nevertheless, the following adverse events included in DSM-III-R criteria for
uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal were reported during U.S. clinical
trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last
zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled
crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal
discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or
less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the
incidence, if any, of dependency, or the relationship of any dependency to dose 
and duration of treatment.  
 
Because individuals with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or
alcohol are at risk of habituation and dependence, they should be under careful 
surveillance when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic.  
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> 
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:  In European postmarketing reports of overdose with
zolpidem alone, impairment of consciousness has ranged from somnolence to light 
coma.  There was one case each of cardiovascular and respiratory compromise. 
Individuals have fully recovered from zolpidem tartrate overdoses up to 400 mg
(40 times the maximum recommended dose). Overdose cases involving multiple CNS- 
depressant agents, including zolpidem, have resulted in more severe
symptomatology, including fatal outcomes.  
 
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:  General symptomatic and supportive measures should be
used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids
should be administered as needed. Flumazenil may be useful. As in all cases of
drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs
should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and
CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical
intervention. Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage,
even if excitation occurs. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage 
has not been determined, although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal
failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not
dialyzable.  
 
POISON CONTROL CENTER:  As with the management of all overdosage, the
possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may
wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information
on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.  
 
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> 
The dose of Zolpidem should be individualized.  
 
The recommended dose for adults is 10 mg immediately before bedtime.  
 
Downward dosage adjustment may be necessary when Zolpidem is administered with
agents having known CNS-depressant effects because of the potentially additive
effects.  
 
Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of
zolpidem tartrate. Patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear the drug as 
rapidly as normals. An initial 5-mg dose is recommended in these patients (see
Precautions).  
 
The total Zolpidem dose should not exceed 10 mg.  
 
Caution:  Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 
 
STAKING Zolpidem 
 
Your doctor has prescribed Zolpidem to help you sleep. The following information
is intended to guide you in the safe use of this medicine. It is not meant to
take the place of your doctor's instructions. If you have any questions about
Zolpidem tablets be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist.  
 
Zolpidem is used to treat different types of sleep problems, such as:  
 
-- trouble falling asleep 
 
-- waking up too early in the morning 
 
-- waking up often during the night 
 
Some people may have more than one of these problems.  
 
Zolpidem belongs to a group of medicines known as the &quot;sedative/hypnotics,&quot; or
simply, sleep medicines. There are many different sleep medicines available to
help people sleep better. Sleep problems are usually temporary, requiring
treatment for only a short time, usually 1 or 2 days up to 1 or 2 weeks. Some
people have chronic sleep problems that may require more prolonged use of sleep 
medicine. However, you should not use these medicines for long periods without
talking with your doctor about the risks and benefits of prolonged use.  
 
SIDE EFFECTS 
 
MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:  All medicines have side effects. Most common side
effects of sleep medicines include:  
 
-- drowsiness 
 
-- dizziness 
 
-- lightheadedness 
 
-- difficulty with coordination 
 
You may find that these medicines make you sleepy during the day. How drowsy
you feel depends upon how your body reacts to the medicine, which sleep
medicine you are taking, and how large a dose your doctor has prescribed.
Daytime drowsiness is best avoided by taking the lowest dose possible that will 
still help you sleep at night. Your doctor will work with you to find the dose
of Zolpidem that is best for you.  
 
To manage these side effects while you are taking this medicine:  
 
-- When you first start taking Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine until you
know whether the medicine will still have some carryover effect in you the next 
day, use extreme care while doing anything that requires complete alertness,
such as driving a car, operating machinery, or piloting an aircraft.  
 
-- NEVER drink alcohol while you are being treated with Zolpidem or any sleep
medicine. Alcohol can increase the side effects of Zolpidem or any other sleep
medicine.  
 
-- Do not take any other medicines without asking your doctor first. This
includes medicines you can buy without a prescription. Some medicines can cause 
drowsiness and are best avoided while taking Zolpidem.  
 
-- Always take the exact dose of Zolpidem prescribed by your doctor. Never change 
your dose without talking to your doctor first.  
 
SPECIAL CONCERNS 
 
There are some special problems that may occur while taking sleep medicines.  
 
MEMORY PROBLEMS:  Sleep medicines may cause a special type of memory loss or
&quot;amnesia.&quot; When this occurs, a person may not remember what has happened for
several hours after taking the medicine. This is usually not a problem since
most people fall asleep after taking the medicine.  
 
Memory loss can be a problem, however, when sleep medicines are taken while
traveling, such as during an airplane flight and the person wakes up before the 
effect of the medicine is gone. This has been called &quot;traveler's amnesia.&quot; 
 
Memory problems are not common while taking Zolpidem. In most instances memory
problems can be avoided if you take Zolpidem only when you are able to get a full 
night's sleep (7 to 8 hours) before you need to be active again. Be sure to
talk to your doctor if you think you are having memory problems.  
 
TOLERANCE:  When sleep medicines are used every night for more than a few weeks 
they may lose their effectiveness to help you sleep. This is known as
&quot;tolerance.&quot; Sleep medicines should, in most cases, be used only for short
periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days and generally no longer than 1 or 2 weeks. 
If your sleep problems continue, consult your doctor, who will determine
whether other measures are needed to overcome your sleep problems.  
 
DEPENDENCE:  Sleep medicines can cause dependence, especially when these
medicines are used regularly for longer than a few weeks or at high doses. Some 
people develop a need to continue taking their medicines. This is known as
dependence or &quot;addiction.&quot; 
 
When people develop dependence, they may have difficulty stopping the sleep
medicine. If the medicine is suddenly stopped, the body is not able to function 
normally and unpleasant symptoms (see Withdrawal) may occur. They may find they 
have to keep taking the medicine either at the prescribed dose or at increasing 
doses just to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  
 
All people taking sleep medicines have some risk of becoming dependent on the
medicine. However, people who have been dependent on alcohol or other drugs in
the past may have a higher chance of becoming addicted to sleep medicines. This 
possibility must be considered before using these medicines for more than a few 
weeks.  
 
If you have been addicted to alcohol or drugs in the past, it is important to
tell your doctor before starting Zolpidem or any sleep medicine.  
 
WITHDRAWAL:  Withdrawal symptoms may occur when sleep medicines are stopped
suddenly after being used daily for a long time. In some cases, these symptoms
can occur even if the medicine has been used for only a week or two.  
 
In mild cases, withdrawal symptoms may include unpleasant feelings. In more
severe cases, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and
rarely, seizures may occur. These more severe withdrawal symptoms are very
uncommon.  
 
Another problem that may occur when sleep medicines are stopped is known as
&quot;rebound insomnia.&quot; This means that a person may have more trouble sleeping the 
first few nights after the medicine is stopped than before starting the
medicine. If you should experience rebound insomnia, do not get discouraged. 
This problem usually goes away on its own after 1 or 2 nights.  
 
If you have been taking Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine for more than 1 or 2 
weeks, do not stop taking it on your own. Always follow your doctor's
directions.  
 
CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AND THINKING:  Some people using sleep medicines have
experienced unusual changes in their thinking and/or behavior. These effects
are not common. However, they have included:  
 
-- more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal 
 
-- loss of personal identity 
 
-- confusion 
 
-- strange behavior 
 
-- agitation 
 
-- hallucinations 
 
-- worsening of depression 
 
-- suicidal thoughts 
 
How often these effects occur depends on several factors, such as a person's
general health, the use of other medicines, and which sleep medicine is being
used. Clinical experience with Zolpidem suggests that it is uncommonly associated 
with these behavior changes.  
 
It is also important to realize that it is rarely clear whether these behavior
changes are caused by the medicine, an illness, or occur on their own. In fact, 
sleep problems that do not improve may be due to illnesses that were present
before the medicine was used. If you or your family notice any changes in your
behavior, or if you have any unusual or disturbing thoughts, call your doctor
immediately.  
 
PREGNANCY:  Sleep medicines may cause sedation of the unborn baby when used
during the last weeks of pregnancy.  
 
Be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become
pregnant, or if you become pregnant while taking Zolpidem.  
 
SAFE USE OF SLEEPING MEDICINES 
 
To ensure the safe and effective use of Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine, you 
should observe the following cautions:  
 
1. Zolpidem is a prescription medicine and should be used ONLY as directed by
your doctor. Follow your doctor's instructions about how to take, when to take, 
and how long to take Zolpidem.  
 
2. Never use Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine for longer than directed by
your doctor.  
 
3. If you notice any unusual and/or disturbing thoughts or behavior during
treatment with Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine, contact your doctor.  
 
4. Tell your doctor about any medicines you may be taking, including medicines
you may buy without a prescription. You should also tell your doctor if you
drink alcohol. DO NOT use alcohol while taking Zolpidem or any other sleep
medicine.  
 
5. Do not take Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine unless you are able to get a
full night's sleep before you must be active again. For example, Zolpidem or any
other sleep medicine should not be taken on an overnight airplane flight of
less than 7 to 8 hours since &quot;traveler's amnesia&quot; may occur.  
 
6. Do not increase the prescribed dose of Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine
unless instructed by your doctor.  
 
7. When you first start taking Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine until you
know whether the medicine will still have some carryover effect in you the next 
day, use extreme care while doing anything that requires complete alertness,
such as driving a car, operating machinery, or piloting an aircraft.  
 
8. Be aware that you may have more sleeping problems the first night or two
after stopping Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine.  
 
9. Be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you are planning to
become pregnant, or if you become pregnant while taking Zolpidem.  
 
10. As with all prescription medicines, never share Zolpidem or any other sleep
medicine with anyone else. Always store Zolpidem or any other sleep medicine in
the original container out of reach of children.  
 
11. Zolpidem works very quickly. You should only take Zolpidem right before going
to bed and are ready to go to sleep.

<P><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION </B></P>

<P>Prochlorperazine, an antipsychotic and antiemetic phenothiazine has
the following chemical formula: C20H24ClN3S and molecular weight of: 373.94.
Chemically, it is 2-Chloro-10-[3-(4-methyl-l-piperazynl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazine.  
It is commonly employed as the maleate salt (tablets, capsules) the edisylate
salt (injection, syrup) and as the free base (suppositories). </P>

<P><A NAME="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></A><B>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </B></P>

<P>For control of severe nausea and vomiting. </P>

<P>For management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. </P>

<P>Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized
non-psychotic anxiety. However, Prochlorperazine is not the first drug
to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because
certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative
treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines). </P>

<P>When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, Prochlorperazine
should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer
than 12 weeks, because the use of Prochlorperazine at higher doses or for
longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove
irreversible (see Warnings). </P>

<P>The effectiveness of Prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic
anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with
generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that Prochlorperazine
will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which
anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness,
organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies,
etc.). </P>

<P>Prochlorperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral
complications in patients with mental retardation. </P>

<P><A NAME="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></A><B>CONTRAINDICATIONS </B></P>

<P>Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.
</P>

<P>Do not use in comatose states or in the presence of large amounts of
central nervous system depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, etc.).
</P>

<P>Do not use in pediatric surgery. </P>

<P>Do not use in children under 2 years of age or under 20 lbs. Do not
use in children for conditions for which dosage has not been established.
</P>

<P><A NAME="WARNINGS"></A><B>WARNINGS </B></P>

<P>THE EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS WHICH CAN OCCUR SECONDARY TO Prochlorperazine
MAY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SIGNS OF AN UNDIAGNOSED
PRIMARY DISEASE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VOMITING, e.g., REYE'S SYNDROME OR
OTHER ENCEPHALOPATHY. THE USE OF Prochlorperazine AND OTHER POTENTIAL HEPATOTOXINS
SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHOSE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
SUGGEST REYE'S SYNDROME. </P>

<P>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA: Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially
irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients
treated with neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs. Although the prevalence
of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly
women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at
the inception of neuroleptic treatment, which patients are likely to develop
the syndrome. Whether neuroleptic drug products differ in their potential
to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. </P>

<P>Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it
will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment
and the total cumulative dose of neuroleptic drugs administered to the
patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less
commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. </P>

<P>There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia,
although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if neuroleptic
treatment is withdrawn. Neuroleptic treatment itself, however, may suppress
(or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby
may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic
suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. </P>

<P>Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner
that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic
neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer
from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs,
and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful
treatments are Not available or appropriate. In patients who do require
chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment
producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for
continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. </P>

<P>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics,
drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require
treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. </P>

<P>For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia
and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on PRECAUTIONS
and ADVERSE REACTIONS. </P>

<P>NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex
sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been
reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations
of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence
of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia,
diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias). </P>

<P>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.
In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the
clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia,
systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal
signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential
diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever
and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. </P>

<P>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of
antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy,
2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment
of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments
are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological
treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. </P>

<P>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from
NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.
The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have
been reported. </P>

<P>An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever,
tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated
serum enzymes, BUN and FBS) has occurred in a few patients treated with
lithium plus a neuroleptic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed
by irreversible brain damage. Because of a possible causal relationship
between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and
neuroleptics, patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored
closely for early evidence of neurologic toxicity and treatment discontinued
promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar
to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). </P>

<P>Patients with bone marrow depression or who have previously demonstrated
a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., blood dyscrasias, jaundice) with a phenothiazine
should not receive any phenothiazine, including Prochlorperazine, unless
in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits of treatment outweigh
the possible hazards. </P>

<P>Prochlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially
during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, caution patients about
activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).
</P>

<P>Phenothiazines may intensify or prolong the action of central nervous
system depressants (e.g., alcohol, anesthetics, narcotics). </P>

<P>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: Safety for the use of Prochlorperazine during pregnancy
has not been established. Therefore, Prochlorperazine is not recommended
for use in pregnant patients except in cases of severe nausea and vomiting
that are so serious and intractable that, in the judgment of the physician,
drug intervention is required and potential benefits outweigh possible
hazards. </P>

<P>There have been reported instances of prolonged jaundice, extrapyramidal
signs, hyperreflexia or hyporeflexia in newborn infants whose mothers received
phenothiazines. </P>

<P>NURSING MOTHERS: There is evidence that phenothiazines are excreted
in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when
Prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing woman. </P>

<P><A NAME="PRECAUTIONS"></A><B>PRECAUTIONS </B></P>

<P>The antiemetic action of Prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms
of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment
of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's
syndrome (see Warnings). </P>

<P>When Prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting
as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic
effect of Prochlorperazine. </P>

<P>Because hypotension may occur, large doses and parenteral administration
should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems.
To minimize the occurrence of hypotension after injection, keep patient
lying down and observe for at least 1/2 hour. If hypotension occurs after
parenteral or oral dosing, place patient in head-low position with legs
raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required, norepinephrine bitartrate and
phenylephrine HCl are suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine,
should not be used because they may cause a paradoxical further lowering
of blood pressure. </P>

<P>Aspiration of vomitus has occurred in a few post-surgical patients who
have received Prochlorperazine as an antiemetic. Although no causal relationship
has been established, this possibility should be borne in mind during surgical
aftercare. </P>

<P>Deep sleep, from which patients can be aroused, and coma have been reported,
usually with overdosage. </P>

<P>Neuroleptic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during
chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately
one third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent In Vitro, a factor
of potential importance if the prescribing of these drugs is contemplated
in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances
such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been
reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels
is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been
found in rodents after chronic administration of neuroleptic drugs. Neither
clinical nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown
an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary
tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive
at this time. </P>

<P>Chromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes and abnormal sperm have been
demonstrated in rodents treated with certain neuroleptics. </P>

<P>As with all drugs which exert an anticholinergic effect, and/or cause
mydriasis, prochlorperazine should be used with caution in patients with
glaucoma. </P>

<P>Because phenothiazines may interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms,
use with caution in persons who will be exposed to extreme heat. </P>

<P>Phenothiazines can diminish the effect of oral anticoagulants. </P>

<P>Phenothiazines can produce alpha-adrenergic blockade. </P>

<P>Thiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may
occur with phenothiazines. </P>

<P>Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be
counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly. </P>

<P>Concomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results
in increased plasma levels of both drugs. </P>

<P>Phenothiazines may lower the convulsive threshold; dosage adjustments
of anticonvulsants may be necessary. Potentiation of anticonvulsant effects
does not occur. However, it has been reported that phenothiazines may interfere
with the metabolism of phenytoin and thus precipitate phenytoin toxicity.
</P>

<P>The presence of phenothiazines may produce false-positive phenylketonuria
(PKU) test results. </P>

<P>LONG-TERM THERAPY: Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically
to neuroleptics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all
patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full
information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their
guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and
the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. </P>

<P>To lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative
drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with Prochlorperazine
and/or other neuroleptics should be evaluated </P>

<P>periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered
or drug therapy discontinued. </P>

<P>CHILDREN WITH ACUTE ILLNESSES (e.g., CHICKENPOX, CNS INFECTIONS, MEASLES,
GASTROENTERITIS) OR DEHYDRATION SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO NEUROMUSCULAR
REACTIONS, PARTICULARLY DYSTONIAS, THAN ARE ADULTS. IN SUCH PATIENTS, THE
DRUG SHOULD BE USED ONLY UNDER CLOSE SUPERVISION. </P>

<P>Drugs which lower the seizure threshold, including phenothiazine derivatives,
should not be used with metrizamide. As with other phenothiazine derivatives,
Prochlorperazine should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography,
should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure, and should not
be used for the control of nausea and vomiting occurring either prior to
myelography with Amipaque, or postprocedure. </P>

<P><A HREF="#PRECAUTIONS">SEE PRECAUTIONS </A></P>

<P><A NAME="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></A><B>ADVERSE REACTIONS </B></P>

<P>Drowsiness, dizziness, amenorrhea, blurred vision, skin reactions and
hypotension may occur. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported
in association with antipsychotic drugs (see WARNINGS). </P>

<P>Cholestatic jaundice has occurred. If fever with grippe-like symptoms
occurs, appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate
an abnormality, stop treatment. There have been a few observations of fatty
changes in the livers of patients who have died while receiving the drug.
No causal relationship has been established. </P>

<P>Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have occurred. Warn patients to report
the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white
blood cell and differential counts indicate leukocyte depression, stop
treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy. </P>

<P>NEUROMUSCULAR (EXTRAPYRAMIDAL) REACTIONS </P>

<P>These symptoms are seen in a significant number of hospitalized mental
patients. They may be characterized by motor restlessness, be of the dystonic
type, or they may resemble parkinsonism. </P>

<P>Depending on the severity of symptoms, dosage should be reduced or discontinued.
If therapy is reinstituted, it should be at a lower dosage. Should these
symptoms occur in children or pregnant patients, the drug should be stopped
and not reinstituted. In most cases barbiturates by suitable route of administration
will suffice. (Or, injectable diphenhydramine may be useful.) In more severe
cases, the administration of an anti-parkinsonism agent, except levodopa,
usually produces rapid reversal of symptoms. Suitable supportive measures
such as maintaining a clear airway and adequate hydration should be employed.
</P>

<P>MOTOR RESTLESSNESS: Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and
sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times
these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms.
Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.
</P>

<P>If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled
by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian
agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful. </P>

<P>DYSTONIAS: Symptoms may include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes
progressing to torticollis; extensor rigidity of back muscles, sometimes
progressing to opisthotonos; carpopedal spasm, trismus, swallowing difficulty,
oculogyric crisis and protrusion of the tongue. </P>

<P>These usually subside within a few hours, and almost always within 24
to 48 hours, after the drug has been discontinued. </P>

<P>In Mild Cases, reassurance or a barbiturate is often sufficient. In
Moderate Cases, barbiturates will usually bring rapid relief. In More Severe
Adult Cases, the administration of an anti-parkinsonism agent, except levodopa,
usually produces rapid reversal of symptoms. In Children, reassurance and
barbiturates will usually control symptoms. (Or, injectable diphenhydramine
may be useful. Note: See diphenhydramine prescribing information for appropriate
Children's dosage.) If appropriate treatment with anti-parkinsonism agents
or diphenhydramine fails to reverse the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis
should be reevaluated. </P>

<P>PSEUDO-PARKINSONISM: Symptoms may include: mask-like facies; drooling;
tremors; pillrolling motion; cogwheel rigidity; and shuffling gait. Reassurance
and sedation are important. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled
when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism
agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks
to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated
to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not
been found effective in pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary
to lower the dosage of Prochlorperazine or to discontinue the drug. </P>

<P>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA: As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia
may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug
therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop, although
much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.
This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears
to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible
to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of neuroleptic
treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms
are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome
is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face,
mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering
of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary
movements of extremities. In rare instances, these involuntary movements
of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A
variant of tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, has also been described.
</P>

<P>There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; anti-parkinsonism
agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested
that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear.
</P>

<P>Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage
of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome
may be masked. </P>

<P>It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may
be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that
time the syndrome may not develop. </P>

<P>CONTACT DERMATITIS: Avoid getting the Injection solution on hands or
clothing because of the possibility of contact dermatitis. </P>

<P>ADVERSE REACTIONS REPORTED WITH Prochlorperazine OR OTHER PHENOTHIAZINE
DERIVATIVES: Adverse reactions with different phenothiazines vary in type,
frequency and mechanism of occurrence, i.e., some are dose-related, while
others involve individual patient sensitivity. Some adverse reactions may
be more likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with
special medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma
have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses of certain
phenothiazines. </P>

<P>Not all of the following adverse reactions have been observed with every
phenothiazine derivative, but they have been reported with 1 or more and
should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered: extrapyramidal
symptoms (opisthotonos, oculogyric crisis, hyperreflexia, dystonia, akathisia,
dyskinesia, parkinsonism) some of which have lasted months and even years--particularly
in elderly patients with previous brain damage; grand mal and petit mal
convulsions, particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history
of such disorders; altered cerebrospinal fluid proteins; cerebral edema;
intensification and prolongation of the action of central nervous system
depressants (opiates, analgesics, antihistamines, barbiturates, alcohol),
atropine, heat, organophosphorus insecticides; autonomic reactions (dryness
of mouth, nasal congestion, headache, nausea, constipation, obstipation,
adynamic ileus, ejaculatory disorders/impotence, priapism, atonic colon,
urinary retention, miosis and mydriasis); reactivation of psychotic processes,
catatonic-like states; hypotension (sometimes fatal); cardiac arrest; blood
dyscrasias (pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia, agranulocytosis,
eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia); liver damage (jaundice,
biliary stasis); endocrine disturbances (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, glycosuria,
lactation, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, false-positive
pregnancy tests); skin disorders (photosensitivity, itching, erythema,
urticaria, eczema up to exfoliative dermatitis); other allergic reactions
(asthma, laryngeal edema, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactoid reactions);
peripheral edema; reversed epinephrine effect; hyperpyrexia; mild fever
after large I.M. doses; increased appetite; increased weight; a systemic
lupus erythematosus-like syndrome; pigmentary retinopathy; with prolonged
administration of substantial doses, skin pigmentation, epithelial keratopathy,
and lenticular and corneal deposits. </P>

<P>EKG changes--particularly nonspecific, usually reversible Q and T wave
distortions--have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine
tranquilizers. </P>

<P>Although phenothiazines cause neither psychic nor physical dependence,
sudden discontinuance in long-term psychiatric patients may cause temporary
symptoms, e.g., nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tremulousness. </P>

<P>Note: There have been occasional reports of sudden death in patients
receiving phenothiazines. In some cases, the cause appeared to be cardiac
arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex. </P>

<P><A NAME="OVERDOSAGE"></A><B>OVERDOSAGE </B></P>

<P>(See also Adverse Reactions.) </P>

<P>SYMPTOMS--Primarily involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism producing
some of the dystonic reactions described above. </P>

<P>Symptoms of central nervous system depression to the point of somnolence
or coma. Agitation and restlessness may also occur. Other possible manifestations
include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic
reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. </P>

<P>TREATMENT--It is important to determine other medications taken by the
patient since multiple-dose therapy is common in overdosage situations.
Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage
is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway,
since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia
and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INDUCE
EMESIS BECAUSE A DYSTONIC REACTION OF THE HEAD OR NECK MAY DEVELOP THAT
COULD RESULT IN ASPIRATION OF VOMITUS. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated
with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or Benadryl. See prescribing
information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing
respiratory depression. </P>

<P>If administration of a stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine,
or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended. </P>

<P>Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g., picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol)
should be avoided. </P>

<P>If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory
shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer a vasoconstrictor,
Levophed and Neo-Synephrine are most suitable. Other pressor agents, including
epinephrine, are not recommended because phenothiazine derivatives may
reverse the usual elevating action of these agents and cause a further
lowering of blood pressure. </P>

<P>Limited experience indicates that phenothiazines are Not dialyzable.
</P>

<P>Special Note On Spansule Capsules--Since much of the Spansule capsule
medication is coated for gradual release, therapy directed at reversing
the effects of the ingested drug and at supporting the patient should be
continued for as long as overdosage symptoms remain. Saline cathartics
are useful for hastening evacuation of pellets that have not already released
medication. </P>

</B></P>

<P>NOTES ON INJECTION: Stability--This solution should be protected from
light. This is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution; a slight yellowish
discoloration will not alter potency. If markedly discolored, solution
should be discarded. </P>

<P>Compatibility--It is recommended that Prochlorperazine Injection not
be mixed with other agents in the syringe. </P>

<P>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION--ADULTS </P>

<P>(For children's dosage and administration, see below.) Dosage should
be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. </P>

<P>ELDERLY PATIENTS: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient
for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to
hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed
closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully
monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more
gradually in elderly patients. </P>

<P>1. TO CONTROL SEVERE NAUSEA AND VOMITING: Adjust dosage to the response
of the individual. Begin with the lowest recommended dosage. </P>

<P>ORAL DOSAGE--TABLETS: Usually one 5 mg or 10 mg tablet 3 or 4 times
daily. Daily dosages above 40 mg should be used only in resistant cases.
</P>

<P>EXTENDED RELEASE CAPSULES: Initially, usually one 15 mg capsule on arising
or one 10 mg capsule q12h. Daily doses above 40 mg should be used only
in resistant cases. </P>

<P>RECTAL DOSAGE: 25 mg twice daily. </P>

<P>I.M. DOSAGE: Initially 5 to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) injected Deeply into the
upper outer quadrant of the buttock. If necessary, repeat every 3 or 4
hours. Total I.M. dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. </P>

<P>I.V. DOSAGE: 2 1/2 to 10 mg (1/2 to 2 mL) by slow I.V. injection or
infusion at a rate not to exceed 5 mg per minute. Prochlorperazine Injection
may be administered either undiluted or diluted in isotonic solution. A
single dose of the drug should not exceed 10 mg; total I.V. dosage should
not exceed 40 mg per day. When administered I.V., do not use bolus injection.
Hypotension is a possibility if the drug is given by I.V. injection or
infusion. </P>

<P>SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ADVISABLE BECAUSE OF LOCAL IRRITATION.
</P>

<P>2. ADULT SURGERY (FOR SEVERE NAUSEA AND VOMITING): Total parenteral
dosage should not exceed 40 mg per day. Hypotension is a possibility if
the drug is given by I.V. injection or infusion. </P>

<P>I.M. DOSAGE: 5 to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) 1 to 2 hours before induction of
anesthesia (repeat once in 30 minutes, if necessary), or to control acute
symptoms during and after surgery (repeat once if necessary). </P>

<P>I.V. DOSAGE: 5 to 10 mg (1 to 2 mL) as a slow I.V. injection or infusion
15 to 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia, or to control acute symptoms
during or after surgery. Repeat once if necessary. Prochlorperazine may
be administered either undiluted or diluted in isotonic solution, but a
single dose of the drug should not exceed 10 mg. The rate of administration
should not exceed 5 mg per minute. When administered I.V., do not use bolus
injection. </P>

<P>3. IN ADULT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: Adjust dosage to the response of
the individual and according to the severity of the condition. Begin with
the lowest recommended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within
a day or 2, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement
is seen. </P>

<P>ORAL DOSAGE: Non-Psychotic Anxiety--Usual dosage is 5 mg 3 or 4 times
daily; by Spansule capsule, usually one 15 mg capsule on arising or one
10 mg capsule q12h. Do not administer in doses of more than 20 mg per day
or for longer than 12 weeks. </P>

<P>Psychotic Disorders--In Relatively Mild Conditions, as seen in private
psychiatric practice or in outpatient clinics, dosage is 5 or 10 mg 3 or
4 times daily. </P>

<P>In Moderate To Severe Conditions, for hospitalized or adequately supervised
patients, usual starting dosage is 10 mg 3 or 4 times daily. Increase dosage
gradually until symptoms are controlled or side effects become bothersome.
When dosage is increased by small increments every 2 or 3 days, side effects
either do not occur or are easily controlled. Some patients respond satisfactorily
on 50 to 75 mg daily. </P>

<P>In More Severe Disturbances, optimum dosage is usually 100 to 150 mg
daily. </P>

<P>I.M. DOSAGE: For immediate control of severely disturbed adults, inject
an initial dose of 10 to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) Deeply into the upper outer
quadrant of the buttock. Many patients respond shortly after the first
injection. If necessary, however, repeat the initial dose every 2 to 4
hours (or, in resistant cases, every hour) to gain control of the patient.
More than three or four doses are seldom necessary. After control is achieved,
switch patient to an oral form of the drug at the same dosage level or
higher. If, in rare cases, parenteral therapy is needed for a prolonged
period, give 10 to 20 mg (2 to 4 mL) every 4 to 6 hours. Pain and irritation
at the site of injection have seldom occurred. </P>

<P>SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ADVISABLE BECAUSE OF LOCAL IRRITATION.
</P>

<P>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION--CHILDREN </P>

<P>DO NOT USE IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY. </P>

<P>Children seem more prone to develop extrapyramidal reactions, even on
moderate doses. Therefore, use lowest effective dosage. Tell parents not
to exceed prescribed dosage, since the possibility of adverse reactions
increases as dosage rises. </P>

<P>Occasionally the patient may react to the drug with signs of restlessness
and excitement; if this occurs, do not administer additional doses. Take
particular precaution in administering the drug to children with acute
illnesses or dehydration (see under Dystonias). </P>

<P>When writing a prescription for the 2 1/2 mg size suppository, write
&quot;2 1/2,&quot; not &quot;2.5&quot;; this will help avoid confusion
with the 25 mg adult size. </P>

<P>1. SEVERE NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN CHILDREN: Prochlorperazine should not
be used in children under 20 pounds in weight or 2 years of age. It should
not be used in conditions for which children's dosages have not been established.
Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to
the severity of the symptoms and the response of the patient. The duration
of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours.
Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. </P>

<P>ORAL OR RECTAL DOSAGE: More than one day's therapy is seldom necessary.

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Gabapentin is described as 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid with
an empirical formula of C9H17NO2 and a molecular weight of 171.24. Gabapentin
is a white to off-white crystalline solid. It is freely soluble in water
and both basic and acidic aqueous solutions. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION </p>

<p>The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is
unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity,
gabapentin prevents seizures as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin
exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock
and pentylenetetrazole seizure models and other preclinical models (e.g.,
strains with genetic epilepsy, etc.) The relevance of these models to human
epilepsy is not known. </p>

<p>Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-
aminobutyric acid) but it does not interact with GABA receptors, it is
not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not
an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Gabapentin was tested in radioligand
binding assays at concentrations up to 100 microM and did not exhibit affinity
for a number of other common receptor sites, including benzodiazepine,
glutamate, N- methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate, kainate, strychnine-
insensitive or strychnine-sensitive glycine, alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta
adrenergic, adenosine A1 or A2, cholinergic, muscarinic or nicotinic, dopamine
D1 or D2, histamine H1, serotonin S1 or S2, opiate mu, delta or kappa,
voltage-sensitive calcium channel sites labeled with nitrendipine or diltiazem,
or at voltage-sensitive sodium channel sites with batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-
benzoate. </p>

<p>Several test systems ordinarily used to assess activity at the NMDA
receptor have been examined. Results are contradictory. Accordingly, no
general statement about the effects, if any, of gabapentin at the NMDA
receptor can be made. In Vitro studies with radiolabeled gabapentin have
revealed a gabapentin binding site in areas of rat brain including neocortex
and hippocampus. The identity and function of this binding site remain
to be elucidated. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND DRUG METABOLISM </p>

<p>All pharmacological actions following gabapentin administration are
due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is NOT appreciably
metabolized in humans. </p>

<p>ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY: Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional;
i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. A 400-mg dose, for
example, is about 25% less bioavailable than a 100-mg dose. Over the recommended
dose range of 300 to 600 mg T.I.D., however, the differences in bioavailability
are not large, and bioavailability is about 60 percent. Food has no effect
on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION: Gabapentin circulates largely unbound (&lt;3%) to plasma
protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg
intravenous administration is 58 +/- 6 L (Mean +/- SD). In patients with
epilepsy, steady- state predose (Cmin) concentrations of gabapentin in
cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma
concentrations. ELIMINATION: Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic
circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably
metabolized in humans. </p>

<p>Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by
dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant,
plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine
clearance (see Special Populations: Patients With Renal Insufficiency,
below). In elderly patients, and in patients with impaired renal function,
gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from
plasma by hemodialysis. Dosage adjustment in patients with compromised
renal function or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION, Table 2). </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Patients With Renal Insufficiency: Subjects (N=60)
with renal insufficiency (mean creatinine clearance ranging from 13-114
mL/min) were administered single 400-mg oral doses of gabapentin. The mean
gabapentin half- life ranged from about 6.5 hours (patients with creatinine
clearance &gt;60 mL/min) to 52 hours (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min)
and gabapentin renal clearance from about 90 mL/min (&gt;60 mL/min group)
to about 10 mL/min (&lt;30 mL/min). Mean plasma clearance (CL/F) decreased
from approximately 190 mL/min to 20 mL/min. Dosage adjustment in patients
with compromised renal function is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
</p>

<p>Hemodialysis: In a study in anuric subjects (N=11), the apparent elimination
half-life of gabapentin on nondialysis days was about 132 hours; dialysis
three times a week (4 hours duration) lowered the apparent half-life of
gabapentin by about 60%, from 132 hours to 51 hours. Hemodialysis thus
has a significant effect on gabapentin elimination in anuric subjects.
</p>

<p>Dosage adjustment in patients undergoing hemodialysis is necessary (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Hepatic Disease: Because gabapentin is not metabolized, no study was
performed in patients with hepatic impairment. </p>

<p>Age: The effect of age was studied in subjects 20-80 years of age. Apparent
oral clearance (CL/F) of gabapentin decreased as age increased, from about
225 mL/min in those under 30 years of age to about 125 mL/min in those
over 70 years of age. Renal clearance (CLr) and CLr adjusted for body surface
area also declined with age; however, the decline in the renal clearance
of gabapentin with age can largely be explained by the decline in renal
function. Reduction of gabapentin dose may be required in patients who
have age related compromised renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric
Use, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic data
are available in children below the age of 18 years. </p>

<p>Gender: Although no formal study has been conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics
of gabapentin in men and women, it appears that the pharmacokinetic parameters
for males and females are similar and there are no significant gender differences.
</p>

<p>Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
Because gabapentin is primarily renally excreted and there are no important
racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences
due to race are not expected. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Gabapentin as adjunctive therapy (added to other
antiepileptic drugs) was established in three multicenter placebo- controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in 705 adults with refractory
partial seizures. The patients enrolled had a history of at least 4 partial
seizures per month in spite of receiving one or more antiepileptic drugs
at therapeutic levels and were observed on their established antiepileptic
drug regimen during a 12-week baseline period. In patients continuing to
have at least 2 (or 4 in some studies) seizures per month, Gabapentin or
placebo was then added on to the existing therapy during a 12-week treatment
period. Effectiveness was assessed primarily on the basis of the percent
of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline
to treatment (the &quot;responder rate&quot;) and a derived measure called
response ratio, a measure of change defined as (T - B)/(T + B), where B
is the patient's baseline seizure frequency and T is the patient's seizure
frequency during treatment. Response ratio is distributed within the range
-1 to +1. A zero value indicates no change while complete elimination of
seizures would give a value of -1; increased seizure rates would give positive
values. A response ratio of -0.33 corresponds to a 50% reduction in seizure
frequency. The results given below are for all partial seizures in the
intent-to-treat (all patients who received any doses of treatment) population
in each study, unless otherwise indicated. </p>

<p>One study compared Gabapentin 1200 mg/day T.I.D. with placebo. Responder
rate was 23% (14/61) in the Gabapentin group and 9% (6/66) in the placebo
group; the difference between groups was statistically significant. Response
ratio was also better in the Gabapentin group (-0.199) than in the placebo
group (- 0.044), a difference that also achieved statistical significance.
</p>

<p>A second study compared primarily 1200 mg/day T.I.D. Gabapentin (N=101)
with placebo (N=98). Additional smaller Gabapentin dosage groups (600 mg/day,
N=53; 1800 mg/day, N=54) were also studied for information regarding dose
response. Responder rate was higher in the Gabapentin 1200 mg/day group
(16%) than in the placebo group (8%), but the difference was not statistically
significant. The responder rate at 600 mg (17%) was also not significantly
higher than in the placebo, but the responder rate in the 1800 mg group
(26%) was statistically significantly superior to the placebo rate. Response
ratio was better in the Gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (-0.103) than in the
placebo group (-0.022); but this difference was also not statistically
significant (p=0.224). A better response was seen in the Gabapentin 600
mg/day group (-0.105) and 1800 mg/day group (-0.222) than in the 1200 mg/day
group, with the 1800 mg/day group achieving statistical significance compared
to the placebo group. </p>

<p>A third study compared Gabapentin 900 mg/day T.I.D. (N=111) and placebo
(N = 109). An additional Gabapentin 1200 mg/day dosage group (N=52) provided
dose- response data. A statistically significant difference in responder
rate was seen in the Gabapentin 900 mg/day group (22%) compared to that
in the placebo group (10%). Response ratio was also statistically significantly
superior in the Gabapentin 900 mg/day group (-0.119) compared to that in
the placebo group (- 0.027), as was response ratio in 1200 mg/day Gabapentin
(-0.184) compared to placebo. </p>

<p>Analyses were also performed in each study to examine the effect of
Gabapentin on preventing secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
Patients who experienced a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure
in either the baseline or in the treatment period in all three placebo-controlled
studies were included in these analyses. There were several response ratio
comparisons that showed a statistically significant advantage for Gabapentin
compared to placebo and favorable trends for almost all comparisons. </p>

<p>Analysis of responder rate using combined data from all three studies
and all doses (N=162, Gabapentin; N=89, placebo) also showed a significant
advantage for Gabapentin over placebo in reducing the frequency of secondarily
generalized tonic-clonic seizures. </p>

<p>In two of the three controlled studies, more than one dose of Gabapentin
was used. Within each study the results did not show a consistently increased
response to dose. However, looking across studies, a trend toward increasing
efficacy with increasing dose is evident </p>

<p>Although no formal analysis by gender has been performed, estimates
of response (Response Ratio) derived from clinical trials (398 men, 307
women) indicate no important gender differences exist. There was no consistent
pattern indicating that age had any effect on the response to Gabapentin.
There were insufficient numbers of patients of races other than Caucasian
to permit a comparison of efficacy among racial groups. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Gabapentin (gabapentin) is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment
of partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults
with epilepsy. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity
to the drug or its ingredients. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>WITHDRAWAL PRECIPITATED SEIZURE, STATUS EPILEPTICUS </p>

<p>In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of status epilepticus
in patients receiving Gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients
receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients treated with Gabapentin
across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus.
Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either
before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical
data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment
with Gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus
than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with
Gabapentin. </p>

<p>TUMORIGENIC POTENTIAL </p>

<p>In standard preclinical In Vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an
unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified
in male, but not female, rats. (See PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,
Impairment of Fertility.) The clinical significance of this finding is
unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development
provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in
humans. </p>

<p>In clinical studies comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure, new tumors
were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma In Situ), and preexisting tumors worsened
in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years
following discontinuation of Gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background
incidence and recurrence in a similar population NOT treated with Gabapentin,
it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or
is not affected by treatment. </p>

<p>SUDDEN AND UNEXPLAINED DEATHS </p>

<p>During the course of premarketing development of Gabapentin, 8 sudden
and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated
(2103 patient-years of exposure). </p>

<p>Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure
was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038
deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a
healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates
for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy
not receiving Gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population
of epileptics, to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that
in the Gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy).
Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern
depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the Gabapentin
cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be instructed to take Gabapentin only as prescribed.
Patients should be advised that Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence
and other symptoms and signs of CNS depression. Accordingly, they should
be advised neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery
until they have gained sufficient experience on Gabapentin to gauge whether
or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Clinical trials data do not indicate that routine monitoring of clinical
laboratory parameters is necessary for the safe use of Gabapentin. The
value of monitoring Gabapentin blood concentrations has not been established.
Gabapentin may be used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs without
concern for alteration of the blood concentrations of gabapentin or of
other antiepileptic drugs. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with
the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs. </p>

<p>The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from
studies involving healthy adults and patients with epilepsy. </p>

<p>PHENYTOIN: In a single and multiple dose study of Gabapentin (400 mg
T.I.D.) in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy
for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough
plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin
pharmacokinetics. </p>

<p>CARBAMAZEPINE: Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine
10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin
(400 mg T.I.D.; N=12) administration. Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics
were unaltered by carbamazepine administration. </p>

<p>VALPROIC ACID: The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations
prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400mg T.I.D.;
N=17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetics parameters
affected by valproic acid. </p>

<p>PHENOBARBITAL: Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters
for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg T.I.D.; N=12) are identical whether
the drugs are administered alone or together. </p>

<p>CIMETIDINE: In the presence of cimetidine at 300mg Q.I.D. (N=12) the
mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance
fell by 10%. Thus cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both
gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function. This
small decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected
to be of clinical importance. The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was
not evaluated. </p>

<p>ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE: Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic
profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration
of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcgm of ethinyl
estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin
(400 mg T.I.D.; N=13). The Cmax of norethindrone was 13% higher when it
was coadministered with gabapentin; this interaction is not expected to
be of clinical importance. </p>

<p>ANTACID (MAALOX): Maalox reduced the bioavailability of gabapentin (N=16)
by about 20%. This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when gabapentin
was administered 2 hours after Maalox. It is recommended that gabapentin
be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration. </p>

<p>EFFECT OF PROBENECID: Probenecid is a blocker of renal tubular secretion.
Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were
comparable. This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular
secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TESTS INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix
SG dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to the other
antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation
procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Gabapentin was given in the diet to mice at 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg/day
and to rats at 250, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 years. A statistically
significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas
and carcinomas was found in male rats receiving the high dose; the no-effect
dose for the occurrence of carcinomas was 1000 mg/kg/day. Peak plasma concentrations
of gabapentin in rats receiving the high dose of 2000 mg/kg were 10 times
higher than plasma concentrations in humans receiving 3600 mg per day,
and in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg/day peak plasma concentrations were 6.5
times higher than in humans receiving 3600 mg/day. The pancreatic acinar
cell carcinomas did not affect survival, did not metastasize and were not
locally invasive. Studies to attempt to define a mechanism by which this
relatively rare tumor type is occurring are in progress. The relevance
of this finding to carcinogenic risk in humans is unclear. </p>

<p>Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three
In Vitro and two In Vivo assays. It was negative in the Ames test and the
In Vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it
did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the
In Vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the In Vivo
chromosomal aberration assay and in the In Vivo micronucleus test in Chinese
hamster bone marrow. </p>

<p>No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in rats
at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended
human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis). </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C: Gabapentin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rodents,
causing delayed ossification of several bones in the skull, vertebrae,
forelimbs, and hindlimbs. These effects occurred when pregnant mice received
oral doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis,
or approximately 1 to 4 times the maximum dose of 3600 mg/day given to
epileptic patients on a mg/M(squared) basis. The no-effect level was 500
mg/kg/day or approximately 1/2 of the human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis.
</p>

<p>When rats were dosed prior to and during mating, and throughout gestation,
pups from all dose groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) were affected.
These doses are equivalent to less than approximately 1 to 5 times the
maximum human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis. There was an increased incidence
of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis in rats in a study of fertility and
general reproductive performance at 2000 mg/kg/day with no effect at 1000
mg/kg/day, in a teratology study at 1500 mg/kg/day with no effect at 300
mg/kg/day, and in a perinatal and postnatal study at all doses studied
(500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day). The doses at which the effects occurred
are approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose of 3600 mg/day on
a mg/M(squared) basis; the no-effect doses were approximately 3 times (Fertility
and General Reproductive Performance study) and approximately equal to
(Teratogenicity study) the maximum human dose on a mg/M(squared) basis.
Other than hydroureter and hydronephrosis, the etiologies of which are
unclear, the incidence of malformations was not increased compared to controls
in offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given doses up to 50 times (mice),
30 times (rats), and 25 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/kg
basis, or 4 times (mice), 5 times (rats), or 8 times (rabbits) the human
daily dose on a mg/M(squared) basis. </p>

<p>In a teratology study in rabbits, an increased incidence of postimplantation
fetal loss occurred in dams exposed to 60, 300 and 1500 mg/kg/day, or less
than approximately 1/4 to 8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/M(squared)
basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human
response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>USE IN NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>It is not known if gabapentin is excreted in human milk and the effect
on the nursing infant is unknown. However, because many drugs are excreted
in human milk, Gabapentin should be used in women who are nursing only
if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years have
not been established. </p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE </p>

<p>No systematic studies in geriatric patients have been conducted. Adverse
clinical events reported among 59 Gabapentin exposed patients over age
65 did not differ in kind from those reported for younger individuals.
The small number of older individuals evaluated, however, limits the strength
of any conclusions reached about the influence, if any, of age on the kind
and incidence of adverse events or laboratory abnormality associated with
the use of Gabapentin. </p>

<p>Because Gabapentin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, the dose
of Gabapentin should be adjusted as noted in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
(Table 2) for elderly patients with compromised renal function. Creatinine
clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients and serum creatinine may
be reduced in the elderly because of decreased muscle mass. Creatinine
clearance (CCr) can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of
Cockcroft and Gault: </p>

<p>for females CCr = (0.85)(140-age)(wt)/((72)(SCr)) </p>

<p>for males CCr = (140-age)(wt)/((72)(SCr)) </p>

<p>where age is in years, wt is in kilograms and SCr is serum creatinine
in mg/dL. </p>

</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of
Gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs, not seen at an
equivalent frequency among placebo- treated patients, were somnolence,
dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. </p>

<p>Approximately 7% of the 2074 individuals who received Gabapentin in
premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse
event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal were
somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and/or vomiting
(0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). </p>

<p>INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in
at least 1% of Gabapentin-treated patients with epilepsy participating
in placebo- controlled trials and were numerically more common in the Gabapentin
group. In these studies, either Gabapentin or placebo was added to the
patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually
mild to moderate in intensity. </p>

<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when Gabapentin
was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict
the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice
where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing
during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly
compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving
different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies,
however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate
the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event
incidences in the population studied. </p>

emotional lability, rash, acne. </p>

of at least 10% of Gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared
to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. </p>

<p>The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events
seen were similar among men and women treated with Gabapentin. The incidence
of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated
with either Gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921)
in placebo- controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other),
there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution
of adverse events by race. </p>

<p>OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED DURING ALL CLINICAL TRIALS 
<br>Gabapentin has been administered to 2074 individuals during all clinical
trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials,
all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology
of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion
of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped
into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART
dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below.
The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 2074 individuals
exposed to Gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at
least one occasion while receiving Gabapentin. All reported events are
included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general
to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of
the drug. </p>

<p>Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated
in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent
adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;
infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients;
rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. </p>

<p>BODY AS A WHOLE: Frequent: asthenia, malaise, face edema; Infrequent:
allergy, generalized edema, weight decrease, chill; Rare: strange feelings,
lassitude, alcohol intolerance, hangover effect. </p>

angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disorder, palpitation, tachycardia,
migraine, murmur; Rare: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thrombophlebitis,
deep thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>The abuse and dependence potential of Gabapentin has not been evaluated
in human studies. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>A lethal dose of gabapentin was not identified in mice and rats receiving
single oral doses as high as 8000 mg/kg. Signs of acute toxicity in animals
included ataxia, labored breathing, ptosis, sedation, hypoactivity, or
excitation. </p>

<p>Acute oral overdoses of Gabapentin up to 49 grams have been reported.
In these cases, double vision, slurred speech, drowsiness, lethargy and
diarrhea were observed. All patients recovered with supportive care. </p>

<p>Gabapentin can be removed by hemodialysis. Although hemodialysis has
not been performed in the few overdose cases reported, it may be indicated
by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.
</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Gabapentin is recommended for add-on therapy in patients over 12 years
of age. Evidence bearing on its safety and effectiveness in children is
not available. Gabapentin is given orally with or without food. </p>

<p>The effective dose of Gabapentin is 900 to 1800mg/day and given in divided
doses (three times a day) using 300- or 400-mg capsules. Titration to an
effective dose can take place rapidly, over a few days, giving 300 mg on
Day 1, 300 mg twice a day on Day 2, and 300 mg three times a day on Day
3. To minimize potential side effects, especially somnolence, dizziness,
fatigue, and ataxia, the first dose on Day 1 may be administered at bedtime.
If necessary, the dose may be increased using 300- or 400-mg capsules three
times a day up to 1800 mg/day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well
tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also
been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short
duration, and have been well tolerated. The maximum time between doses
in the T.I.D. schedule should not exceed 12 hours. It is not necessary
to monitor gabapentin plasma concentrations to optimize Gabapentin therapy.
Further, because there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions
among Gabapentin and other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, the addition
of Gabapentin does not alter the plasma levels of these drugs appreciably.
</p>

<p>If Gabapentin is discontinued and/or alternate anticonvulsant medication
is added to the therapy, this should be done gradually over a minimum of
1 week. Dosage adjustment in patients with compromised renal function or
undergoing hemodialysis is recommended as follows: </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Risperidone is an antipsychotic agent belonging to a new chemical class,
the benzisoxazole derivatives. The chemical designation is 3-(2-(4-(6-
fluoro- 1,2-benzisoxazol- 3-yl)-1-piperidinyl)ethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-
2- methyl-4H-pyrido(1,2-a)pyrimidin-4-one. Its molecular formula is C23H27FN4O2
and its molecular weight is 410.49. Risperidone is a white to slightly
beige powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in methylene
chloride, and soluble in methanol and 0.1 N HCl. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>The mechanism of action of Risperidone , as with other antipsychotic
drugs, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's antipsychotic
activity is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and
serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Antagonism at receptors other than
D2 and 5HT2 may explain some of the other effects of Risperidone. </p>

<p>Risperidone is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity
(Ki of 0.12 to 7.3 nM) for the serotonin type 2 (5HT2), dopamine type 2
(D2), alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors. Risperidone
antagonizes other receptors, but with lower potency. Risperidone has low
to moderate affinity (Ki of 47 to 253 nM) for the serotonin 5HT1C, 5HT1D,
and 5HT1A receptors, weak affinity (Ki of 620 to 800 nM) for the dopamine
D1 and haloperidol-sensitive sigma site, and no affinity (when tested at
concentrations &gt;10 raised to the power of -5 M) for cholinergic muscarinic
or beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Risperidone is well absorbed, as illustrated by a mass balance study
involving a single 1 mg oral dose of 14C-risperidone as a solution in three
healthy male volunteers. Total recovery of radioactivity at one week was
85%, including 70% in the urine and 15% in the feces. </p>

<p>Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450IID6
to a major active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which is the predominant
circulating specie, and appears approximately equi-effective with risperidone
with respect to receptor binding activity and some effects in animals.
(A second minor pathway is N-dealkylation). Consequently, the clinical
effect of the drug likely results from the combined concentrations of risperidone
plus 9- hydroxyrisperidone. Plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone,
and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone are dose proportional over the
dosing range of 1 to 16 mg daily (0.5 to 8 mg BID). The relative oral bioavailability
of risperidone from a tablet was 94% (CV=10%) when compared to a solution.
Food does not affect either the rate or extent of absorption of risperidone.
Thus, risperidone can be given with or without meals. The absolute oral
bioavailability of risperidone was 70% (CV=25%). </p>

<p>The enzyme catalyzing hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone
is cytochrome P450IID6, also called debrisoquin hydroxylase, the enzyme
responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics,
and other drugs. Cytochrome P450IID6 is subject to genetic polymorphism
(about 6-8% of caucasians, and a very low percent of Asians have little
or no activity and are &quot;poor metabolizers&quot;) and to inhibition
by a variety of substrates and some non- substrates, notably quinidine.
Extensive metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9-hydroxyrisperidone,
while poor metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Extensive metabolizers,
therefore, have lower risperidone and higher 9- hydroxyrisperidone concentrations
than poor metabolizers. Following oral administration of solution or tablet,
mean peak plasma concentrations occurred at about 1 hour. Peak 9-hydroxyrisperidone
occurred at about 3 hours in extensive metabolizers, and 17 hours in poor
metabolizers. The apparent half- life of risperidone was three hours (CV=30%)
in extensive metabolizers and 20 hours (CV=40%) in poor metabolizers. The
apparent half-life of 9- hydroxyrisperidone was about 21 hours (CV=20%)
in extensive metabolizers and 30 hours (CV=25%) in poor metabolizers. Steady-state
concentrations of risperidone are reached in 1 day in extensive metabolizers
and would be expected to reach steady state in about 5 days in poor metabolizers.
Steady-state concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone are reached in 5-6
days (measured in extensive metabolizers). </p>

<p>Because risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are approximately equi-effective,
the sum of their concentrations is pertinent. The pharmacokinetics of the
sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, after single and multiple
doses, were similar in extensive and poor metabolizers, with an overall
mean elimination half-life of about 20 hours. In analyses comparing adverse
reaction rates in extensive and poor metabolizers in controlled and open
studies, no important differences were seen. </p>

<p>Risperidone could be subject to two kinds of drug-drug interactions.
First, inhibitors of cytochrome P450IID6 could interfere with conversion
of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone. This in fact occurs with quinidine,
giving essentially all recipients a risperidone pharmacokinetic profile
typical of poor metabolizers. The favorable and adverse effects of risperidone
in patients receiving quinidine have not been evaluated, but observations
in a modest number (n is approximately equal to 70) of poor metabolizers
given risperidone do not suggest important differences between poor and
extensive metabolizers. It would also be possible for risperidone to interfere
with metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6. Relatively
weak binding of risperidone to the enzyme suggests this is unlikely (See
PRECAUTIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS). </p>

<p>The plasma protein binding of risperidone was about 90% over the in
vitro concentration range of 0.5 to 200 ng/mL and increased with increasing
concentrations of alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The plasma binding of 9- hydroxyrisperidone
was 77%. Neither the parent nor the metabolite displaced each other from
the plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine
(100 mcgm/mL), warfarin (10 mcgm/mL) and carbamazepine (10 mcgm/mL) caused
only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL
and 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance.
</p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS </p>

<p>RENAL IMPAIRMENT: In patients with moderate to severe renal disease,
clearance of the sum of risperidone and its active metabolite decreased
by 60% compared to young healthy subjects. Risperidone doses should be
reduced in patients with renal disease (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT: While the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in subjects
with liver disease were comparable to those in young healthy subjects,
the mean free fraction of risperidone in plasma was increased by about
35% because of the diminished concentration of both albumin and alpha1-acid
glycoprotein. Risperidone doses should be reduced in patients with liver
disease (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>ELDERLY: In healthy elderly subjects renal clearance of both risperidone
and 9- hydroxyrisperidone was decreased, and elimination half-lives were
prolonged compared to young healthy subjects. Dosing should be modified
accordingly in the elderly patients (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>RACE AND GENDER EFFECTS: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted
to investigate race and gender effects, but a population pharmacokinetic
analysis did not identify important differences in the disposition of risperidone
due to gender (whether corrected for body weight or not) or race. </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>The efficacy of Risperidone in the management of the manifestations
of psychotic disorders was established in three short-term (6- to 8-week)
controlled trials of psychotic inpatients who met DSM III-R criteria for
schizophrenia. </p>

<p>Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms
in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS),
a multi- item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to
evaluate the effects of drug treatment in psychosis. The BPRS psychosis
cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness,
and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset
for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional
assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression
of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia,
about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, two more
recently developed, but less well evaluated scales, were employed; these
included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale
for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS). The results of the trials follow:
</p>

<p>(1) In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=160) involving titration
of Risperidone in doses up to 10 mg/day (BID schedule), Risperidone was
generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, on the BPRS psychosis
cluster, and marginally superior to placebo on the SANS. </p>

<p>(2) In an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=513) involving 4 fixed
doses of Risperidone (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day, on a BID schedule), all
4 Risperidone groups were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total
score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score; the 3 highest Risperidone
dose groups were generally superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale.
The most consistently positive responses on all measures were seen for
the 6 mg dose group, and there was no suggestion of increased benefit from
larger doses. </p>

<p>(3) In an 8-week, dose comparison trial (n=1356) involving 5 fixed doses
of Risperidone (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day, on a BID schedule), the four
highest Risperidone dose groups were generally superior to the 1 mg Risperidone
dose group on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity
score. None of the dose groups were superior to the 1 mg group on the PANSS
negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses were seen for
the 4 mg dose group. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Risperidone is indicated for the management of the manifestations of
psychotic disorders. </p>

<p>The antipsychotic efficacy of Risperidone was established in short-term
(6 to 8 weeks) controlled trials of schizophrenic inpatients (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Risperidone in long-term use, that is, more than
6 to 8 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.
Therefore, the physician who elects to use Risperidone for extended periods
should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for
the individual patient (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Risperidone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity
to the product. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS) </p>

<p>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic
Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic
drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity,
altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular
pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria
(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. </p>

<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.
In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the
clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia,
systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal
signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential
diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever,
and primary central nervous system pathology. </p>

<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of
antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy;
2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment
of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments
are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological
treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. </p>

<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from
NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered.
The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have
been reported. </p>

<p>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA </p>

<p>A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements
may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the
prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially
elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict,
at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in
their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. </p>

<p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it
will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment
and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the
patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less
commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. </p>

<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia,
although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic
treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress
(or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby
may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression
has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. </p>

<p>Given these considerations, Risperidone should be prescribed in a manner
that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic
antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer
from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs,
and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful
treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require
chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment
producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for
continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. </p>

<p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Risperidone,
drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require
treatment with Risperidone despite the presence of the syndrome. </p>

<p>POTENTIAL FOR PROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS: Risperidone and/or 9-hydroxyrisperidone
appears to lengthen the QT interval in some patients, although there is
no average increase in treated patients, even at 12-16 mg/day, well above
the recommended dose. Other drugs that prolong the QT interval have been
associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes, a life-threatening
arrhythmia. Bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, concomitant use with other
drugs that prolong QT, or the presence of congenital prolongation in QT
can increase the risk for occurrence of this arrhythmia. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: Risperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension
associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope,
especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting
its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.2%
(6/2607) of Risperidone treated patients in phase 2-3 studies. The risk
of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the
initial dose to 1 mg BID in normal adults and 0.5 mg BID in the elderly
and patients with renal or hepatic impairment (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Risperidone
should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular
disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or
conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which
would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and
treatment with antihypertensive medications). </p>

<p>SEIZURES: During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0.3% (9/2607)
of Risperidone treated patients, two in association with hyponatremia.
Risperidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures.
</p>

<p>HYPERPROLACTINEMIA: As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2
receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists
during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that
approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent
in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these
drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer.
Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and
impotence have been reported with prolactin- elevating compounds, the clinical
significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.
As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase
in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia
and/or neoplasia was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies
conducted in mice and rats (See CARCINOGENESIS). However, neither clinical
studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association
between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis
in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive
at this time. </p>

<p>POTENTIAL FOR COGNITIVE AND MOTOR IMPAIRMENT: Somnolence was a commonly
reported adverse event associated with Risperidone treatment, especially
when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse event
is dose related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse
events, 41% of the high dose patients (Risperidone 16 mg/day) reported
somnolence compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more
sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which
8% of Risperidone 16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported
somnolence as an adverse event. Since Risperidone has the potential to
impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned
about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they
are reasonably certain that Risperidone therapy does not affect them adversely.
</p>

<p>PRIAPISM: Rare cases of priapism have been reported. While the relationship
of the events to Risperidone use has not been established, other drugs
with alpha- adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism,
and it is possible that Risperidone may share this capacity. Severe priapism
may require surgical intervention. </p>

<p>THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (TTP): A single case of TTP was
reported in a 28 year-old female patient receiving Risperidone in a large,
open premarketing experience (approximately 1300 patients). She experienced
jaundice, fever, and bruising, but eventually recovered after receiving
plasmapheresis. The relationship to Risperidone therapy is unknown. </p>

<p>ANTIEMETIC EFFECT: Risperidone has an antiemetic effect in animals;
this effect may also occur in humans, and may mask signs and symptoms of
overdosage with certain drugs or of conditions such as intestinal obstruction,
Reye's syndrome, and brain tumor. </p>

<p>BODY TEMPERATURE REGULATION: Disruption of body temperature regulation
has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Caution is advised when prescribing
for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes. SUICIDE: The
possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia, and close
supervision of high risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions
for Risperidone should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets
consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of
overdose. </p>

<p>USE IN PATIENTS WITH CONCOMITANT ILLNESS: Clinical experience with Risperidone
in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution
is advisable in using Risperidone in patients with diseases or conditions
that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. </p>

<p>Risperidone has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent
in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable
heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical
studies during the product's premarket testing. The electrocardiograms
of approximately 380 patients who received Risperidone and 120 patients
who received placebo in two double-blind, placebo- controlled trials were
evaluated and the data revealed one finding of potential concern, i.e.,
8 patients taking Risperidone whose baseline QTc interval was less than
450 msec were observed to have QTc intervals greater than 450 msec during
treatment; no such prolongations were seen in the smaller placebo group.
There were 3 such episodes in the approximately 125 patients who received
haloperidol. Because of the risks of orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation,
caution should be observed in cardiac patients (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
</p>

<p>Increased plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone
occur in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30mL/min/1.73
M(square)), and an increase in the free fraction of the risperidone is
seen in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose
should be used in such patients (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients
for whom they prescribe Risperidone: </p>

<p>ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic
hypotension, especially during the period of initial dose titration. </p>

<p>INTERFERENCE WITH COGNITIVE AND MOTOR PERFORMANCE: Since Risperidone
has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients
should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles,
until they are reasonably certain that Risperidone therapy does not affect
them adversely. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they
become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. </p>

<p>NURSING: Patients should be advised not to breast feed an infant if
they are taking Risperidone. </p>

<p>CONCOMITANT MEDICATION: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians
if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter
drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. </p>

<p>ALCOHOL: Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Risperidone.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>No specific laboratory tests are recommended. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>The interactions of Risperidone and other drugs have not been systematically
evaluated. Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should
be used when Risperidone is taken in combination with other centrally acting
drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p>Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, Risperidone may enhance
the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential.
Risperidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
Chronic administration of carbamazepine with risperidone may increase the
clearance of risperidone. </p>

<p>Chronic administration of clozapine with risperidone may decrease the
clearance of risperidone. </p>

<p>DRUGS THAT INHIBIT CYTOCHROME P450IID6 AND OTHER P450 ISOZYMES: </p>

<p>Risperidone is metabolized to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by cytochrome P450IID6,
an enzyme that is polymorphic in the population and that can be inhibited
by a variety of psychotropic and other drugs (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
Drug interactions that reduce the metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone
would increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone and lower the concentrations
of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Analysis of clinical studies involving a modest
number of poor metabolizers (n is approximately equal to 70) does not suggest
that poor and extensive metabolizers have different rates of adverse effects.
No comparison of effectiveness in the two groups has been made. In vitro
studies showed that drugs metabolized by other P450 isozymes, including
1A1, 1A2, IIC9, MP, and IIIA4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone
metabolism. </p>

<p>DRUGS METABOLIZED BY CYTOCHROME P450IID6: In vitro studies indicate
that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450IID6.
Therefore, Risperidone is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance
of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. However, clinical
data to confirm this expectation are not available. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY CARCINOGENESIS:
Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Swiss albino mice and Wistar
rats. Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and
10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are
equivalent to 2.4, 9.4 and 37.5 times the maximum human dose (16 mg/day)
on a mg/kg basis or 0.2, 0.75 and 3 times the maximum human dose (mice)
or 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times the maximum human dose (rats) on a mg/M(square)
basis. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There were
statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine
pancreas adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The following table
summarizes the multiples of the human dose on a mg/M(square) (mg/kg) basis
at which these tumors occurred. </p>

<p>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin
levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the
risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic
toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels
5 to 6 fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity
studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms
has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic
drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human
risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents
is unknown (See Hyperprolactinemia under PRECAUTIONS, GENERAL). </p>

<p>MUTAGENESIS: No evidence of mutagenic potential for risperidone was
found in the Ames reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay, in vitro
rat hepatocyte DNA- repair assay, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the
sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila, or the chromosomal aberration
test in human lymphocytes or Chinese hamster cells. </p>

<p>IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Risperidone (0.16 to 5 mg/kg) was shown to
impair mating, but not fertility, in Wistar rats in three reproductive
studies (two Segment I and a multigenerational study) at doses 0.1 to 3
times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/M(square) basis. The effect
appeared to be in females since impaired mating behavior was not noted
in the Segment I study in which males only were treated. In a subchronic
study in Beagle dogs in which risperidone was administered at doses of
0.31 to 5 mg/kg, sperm motility and concentration were decreased at doses
0.6 to 10 times the human dose on a mg/M(square) basis. Dose-related decreases
were also noted in serum testosterone at the same doses. Serum testosterone
and sperm parameters partially recovered but remained decreased after treatment
was discontinued. No no-effect doses were noted in either rat or dog. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: The teratogenic potential of risperidone was studied
in three Segment II studies in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats and in one
Segment II study in New Zealand rabbits. The incidence of malformations
was not increased compared to control in offspring of rats or rabbits given
0.4 to 6 times the human dose on a mg/M(square) basis. In three reproductive
studies in rats (two Segment III and a multigenerational study), there
was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation at doses
0.1 to 3 times the human dose on a mg/M(square) basis. It is not known
whether these deaths were due to a direct effect on the fetuses or pups
or to effects on the dams. There was no no-effect dose for increased rat
pup mortality. In one Segment III study, there was an increase in stillborn
rat pups at a dose 1.5 times higher than the human dose on a mg/M(square)
basis. </p>

<p>Placental transfer of risperidone occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate
and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, there was one report
of a case of agenesis of the corpus callosum in an infant exposed to risperidone
in utero. The causal relationship to Risperidone therapy is unknown. Risperidone
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies
the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>The effect of Risperidone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.
NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>It is not known whether or not risperidone is excreted in human milk.
In animal studies, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were excreted in
breast milk. Therefore, women receiving Risperidone should not breast feed.
PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Clinical studies of Risperidone did not include sufficient numbers of
patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently
from younger patients. In general, a lower starting dose is recommended
for an elderly patient, reflecting a decreased pharmacokinetic clearance
in the elderly, as well as a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal,
or cardiac function, and a greater tendency to postural hypotension (See
ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT </p>

<p>Approximately 9% percent (244/2607) of Risperidone -treated patients
in phase 2-3 studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared
with about 7% on placebo and 10% on active control drugs. The more common

</pre>

<p>Suicide attempt was associated with discontinuation in 1.2% of Risperidone
treated patients compared to 0.6% of placebo patients, but, given the almost
40- fold greater exposure time in Risperidone compared to placebo patients,
it is unlikely that suicide attempt is a Risperidone related adverse event
(See PRECAUTIONS). Discontinuation for extrapyramidal symptoms was 0% in
placebo patients but 3.8% in active-control patients in the phase 2-3 trials.
</p>

<p>INCIDENCE IN CONTROLLED TRIALS </p>

<p>COMMONLY OBSERVED ADVERSE EVENTS IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS: In two
6- to 8- week placebo- controlled trials, spontaneously-reported, treatment-emergent
adverse events with an incidence of 5% or greater in at least one of the
Risperidone groups and at least twice that of placebo were: anxiety, somnolence,
extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis,
rash, and tachycardia. </p>

<p>Adverse events were also elicited in one of these two trials (i.e.,
in the fixed-dose trial comparing Risperidone at doses of 2, 6, 10, and
16 mg/day with placebo) utilizing a checklist for detecting adverse events,
a method that is more sensitive than spontaneous reporting. By this method,
the following additional common and drug- related adverse events were present
at at least 5% and twice the rate of placebo: increased dream activity,
increased duration of sleep, accommodation disturbances, reduced salivation,
micturition disturbances, diarrhea, weight gain, menorrhagia, diminished
sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and orgastic
dysfunction. ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING AT AN INCIDENCE OF 1% OR MORE AMONG
Risperidone </p>

<p>TREATED PATIENTS: The table that follows enumerates adverse events that
occurred at an incidence of 1% or more, and were at least as frequent among
Risperidone treated patients treated at doses of &lt; or = 10 mg/day than
among placebo-treated patients in the pooled results of two 6- to 8-week
controlled trials. Patients received Risperidone doses of 2, 6, 10, or
16 mg/day in the dose comparison trial, or up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/day
in the titration study. This table shows the percentage of patients in
each dose group (&lt; or = 10 mg/day or 16 mg/day) who spontaneously reported
at least one episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Patients
given doses of 2, 6, or 10 mg did not differ materially in these rates.
Reported adverse events were classified using the World Health Organization
preferred terms. </p>

<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to
predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice
where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which
prevailed in this clinical trial. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot
be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving
different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however,
do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the
relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence
rate in the population studied. </p>

<p>(1) Events reported by at least 1% of patients treated with Risperidone
&lt; or = 10 mg/day are included, and are rounded to the nearest %. Comparative
rates for Risperidone 16 mg/day and placebo are provided as well. Events
for which the Risperidone incidence (in both dose groups) was equal to
or less than placebo are not listed in the table, but included the following:
nervousness, injury, and fungal infection. </p>

<p>(2) Includes tremor, dystonia, hypokinesia, hypertonia, hyperkinesia,
oculogyric crisis, ataxia, abnormal gait, involuntary muscle contractions,
hyporeflexia, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorders. Although the incidence
of &quot;extrapyramidal symptoms&quot; does not appear to differ for the
&quot;&lt; or = 10 mg/day&quot; group and placebo, the data for individual
dose groups in fixed dose trials do suggest a dose/response relationship
(See DOSE DEPENDENCY OF ADVERSE EVENTS). DOSE DEPENDENCY OF ADVERSE EVENTS:
</p>

<p>EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS: Data from two fixed dose trials provided evidence
of dose-relatedness for extrapyramidal symptoms associated with risperidone
treatment. </p>

<p>Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an
8-week trial comparing four fixed doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, and 16
mg/day), including (1) a parkinsonism score (mean change from baseline)
from the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and (2) incidence of spontaneous
complaints of EPS: </p>

<p>OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS: Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for
side effects from a large study comparing 5 fixed doses of Risperidone
(1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for dose- relatedness of adverse
events. A Cochran- Armitage Test for trend in these data revealed a positive
trend (p&lt;0.05) for the following adverse events: sleepiness, increased
duration of sleep, accommodation disturbances, orthostatic dizziness, palpitations,
weight gain, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgastic dysfunction,
asthenia/lassitude/increased fatigability, and increased pigmentation.
</p>

<p>VITAL SIGN CHANGES: Risperidone is associated with orthostatic hypotension
and tachycardia (See PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>WEIGHT CHANGES: The proportions of Risperidone and placebo-treated patients
meeting a weight gain criterion of &gt;/=7% of body weight were compared
in a pool of 6- to 8-week placebo- controlled trials, revealing a statistically
significantly greater incidence of weight gain for Risperidone (18%) compared
to placebo (9%). </p>

<p>LABORATORY CHANGES: A between group comparison for 6- to 8-week placebo-
controlled trials revealed no statistically significant Risperidone/placebo
differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important
changes in routine serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis parameters.
Similarly, there were no Risperidone/placebo differences in the incidence
of discontinuations for changes in serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis.
However, Risperidone administration was associated with increases in serum
prolactin (See PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>ECG CHANGES: The electrocardiograms of approximately 380 patients who
received Risperidone and 120 patients who received placebo in two double-blind,
placebo- controlled trials were evaluated and revealed one finding of potential
concern; i.e., 8 patients taking Risperidone whose baseline QTc interval
was less than 450 msec were observed to have QTc intervals greater than
450 msec during treatment (See WARNINGS). Changes of this type were not
seen among about 120 placebo patients, but were seen in patients receiving
haloperidol (3/126). </p>

<p>OTHER EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE PRE-MARKETING EVALUATION OF Risperidone
During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of Risperidone were
administered to 2607 patients in phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions
and duration of exposure to Risperidone varied greatly, and included (in
overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and
controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration
studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure. In most studies, untoward
events associated with this exposure were obtained by spontaneous report
and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.
Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the
proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping
similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized
event categories. In two large studies, adverse events were also elicited
utilizing the UKU (direct questioning) side effect rating scale, and these
events were not further categorized using standard terminology (Note: These
events are marked with an asterisk in the listings that follow). </p>

<p>In the listings that follow, spontaneously reported adverse events were
classified using World Health Organization (WHO) preferred terms. The frequencies
presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2607 patients exposed
to multiple doses of Risperidone who experienced an event of the type cited
on at least one occasion while receiving Risperidone. All reported events
are included except those already listed in Table 1, those events for which
a drug cause was remote, and those event terms which were so general as
to be uninformative. It is important to emphasize that, although the events
reported occurred during treatment with Risperidone, they were not necessarily
caused by it. </p>

<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of
decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse
events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already
listed in the tabulated results from placebo controlled trials appear in
this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to
1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

pulmonary embolism, sudden death. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: </p>

<p>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CLASS: Risperidone is not a controlled substance.
</p>

<p>PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGIC DEPENDENCE: Risperidone has not been systematically
studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance or
physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency
for any drug- seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic
and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience
the extent to which a CNS- active drug will be misused, diverted and/or
abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully
for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely
for signs of Risperidone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance,
increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>HUMAN EXPERIENCE: Experience with Risperidone in acute overdosage was
limited in the premarketing database (8 reports), with estimated doses
ranging from 20 to 300 mg and no fatalities. In general, reported signs
and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known
pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and
hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated
overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged
QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36
mg, was associated with a seizure. </p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF OVERDOSAGE: In case of acute overdosage, establish and
maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Gastric
lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration
of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The
possibility of obtundation, seizures or dystonic reaction of the head and
neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis.
Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include
continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide and
quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects that might
be additive to those of risperidone. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect
that the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those
of risperidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. </p>

<p>There is no specific antidote to Risperidone. Therefore appropriate
supportive measures should be instituted. The possibility of multiple drug
involvement should be considered. Hypotension and circulatory collapse
should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids
and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used,
since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of risperidone-induced
alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic
medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring
should continue until the patient recovers. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>USUAL INITIAL DOSE: Risperidone should be administered on a BID schedule,
generally beginning with 1 mg BID initially, with increases in increments
of 1 mg BID on the second and third day, as tolerated, to a target dose
of 3 mg BID by the third day. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated,
should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady
state for the active metabolite would not be achieved for approximately
1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, small
dose increments/decrements of 1 mg BID are recommended. </p>

<p>Antipsychotic efficacy was demonstrated in a dose range of 4 to 16 mg/day
in the clinical trials supporting effectiveness of Risperidone, however,
maximal effect was generally seen in a range of 4 to 6 mg/day. Doses above
6 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses,
were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects,
and are not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day
has not been evaluated in clinical trials. </p>

<p>DOSAGE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS: The recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg
BID in patients who are elderly or debilitated, patients with severe renal
or hepatic impairment, and patients either predisposed to hypotension or
for whom hypotension would pose a risk. Dosage increases in these patients
should be in increments of 0.5 mg BID. Dosage increases above 1.5 mg BID
should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week. Elderly or
debilitated patients, and patients with renal impairment, may have less
ability to eliminate Risperidone than normal adults. Patients with impaired
hepatic function may have increases in the free fraction of the risperidone,
possibly resulting in an enhanced effect (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
Patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions or for whom such
reactions would pose a particular risk likewise need to be titrated cautiously
and carefully monitored (See PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>MAINTENANCE THERAPY: While there is no body of evidence available to
answer the question of how long the patient treated with Risperidone should
remain on it, the effectiveness of maintenance treatment is well established
for many other antipsychotic drugs. It is recommended that responding patients
be continued on Risperidone, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain
remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the
need for maintenance treatment. </p>

<p>REINITIATION OF TREATMENT IN PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY DISCONTINUED: Although
there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it
is recommended that when restarting patients who have had an interval off
Risperidone, the initial 3-day dose titration schedule should be followed.
</p>

<p>SWITCHING FROM OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTICS: There are no systematically collected
data to specifically address switching from other antipsychotics to Risperidone,
or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While
immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be
acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most
appropriate for other patients. In all cases, the period of overlapping
antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients
from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate Risperidone
therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing
existing EPS medication should be reevaluated periodically. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Acetaminophen, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, is a non-opiate, non-salicylate
analgesic and antipyretic which occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline
powder, possessing a slightly bitter taste. </p>

<p>C8H9NO2 : M.W. 151.16. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Acetaminophen is a peripherally acting analgesic and is well absorbed
orally. Acetaminophen produces analgesia by elevation of the pain threshold
and antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat regulating center.
Acetaminophen is equal to aspirin in analgesic and antipyretic effectiveness.
</p>

<p>The plasma elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 4 hours for acetaminophen.
Acetaminophen is distributed throughout most fluids of the body, and is
metabolized primarily in the liver. Little unchanged drug is excreted in
the urine, but most metabolic products appear in the urine within 24 hours.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Acetaminophen provides temporary relief of minor aches and pains with
heartburn or acid indigestion and upset stomach associated with these symptoms.
Acetaminophen chewable tablets, elixir, drops, suspension liquid and suspension
drops are designed for treatment of infants and children with conditions
requiring temporary relief of fever and discomfort due to colds and &quot;flu,&quot;
and of simple pain and discomfort due to teething, immunizations and tonsillectomy.

<br>
<br><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b></p>

<p> Acetaminophen should not be administered to patients who have previously
exhibited hypersensitivity to it. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>If you generally consume 3 or more alcohol- containing drinks per day,
you should consult your physician for advice on when and how you should
take acetaminophen and other pain relievers. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs And Symptoms: In acute acetaminophen overdosage, dose-dependent,
potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect.
Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also
occur. </p>

<p>In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses
of less than 10 grams and fatalities with less than 15 grams. Importantly,
young children seem to be more resistant than adults to the hepatotoxic
effect of an acetaminophen overdose. Despite this, the measures outlined
below should be initiated in any adult or child suspected of having ingested
an acetaminophen overdose. </p>

<p>Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include:
nausea vomiting, diaphoresis and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory
evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.
</p>

<p>Treatment: The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by induction
of emesis with syrup of ipecac. Patients' estimates of the quantity of
a drug ingested are notoriously unreliable. Therefore, if an acetaminophen
overdose is suspected, a serum acetaminophen assay should be obtained as
early as possible, but no sooner than four hours following ingestion. Liver
function studies should be obtained initially and repeated at 24-hour intervals.
</p>

<p>The antidote, N-acetylcysteine, should be administered as early as possible,
preferably within 16 hours of the overdose ingestion for optimal results,
but in any case, within 24 hours. Following recovery, there are no residual,
structural or functional hepatic abnormalities. </p>

<p>For additional emergency information, call your regional poison center
or call the Rocky Mountain Poison Center toll-free (1-800-525-6115). </p>

<p>ALCOHOL INFORMATION </p>

<p>Chronic heavy alcohol abusers may be at increased risk of liver toxicity
from excessive acetaminophen use, although reports of this event are rare.
Reports almost invariably involve cases of severe chronic alcoholics and
the dosages of acetaminophen most often exceed recommended doses and often
involve substantial overdose. Professionals should alert their patients
who regularly consume large amounts of alcohol not to exceed recommended
doses of acetaminophen. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <P></P>
The active component of Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol is albuterol, USP racemic
(alpha1-((Ttert-butylamino)methyl)-4-hydroxy-M-xylene-alpha,alpha,-diol), a
relatively selective beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator.  
 <P></P>
Albuterol is the official generic name in the United States. The World Health
Organization recommended name for the drug is salbutamol. The molecular weight
of albuterol is 239.3, and the empirical formula is C13H21NO3. Albuterol is a
white to off-white crystalline solid. It is soluble in ethanol, sparingly
soluble in water, and very soluble in chloroform.  
 <P></P>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <P></P>
In Vitro studies and In Vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that
albuterol has a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors compared with 
isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors are
thepredominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicate that
there is a population of beta2-receptors in the human heart existing in a
concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these, however, is not
yet established. The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonist drugs,
including albuterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through
beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which
catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'
adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with
relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of 
immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Albuterol
has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the
respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than
isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. 
Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that
inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a
significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate,
blood pressure, symptoms, and/or ECG changes.  <P></P>
 
Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol by any route of administration in 
most patients because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes
for catecholamines nor for catechol-O-methyl transferase.  <P></P>
 
Because of its gradual absorption from the bronchi, systemic levels of
albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. Studies undertaken
with four subjects administered tritiated albuterol, resulted in maximum plasma 
concentrations occurring within 2 to 4 hours. Due to the sensitivity of the
assay method, the metabolic rate and half-life of elimination of albuterol in
plasma could not be determined. However, urinary excretion provided data
indicating that albuterol has an elimination half-life of 3.8 hours. 
Approximately 72% of the inhaled dose is excreted within 24 hours in the urine, 
and consists of 28% of unchanged drug and 44% as metabolite.  <P></P>
 
Results of animal studies show that albuterol does not pass the blood-brain
barrier.  <P></P>
 
Recent studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) recorded the 
occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologic evidence of 
myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines were administered
concurrently. The significance of these findings when applied to humans is
currently unknown.  
 <P></P>
The effects of rising doses of albuterol and isoproterenol aerosols were
studied in volunteers and asthmatic patients. Results in normal volunteers
indicated that albuterol is 1/2 to 1/4 as active as isoproterenol in producing
increases in heart rate. In asthmatic patients similar cardiovascular
differentiation between the two drugs was also seen.  <P></P>
 
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol is indicated for the prevention and relief of
bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease, and for
the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.  
 <P></P>
In controlled clinical trials the onset of improvement in pulmonary function
was within 15 minutes, as determined by both maximal midexpiratory flow rate
(MMEF) and FEV1. MMEF measurements also showed that near maximum improvement in 
pulmonary function generally occurs within 60 to 90 minutes following 2
inhalations of albuterol and that clinically significant improvement generally
continues for 3 to 4 hours in most patients. In clinical trials, some patients
with asthma showed a therapeutic response (defined by maintaining FEV1 values
15% or more above baseline) which was still apparent at 6 hours. Continued
effectiveness of albuterol was demonstrated over a 13-week period in these same 
trials.  
 <P></P>
In clinical studies, 2 inhalations of albuterol taken approximately 15 minutes
prior to exercise prevented exercise-induced bronchospasm, as demonstrated by
the maintenance of FEV1 within 80 percent of baseline values in the majority of 
patients. One of these studies also evaluated the duration of the prophylactic
effect to repeated exercise challenges, which was evident at 4 hours in the
majority of patients, and at 6 hours in approximately one third of the
patients.  <P></P>
 
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol is contraindicated in patients with a history of
hypersensitivity to any of its components.  <P></P>
 
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
<P></P>
</b>As with other inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol
can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs 
the preparation should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy
instituted.  
 <P></P>
Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled
sympathomimetic drugs. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest
following the unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and
subsequent hypoxia is suspected. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur 
after administration of albuterol inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by rare
cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and
oropharyngeal edema.  <P></P>
 
The contents of Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol are under pressure. Do not
puncture. Do not use or store near heat or open flame. Exposure to temperatures 
above 120 deg F may cause bursting. Never throw container into fire or
incinerator. Keep out of reach of children.  <P></P>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
GENERAL: Albuterol, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with
caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary
insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with
convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients
who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.  <P></P>
 
Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate
preexisting diabetes and ketoacidosis. Additionally, beta-agonists, including
albuterol, when given intravenously may cause a decrease in serum potassium,
possibly through intracellular shunting. The relevance of this observation to
the use of Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol is unknown, since the aerosol dose is
much lower than the doses given intravenously.  
 <P></P>
Although there have been no reports concerning the use of Albuterol Inhalation
Aerosol during labor and delivery, it has been reported that high doses of
albuterol administered intravenously inhibit uterine contractions. Although
this effect is extremely unlikely as a consequence of aerosol use, it should be 
kept in mind.  <P></P>
 
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: The action of Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol may last
up to six hours and therefore it should not be used more frequently than
recommended. Increasing the number or frequency of doses without consulting
your physician can be dangerous. If recommended dosage does not provide relief
of symptoms or symptoms become worse, seek immediate medical attention. While
taking Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol, other inhaled medicines should not be used 
unless prescribed.  <P></P>
 
See Illustrated Patient Instructions For Use.  
 <P></P>
DRUG INTERACTIONS: Other sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be
used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be
administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid
deleterious cardiovascular effects.  <P></P>
 
Albuterol should be administered with caution to patients being treated with
monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of
albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.  <P></P>
 
Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other. 
 <P></P>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: In a 2 year study in
the rat, albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose-related increase in the
incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at doses corresponding to 111, 
555, and 2,800 times the maximum human inhalational dose. In another study this 
effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol. The relevance of
these findings to humans is not known. An 18-month study in mice revealed no
evidence of tumorigenicity. Studies with albuterol revealed no evidence of
mutagenesis. Reproduction studies in rats revealed no evidence of impaired
fertility.  <P></P>
 
TERATOGENIC EFFECTS -- PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Albuterol has been shown to be
teratogenic in mice when given in doses corresponding to 14 times the human
dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 
Albuterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. A reproduction study in CD-1 mice
with albuterol (0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg/kg, corresponding to 1.4, 14, and 140
times the maximum human inhalational dose) showed cleft palate formation in 5
of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5
mg/kg. None were observed at 0.025 mg/kg. Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of
72 (30.5%) fetuses treated with 2.5 mg/kg isoproterenol (positive control). A
reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19
(37%) fetuses at 50 mg/kg, corresponding to 2,800 times the maximum human
inhalational dose of albuterol. During marketing, various congenital anomalies, 
including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of 
patients being treated with albuterol.  Some of the mothers were taking
multiple medications during their pregnancies.  Because no consistent pattern
of defects can be discerned, a relationship between albuterol use and
congenital anomalies cannot be established.  <P></P>
 
NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. 
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in animal
studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the
mother.  <P></P>
 
PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years
have not been established.  
 <P></P>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
Other sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly
with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any
route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular
effects.  
 <P></P>
Albuterol should be administered with caution to patients being treated with
monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of
albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.  <P></P>
 
Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other. 
 <P></P>
(See Also PRECAUTIONS) 
 <P></P>
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <P></P>
The adverse reactions of albuterol are similar in nature to those of other
sympathomimetic agents, although the incidence of certain cardiovascular
effects is less with albuterol. A 13-week double-blind study compared albuterol 
and isoproterenol aerosols in 147 asthmatic patients. The results of this study 
showed that the incidence of cardiovascular effects was: palpitations, less
than 10 per 100 with albuterol and less than 15 per 100 with isoproterenol;
tachycardia, 10 per 100 with both albuterol and isoproterenol; and increased
blood pressure, less than 5 per 100 with both albuterol and isoproterenol. In
the same study, both drugs caused tremor or nausea in less than 15 patients per 
100; dizziness or heartburn in less than 5 per 100 patients. Nervousness
occurred in less than 10 per 100 patients receiving albuterol and in less than
15 per 100 patients receiving isoproterenol.  <P></P>
 
Rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm and oropharyngeal edema 
have been reported after the use of inhaled albuterol.  <P></P>
 
In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse
reactions such as hypertension, angina, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous
system stimulation, insomnia, headache, unusual taste, and drying or irritation 
of the oropharynx.  
 <P></P>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <P></P>
Manifestations of overdosage may include anginal pain, hypertension,
hypokalemia, and exaggeration of the pharmacological effects listed in ADVERSE
REACTIONS.  <P></P>
 
As with all sympathomimetic aerosol medications, cardiac arrest and even death
may be associated with abuse.  <P></P>
 
The oral LD50 in male and female rats and mice was greater than 2,000 mg/kg.
The aerosol LD50 could not be determined.  <P></P>
 
Dialysis is not appropriate treatment for overdosage of Albuterol Inhalation
Aerosol. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker, such as
metoprolol tartrate, is suggested, bearing in mind the danger of inducing an
asthmatic attack.  <P></P>

<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <P></P>
For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic
symptoms, the usual dosage for adults and children 12 years and older is 2
inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours; in some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 
hours may be sufficient. More frequent administration or a larger number of
inhalations is not recommended. For maintenance therapy or prevention of
exacerbation of bronchospasm, 2 inhalations, 4 times a day should be
sufficient.  <P></P>
 
The use of Albuterol Inhalation Aerosol can be continued as medically indicated 
to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During this time most patients gain 
optimal benefit from regular use of the inhaler. Safe usage for periods
extending over several years has been documented.  <P></P>
 
If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief,
medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of
seriously worsening asthma which would require reassessment of therapy.  
 <P></P>
Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm Prevention: The usual dosage for adults and
children 12 years and older is 2 inhalations, 15 minutes prior to exercise.  
 <P></P>
For treatment, see above.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Tramadol hydrochloride is a centrally acting analgesic. The chemical
name for tramadol hydrochloride is (+/- )cis- 2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-1-(3-
methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride. </p>

<p>The molecular weight of tramadol hydrochloride is 299.8. Tramadol hydrochloride
is a white, bitter, crystalline and odorless powder. It is readily soluble
in water and ethanol and has a pKa of 9.41. The water/n-octanol partition
coefficient is 1.35 at pH 7. Tramadol tablets contain 50 mg of tramadol
hydrochloride and are white in color. Inactive ingredients in the tablet
are corn starch, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate,
microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, sodium
starch glycolate, titanium dioxide and wax. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic compound that is
not derived from natural sources nor is it chemically related to opiates.
Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests,
at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding to mu-
opioid receptors and inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.
Tramadol opioid activity derives from low affinity binding of the parent
compound to mu-opioid receptors and higher affinity binding of the M1 metabolite.
In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing
analgesia and 200 times more potent in mu-opioid binding. The contribution
to human analgesia of tramadol relative to M1 is unknown.</p>

<p>Tramadol-induced antinociception is only partially antagonized by the
opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. In addition, tramadol
has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin In Vitro,
as have some other opioid analgesics. These latter mechanisms may contribute
independently to the overall analgesic profile of Tramadol. Onset of analgesia
in humans is evident within one hour after administration and reaches a
peak in approximately two to three hours. Peak plasma concentrations are
reached about two hours after administration, which correlates closely
with the time to peak pain relief. Apart from analgesia, Tramadol administration
may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence,
nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of an opioid.
However, tramadol causes significantly less respiratory depression than
morphine. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause
histamine release. At therapeutic doses, Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride)
has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index.
Orthostatic changes in blood pressure have been observed. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Absorption: </p>

<p>Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral
administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose
is approximately 75%. Oral administration of Tramadol with food does not
significantly affect its rate or extent of absorption. Therefore, Tramadol
can be administered without regard to food. The mean peak (+/- SD) plasma
concentration of racemic tramadol is 308 +/- 78 ng/mL and occurs at approximately
two hours after a single 100 mg oral dose in healthy subjects. At this
dose, the mean peak plasma concentration of the active mono-O-desmethyl
metabolite, racemic M1, is 55 +/- 20 ng/mL and occurs approximately three
hours post-dose. The separate (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of tramadol generally
follow a parallel time course in plasma after a single 100 mg oral dose
of Tramadol. Following 100 mg oral administration of tramadol, the maximum
plasma concentrations of the (-)- enantiomer of tramadol are somewhat lower
than those of the (+)-enantiomer (148 +/- 33 vs. 168 +/- 36 ng/mL, respectively).
The (-)-M1 enantiomer is present at slightly higher plasma concentrations
than the (+)-M1 enantiomer (35 +/-10 vs. 26 +/- 13 ng/mL, respectively).
At steady state following a 100 mg q.i.d. regimen of tramadol, 3 out of
18 subjects formed relatively low amounts of (+)- M1, while their (-)-M1
formation remained similar to that of other subjects. This is believed
not to be clinically significant.</p>

<p>Plasma concentrations of racemic tramadol are predictable over a 50
mg to 100 mg single-dose range. This is also true under multiple-dose conditions.
Steady state is achieved after two days of dosing Tramadol by a 100 mg
q.i.d. regimen (maximum plasma concentration was 592 +/- 177 ng/mL). The
plasma half-life of tramadol, following single and multiple dosing, was
6 and 7 hours, respectively. This increase in half-life upon multiple dosing
is not considered to be clinically significant or to warrant dosage adjustment
for chronic use. </p>

<p>Distribution: </p>

<p>The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2.6 and 2.9 liters/kg in
male and female subjects, respectively following a 100 mg intravenous dose.
The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20% and
binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 mcgm/mL.
Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside
the clinically relevant range. Although not confirmed in humans, tramadol
has been shown in rats to cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>Metabolism: </p>

<p>Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration. Approximately
30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60%
of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either
as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites. The major metabolic pathways
appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in
the liver. Only one metabolite (mono-O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is
pharmacologically active. Production of M1 is dependent on the CYP2D6 isoenzyme
of cytochrome P-450. Elimination: </p>

<p>The mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol
and racemic M1 are 6.3 +/- 1.4 and 7.4 +/- 1.4 hours, respectively. The
plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased from approximately
six hours to seven hours upon multiple dosing. SPECIAL POPULATIONS: </p>

<p>Renal: </p>

<p>Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion
of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine
clearances of less than 30 mL/min, adjustment of the dosing regimen is
recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The total amount of tramadol
and M1 removed during a dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered
dose. </p>

<p>Hepatic: </p>

<p>Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis
of the liver, resulting in a larger area under the serum- concentration-versus-time
curve for tramadol and longer tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13
hrs. for tramadol and 19 hrs. for M1). In cirrhotic patients, adjustment
of the dosing regimen is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Age: </p>

<p>Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations
and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects
less than 65 years of age. In subjects over 75 years, maximum serum concentrations
are slightly elevated (208 vs. 162 ng/mL) and the elimination half-life
is slightly prolonged (7 vs. 6 hours) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years
of age. Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older
than 75 years (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p>Gender: </p>

<p>The absolute bioavailability of tramadol was 73% in males and 79% in
females. The plasma clearance was 6.4 mL/min/kg in males and 5.7 mL/min/kg
in females following a 100 mg IV dose of tramadol. Following a single oral
dose, and after adjusting for body weight, females had a 12% higher peak
tramadol concentration and a 35% higher area under the concentration-time
curve compared to males. This difference may not be of any clinical significance.
</p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) has been given in single oral doses
of 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mg to patients with pain following surgical
procedures (orthopedic, gynecological, cesarean section) and pain following
oral surgery (extraction of impacted molars). </p>

<p>In single-dose models of pain following oral surgery, pain relief was
demonstrated in some patients at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg. A dose of 100
mg Tramadol tended to provide analgesia superior to codeine sulfate 60
mg, but it was not as effective as the combination of aspirin 650 mg with
codeine phosphate 60 mg. In single-dose models of pain following surgical
procedures, 150mg provided analgesia generally comparable to the combination
of acetaminophen 650 mg with propoxyphene napsylate 100 mg, with a tendency
toward later peak effect. Tramadol has been studied in three long-term
controlled trials involving a total of 820 patients, with 530 patients
receiving Tramadol. Patients with chronic conditions such as low back pain,
cancer, neuropathic pain, and orthopedic and joint conditions, entered
a double-blind phase of one to three months. Average daily doses of approximately
250 mg of Tramadol in divided doses produced analgesia comparable with
five doses of acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg (TYLENOL
with Codeine #3) daily, five doses of aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate
30 mg daily, and with two to three doses of acetaminophen 500 mg with oxycodone
hydrochloride 5 mg (TYLOX) daily. Following the double- blind period, some
patients took Tramadol in an open period for up to two years. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Tramadol is indicated for the management of moderate to moderately severe
pain. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Tramadol should not be administered to patients who have previously
demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol or in cases of acute intoxication
with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic
drugs. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SEIZURE RISK </p>

<p>Seizures have been reported in patients receiving Tramadol. A dose relationship
is not apparent. Administration of Tramadol may enhance the seizure risk
in patients taking MAO inhibitors, neuroleptics, other drugs that reduce
the seizure threshold, patients with epilepsy, or patients otherwise at
increased risk for seizure. Tramadol causes seizures in animals. In animal
studies, naloxone administration increased the risk of convulsions. </p>

<p>USE WITH CNS DEPRESSANTS </p>

<p>Tramadol should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered
to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic
agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. </p>

<p>USE WITH MAO INHIBITORS </p>

<p>Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) should be used with great caution
in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits
the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION </p>

<p>When large doses of Tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications
or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Cases of intraoperative
respiratory depression, usually with large intravenous doses of tramadol
and with concurrent administration of respiratory depressants, have been
reported in foreign experience. Such cases should be treated as overdoses
(see OVERDOSAGE). Tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients
at risk for respiratory depression.</p>

<p>INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE OR HEAD TRAUMA </p>

<p>Tramadol should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial
pressure or head injury. Pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure
the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians
should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction
when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving
Tramadol. </p>

<p>ACUTE ABDOMINAL CONDITIONS </p>

<p>The administration of Tramadol may complicate the clinical assessment
of patients with acute abdominal conditions. </p>

<p>PATIENTS PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT ON OPIOIDS </p>

<p>Tramadol is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.
Patients who have recently taken substantial amounts of opioids may experience
withdrawal symptoms. Because of the difficulty in assessing dependence
in patients who have previously received substantial amounts of opioid
medication, caution should be used in the administration of Tramadol to
such patients. </p>

<p>USE IN RENAL AND HEPATIC DISEASE </p>

<p>Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion
of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine
clearances of less than 30 mL/min, dosing reduction is recommended (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis
of the liver. In cirrhotic patients, dosing reduction is recommended (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>With the prolonged half-life in these conditions, achievement of steady
state is delayed, so that it may take several days for elevated plasma
concentrations to develop. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients being treated with Tramadol should receive the following information:
</p>

<p>Tramadol may impair mental or physical abilities required for the performance
of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since
observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher
than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of
selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals. Concomitant administration
of Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) with CARBAMAZEPINE causes a significant
increase in tramadol metabolism, presumably through metabolic induction
by carbamazepine. Patients receiving chronic carbamazepine doses of up
to 800 mg daily may require up to twice the recommended dose of Tramadol.
</p>

<p>Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by the CYP2D6 P-450 isoenzyme. QUINIDINE
is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme; so that concomitant administration
of quinidine and Tramadol results in increased concentrations of tramadol
and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of this effect
have not been fully investigated, and the effect of quinidine concentrations
is unknown. Concomitant administration of Tramadol with CIMETIDINE does
not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics.
Therefore, no alteration of the Tramadol dosage regimen is recommended.
Interactions with MAO INHIBITORS, due to interference with detoxification
mechanisms, have been reported for some centrally acting drugs (see WARNINGS).
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames Salmonella
microsomal activation test, CHO/HPRT mammalian cell assay, mouse lymphoma
assay (in the absence of metabolic activation), dominant lethal mutation
tests in mice, chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamsters, and bone
marrow micronucleus tests in mice and Chinese hamsters. Weakly mutagenic
results occurred in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma
assay and micronucleus test in rats. Overall, the weight of evidence from
these tests indicates that tramadol does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans.
</p>

<p>A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine
tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in a mouse carcinogenicity
study, particularly in aged mice (dosing orally up to 30 mg/kg for approximately
two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose).
This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No such finding
occurred in a rat carcinogenicity study. </p>

<p>No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels
up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 75 mg/kg in female rats. </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: USAGE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C </p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, rats
and rabbits at maternally toxic doses 3 to 15 times the maximum human dose
or higher (120 mg/kg in mice, 25 mg/kg or higher in rats and 75 mg/kg or
higher in rabbits), but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. No harm
to the fetus due to tramadol was seen at doses that were not maternally
toxic. No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of
mice, rats or rabbits treated with tramadol by various routes (up to 140
mg/kg for mice, 80 mg/kg for rats or 300 mg/kg for rabbits). Embryo and
fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal
ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose
levels. Transient delays in development or behavioral parameters were also
seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality
were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg, a dose that would
cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit.</p>

<p>In peri- and post-natal studies in rats, progeny of dams receiving oral
(gavage) dose levels of 50mg/kg or greater had decreased weights, and pup
survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (6 to 10 times the
maximum human dose). </p>

<p>No toxicity was observed for progeny of dams receiving 8, 10, 20, 25
or 40 mg/kg. Maternal toxicity was observed at all dose levels, but effects
of progeny were evident only at higher dose levels where maternal toxicity
was more severe. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) should not be used in pregnant women
prior to or during labor unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks,
because safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been
shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical
veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during
labor. </p>

<p>The effect of Tramadol, if any, on the later growth, development, and
functional maturation of the child is unknown. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Tramadol is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication
or for post- delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in
infants and newborns has not been studied. Following a single IV 100 mg
dose of tramadol, the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours
postdose was 100 mcgm of tramadol (0.1% of the maternal dose) and 27 mcgm
of M1. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>The pediatric use of Tramadol is not recommended because safety and
efficacy in patients under 16 years of age have not been established. </p>

<p>USE IN THE ELDERLY </p>

<p>In subjects over the age of 75 years, serum concentrations are slightly
elevated and the elimination half-life is slightly prolonged. The aged
also can be expected to vary more widely in their ability to tolerate adverse
drug effects. Daily doses in excess of 300 mg are not recommended in patients
over 75 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since
observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher
than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of
selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) with
CARBAMAZEPINE causes a significant increase in tramadol metabolism, presumably
through metabolic induction by carbamazepine. Patients receiving chronic
carbamazepine doses of up to 800 mg daily may require up to twice the recommended
dose of Tramadol. </p>

<p>Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by the CYP2D6 P-450 isoenzyme. QUINIDINE
is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme; so that concomitant administration
of quinidine and Tramadol results in increased concentrations of tramadol
and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of this effect
have not been fully investigated, and the effect of quinidine concentrations
is unknown. Concomitant administration of Tramadol with CIMETIDINE does
not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics.
Therefore, no alteration of the Tramadol dosage regimen is recommended.
</p>

<p>Interactions with MAO INHIBITORS, due to interference with detoxification
mechanisms, have been reported for some centrally acting drugs (see WARNINGS).
(See Also PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Tramadol was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or
open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain.
Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 1 reports the
cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for
the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently
reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal
system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably
related to Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) administration, the reported
rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease
or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences
in these trials were similar for Tramadol and the active control groups,
TYLENOL with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30
mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg. </p>

<p>OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS, CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP UNDETERMINED: A variety
of other adverse events were reported infrequently in patients taking tramadol
during clinical trials. A causal relationship between Tramadol and these
events has not been determined. However, the most significant events are
listed below as alerting information to the physician. </p>

<p>BODY AS A WHOLE: Suicidal tendency. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR: Abnormal ECG, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, palpitations.
</p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Migraine. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis.
</p>

<p>LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES: Creatinine increase, elevated liver enzymes,
hemoglobin decrease, proteinuria. </p>

<p>SENSORY: Cataracts, deafness, tinnitus. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: </p>

<p>Although tramadol can produce drug dependence of the mu-opioid type
(like codeine or dextropropoxyphene) and potentially may be abused, there
has been little evidence of abuse in foreign clinical experience. In clinical
trials, tramadol produced effects similar to an opioid, and at supratherapeutic
doses was recognized as an opioid in subjective/behavioral studies. Tolerance
development has been reported to be relatively mild and withdrawal, when
present, is not considered to be as severe as that produced by other opioids.
Part of tramadol's activity is believed derived from its active metabolite,
which is responsible for some delay in onset of activity and some extension
of the duration of mu-opioid activity. Delayed mu- opioid activity is believed
to reduce a drug's abuse liability. </p>

<p>An assay for tramadol is not included in routine urine screens for drugs
of abuse. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Few cases of overdose with tramadol have been reported. Estimates of
ingested dose in foreign fatalities have been in the range of 3 to 5 g.
A 3 g intentional overdose in a patient in the clinical studies produced
emesis and no sequelae. </p>

<p>The lowest dose reported to be associated with fatality was possibly
between 500 and 1000 mg in a 40 kg woman, but details of the case are not
completely known. </p>

<p>Serious potential consequences of overdosage are respiratory depression
and seizure. Naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by
overdosage with Tramadol, so that general supportive treatment is recommended.
Primary attention should be given to the assurance of adequate respiratory
exchange. </p>

<p>Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful because it removes only a
small percentage of the administered dose. Convulsions occurring in mice
following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol could be suppressed
with barbiturates or benzodiazepines, but were increased with naloxone.
Naloxone did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. </p>

<p>For the treatment of painful conditions, Tramadol 50 mg to 100 mg can
be administered as needed for relief every four to six hours, not to exceed
400mg per day. For moderate pain, Tramadol 50 mg may be adequate as the
initial dose, and for more severe pain, Tramadol 100 mg is usually more
effective as the initial dose. </p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSE </p>

<p>Available data do not suggest that a dosage adjustment is necessary
in elderly patients 65 to 75 years of age unless they also have renal or
hepatic impairment. For elderly patients OVER 75 YEARS OLD, not more than
300 mg/day in divided doses as above is recommended. In all patients with
CREATININE CLEARANCE LESS THAN 30 ML/MIN, it is recommended that the dosing
interval of Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride) be increased to 12 hours,

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Glyburide is an oral blood-glucose-lowering drug of the
sulfonylurea class. Chemically, Glyburide is identified as 
1-( (p-(2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl) phenyl) -sulfonyl) -3-cyclohexylurea.  
 <p>
The molecular weight is 493.99. The aqueous solubility of Glyburide increases
with pH as a result of salt formation.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Glyburide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the
release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta 
cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which Glyburide lowers blood
glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.  
 <p>
With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose
lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory
response to the drug. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism
of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.  
 <p>
In addition to its blood glucose lowering actions, Glyburide produces a mild
diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance. Clinical experience to
date indicates an extremely low incidence of disulfiram-like reactions in
patients while taking Glyburide.  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS 
 <p>
Single-dose studies with Glyburide in normal subjects demonstrate significant
absorption within one hour, peak drug levels at about four hours, and low but
detectable levels at twenty-four hours. Mean serum levels of glyburide, as
reflected by areas under the serum concentration-time curve, increase in
proportion to corresponding increases in dose. Multiple-dose studies with
Glyburide in diabetic patients demonstrate drug level concentration-time
curves similar to single-dose studies, indicating no build-up of drug in tissue 
depots.  The decrease of glyburide in the serum of normal healthy individuals
is biphasic, the terminal half-life being about 10 hours. In single-dose
studies in fasting normal subjects, the degree and duration of blood glucose
lowering is proportional to the dose administered and to the area under the
drug level concentration-time curve. The blood glucose lowering effect persists 
for 24 hours following single morning doses in non-fasting diabetic patients.
Under conditions of repeated administration in diabetic patients, however,
there is no reliable correlation between blood drug levels and fasting blood
glucose levels.  A one-year study of diabetic patients treated with Glyburide
showed no reliable correlation between administered dose and serum drug level.  
 <p>
The major metabolite of Glyburide is the 4-trans-hydroxy derivative. A second
metabolite, the 3-cis-hydroxy derivative, also occurs. These metabolites
contribute no significant hypoglycemic action since they are only weakly active 
(1/400th and 1/40th, respectively, as glyburide) in rabbits.  
 <p>
Glyburide is excreted as metabolites in the bile and urine, approximately 50%
by each route. This dual excretory pathway is qualitatively different from that 
of other sulfonylureas, which are excreted primarily in the urine.  
 <p>
Sulfonylurea drugs are extensively bound to serum proteins. Displacement from
protein binding sites by other drugs may lead to enhanced hypoglycemic action.  
In Vitro, the protein binding exhibited by Glyburide is predominantly non-
ionic, whereas that of other sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolbutamide,
tolazamide) is predominantly ionic. Acidic drugs such as phenylbutazone,
warfarin, and salicylates displace the ionic-binding sulfonylureas from serum
proteins to a far greater extent than the non-ionic binding Glyburide. It has
not been shown that this difference in protein binding will result in fewer
drug-drug interactions with Glyburide in clinical use.  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Glyburide is indicated as an adjunct to diet to lower the blood glucose in
patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II) whose
hyperglycemia cannot be controlled by diet alone.  
 <p>
In initiating treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes, diet should be
emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and weight
loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary management
alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of
hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity should also be
stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective
measures taken where possible.  
 <p>
If this treatment program fails to reduce symptoms and/or blood glucose, the
use of an oral sulfonylurea or insulin should be considered. Use of Glyburide
must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to
diet, and not as a substitute for diet or as a convenient mechanism for
avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet
alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of
Glyburide.  
 <p>
During maintenance programs, Glyburide should be discontinued if satisfactory
lowering of blood glucose is no longer achieved. Judgments should be based on
regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.  
                             <p>
In considering the use of Glyburide in asymptomatic patients, it should be
recognized that controlling the blood glucose in non-insulin dependent diabetes 
has not been definitely established to be effective in preventing the long-term 
cardiovascular or neural complications of diabetes.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Glyburide is contraindicated in patients with:  
 <p>
1. Known hypersensitivity to the drug.  
 <p>
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should be
treated with insulin.  
 <p>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <p>
SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED 
 <p>
RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY 
 <p>
THE ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AS COMPARED TO TREATMENT
WITH DIET ALONE OR DIET PLUS INSULIN. THIS WARNING IS BASED ON THE STUDY
CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY GROUP DIABETES PROGRAM (UGDP), A LONG-TERM
PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLUCOSE
LOWERING DRUGS IN PREVENTING OR DELAYING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS
WITH NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES. THE STUDY INVOLVED 823 PATIENTS WHO WERE
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS (DIABETES, 19 (supp. 2): 747
830, 1970).  
 <p>
UGDP REPORTED THAT PATIENTS TREATED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS WITH DIET PLUS A FIXED
DOSE OF TOLBUTAMIDE (1.5 GRAMS PER DAY) HAD A RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY
APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 TIMES THAT OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH DIET ALONE. A
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TOTAL MORTALITY WAS NOT OBSERVED, BUT THE USE OF
TOLBUTAMIDE WAS DISCONTINUED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, 
THUS LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDY TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OVERALL
MORTALITY. DESPITE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS,
THE FINDINGS OF THE UGDP STUDY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE BASIS FOR THIS WARNING. THE
PATIENT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND ADVANTAGES OF Glyburide
AND OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY.  
 <p>
ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE DRUG IN THE SULFONYLUREA CLASS (TOLBUTAMIDE) WAS INCLUDED IN
THIS STUDY, IT IS PRUDENT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT TO CONSIDER THAT THIS
WARNING MAY ALSO APPLY TO OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS IN THIS CLASS, IN VIEW
OF THEIR CLOSE SIMILARITIES IN MODE OF ACTION AND CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe
hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important
to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause
elevated blood levels of Glyburide and the latter may also diminish
gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic 
reactions. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with
adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the
hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to 
recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking 
drugs.  Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient,
after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than 
one glucose-lowering drug is used. Loss of control of blood glucose: When a
patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever,
trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it
may be necessary to discontinue Glyburide and administer insulin.  
 <p>
The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including Glyburide, in
lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a
period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes 
or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as
secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is
ineffective in an individual patient when first given.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 
 <p>
Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of Glyburide 
and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the
importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, 
and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.  
 <p>
The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that
predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible
family members. Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.  
 <p>
LABORATORY TESTS 
 <p>
Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically. Measurement of
glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.  
 <p>
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs
including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly 
protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenacid,
coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glyburide, the patient 
should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from 
a patient receiving Glyburide, the patient should be observed closely for loss 
of control.  
 <p>
A possible interaction between glyburide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics has
been reported resulting in a potentiating of the hypoglycemic action
glyburide. The mechanism for this interaction is not known.  
 <p>
Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control. 
These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids,
phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin,
nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and
isoniazid.  When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glyburide, 
the patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs are 
withdrawn from a patient receiving Glyburide, the patient should be observed
closely for hypoglycemia.  
 <p>
A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents
leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also 
occurs with the intravenous, topical or vaginal preparations of miconazole is
not known.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
Glyburide (glyburide) is non-mutagenic when studied in the Salmonella
microsome test (Ames test) and in the DNA damage/alkaline elution assay.
Studies in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day for 18 months showed no
carcinogenic effects.  
 <p>
No drug related effects were noted in any of the criteria evaluated in the two
year oncogenicity study of glyburide in mice.  
 <p>
PREGNANCY 
 <p>
TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B 
 <p>
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 
times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or
harm to the fetus due to Glyburide. There are, however, no adequate and well
controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are
not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during
pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because recent information suggests that
abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher
incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be
used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as
possible.  
 <p>
NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS 
 <p>
Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born 
to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery. This 
had been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-
lives. If Glyburide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at
least two weeks before the expected delivery date.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS <p>
Although it is not known whether Glyburide is excreted in human milk, some
sulfonylureas are known to be excreted in human milk. Because the potential for 
hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue administering the drug, taking into
account the importance of the drug to the mother. If Glyburide is discontinued 
and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy
should be considered.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.  
 <p>

(See Also PRECAUTIONS) <p>
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
HYPOGLYCEMIA: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE Sections.  
 <p>
GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS: Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur
rarely; Glyburide should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function
abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations, have been reported.
Gastrointestinal disturbances, e.g., nausea, epigastric fullness, and heartburn 
are the most common reactions and occur in 1.8% of treated patients. They tend
to be dose- related and may disappear when dosage is reduced.  
 <p>
DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema,
urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occur in 1.5% of
treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued
use of Glyburide; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued.  
 <p>
Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with
sulfonylureas.  
 <p>
HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONS: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic 
anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with
sulfonylureas.  
 <p>
METABOLIC REACTIONS: Hepatic porphyria reactions have been reported with
sulfonylureas; however, these have not been reported with Glyburide. 
Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely with Glyburide. Cases 
of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas,
most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions
known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been
reported with certain other sulfonylureas, and it has been suggested that these 
sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or
increase release of ADH.  
 <p>
OTHER REACTIONS: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been
reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be
related to fluctuation in glucose levels.  
 <p>
In addition to dermatologic reactions, allergic reactions such as angioedema,
arthralgia, myalgia and vasculitis have been reported.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including Glyburide, can produce hypoglycemia. 
Mild hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings 
should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage 
and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is
assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with
coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but
constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If
hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a
rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should 
be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at 
a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/mL.
Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since
hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b>                             <p>
There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with
Glyburide or any other hypoglycemic agent. In addition to the usual monitoring 
of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored
periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect 
primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum
recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of
adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of
effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in
monitoring the patient's response to therapy.  
 <p>
Short-term administration of Glyburide may be sufficient during periods of
transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.  
 <p>
1. USUAL STARTING DOSE 
 <p>
The usual starting dose of Glyburide as initial therapy is 2.5-5 mg daily,
administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients who may be
more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1.25 mg daily. (See
PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) Failure to follow an
appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not
adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit
unsatisfactory response to therapy.  
 <p>
Transfer of patients from other oral antidiabetic regimens to Glyburide should 
be done conservatively and the initial daily dose should be 2.5 to 5 mg. When
transferring patients from oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide
to Glyburide, no transition period and no initial or priming dose is
necessary.  When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, particular care
should be exercised during the first two weeks because the prolonged retention
of chlorpropamide in the body and subsequent overlapping drug effects may
provoke hypoglycemia.  
 <p>
Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that Glynase PresTab Tablets 3
mg are not bioequivalent to Glyburide Tablets 5 mg. Therefore, these products
are not substitutable and patients should be refiltrated if transferred.  
 <p>
Some Type II diabetic patients being treated with insulin may respond
satisfactorily to Glyburide. If the insulin dose is less than 20 units daily,
substitution of Glyburide 2.5 to 5 mg as a single daily dose may be tried. If
the insulin dose is between 20 and 40 units daily, the patient may be placed
directly on Glyburide 5 mg daily as a single dose. If the insulin dose is more 
than 40 units daily, a transition period is required for conversion to
Glyburide. In these patients, insulin dosage is decreased by 50% and
Glyburide 5 mg daily is started. Please refer to Usual Maintenance Dose for
further explanation.  <p>
 
2. USUAL MAINTENANCE DOSE 
 <p>
The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 1.25 to 20 mg daily, which may be 
given as a single dose or in divided doses (See Dosage Interval Section).
Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2.5 mg at weekly
intervals based upon the patient's blood glucose response.  
 <p>
No exact dosage relationship exists between Glyburide and the other oral
hypoglycemic agents. Although patients may be transferred from the maximum dose 
of other sulfonylureas, the maximum starting dose of 5 mg of Glyburide should
be observed. A maintenance dose of 5 mg Glyburide provides approximately the
same degree of blood glucose control as 250 to 375 mg chlorpropamide, 250 to
375 mg tolazamide, 500 to 750 mg acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg tolbutamide. 
 <p>
When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily, they
may be started on a daily dose of Glyburide 5 mg concomitantly with a 50%
reduction in insulin dose. Progressive withdrawal of insulin and increase of
Glyburide in increments of 1.25 to 2.5 mg every 2 to 10 days is then carried
out. During this conversion period when both insulin and Glyburide are being
used, hypoglycemia may rarely occur. During insulin withdrawal, patients should 
test their urine for glucose and acetone at least three times daily and report
results to their physician. The appearance of persistent acetonuria with
glycosuria indicates that the patient is a Type I diabetic who requires insulin 
therapy.  
 <p>
3. MAXIMUM DOSE 
 <p>
Daily doses of more than 20 mg are not recommended.  
 <p>
4. DOSAGE INTERVAL 
 <p>
Once-a-day therapy is usually satisfactory, based upon usual meal patterns and
a 10 hour half-life of Glyburide. Some patients, particularly those receiving
more than 10 mg daily, may have a more satisfactory response with twice-a-day
dosage.  
 <p>
In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with
impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should
be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. (See PRECAUTIONS Section.)

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Loratadine is a white to off-white powder, not soluble in water, but
very soluble in acetone, alcohol, and chloroform. Loratadine has a molecular
weight of 382.89 and empirical formula of C22H23ClN2O2; the chemical name,
ethyl 4-(8- chloro-5,6-dihydro-11H- benzo(5,6)cyclohepta(1,2-B)pyridin-11-ylidene)-1-
piperidinecarboxylate.</p>

<p> Pseudoephedrine sulfate is the synthetic salt of one of the naturally
occurring dextrorotatory diastereomers of ephedrine and is classified as
an indirect sympathomimetic amine. The empirical formula for pseudoephedrine
sulfate is (C10H15NO)2.H2SO4; the chemical name is (S- (R*,R*))-alpha-(1(methylamino)ethyl)
benzenemethanol sulfate (2:1) (salt).</p>

<p> The molecular weight of pseudoephedrine sulfate is 428.54. It is a
white powder, freely soluble in water and methanol and sparingly soluble
in chloroform.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The following information is based upon studies of loratadine alone
or pseudoephedrine alone, except as indicated. Loratadine is a long-acting
tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral histamine H1-receptor
antagonistic activity.</p>

<p> Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated oral
doses of loratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic
effect beginning within 1 to 3 hours, reaching a maximum at 8 to 12 hours
and lasting in excess of 24 hours. There was no evidence of tolerance to
this effect developing after 28 days of dosing with loratadine.</p>

<p> Pharmacokinetic studies following single and multiple oral doses of
loratadine in 115 volunteers showed that loratadine is rapidly absorbed
and extensively metabolized to an active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine).
Approximately 80% of the total dose administered can be found equally distributed
between urine and feces in the form of metabolic products after 10 days.
The mean elimination half-lives found in studies in normal adult subjects
(n=54) were 8.4 hours (range = 3 to 20 hours) for loratadine and 28 hours
(range = 8.8 to 92 hours) for the major active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine).
In nearly all patients, exposure (AUC) to the metabolite is greater than
exposure to parent loratadine. Loratadine and descarboethoxyloratadine
reached steady-state in most patients by approximately the fifth dosing
day. The pharmacokinetics of loratadine and descarboethoxyloratadine are
dose independent over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg and are not significantly
altered by the duration of treatment. In Vitro studies with human liver
microsomes indicate that loratadine is metabolized to descarboethoxyloratadine
predominantly by P450 CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by P450 CYP2D6. In
the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, loratadine is metabolized
to descarboethoxyloratadine predominantly by CYP2D6. Concurrent administration
of loratadine with either ketoconazole, erythromycin (both CYP3A4 inhibitors),
or cimetidine (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) to healthy volunteers was associated
with significantly increased plasma concentrations of loratadine (see DRUG
INTERACTIONS section). </p>

<p>In a study involving twelve healthy geriatric subjects (66 to 78 years
old), the AUC and peak plasma levels (Cmax) of both loratadine and descarboethoxyloratadine
were significantly higher (approximately 50% increased) than in studies
of younger subjects. The mean elimination half-lives for the elderly subjects
were 18.2 hours (range = 6.7 to 37 hours) for loratadine and 17.5 hours
(range = 11 to 38 hours) for the active metabolite.</p>

<p> In the clinical efficacy studies, loratadine was administered before
meals. In a single-dose study, food increased the AUC of loratadine by
approximately 40% and of descarboethoxyloratadine by approximately 15%.
The time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of loratadine and descarboethoxyloratadine
was delayed by 1 hour with a meal. Although these differences would not
be expected to be clinically important, loratadine should be administered
on an empty stomach. In patients with chronic renal impairment (creatinine
clearance &lt; or = 30 mL/min) both the AUC and peak plasma levels (Cmax)
increased on average by approximately 73% for loratadine; and approximately
by 120% for descarboethoxyloratadine, compared to individuals with normal
renal function. The mean elimination half- lives of loratadine (7.6 hours)
and descarboethoxyloratadine (23.9 hours) were not significantly different
from that observed in normal subjects. Hemodialysis does not have an effect
on the pharmacokinetics of loratadine or its active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine)
in subjects with chronic renal impairment. In patients with chronic alcoholic
liver disease the AUC and peak plasma levels (Cmax) of loratadine were
double while the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite (descarboethoxyloratadine)
was not significantly changed from that in normals. The elimination half-lives
for loratadine and descarboethoxyloratadine were 24 hours and 37 hours,
respectively, and increased with increasing severity of liver disease.</p>

<p> There was considerable variability in the pharmacokinetic data in all
studies of loratadine, probably due to the extensive first- pass metabolism.
Individual histograms of area under the curve, clearance, and volume of
distribution showed a log normal distribution with a 25-fold range in distribution
in healthy subjects.</p>

<p> Loratadine is about 97% bound to plasma proteins at the expected concentrations
(2.5 to 100 ng/mL) after a therapeutic dose. Loratadine does not affect
the plasma protein binding of warfarin and digoxin. The metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine
is 73% to 77% bound to plasma proteins (at 0.5 to 100 ng/mL).</p>

<p> Whole body autoradiographic studies in rats and monkeys, radiolabeled
tissue distribution studies in mice and rats, and In Vivo radioligand studies
in mice have shown that neither loratadine nor its metabolites readily
cross the blood- brain barrier. Radioligand binding studies with guinea
pig pulmonary and brain H1-receptors indicate that there was preferential
binding to peripheral versus central nervous system H1-receptors.</p>

<p> In a study in which loratadine alone was administered at four times
the clinical dose for 90 days, no clinically significant increase in the
QTc was seen on ECGs.</p>

<p> Pseudoephedrine sulfate (d-isoephedrine sulfate) is an orally active
sympathomimetic amine which exerts a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa.
It is recognized as an effective agent for the relief of nasal congestion
due to allergic rhinitis. Pseudoephedrine produces peripheral effects similar
to those of ephedrine and central effects similar to, but less intense
than, amphetamines. It has the potential for excitatory side effects.</p>

<p> The pseudoephedrine component of Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended
release) Tablets was absorbed at a similar rate and was equally available
from the combination tablet as from a pseudoephedrine sulfate repetabs
120 mg tablet. Mean (%CV) steady-state peak plasma concentration of 464
ng/mL (22) was attained at 3.9 hours (50). The terminal half-life of pseudoephedrine
from the combination tablet administered twice daily was 6.3 hours (23).
The ingestion of food was found not to affect the absorption of pseudoephedrine
from Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets. Loratadine
and pseudoephedrine sulfate do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each
other when administered concomitantly.</p>

<p> CLINICAL STUDIES: Clinical trials of Loratadine with pseudoephedrine
(extended release) Tablets in seasonal allergic rhinitis involved approximately
3700 patients who received either the combination product, a comparative
treatment, or placebo, in double-blind, randomized controlled studies.
Four of the largest studies involved approximately 1600 patients in comparisons
of the combination product, loratadine (5 mg bid), pseudoephedrine sulfate
(120 mg bid), and placebo. Improvement in symptoms of seasonal allergic
rhinitis for patients receiving Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended
release) Tablets was significantly greater than the improvement in those
patients who received the individual components or placebo. The combination
reduced the intensity of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and eye
tearing more than pseudoephedrine and reduced the intensity of nasal congestion
more than loratadine, demonstrating a contribution of each of the components.
The onset of antihistamine and nasal decongestant actions occurred after
the first dose of Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets.
Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets were well tolerated,
with a frequency of sedation similar to that seen with placebo, and an
adverse event profile clinically similar to that of pseudoephedrine.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b> INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets are indicated
for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Loratadine with
pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets should be administered when
both the antihistaminic properties of Loratadine and the nasal decongestant
activity of pseudoephedrine are desired (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b> CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets are contraindicated
in patients who are hypersensitive to this medication or to any of its
ingredients.</p>

<p> This product, due to its pseudoephedrine component, is contraindicated
in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention, and in patients
receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen
(14) days of stopping such treatment (see DRUG INTERACTIONS section). It
is also contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary
artery disease, and in those who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy
to its components, to adrenergic agents, or to other drugs of similar chemical
structures. Manifestations of patient idiosyncrasy to adrenergic agents
include: insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets should be
used with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic
heart disease, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, renal impairment,
or prostatic hypertrophy. Central nervous system stimulation with convulsions
or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension may be produced
by sympathomimetic amines.</p>

<p> Use in Patients Approximately 60 years and Older: The safety and efficacy
of Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets in patients
greater than 60 years old have not been investigated in placebo-controlled
clinical trials. The elderly are more likely to have adverse reactions
to sympathomimetic amines.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b> PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot
be individually titrated and hepatic insufficiency results in a reduced
clearance of loratadine to a much greater extent than pseudoephedrine,
Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets should generally
be avoided in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Patients with renal
insufficiency (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min) should be given a lower initial dose
(one tablet per day) because they have reduced clearance of loratadine
and pseudoephedrine.</p>

<p> INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients taking Loratadine with pseudoephedrine
(extended release) Tablets should receive the following information: Loratadine
with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets are prescribed for the
relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients should be instructed
to take Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets only
as prescribed and not to exceed the prescribed dose.</p>

<p> Patients should also be advised against the concurrent use of Loratadine
with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets with over-the-counter antihistamines
and decongestants.</p>

<p> This product should not be used by patients who are hypersensitive
to it or to any of its ingredients. Due to its pseudoephedrine component,
this product should not be used by patients with narrow-angle glaucoma,
urinary retention, or by patients receiving a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor
or within 14 days of stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. It also should not
be used by patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery
disease.</p>

<p> Patients who are or may become pregnant should be told that this product
should be used in pregnancy or during lactation only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus or nursing infant.</p>

<p> Patients should be instructed not to break or chew the tablet.</p>

<p> DRUG INTERACTIONS: No specific interaction studies have been conducted
with Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets. However,
loratadine (10 mg once daily) has been safely coadministered with therapeutic
doses of erythromycin, cimetidine, and ketoconazole in controlled clinical
pharmacology studies. Although increased plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24
hrs) of loratadine and/or descarboethoxyloratadine were observed following
coadministration of loratadine with each of these drugs in normal volunteers
(n=24 in each study), there were no clinically relevant changes in the
safety profile of loratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters,
clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events. There were
no significant effects on QTc intervals, and no reports of sedation or
syncope. No effects on plasma concentrations of cimetidine or ketoconazole
were observed. Plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of erythromycin decreased
15% with coadministration of loratadine relative to that observed with
erythromycin alone. The clinical relevance of this difference is unknown.
These above findings are summarized in the following table:</p>

(200 mg Q12h)
</pre>

<p>There does not appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects
who received oral contraceptives and loratadine.</p>

<p> Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets (pseudoephedrine
component) are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors
and for 2 weeks after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. The antihypertensive
effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine,
and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics. Increased ectopic
pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly
with digitalis.</p>

<p> DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: The In Vitro addition of pseudoephedrine
to sera containing the cardiac isoenzyme MB of serum creatinine phosphokinase
progressively inhibits the activity of the enzyme. The inhibition becomes
complete over 6 hours.</p>

<p> CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: There are no
animal or laboratory studies on the combination product loratadine and
pseudoephedrine sulfate to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment
of fertility. In an 18-month oncogenicity study in mice and a 2-year study
in rats loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 40 mg/kg
(mice) and 25mg/kg (rats). In the carcinogenicity studies pharmacokinetic
assessments were carried out to determine animal exposure to the drug.
AUC data demonstrated that the exposure of mice given 40 mg/kg of loratadine
was 3.6 and 18 (active metabolite) times higher than a human given 10 mg/day.
Exposure of rats given 25 mg/kg of loratadine was 28 and 67 (active metabolite)
times higher than a human given 10 mg/day. Male mice given 40 mg/kg had
a significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas
and carcinomas) than concurrent controls. In rats, a significantly higher
incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was
observed in males given 10 mg/kg and males and females given 25 mg/kg.
The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of loratadine
is not known. In mutagenicity studies with loratadine alone, there was
no evidence of mutagenic potential in reverse (Ames) or forward point mutation
(CHO- HGPRT) assays, or in the assay for DNA damage (Rat Primary Hepatocyte
Unscheduled DNA Assay) or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (Human
Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Clastogenesis Assay and the Mouse Bone Marrow
Erythrocyte Micronucleus Assay). In the Mouse Lymphoma Assay, a positive
finding occurred in the non-activated but not the activated phase of the
study. Loratadine administration produced hepatic microsomal enzyme induction
in the mouse at 40 mg/kg and rat at 25 mg/kg, but not at lower doses. Decreased
fertility in male rats, shown by lower female conception rates, occurred
at approximately 64 mg/kg of loratadine and was reversible with cessation
of dosing. Loratadine had no effect on male or female fertility or reproduction
in the rat at doses approximately 24mg/kg.</p>

<p> PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: There was no evidence of animal teratogenicity
in reproduction studies performed on rats and rabbits with this combination
at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg (885 mg/M(squared) or 5 times the recommended
daily human dosage of 250 mg or 185 mg/M(squared)), and 120 mg/kg (1416
mg/M(squared) or 8 times the recommended daily human dosage), respectively.
There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets
should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<p> NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known if this combination product is excreted
in human milk. However, loratadine when administered alone and its metabolite
descarboethoxyloratadine pass easily into breast milk and achieve concentrations
that are equivalent to plasma levels, with an AUCmilk/AUCplasma ratio of
1.17 and 0.85 for the parent and active metabolite, respectively. Following
a single oral dose of 40 mg, a small amount of loratadine and metabolite
was excreted into the breast milk (approximately 0.03% of 40 mg after 48
hours).</p>

<p> Pseudoephedrine administered alone also distributes into breast milk
of the lactating human female. Pseudoephedrine concentrations in milk are
consistently higher than those in plasma. The total amount of drug in milk
as judged by the area under the curve (AUC) is 2 to 3 times greater than
in plasma. The fraction of a pseudoephedrine dose excreted in milk is estimated
to be 0.4% to 0.7%. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing
or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug
to the mother. Caution should be exercised when Loratadine with pseudoephedrine
(extended release) Tablets are administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<p> PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of
12 years have not been established.</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b> DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>No specific interaction studies have been conducted with Loratadine
with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets.</p>

<p> However, loratadine (10 mg once daily) has been safely coadministered
with therapeutic doses of erythromycin, cimetidine, and ketoconazole in
controlled clinical pharmacology studies. Although increased plasma concentrations
(AUC 0- 24 hrs) of loratadine and/or descarboethoxyloratadine were observed

<p>There does not appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects
who received oral contraceptives and loratadine.</p>

<p> Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) Tablets (pseudoephedrine
component) are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors
and for 2 weeks after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. The antihypertensive
effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine,
and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics. Increased ectopic
pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly
with digitalis.</p>

<p> In addition to those adverse events reported above (&gt;/=2%), the
following less frequent adverse events have been reported in at least one
Loratadine with pseudoephedrine (extended release) treated patient:</p>

<p> The following additional adverse events have been reported with the
use of Loratadine Tablets: alopecia, altered salivation, amnesia, anaphylaxis,
angioneurotic edema, blepharospasm, breast enlargement, breast pain, dermatitis,
dry hair, erythema multiforme, hemoptysis, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis,
jaundice, laryngitis, menorrhagia, nasal dryness, photosensitivity reaction,
purpura, seizures, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and urinary discoloration.
</p>

<p>Pseudoephedrine may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients.
Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia
may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity,
and cardiac arrhythmias have been reported. Sympathomimetic drugs have
also been associated with other untoward effects, such as fear, anxiety,
tenseness, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, pallor, respiratory difficulty,
dysuria, and cardiovascular collapse.</p>

<p> DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:</p>

<p> There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs
with loratadine or the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine.</p>

<p> Pseudoephedrine, like other central nervous system stimulants, has
been abused. At high doses, subjects commonly experience an elevation of
mood, a sense of increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite.
Some individuals become anxious, irritable, and loquacious. In addition
to the marked euphoria, the user experiences a sense of markedly enhanced
physical strength and mental capacity. With continued use, tolerance develops,
the user increases the dose, and toxic signs and symptoms appear. Depression
may follow rapid withdrawal.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b> OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures
should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary.
Treatment of overdosage would reasonably consist of emesis (ipecac syrup),
except in patients with impaired consciousness, followed by the administration
of activated charcoal to absorb any remaining drug. If vomiting is unsuccessful,
or contraindicated, gastric lavage should be performed with normal saline.
Saline cathartics may also be of value for rapid dilution of bowel contents.
Loratadine is not eliminated by hemodialysis. It is not known if loratadine
is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis.</p>

<p> Somnolence, tachycardia, and headache have been reported with doses
of 40 to 180 mg of Loratadine Tablets. In large doses, sympathomimetics
may give rise to giddiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, thirst,
tachycardia, precordial pain, palpitations, difficulty in micturition,
muscular weakness and tenseness, anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Many
patients can present a toxic psychosis with delusions and hallucinations.
Some may develop cardiac arrhythmias, circulatory collapse, convulsions,
coma, and respiratory failure.</p>

<p> The oral LD50 values for the mixture of the two drugs were greater
than 525 and 1839 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. Oral LD50 values
for loratadine were greater than 5000 mg/kg in rats and mice. Doses of
loratadine as high as 10 times the recommended daily clinical dose showed
no effect in rats, mice, and monkeys.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Adults and children 12 years of age and over: one tablet twice a day
(every 12 hours) on an empty stomach. Because the doses of this fixed combination
product cannot be individually titrated and hepatic insufficiency results
in a reduced clearance of loratadine to a much greater extent than pseudoephedrine,
Loratadine with Pseudoephedrine Tablets should generally be avoided in
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Patients with renal insufficiency
(GFR &lt; 30 mL/min) should be given a lower initial dose (one tablet per
day) because they have reduced clearance of loratadine and pseudoephedrine.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Metoprolol, is a selective beta1-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, available
as 50- and 100-mg tablets for oral administration and in 5-ml ampuls for
intravenous administration. Each ampul contains a sterile solution of metoprolol
tartrate USP, 5 mg, and sodium chloride USP, 45 mg. Metoprolol tartrate
is 1-(isopropylamino)-3-(p-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy)-2-propanol (2:1) Dextro-tartrate
salt. </p>

<p>Metoprolol tartrate is a white, practically odorless, crystalline powder
with a molecular weight of 684.82. It is very soluble in water; freely
soluble in methylene chloride, in chloroform, and in alcohol; slightly
soluble in acetone; and insoluble in ether. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Metoprolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. In Vitro and
In Vivo animal studies have shown that it has a preferential effect on
beta1 adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in cardiac muscle. This preferential
effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, Metoprolol also inhibits
beta2 adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.
</p>

<p>Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity
of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac
output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure
upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and
(4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. </p>

<p>Relative beta1 selectivity has been confirmed by the following: (1)
In normal subjects, Metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated
vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of
nonselective (beta1 plus beta2) beta blockers, which completely reverse
the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, Metoprolol
reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta blocker,
propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses. </p>

<p>Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing
activity is detectable only at doses much greater than required for beta
blockade. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported
in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration.
Animal and human experiments indicate that Metoprolol slows the sinus rate
and decreases AV nodal conduction. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical studies, Metoprolol has been shown to be an effective
antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide
type diuretics, at dosages of 100-450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative,
clinical studies, Metoprolol has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive
agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and to be
equally effective in supine and standing positions. </p>

<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents
has not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been
proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially
cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output;
(2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery;
and (3) suppression of renin activity. </p>

<p>By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity
and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, Metoprolol
reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort,
thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris. However,
in patients with heart failure, beta-adrenergic blockade may increase oxygen
requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end-diastolic
pressure. </p>

<p>Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment
of angina and hypertension, there are situations in which sympathetic stimulation
is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular
function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence of AV block,
beta blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating effect of sympathetic
activity on conduction. Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial
constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity
in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous
bronchodilators in such patients. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, Metoprolol, administered two or four
times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing
the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage
used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative,
clinical trial showed that Metoprolol was indistinguishable from propranolol
in the treatment of angina pectoris. </p>

<p>In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical study, Metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36%
in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. </p>

<p>Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their
arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and
their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible
if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or
more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial
treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol
or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance
therapy with Metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After
this double blind period, all patients were given Metoprolol and followed
up to 1 year. </p>

<p>The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy
was 8 hours in both the Metoprolol and placebo treatment groups. Among
patients treated with Metoprolol, there were comparable reductions in 3-month
mortality for those treated early (&lt; or = 8 hours) and those in whom
treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of
ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous
therapy were also observed with Metoprolol and were independent of the
interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy. </p>

<p>The precise mechanism of action of Metoprolol in patients with suspected
or definite myocardial infarction is not known. </p>

<p>In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both
very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while
placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The
study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen
but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from
the benefit of later beta blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall
regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of
an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the
precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very
early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to
administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended
for certain other beta blockers. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>In man, absorption of Metoprolol is rapid and complete. Plasma levels
following oral administration, however, approximate 50% of levels following
intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.
</p>

<p>Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration.
Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.
Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma
half life ranges from approximately 3 to 7 hours. Less than 5% of an oral
dose of Metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted
by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no clinical significance.
The systemic availability and half-life of Metoprolol in patients with
renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those
in normal subjects. Consequently, no reduction in dosage is usually needed
in patients with chronic renal failure. </p>

<p>Significant beta-blocking effect (as measured by reduction of exercise
heart rate) occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration
is dose related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum registered
effect after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5.0,
and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages
of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood
pressure was evident at 12 hours. </p>

<p>Following intravenous administration of Metoprolol, the urinary recovery
of unchanged drug is approximately 10%. When the drug was infused over
a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta blockade was achieved
at approximately 20 minutes. Doses of 5 mg and 15 mg yielded a maximal
reduction in exercise-induced heart rate of approximately 10% and 15%,
respectively. The effect on exercise heart rate decreased linearly with
time at the same rate for both doses, and disappeared at approximately
5 hours and 8 hours for the 5-mg and 15-mg doses, respectively. </p>

<p>Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous
doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. </p>

<p>There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and
reduction of exercise heart rate. However, antihypertensive activity does
not appear to be related to plasma levels. Because of variable plasma levels
attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive
activity to dose, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.
</p>

<p>In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous
followed by oral administration of Metoprolol caused a reduction in heart
rate, systolic blood pressure, and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic
blood pressure, and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.
</p>

<p>In patients with angina pectoris, plasma concentration measured at 1
hour is linearly related to the oral dose within the range of 50 to 400
mg. Exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure are reduced in relation
to the logarithm of the oral dose of metoprolol. The increase in exercise
capacity and the reduction in left ventricular ischemia are also significantly
related to the logarithm of the oral dose. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>Metoprolol tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
They may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
</p>

<p>ANGINA PECTORIS </p>

<p>Metoprolol is indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris.
</p>

<p>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION </p>

<p>Metoprolol ampuls and tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically
stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction
to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment with intravenous Metoprolol
can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS). Alternatively,
treatment can begin within 3 to 10 days of the acute event (see DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION AND ANGINA </p>

<p>Metoprolol is contraindicated in sinus bradycardia, heart block greater
than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure (see WARNINGS).
</p>

<p>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION </p>

<p>Metoprolol is contraindicated in patients with a heart rate &lt;45 beats/min;
second- and third-degree heart block; significant first-degree heart block
(P-R interval &gt;/= 0.24 sec); systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg; or
moderate-to- severe cardiac failure (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION AND ANGINA </p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting
circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries
the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and
precipitating more severe failure. In hypertensive and angina patients
who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics,
Metoprolol should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and Metoprolol
slow AV conduction. </p>

<p>IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF CARDIAC FAILURE: Continued depression
of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can,
in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of
impending cardiac failure, patients should be fully digitalized and/or
given a diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure
continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, Metoprolol
should be withdrawn. </p>

<p>ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE: Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain
beta blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases,
myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered
Metoprolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1-2 weeks and the patient
should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary
insufficiency develops, Metoprolol administration should be reinstated
promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the
management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned
against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's
advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized,
it may be prudent not to discontinue Metoprolol therapy abruptly even in
patients treated only for hypertension. </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES: PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD,
IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVE BETA1 SELECTIVITY,
HOWEVER, Metoprolol MAY BE USED WITH CAUTION IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC
DISEASE WHO DO NOT RESPOND TO, OR CANNOT TOLERATE, OTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE
TREATMENT. SINCE BETA1 SELECTIVITY IS NOT ABSOLUTE, A BETA2-STIMULATING
AGENT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED CONCOMITANTLY, AND THE LOWEST POSSIBLE DOSE
OF Metoprolol SHOULD BE USED. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE PRUDENT
INITIALLY TO ADMINISTER Metoprolol IN SMALLER DOSES THREE TIMES DAILY,
INSTEAD OF LARGER DOSES TWO TIMES DAILY, TO AVOID THE HIGHER PLASMA LEVELS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LONGER DOSING INTERVAL. (SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>MAJOR SURGERY: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta-blocking
therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of
the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks
of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. </p>

<p>Metoprolol, like other beta blockers, is a competitive inhibitor of
beta receptor agonists, and its effects can be reversed by administration
of such agents, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients
may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Difficulty in restarting
and maintaining the heart beat has also been reported with beta blockers.
</p>

<p>DIABETES AND HYPOGLYCEMIA: Metoprolol should be used with caution in
diabetic patients if a beta-blocking agent is required. Beta blockers may
mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations
such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. </p>

<p>THYROTOXICOSIS: Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs
(e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing
thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of
beta blockade, which might precipitate a thyroid storm. </p>

<p>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION </p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting
circulatory function, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of
depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating or exacerbating minimal
cardiac failure. </p>

<p>During treatment with Metoprolol, the hemodynamic status of the patient
should be carefully monitored. If heart failure occurs or persists despite
appropriate treatment, Metoprolol should be discontinued. </p>

<p>BRADYCARDIA: Metoprolol produces a decrease in sinus heart rate in most
patients; this decrease is greatest among patients with high initial heart
rates and least among patients with low initial heart rates. Acute myocardial
infarction (particularly inferior infarction) may in itself produce significant
lowering of the sinus rate. If the sinus rate decreases to &lt; 40 beats/min,
particularly if associated with evidence of lowered cardiac output, atropine
(0.25-0.5 mg) should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine
is not successful, Metoprolol should be discontinued, and cautious administration
of isoproterenol or installation of a cardiac pacemaker should be considered.
</p>

<p>AV BLOCK: Metoprolol slows AV conduction and may produce significant
first- (P-R interval &gt;/= 0.26 sec), second-, or third-degree heart block.
Acute myocardial infarction also produces heart block. </p>

<p>If heart block occurs, Metoprolol should be discontinued and atropine
(0.25-0.5 mg) should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine
is not successful, cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation
of a cardiac pacemaker should be considered. </p>

<p>HYPOTENSION: If hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; or = 90 mmHg)
occurs, Metoprolol should be discontinued, and the hemodynamic status of
the patient and the extent of myocardial damage carefully assessed. Invasive
monitoring of central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge, and arterial pressures
may be required. Appropriate therapy with fluids, positive inotropic agents,
balloon counterpulsation, or other treatment modalities should be instituted.
If hypotension is associated with sinus bradycardia or AV block, treatment
should be directed at reversing these (see above). </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES: PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD,
IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA BLOCKERS. BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVE BETA1 SELECTIVITY,
Metoprolol MAY BE USED WITH EXTREME CAUTION IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC
DISEASE. BECAUSE IT IS UNKNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT BETA2-STIMULATING AGENTS
MAY EXACERBATE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND THE EXTENT OF INFARCTION, THESE
AGENTS SHOULD Not BE USED PROPHYLACTICALLY. IF BRONCHOSPASM NOT RELATED
TO CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE OCCURS, Metoprolol SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED.
A THEOPHYLLINE DERIVATIVE OR A BETA2 AGONIST MAY BE ADMINISTERED CAUTIOUSLY,
DEPENDING ON THE CLINICAL CONDITION OF THE PATIENT. BOTH THEOPHYLLINE DERIVATIVES
AND BETA2 AGONISTS MAY PRODUCE SERIOUS CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Metoprolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic
function. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be advised to take Metoprolol regularly and continuously,
as directed, with or immediately following meals. If a dose should be missed,
the patient should take only the next scheduled dose (without doubling
it). Patients should not discontinue Metoprolol without consulting the
physician. </p>

<p>Patients should be advised (1) to avoid operating automobiles and machinery
or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient's response
to therapy with Metoprolol has been determined; (2) to contact the physician
if any difficulty in breathing occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist
before any type of surgery that he or she is taking Metoprolol. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Clinical laboratory findings may include elevated levels of serum transaminase,
alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive
effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Metoprolol
plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for
evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo,
syncope, or postural hypotension. </p>

<p>Risk Of Anaphylactic Reaction. While taking beta-blockers, patients
with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens
may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic,
or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of
epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic
potential. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up
to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously
occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic
changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of
generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli
and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss
albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign
lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving
the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase
in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall
incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated
in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences
were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type
of tumor. </p>

<p>All mutagenicity tests performed (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome
studies in somatic cells, a Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity
test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) were negative.
</p>

<p>No evidence of impaired fertility due to Metoprolol was observed in
a study performed in rats at doses up to 55.5 times the maximum daily human
dose of 450 mg. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C </p>

<p>Metoprolol has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease
neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 55.5 times the maximum daily human
dose of 450 mg. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus
when Metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These studies have
revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenicity. There are
no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this
drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantity. An infant
consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than
1 mg of the drug. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered
to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>ACUTE TOXICITY </p>

<p>Several cases of overdosage have been reported, some leading to death.
</p>

<p>Oral LD50's (mg/kg): mice, 1158-2460; rats, 3090-4670. </p>

<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS </p>

<p>Potential signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with Metoprolol
are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and cardiac failure. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>There is no specific antidote. </p>

<p>In general, patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction may
be more hemodynamically unstable than other patients and should be treated
accordingly (see WARNINGS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION). </p>

<p>On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of Metoprolol, the following
general measures should be employed: </p>

<p>ELIMINATION OF THE DRUG: Gastric lavage should be performed. </p>

<p>BRADYCARDIA: Atropine should be administered. If there is no response
to vagal blockade, isoproterenol should be administered cautiously. </p>

<p>HYPOTENSION: A vasopressor should be administered, e.g., levarterenol
or dopamine. </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASM: A beta2-stimulating agent and/or a theophylline derivative
should be administered. </p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: A digitalis glycoside and diuretic should be administered.
In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, administration
of dobutamine, isoproterenol, or glucagon may be considered. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>The dosage of Metoprolol should be individualized. Metoprolol should
be taken with or immediately following meals. </p>

<p>The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses,
whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction
is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will
be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range is 100
to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied.
While once-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood
pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain
a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more frequent
daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure
near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control
is being maintained throughout the day. Beta1 selectivity diminishes as
the dose of Metoprolol is increased. </p>

<p>ANGINA PECTORIS </p>

<p>The dosage of Metoprolol should be individualized. Metoprolol should
be taken with or immediately following meals. </p>

<p>The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses.
The dosage may be gradually increased at weekly intervals until optimum
clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the
heart rate. The effective dosage range is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages
above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued,
the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks. (See
WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION </p>

<p>EARLY TREATMENT: During the early phase of definite or suspected acute
myocardial infarction, treatment with Metoprolol can be initiated as soon
as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment
should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after
the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized. </p>

<p>Treatment in this early phase should begin with the intravenous administration
of three bolus injections of 5 mg of Metoprolol each; the injections should
be given at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous administration
of Metoprolol, blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram should
be carefully monitored. </p>

<p>In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), Metoprolol
tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, should be initiated 15 minutes after the
last intravenous dose and continued for 48 hours. Thereafter, patients
should receive a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily (see LATE TREATMENT
below). </p>

<p>Patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose should
be started on Metoprolol tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending
on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose
or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe
intolerance, treatment with Metoprolol should be discontinued (see WARNINGS).
</p>

<p>LATE TREATMENT: Patients with contraindications to treatment during
the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients
who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom
the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason should be started
on Metoprolol tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition
allows. Therapy should be continued for at least 3 months. Although the
efficacy of Metoprolol beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established,
data from studies with other beta blockers suggest that treatment should
be continued for 1-3 years. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Allopurinol is known chemically as 1,5-dihydro-4H-pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one.
It is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. Its solubility
in water at 37oC is 80.0 mg/dl and is greater in an alkaline solution.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Allopurinol acts on purine catabolism, without disrupting the biosynthesis
of purines. It reduces the production of uric acid by inhibiting the biochemical
reactions immediately preceding its formation.</p>

<p> Allopurinol is a structural analogue of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine.
It is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the
conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid, the
end product of purine metabolism in man. Allopurinol is metabolized to
the corresponding xanthine analogue, oxipurinol (alloxanthine), which also
is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.</p>

<p> It has been shown that reutilization of both hypoxanthine and xanthine
for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis is markedly enhanced when their
oxidations are inhibited by allopurinol and oxipurinol. This reutilization
does not disrupt normal nucleic acid anabolism, however, because feedback
inhibition is an integral part of purine biosynthesis. As a result of xanthine
oxidase inhibition, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine plus xanthine
in patients receiving allopurinol for treatment of hyperuricemia is usually
in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dl compared to a normal level of approximately
0.15 mg/dl. A maximum of 0.9 mg/dl of these oxypurines has been reported
when the serum urate was lowered to less than 2 mg/dl by high doses of
allopurinol. These values are far below the saturation levels at which
point their precipitation would be expected to occur (above 7 mg/dl).</p>

<p> The renal clearance of hypoxanthine and xanthine is at least 10 times
greater than that of uric acid. The increased xanthine and hypoxanthine
in the urine have not been accompanied by problems of nephrolithiasis.
Xanthine crystalluria has been reported in only three patients. Two of
the patients had Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by excessive
uric acid production combined with a deficiency of the enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This enzyme is required for the conversion
of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine to their respective nucleotides.
The third patient had lymphosarcoma and produced an extremely large amount
of uric acid because of rapid cell lysis during chemotherapy.</p>

<p> Allopurinol is approximately 90% absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract. Peak plasma levels generally occur at 1.5 hours and 4.5 hours for
allopurinol and oxipurinol respectively, and after a single oral dose of
300 mg allopurinol, maximum plasma levels of about 3 mcg/ml of allopurinol
and 6.5 mcg/ml of oxipurinol are produced. Approximately 20% of the ingested
allopurinol is excreted in the feces. Because of its rapid oxidation to
oxipurinol and a renal clearance rate approximately that of glomerular
filtration rate, allopurinol has a plasma half-life of about 1-2 hours.
Oxipurinol, however, has a longer plasma half-life (approximately 15.0
hours) and therefore effective xanthine oxidase inhibition is maintained
over a 24-hour period with single daily doses of allopurinol. Whereas allopurinol
is cleared essentially by glomerular filtration, oxipurinol is reabsorbed
in the kidney tubules in a manner similar to the reabsorption of uric acid.</p>

<p> The clearance of oxipurinol is increased by uricosuric drugs, and as
a consequence, the addition of a uricosuric agent reduces to some degree
the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by oxipurinol and increases to some
degree the urinary excretion of uric acid. In practice, the net effect
of such combined therapy may be useful in some patients in achieving minimum
serum uric acid levels provided the total urinary uric acid load does not
exceed the competence of the patient's renal function. Hyperuricemia may
be primary, as in gout, or secondary to diseases such as acute and chronic
leukemia, polycythemia vera, multiple myeloma, and psoriasis. It may occur
with the use of diuretic agents, during renal dialysis, in the presence
of renal damage, during starvation or reducing diets and in the treatment
of neoplastic disease where rapid resolution of tissue masses may occur.
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication for allopurinol treatment
(see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).</p>

<p> Gout is a metabolic disorder which is characterized by hyperuricemia
and resultant deposition of monosodium urate in the tissues, particularly
the joints and kidneys. The etiology of this hyperuricemia is the overproduction
of uric acid in relation to the patient's ability to excrete it. If progressive
deposition of urates is to be arrested or reversed, it is necessary to
reduce the serum uric acid level below the saturation point to suppress
urate precipitation.</p>

<p> Administration of allopurinol generally results in a fall in both serum
and urinary uric acid within two to three days. The degree of this decrease
can be manipulated almost at will since it is dose-dependent. A week or
more of treatment with allopurinol may be required before its full effects
are manifested; likewise, uric acid may return to pretreatment levels slowly
(usually after a period of seven to ten days following cessation of therapy).
This reflects primarily the accumulation and slow clearance of oxipurinol.
In some patients a dramatic fall in urinary uric acid excretion may not
occur, particularly in those with severe tophaceous gout. It has been postulated
that this may be due to the mobilization of urate from tissue deposits
as the serum uric acid level begins to fall.</p>

<p> Allopurinol's action differs from that of uricosuric agents, which
lower the serum uric acid level by increasing urinary excretion of uric
acid. Allopurinol reduces both the serum and urinary uric acid levels by
inhibiting the formation of uric acid. The use of allopurinol to block
the formation of urates avoids the hazard of increased renal excretion
of uric acid posed by uricosuric drugs.</p>

<p> Allopurinol can substantially reduce serum and urinary uric acid levels
in previously refractory patients even in the presence of renal damage
serious enough to render uricosuric drugs virtually ineffective. Salicylates
may be given conjointly for their antirheumatic effect without compromising
the action of allopurinol. This is in contrast to the nullifying effect
of salicylates on uricosuric drugs.</p>

<p> Allopurinol also inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine,
the sulfur-containing analogue of hypoxanthine, to 6-thiouric acid. This
oxidation, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, inactivates mercaptopurine.
Hence, the inhibition of such oxidation by allopurinol may result in as
much as a 75% reduction in the therapeutic dose requirement of mercaptopurine
when the two compounds are given together.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b> INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>THIS IS NOT AN INNOCUOUS DRUG. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THE TREATMENT
OF ASYMPTOMATIC HYPERURICEMIA.</p>

<p> Allopurinol reduces serum and urinary uric acid concentrations. Its
use should be individualized for each patient and requires an understanding
of its mode of action and pharmacokinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<p> Allopurinol is indicated in:</p>

<p> (1) the management of patients with signs and symptoms of primary or
secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis
and/or nephropathy).</p>

<p> (2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies
who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary
uric acid levels. Allopurinol treatment should be discontinued when the
potential for overproduction of uric acid is no longer present.</p>

<p> (3) the management of patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi
whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and
750 mg/day in female patients. Therapy in such patients should be carefully
assessed initially and reassessed periodically to determine in each case
that treatment is beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b> CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Patients who have developed a severe reaction to allopurinol should
not be restarted on the drug.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>ALLOPURINOL SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF SKIN RASH
OR OTHER SIGNS WHICH MAY INDICATE AN ALLERGIC REACTION. In some instances
a skin rash may be followed by more severe hypersensitivity reactions such
as exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions as well as Stevens-Johnson
syndrome (erythema multiforme exudativum), and/or generalized vasculitis,
irreversible hepatotoxicity and on rare occasions death.</p>

<p> In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran),
the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of allopurinol per day will
require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of
the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment
of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis
of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY).</p>

<p> A few cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have been noted in
patients taking allopurinol, and in some patients asymptomatic rises in
serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If
anorexia, weight loss or pruritus develop in patients on allopurinol, evaluation
of liver function should be part of their diagnostic workup. In patients
with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function tests are recommended
during the early stages of therapy. Due to the occasional occurrence of
drowsiness, patients should be alerted to the need for due precaution when
engaging in activities where alertness is mandatory.</p>

<p> The occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol may be
increased in patients with decreased renal function receiving thiazides
and allopurinol concurrently. For this reason, in this clinical setting,
such combinations should be administered with caution and patients should
be observed closely.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b> PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General: An increase in acute attacks of gout has been reported during
the early stages of allopurinol administration, even when normal or subnormal
serum uric acid levels have been attained. Accordingly, maintenance doses
of colchicine generally should be given prophylactically when allopurinol
is begun. In addition, it is recommended that the patient start with a
low dose of allopurinol (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals
by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dl or less is attained
but without exceeding the maximum recommended dose (800 mg per day). The
use of colchicine or anti-inflammatory agents may be required to suppress
gouty attacks in some cases. The attacks usually become shorter and less
severe after several months of therapy. The mobilization of urates from
tissue deposits which cause fluctuations in the serum uric acid levels
may be a possible explanation for these episodes. Even with adequate allopurinol
therapy, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently
to achieve control of the acute attacks. A fluid intake sufficient to yield
a daily urinary output of at least two liters and the maintenance of a
neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable to (1) avoid
the theoretical possibility of formation of xanthine calculi under the
influence of allopurinol therapy and (2) help prevent renal precipitation
of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents.</p>

<p> Some patients with pre-existing renal disease or poor urate clearance
have shown a rise in BUN during allopurinol administration. Although the
mechanism responsible for this has not been established, patients with
impaired renal function should be carefully observed during the early stages
of allopurinol administration and dosage decreased or the drug withdrawn
if increased abnormalities in renal function appear and persist.</p>

<p> Renal failure in association with allopurinol administration has been
observed among patients with hyperuricemia secondary to neoplastic diseases.
Concurrent conditions such as multiple myeloma and congestive myocardial
disease were present among those patients whose renal dysfunction increased
after allopurinol was begun. Renal failure is also frequently associated
with gouty nephropathy and rarely with allopurinol-associated hypersensitivity
reactions. Albuminuria has been observed among patients who developed clinical
gout following chronic glomerulonephritis and chronic pyelonephritis.</p>

<p> Patients with decreased renal function require lower doses of allopurinol
than those with normal renal function. Lower than recommended doses should
be used to initiate therapy in any patients with decreased renal function
and they should be observed closely during the early stages of allopurinol
administration. In patients with severely impaired renal function or decreased
urate clearance, the half-life of oxipurinol in the plasma is greatly prolonged.
Therefore, a dose of 100 mg per day or 300 mg twice a week, or perhaps
less, may be sufficient to maintain adequate xanthine oxidase inhibition
to reduce serum urate levels.</p>

<p> Bone marrow depression has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol,
most of whom received concomitant drugs with the potential for causing
this reaction. This has occurred as early as six weeks to as long as six
years after the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Rarely a patient may
develop varying degrees of bone marrow depression, affecting one or more
cell lines, while receiving allopurinol alone. Information for Patients:
Patients should be informed of the following:</p>

<p> (1) They should be cautioned to discontinue allopurinol and to consult
their physician immediately at the first sign of a skin rash, painful urination,
blood in the urine, irritation of the eyes, or swelling of the lips or
mouth. (2) They should be reminded to continue drug therapy prescribed
for gouty attacks since optimal benefit of allopurinol may be delayed for
two to six weeks. (3) They should be encouraged to increase fluid intake
during therapy to prevent renal stones. (4) If a single dose of allopurinol
is occasionally forgotten, there is no need to double the dose at the next
scheduled time. (5) There may be certain risks associated with the concomitant
use of allopurinol and dicumarol, sulfinpyrazone, mercaptopurine, azathioprine,
ampicillin, amoxicillin and thiazide diuretics, and they should follow
the instructions of their physician. (6) Due to the occasional occurrence
of drowsiness, patients should take precautions when engaging in activities
where alertness is mandatory. (7) Patients may wish to take allopurinol
after meals to minimize gastric irritation.</p>

<p> Laboratory Tests: The correct dosage and schedule for maintaining the
serum uric acid within the normal range is best determined by using the
serum uric acid as an index.</p>

<p> In patients with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function
tests are recommended during the early stages of therapy (see WARNINGS).</p>

<p> Allopurinol and its primary active metabolite oxipurinol are eliminated
by the kidneys; therefore, changes in renal function have a profound effect
on dosage. In patients with decreased renal function or who have concurrent
illnesses which can affect renal function such as hypertension and diabetes
mellitus, periodic laboratory parameters of renal function, particularly
BUN and serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, should be performed and
the patient's allopurinol dosage reassessed.</p>

<p> The prothrombin time should be reassessed periodically in the patients
receiving dicumarol who are given allopurinol.</p>

<p> Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Allopurinol is not known to alter
the accuracy of laboratory tests.</p>

<p> Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Reproductive
studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to twenty times
the usual human dose (5 mg/kg/day), and it was concluded that there was
no impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to allopurinol. There is
a published report of a study in pregnant mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg allopurinol
intraperitoneally on gestation days 10 or 13. There were increased numbers
of dead fetuses in dams given 100 mg/kg allopurinol but not in those given
50 mg/kg. There were increased numbers of external malformations in fetuses
at both doses of allopurinol on gestation day 10 and increased numbers
of skeletal malformations in fetuses at both doses on gestation day 13.
It cannot be determined whether this represented a fetal effect or an effect
secondary to maternal toxicity. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not
always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy
only if clearly needed.</p>

<p> Experience with allopurinol during human pregnancy has been limited
partly because women of reproductive age rarely require treatment with
allopurinol. There are two unpublished reports and one published paper
of women giving birth to normal offspring after receiving allopurinol during
pregnancy.</p>

<p> Nursing Mothers: Allopurinol and oxipurinol have been found in the
milk of a mother who was receiving allopurinol. Since the effect of allopurinol
on the nursing infant is unknown, caution should be exercised when allopurinol
is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Allopurinol is rarely
indicated for use in children with the exception of those with hyperuricemia
secondary to malignancy or to certain rare inborn errors of purine metabolism
(see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b> DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran),
the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of allopurinol per day will
require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of
the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment
of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis
of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY).</p>

<p> It has been reported that allopurinol prolongs the half-life of the
anticoagulant, dicumarol. The clinical basis of this drug interaction has
not been established but should be noted when allopurinol is given to patients
already on dicumarol therapy.</p>

<p> Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, uricosuric
agents, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase
the excretion of oxipurinol and thus lower the degree of inhibition of
xanthine oxidase. The concomitant administration of uricosuric agents and
allopurinol has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines
(hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion
compared with that observed with allopurinol alone. Although clinical evidence
to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients
either on allopurinol alone or in combination with uricosuric agents, the
possibility should be kept in mind.</p>

<p> The reports that the concomitant use of allopurinol and thiazide diuretics
may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients
have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship
and a mechanism of causation. Review of these case reports indicates that
the patients were mainly receiving thiazide diuretics for hypertension
and that tests to rule out decreased renal function secondary to hypertensive
nephropathy were not often performed. In those patients in whom renal insufficiency
was documented, however, the recommendation to lower the dose of allopurinol
was not followed. Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship
have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function
should be monitored in patients on thiazide diuretics and allopurinol even
in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more
conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished
renal function is detected.</p>

<p> An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients
receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared
to patients who are not receiving both drugs. The cause of the reported
association has not been established. Enhanced bone marrow suppression
by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among
patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of allopurinol.
However, in a well-controlled study of patients with lymphoma on combination
therapy, allopurinol did not increase the marrow toxicity of patients treated
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine and/or mechlorethamine.</p>

<p> Tolbutamide's conversion to inactive metabolites has been shown to
be catalyzed by xanthine oxidase from rat liver. The clinical significance,
if any, of these observations is unknown. Chlorpropamide's plasma half-life
may be prolonged by allopurinol, since allopurinol and chlorpropamide may
compete for excretion in the renal tubule. The risk of hypoglycemia secondary
to this mechanism may be increased if allopurinol and chlorpropamide are
given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b> ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions
are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature, unpublished
clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of allopurinol began.
Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation
of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average
6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence
of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation
for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating
therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p> The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin
reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore, treatment with
allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see
WARNINGS). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever,
chills, arthralgias, cholestatic, jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis
or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for
3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively,
Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction
which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption, sometimes
scaly or exfoliative. However, with current usage, skin reactions have
been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease
is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence
of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving
ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported
to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS).</p>

<p> Most Common Reactions* Probably Causally Related Gastrointestinal:
diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase increase, SGOT/SGPT increase </p>

<p>Metabolic and Nutritional: acute attacks of gout </p>

<p>Skin and Appendages: rash, maculopapular rash </p>

<p>*Early clinical studies and incidence rates from early clinical experience
with allopurinol suggested that these adverse reactions were found to occur
at a rate of greater than 1%. The most frequent event observed was acute
attacks of gout following the initiation of therapy. Analyses of current
usage suggest that the incidence of these adverse reactions is now less
than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined, but
it may be due to following recommended usage (see ADVERSE REACTIONS introduction,
INDICATIONS AND USAGE, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Massive overdosing or acute poisoning by allopurinol has not been reported.</p>

<p> In mice the 50% lethal dose (LD50) is 160 mg/kg given intraperitoneally
(i.p.) with deaths delayed up to five days and 700 mg/kg orally (p.o.)
(approximately 140 times the usual human dose) with deaths delayed up to
three days. In rats the acute LD50 is 750 mg/kg i.p. and 6000 mg/kg p.o.
(approximately 1200 times the human dose).</p>

<p> In the management of overdosage there is no specific antidote for allopurinol.
There has been no clinical experience in the management of a patient who
has taken massive amounts of allopurinol.</p>

<p> Both allopurinol and oxipurinol are dialyzable; however, the usefulness
of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in the management of a allopurinol
overdose is unknown.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The dosage of allopurinol to accomplish full control of gout and to
lower serum uric acid to normal or near-normal levels varies with the severity
of the disease. The average is 200 to 300 mg per day for patients with
mild gout and 400 to 600 mg per day for those with moderately severe tophaceous
gout. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as
a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Dosage requirements in
excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses.</p>

<p> The minimal effective dosage is 100 to 200 mg daily and the maximal
recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. To reduce the possibility of flare-up
of acute gouty attacks, it is recommended that the patient start with a
low dose of allopurinol (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals
by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dl or less is attained
but without exceeding the maximal recommended dosage.</p>

<p> Normal serum urate levels are usually achieved in one to three weeks.
The upper limit of normal is about 7 mg/dl for men and postmenopausal women
and 6 mg/dl for premenopausal women. Too much reliance should not be placed
on a single serum uric acid determination since, for technical reasons,
estimation of uric acid may be difficult. By selecting the appropriate
dosage and, in certain patients, using uricosuric agents concurrently,
it is possible to reduce serum uric acid to normal or, if desired, to as
low as 2 to 3 mg/dl and keep it there indefinitely.</p>

<p> While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol in patients who are being
treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, it is wise to
continue the latter therapy until serum uric acid has been normalized and
there has been freedom from acute gouty attacks for several months.</p>

<p> In transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to allopurinol, the
dose of the uricosuric agent should be gradually reduced over a period
of several weeks and the dose of allopurinol gradually increased to the
required dose needed to maintain a normal serum uric acid level.</p>

<p> It should also be noted that allopurinol is generally better tolerated
if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary
output of at least two liters and the maintenance of a neutral or, preferably,
slightly alkaline urine are desirable.</p>

<p> Since allopurinol and its metabolites are primarily eliminated only
by the kidney, accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure, and
the dose of allopurinol should consequently be reduced. With a creatinine
clearance of 10 to 20 ml/min, a daily dosage of 200 mg of allopurinol is
suitable. When the creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/min the daily
dosage should not exceed 100 mg. With extreme renal impairment (creatinine
clearance less than 3 ml/min) the interval between doses may also need
to be lengthened.</p>

<p> The correct size and frequency of dosage for maintaining the serum
uric acid just within the normal range is best determined by using the
serum uric acid level as an index.</p>

<p> For the prevention of uric acid nephropathy during the vigorous therapy
of neoplastic disease, treatment with 600 to 800 mg daily for two or three
days is advisable together with a high fluid intake. Otherwise similar
considerations to the above recommendations for treating patients with
gout govern the regulation of dosage for maintenance purposes in secondary
hyperuricemia.</p>

<p> The dose of allopurinol recommended for management of recurrent calcium
oxalate stones in hyperuricosuric patients is 200 to 300 mg/day in divided
doses or as the single equivalent. This dose may be adjusted up or down
depending upon the resultant control of the hyperuricosuria based upon
subsequent 24 hour urinary urate determinations. Clinical experience suggests
that patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones may also benefit from
dietary changes such as the reduction of animal protein, sodium, refined
sugars, oxalate-rich foods, and excessive calcium intake as well as an
increase in oral fluids and dietary fiber.</p>

<p> Children, 6 to 10 years of age, with secondary hyperuricemia associated
with malignancies may be given 300 mg allopurinol daily while those under
6 years are generally given 150 mg daily. The response is evaluated after
approximately 48 hours of therapy and a dosage adjustment is made if necessary.</p>

<p>Methotrexate (formerly Amethopterin) is an antimetabolite used in the
treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis, and adult rheumatoid
arthritis. Chemically methotrexate is N-(4-(((2,4-diamino- 6-pteridinyl)methyl)methylamino)
benzoyl)-L- glutamic acid. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must
be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized
as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides
and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis,
repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as
malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa,
and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this
effect of methotrexate. When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues
is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant
growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues. </p>

<p>The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; it may affect
immune function. Two reports describe In Vitro methotrexate inhibition
of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mononuclear cells, and another describes
in animal polyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell
hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production. Other laboratories,
however, have been unable to demonstrate similar effects. Clarification
of methotrexate's effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid
immunopathogenesis await further studies. </p>

<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, effects of methotrexate on articular
swelling and tenderness can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks. Although
methotrexate clearly ameliorates symptoms of inflammation (pain, swelling,
stiffness), there is no evidence that it induces remission of rheumatoid
arthritis nor has a beneficial effect been demonstrated on bone erosions
and other radiologic changes which result in impaired joint use, functional
disability, and deformity </p>

<p>Most studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are
relatively short term (3 to 6 months). Limited data from long-term studies
indicate that an initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least
2 years with continued therapy. </p>

<p>In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin
is greatly increased over normal skin. This differential in proliferation
rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic
process. </p>

<p>Methotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as
a part of the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. The
original rationale for high- dose methotrexate therapy was based on the
concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin. More recent
evidence suggests that high-dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate
resistance caused by impaired active transport, decreased affinity of dihydrofolic
acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of dihydrofolic acid
reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglutamation
of methotrexate. The actual mechanism of action is unknown. </p>

<p>Two Pediatric Oncology Group studies (one randomized and one nonrandomized)
demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival in patients
with non-metastatic osteosarcoma, when high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin
rescue was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents following
surgical resection of the primary tumor. These studies were not designed
to demonstrate the specific contribution of high dose methotrexate/leucovorin
rescue therapy to the efficacy of the combination. However, a contribution
can be inferred from the reports of objective responses to this therapy
in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma, and from reports of extensive
tumor necrosis following preoperative administration of this therapy to
patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: Absorption: In adults, oral absorption appears to
be dose dependent. Peak serum levels are reached within 1 to 2 hours. At
doses of 30 mg/m(squared) or less, methotrexate is generally well absorbed
with a mean bioavailability of about 60%. The absorption of doses greater
than 80 mg/m(squared) is significantly less, possibly due to a saturation
effect. In leukemic children, oral absorption has been reported to vary
widely (23% to 95%). A twenty- fold difference between highest and lowest
peak levels (Cmax: 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar after a 20 mg/m(squared) dose)
has been reported. Significant interindividual variability has also been
noted in time to peak concentration (Tmax: 0.67 to 4hrs after a 15 mg/m(squared)
dose) and fraction of dose absorbed. Food has been shown to delay absorption
and reduce peak concentration. </p>

<p>Methotrexate is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes
of injection. After intramuscular injection, peak serum concentrations
occur in 30 to 60 minutes. </p>

<p>Distribution: After intravenous administration, the initial volume of
distribution is approximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state
volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 to 0.8 L/kg (40% to 80% of
body weight). Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport
across cell membranes by means of a single carrier-mediated active transport
process. At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar, passive diffusion
becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations
can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound.
Laboratory studies demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma albumin
by various compounds including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines,
chloramphenicol, and phenytoin. </p>

<p>Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood- cerebrospinal fluid barrier
in therapeutic amounts when given orally or parenterally. High CSF concentrations
of the drug may be attained by intrathecal administration. In dogs, synovial
fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed than uninflamed
joints. Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration, prior
prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level
of normal joints. </p>

<p>Metabolism: After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular
metabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate
by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate
reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates
may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged
drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues,
and tumors. A small amount of metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate may occur
at doses commonly prescribed. Accumulation of this metabolite may become
significant at the high doses used in osteogenic sarcoma. The aqueous solubility
of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is three- to fivefold lower than the parent compound.
Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.
</p>

<p>Half-Life: The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately
3 to 10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid
arthritis or low-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m(squared)).
For patients receiving high doses of methotrexate, the terminal half-life
is 8 to 15 hours. </p>

<p>Excretion: Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is
dependent upon dosage and route of administration. With IV administration,
80% to 90% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine
within 24 hours. There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or
less of the administered dose. Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate
has been proposed. </p>

<p>Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.
Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has
been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg. Impaired
renal function, as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic
acids that also undergo tubular secretion, can markedly increase methotrexate
serum levels. Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate
clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance. </p>

<p>Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased
at higher doses. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the
major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity. It has been postulated
that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent
upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved.
When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function,
a third-space effusion, or other causes, methotrexate serum concentrations
may remain elevated for prolonged periods. </p>

<p>The potential for toxicity from high-dose regimens or delayed excretion
is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final
phase of methotrexate plasma elimination. Pharmacokinetic monitoring of
methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high
risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustment of leucovorin
dosing. Guidelines for monitoring serum methotrexate levels, and for adjustment
of leucovorin dosing to reduce the risk of methotrexate toxicity, are provided
below in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. </p>

<p>Methotrexate has been detected in human breast milk. The highest breast
milk to plasma concentration ratio reached was 0.08:1. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>NEOPLASTIC DISEASES: Methotrexate is indicated in the treatment of gestational
choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens, and hydatidiform mole. </p>

<p>In acute lymphocytic leukemia, methotrexate is indicated in the prophylaxis
of meningeal leukemia and is used in maintenance therapy in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents. Methotrexate is also indicated in the
treatment of meningeal leukemia. </p>

<p>Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents
in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck,
advanced mycosis fungoides, and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell
and small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas. Methotrexate in high doses followed by leucovorin rescue in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents is effective in prolonging
relapse-free survival in patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma who have
undergone surgical resection or amputation for the primary tumor. </p>

<p>PSORIASIS: Methotrexate is indicated in the symptomatic control of severe,
recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to
other forms of therapy, But Only When The Diagnosis Has Been Established,
As By Biopsy And/Or After Dermatologic Consultation. It is important to
ensure that a psoriasis &quot;flare&quot; is not due to an undiagnosed
concomitant disease affecting immune responses. </p>

<p>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: Methotrexate is indicated in the management of
selected adults with severe, active, classical, or definite rheumatoid
arthritis (ARA criteria) who have had an insufficient therapeutic response
to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including
full dose NSAIDs and usually a trial of at least one or more disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs. </p>

<p>Aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and/or low-dose steroids
may be continued, although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant
use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored (see PRECAUTIONS,
DRUG INTERACTIONS). Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond
to methotrexate. Combined use of methotrexate with gold, penicillamine,
hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or cytotoxic agents, has not been studied
and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Rest and physiotherapy
as indicated should be continued. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Methotrexate can cause fetal death or teratogenic effects when administered
to a pregnant woman. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnant patients
with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis and should be used in the treatment
of neoplastic diseases only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk
to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should not be started on
methotrexate until pregnancy is excluded and should be fully counseled
on the serious risk to the fetus (see PRECAUTIONS) should they become pregnant
while undergoing treatment. Pregnancy should be avoided if either partner
is receiving methotrexate; during and for a minimum of 3 months after therapy
for male patients, and during and for at least one ovulatory cycle after
therapy for female patients. (See Boxed WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from methotrexate
in breast fed infants, it is contraindicated in nursing mothers. </p>

<p>Patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with alcoholism, alcoholic
liver disease, or other chronic liver disease should not receive methotrexate.
</p>

<p>Patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis who have overt or laboratory
evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes should not receive methotrexate.
</p>

<p>Patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis who have preexisting
blood dyscrasias, such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
or significant anemia, should not receive methotrexate. </p>

<p>Patients with a known hypersensitivity to methotrexate should not receive
the drug. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Methotrexate has the potential for serious toxicity (see Boxed
WARNINGS). Toxic effects may be related in frequency and severity to dose
or frequency of administration but have been seen at all doses. Because
they can occur at any time during therapy, it is necessary to follow patients
on methotrexate closely. Most adverse reactions are reversible if detected
early. When such reactions do occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage
or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken. If
necessary, this could include the use of leucovorin calcium (see OVERDOSAGE).
If methotrexate therapy is reinstituted, it should be carried out with
caution, with adequate consideration of further need for the drug, and
with increased alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity. </p>

<p>The clinical pharmacology of methotrexate has not been well studied
in older individuals. Due to diminished hepatic and renal function as well
as decreased folate stores in this population, relatively low doses should
be considered, and these patients should be closely monitored for early
signs of toxicity. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be informed of the early signs
and symptoms of toxicity, of the need to see their physician promptly if
they occur, and the need for close follow-up, including periodic laboratory
tests to monitor toxicity. </p>

<p>Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that
the recommended dose is taken weekly in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis,
and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity.
Patients should be encouraged to read the Patient Instructions sheet within
the Dose Pack. Prescriptions should not be written or refilled on a PRN
basis. Patients should be informed of the potential benefit and risk in
the use of methotrexate. The risk of effects on reproduction should be
discussed with both male and female patients taking methotrexate. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: Patients undergoing methotrexate therapy should be
closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline
assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and
platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests, and a chest X-ray.
During therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, monitoring of these
parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, and liver and renal
function every 1 to 3 months. More frequent monitoring is usually indicated
during antineoplastic therapy. During Initial Or Changing Doses, or during
periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (eg, dehydration),
more frequent monitoring may also be indicated. </p>

<p>A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or
cirrhosis of the liver has not been established. Transient liver function
test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration
and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent
liver function test abnormalities just prior to dosing and/or depression
of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require
evaluation. Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced
lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be
administered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate
used in the treatment of osteosarcoma. Concomitant administration of some
NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate
and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe
hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. </p>

<p>Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered
concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate. These drugs have been reported
to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and
may enhance its toxicity. </p>

<p>Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis have usually included concurrent use of constant
dosage regimens of NSAIDs, without apparent problems. It should be appreciated
however, that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week)
are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis and that larger doses could
lead to unexpected toxicity. </p>

<p>Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be
increased because of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates,
phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is
also diminished by probenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug should
be carefully monitored. In the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma,
caution must be exercised if high-dose methotrexate is administered in
combination with a potentially nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (eg,
cisplatin). </p>

<p>Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable
broad- spectrum antibiotics, may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate
or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora
and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria. </p>

<p>Vitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease
responses to systemically administered methotrexate. Preliminary animal
and human studies have shown that small quantities of intravenously administered
leucovorin enter the CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and, in
humans, remain 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate
concentrations following intrathecal administration. However, high doses
of leucovorin may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate.
</p>

<p>Folate deficiency states may increase methotrexate toxicity. </p>

<p>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone
marrow suppression in patients receiving methotrexate, probably by an additive
antifolate effect. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: No controlled
human data exist regarding the risk of neoplasia with methotrexate. Methotrexate
has been evaluated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential
with inconclusive results. Although there is evidence that methotrexate
causes chromosomal damage to animal somatic cells and human bone marrow
cells, the clinical significance remains uncertain. Assessment of the carcinogenic
potential of methotrexate is complicated by conflicting evidence of an
increased risk of certain tumors in rheumatoid arthritis. Benefit should
be weighed against this potential risk before using methotrexate alone
or in combination with other drugs, especially in children or young adults.
Methotrexate causes embryotoxicity, abortion, and fetal defects in humans.
It has also been reported to cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia,
and menstrual dysfunction in humans, during and for a short period after
cessation of therapy. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: Psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis: Methotrexate is in Pregnancy
Category X. See CONTRAINDICATIONS. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: See CONTRAINDICATIONS. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established,
other than in cancer chemotherapy. </p>

<p>ORGAN SYSTEM TOXICITY: Gastrointestinal: If vomiting, diarrhea, or stomatitis
occur, which may result in dehydration, methotrexate should be discontinued
until recovery occurs. Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution
in the presence of peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis. </p>

<p>Hematologic: Methotrexate can suppress hematopoiesis and cause anemia,
leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. In patients with malignancy and preexisting
hematopoietic impairment, the drug should be used with caution, if at all.
In controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (n = 128), leukopenia
(WBC &lt;3000/mm(cubed)) was seen in two patients, thrombocytopenia (platelets
&lt;100,000/mm(cubed)) in six patients, and pancytopenia in two patients.
</p>

<p>In psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate should be stopped
immediately if there is a significant drop in blood counts. In the treatment
of neoplastic diseases, methotrexate should be continued only if the potential
benefit warrants the risk of severe myelosuppression. Patients with profound
granulocytopenia and fever should be evaluated immediately and usually
require parenteral broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy. </p>

<p>Hepatic: Methotrexate has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases)
and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is
potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally
2 years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies
in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total
cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes,
and advanced age. An accurate incidence rate has not been determined; the
rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known. Special
caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired
hepatic function. </p>

<p>Liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically
prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis
or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. </p>

<p>In psoriasis, the usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at
a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams. Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis
normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests
a repeat biopsy in 6 months. Milder histologic findings, such as fatty
change and low grade portal inflammation, are relatively common pretherapy.
Although these mild changes are usually not a reason to avoid or discontinue
methotrexate therapy, the drug should be used with caution. </p>

<p>Clinical experience with liver disease in rheumatoid arthritis is limited,
but the same risk factors would be anticipated. Liver function tests are
also usually not reliable predictors of histological changes in this population.
</p>

<p>When to perform a liver biopsy in rheumatoid arthritis patients has
not been established, either in terms of cumulative methotrexate dose or
duration of therapy. There is a combined reported experience in 217 rheumatoid
arthritis patients with liver biopsies both before and during treatment
(after a cumulative dose of at least 1500 mg) and in 714 patients with
a biopsy only during treatment. There are 64 (7%) cases of fibrosis and
1 (0.1%) case of cirrhosis. Of the 64 cases of fibrosis, 60 were deemed
mild. The reticulin stain is more sensitive for early fibrosis and its
use may increase these figures. It is unknown whether even longer use will
increase these risks. </p>

<p>Infection Or Immunologic States: Methotrexate should be used with extreme
caution in the presence of active infection, and is usually contraindicated
in patients with overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes.
Immunization may be ineffective when given during methotrexate therapy.
Immunization with live virus vaccines is generally not recommended. There
have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunization
in patients receiving methotrexate therapy. Hypogammaglobulinemia has been
reported rarely. </p>

<p>Neurologic: There have been reports of leukoencephalopathy following
intravenous administration of methotrexate to patients who have had craniospinal
irradiation. Chronic leukoencephalopathy has also been reported in patients
with osteosarcoma who received repeated doses of high-dose methotrexate
with leucovorin rescue even without cranial irradiation. Discontinuation
of methotrexate does not always result in complete recovery. </p>

<p>A transient acute neurologic syndrome has been observed in patients
treated with high-dosage regimens. Manifestations of this neurologic disorder
may include behavioral abnormalities, focal sensorimotor signs, and abnormal
reflexes. The exact cause is unknown. </p>

<p>After the intrathecal use of methotrexate, the central nervous system
toxicity which may occur can be classified as follows: chemical arachnoiditis
manifested by such symptoms as headache, back pain, nuchal rigidity, and
fever; paresis, usually transient, manifested by paraplegia associated
with involvement with one or more spinal nerve roots; leukoencephalopathy
manifested by confusion, irritability, somnolence, ataxia, dementia, and
occasionally major convulsions. Pulmonary: Pulmonary symptoms (especially
a dry, nonproductive cough) or a nonspecific pneumonitis occurring during
methotrexate therapy may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion
and require interruption of treatment and careful investigation. Although
clinically variable, the typical patient with methotrexate-induced lung
disease presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an infiltrate
on chest X-ray; infection needs to be excluded. This lesion can occur at
all dosages. </p>

<p>Renal: High doses of methotrexate used in the treatment of osteosarcoma
may cause renal damage leading to acute renal failure. Nephrotoxicity is
due primarily to the precipitation of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate
in the renal tubules. Close attention to renal function including adequate
hydration, urine alkalinization and measurement of serum methotrexate and
creatinine levels are essential for safe administration. </p>

<p>Other Precautions: Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution
in the presence of debility. </p>

<p>Methotrexate exits slowly from third-space compartments (eg, pleural
effusions or ascites). This results in a prolonged terminal plasma half-
life and unexpected toxicity. In patients with significant third-space
accumulations, it is advisable to evacuate the fluid before treatment and
to monitor plasma methotrexate levels. </p>

<p>Lesions of psoriasis may be aggravated by concomitant exposure to ultraviolet
radiation. Radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be &quot;recalled&quot;
by the use of methotrexate. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be administered prior
to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate used in the treatment
of osteosarcoma. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose
methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate
levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal
toxicity. </p>

<p>Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered
concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate. These drugs have been reported
to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and
may enhance its toxicity. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>IN GENERAL, THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF ACUTE SIDE EFFECTS ARE RELATED
TO DOSE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION. THE MOST SERIOUS REACTIONS ARE
DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER ORGAN SYSTEM TOXICITY IN THE PRECAUTIONS SECTION.
THAT SECTION SHOULD ALSO BE CONSULTED WHEN LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT
ADVERSE REACTIONS WITH METHOTREXATE. </p>

<p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions include ulcerative stomatitis,
leukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse
effects are malaise, undue fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness, and decreased
resistance to infection. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions that have been reported with methotrexate are
listed below by organ system. In the oncology setting, concomitant treatment
and the underlying disease make specific attribution of a reaction to methotrexate
difficult. </p>

<p>ALIMENTARY SYSTEM: Gingivitis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, gastrointestinal ulceration and
bleeding, enteritis. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Headaches, drowsiness, blurred vision. Aphasia,
hemiparesis, paresis, and convulsions have also occurred following administration
of methotrexate. FOLLOWING LOW DOSES, OCCASIONAL PATIENTS HAVE REPORTED
TRANSIENT SUBTLE COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, MOOD ALTERATION, OR UNUSUAL CRANIAL
SENSATIONS. </p>

<p>PULMONARY SYSTEM: Interstitial pneumonitis deaths have been reported,
and chronic interstitial obstructive pulmonary disease has occasionally
occurred. </p>

<p>SKIN: Erythematous rashes, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity, pigmentary
changes, alopecia, ecchymosis, telangiectasia, acne, furunculosis. </p>

<p>UROGENITAL SYSTEM: Severe nephropathy or renal failure, azotemia, cystitis,
hematuria; defective oogenesis or spermatogenesis, transient oligospermia,
menstrual dysfunction and vaginal discharge; infertility, abortion, fetal
defects. </p>

<p>Other rarer reactions related to or attributed to the use of methotrexate
such as opportunistic infection, arthralgia/myalgia, loss of libido/impotence,
diabetes, osteoporosis, and sudden death. A few cases of anaphylactoid
reactions have been reported. </p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS IN DOUBLE-BLIND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS STUDIES: The
approximate incidences of methotrexate-attributed (ie, placebo rate subtracted)
adverse reactions in 12- to 18-week double-blind studies of patients (n
= 128) with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dose oral (7.5 to 15
mg/week) pulse methotrexate, are listed below. Virtually all of these patients
were on concomitant nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs and some were
also taking low dosages of corticosteroids. </p>

<p>Incidence greater than 10%: Elevated liver function tests 15%, nausea/vomiting
10%. </p>

<p>Incidence 3% to 10%: Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count less
than 100,000/mm(cubed)). </p>

<p>Incidence 1% to 3%: Rash/pruritus/dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, leukopenia
(WBC &lt;3000/mm(cubed)), pancytopenia, dizziness. </p>

<p>No pulmonary toxicity was seen in these two trials. Thus, the incidence
is probably less than 2.5% (95% C.L.). Hepatic histology was not examined
in these short-term studies (see PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>Other less common reactions included decreased hematocrit, headache,
upper respiratory infection, anorexia, arthralgias, chest pain, coughing,
dysuria, eye discomfort, epistaxis, fever, infection, sweating, tinnitus,
and vaginal discharge. </p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS IN PSORIASIS: There are no recent placebo-controlled
trials in patients with psoriasis. There are two literature reports (Roenigk,
1969 and Nyfors, 1978) describing large series (n = 204, 248) of psoriasis
patients treated with methotrexate. Dosages ranged up to 25 mg per week,
and treatment was administered for up to 4 years. With the exception of
alopecia, photosensitivity, and &quot;burning of skin lesions&quot; (each
3% to 10%), the adverse reaction rates in these reports were very similar
to those in the rheumatoid arthritis studies. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Leucovorin is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the
effect of inadvertently administered overdosages of methotrexate. Leucovorin
administration should begin as promptly as possible. As the time interval
between methotrexate administration and leucovorin initiation increases,
the effectiveness of leucovorin in counteracting toxicity decreases. Monitoring
of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential in determining the
optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin. </p>

<p>In cases of massive overdosage, hydration and urinary alkalinization
may be necessary to prevent the precipitation of methotrexate and/or its
metabolites in the renal tubules. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis
has been shown to improve methotrexate elimination. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>NEOPLASTIC DISEASES: Oral administration in tablet form is often preferred
when low doses are being administered since absorption is rapid and effective
serum levels are obtained. Methotrexate sodium injection and for injection
may be given by the intramuscular, intravenous, intra- arterial, or intrathecal
route. However, the preserved formulation contains Benzyl Alcohol and must
not be used for intrathecal or high-dose therapy. Parenteral drug products
should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior
to administration, whenever solution and container permit. </p>

<p>Choriocarcinoma And Similar Trophoblastic Diseases: Methotrexate is
administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for
a 5-day course. Such courses are usually repeated for three to five times
as required, with rest periods of 1 or more weeks interposed between courses,
until any manifesting toxic symptoms subside. The effectiveness of therapy
is ordinarily evaluated by 24-hour quantitative analysis of urinary chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), which should return to normal or less than 50 IU/24h
usually after the third or fourth course and usually be followed by a complete
resolution of measurable lesions in 4 to 6 weeks. One to two courses of
methotrexate after normalization of hCG is usually recommended. Before
each course of the drug careful clinical assessment is essential. Cyclic
combination therapy of methotrexate with other antitumor drugs has been
reported as being useful. </p>

<p>Since hydatidiform mole may precede choriocarcinoma, prophylactic chemotherapy
with methotrexate has been recommended. </p>

<p>Chorioadenoma destruens is considered to be an invasive form of hydatidiform
mole. Methotrexate is administered in these disease states in doses similar
to those recommended for choriocarcinoma. </p>

<p>Leukemia: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adolescents
is the most responsive to present-day chemotherapy. In young adults and
older patients, clinical remission is more difficult to obtain and early
relapse is more common. </p>

<p>Methotrexate alone or in combination with steroids was used initially
for induction of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. More recently
corticosteroid therapy, in combination with other antileukemic drugs or
in cyclic combinations with methotrexate included, has appeared to produce
rapid and effective remissions. When used for induction, methotrexate in
doses of 3.3 mg/m(squared) in combination with 60 mg/m(squared) of prednisone,
given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within
a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with other agents
appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-induced
remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced
general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows:
Methotrexate is administered two times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly
in total weekly doses of 30 mg/m(squared). It has also been given in doses
of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. If and when relapse does occur,
reinduction of remission can again usually be obtained by repeating the
initial induction regimen. </p>

<p>A variety of combination chemotherapy regimens have been used for both
induction and maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The
physician should be familiar with the new advances in antileukemic therapy.
</p>

<p>Meningeal Leukemia: In the treatment or prophylaxis of meningeal leukemia,
methotrexate must be administered intrathecally. Preservative- free methotrexate
is diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL in an appropriate sterile, preservative-free
medium such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The cerebrospinal fluid
volume is dependent on age and not on body surface area. The CSF is at
40% of the adult volume at birth and reaches the adult volume in several
years. </p>

<p>Intrathecal methotrexate administration at a dose of 12 mg/m(squared)
(maximum 15 mg) has been reported to result in low CSF methotrexate concentrations
and reduced efficacy in children and high concentrations and neurotoxicity
in adults. The following dosage regimen is based on age instead of body
surface area: </p>

<pre>
                   -------------------------------------------------
                            Age (years)         Dose (mg)
                   -------------------------------------------------
                                 &lt;1                  6
                                  1                  8
                                  2                 10
                             3 or older             12
                   -------------------------------------------------</pre>

<p>In one study in patients under the age of 40, this dosage regimen appeared
to result in more consistent CSF methotrexate concentrations and less neurotoxicity.
Another study in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia compared this
regimen to a dose of 12 mg/m(squared) (maximum 15mg). A significant reduction
in the rate of CNS relapse was observed in the group whose dose was based
on age. </p>

<p>Because the CSF volume and turnover may decrease with age, a dose reduction
may be indicated in elderly patients. </p>

<p>For the treatment of meningeal leukemia, intrathecal methotrexate may
be given at intervals of 2 to 5 days. However, administration at intervals
of less than 1 week may result in increased subacute toxicity. Methotrexate
is administered until the cell count of the cerebrospinal fluid returns
to normal. At this point one additional dose is advisable. For prophylaxis
against meningeal leukemia, the dosage is the same as for treatment except
for the intervals of administration. On this subject, it is advisable for
the physician to consult the medical literature. </p>

<p>Untoward side effects may occur with any given intrathecal injection
and are commonly neurological in character. Large doses may cause convulsions.
Methotrexate given by the intrathecal route appears significantly in the
systemic circulation and may cause systemic methotrexate toxicity. Therefore,
systemic antileukemic therapy with the drug should be appropriately adjusted,
reduced, or discontinued. Focal leukemic involvement of the CNS may not
respond to intrathecal chemotherapy and is best treated with radiotherapy.
Lymphomas: In Burkitt's tumor, Stages I to II, methotrexate has produced
prolonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day
orally for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly
with other antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of
several courses of the drug interposed with 7- to 10-day rest periods.
Lymphosarcomas in Stage III may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate
given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily. </p>

<p>Mycosis Fungoides: Therapy with methotrexate appears to produce clinical
remissions in one half of the cases treated. Dosage is usually 2.5 to 10
mg daily by mouth for weeks or months. Dose levels of drug and adjustment
of dose regimen by reduction or cessation of drug are guided by patient
response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate has also been given intramuscularly
in doses of 50 mg once weekly or 25 mg two times weekly. </p>

<p>Osteosarcoma: An effective adjuvant chemotherapy regimen requires the
administration of several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In addition
to high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, these agents may include
doxorubicin, cisplatin, and the combination of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide
and dactinomycin (BCD) in the doses and schedule shown in the table below.
The starting dose for high-dose methotrexate treatment is 12 grams/m(squared).
If this dose is not sufficient to produce a peak serum methotrexate concentration
of 1,000 micromolar (10(raised to the power of minus 3) mol/L) at the end
of the methotrexate infusion, the dose may be escalated to 15 grams/m(squared)
in subsequent treatments. If the patient is vomiting or is unable to tolerate
oral medication, leucovorin is given IV or IM at the same dose and schedule.

  toxicity.</pre>

<p>When these higher doses of methotrexate are to be administered, the
following safety guidelines should be closely observed. </p>

<p>GUIDELINES FOR METHOTREXATE THERAPY WITH LEUCOVORIN RESCUE </p>

<p>1. Administration of methotrexate should be delayed until recovery if:
</p>

<p>--the WBC count is &lt; 1500/microliter </p>

<p>--the neutrophil count is &lt; 200/microliter </p>

<p>--the platelet count is &lt; 75,000/microliter </p>

<p>--the serum bilirubin level is &gt; 1.2 mg/dL </p>

<p>--the SGPT level is &gt; 450 U </p>

<p>--mucositis is present, until there is evidence of healing </p>

<p>--persistent pleural effusion is present; this should be drained dry
prior to infusion. </p>

<p>2. Adequate renal function must be documented. </p>

<p>a. Serum creatinine must be normal, and creatinine clearance must be
greater than 60 mL/min, before initiation of therapy. </p>

<p>b. Serum creatinine must be measured prior to each subsequent course
of therapy. </p>

<p>If serum creatinine has increased by 50% or more compared to a prior
value, the creatinine clearance must be measured and documented to be greater
than 60 mL/min (even if the serum creatinine is still within the normal
range). </p>

<p>3. Patients must be well hydrated, and must be treated with sodium bicarbonate
for urinary alkalinization. </p>

<p>a. Administer 1,000 mL/m(squared) of intravenous fluid over 6 hours
prior to initiation of the methotrexate infusion. Continue hydration at
125 mL/m(squared)/hr (3 liters/m(squared)/day) during the methotrexate
infusion, and for 2 days after the infusion has been completed. </p>

<p>b. Alkalinize urine to maintain pH above 7.0 during methotrexate infusion
and leucovorin calcium therapy. This can be accomplished by the administration
of sodium bicarbonate orally or by incorporation into a separate intravenous
solution. </p>

<p>4. Repeat serum creatinine and serum methotrexate 24 hours after starting
methotrexate and at least once daily until the methotrexate level is below
5 x 10(raised to the power of minus 8) mol/L (0.05 micromolar). </p>

<p>5. The table below provides guidelines for leucovorin calcium dosage
based upon serum methotrexate levels. (See table below.**) </p>

                        in serum creatinine level     0.05 micromolar.
                        at 24 hours after
                        methotrexate administration
                        (eg, an increase from
                        0.5 mg/dL to a level of
                        1 mg/dL or more).</pre>

<p>Patients who experience delayed early methotrexate elimination are likely
to develop nonreversible oliguric renal failure. In addition to appropriate
leucovorin therapy, these patients require continuing hydration and urinary
alkalinization, and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until
the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the
renal failure has resolved. </p>

<p>6. Some patients will have abnormalities in methotrexate elimination,
or abnormalities in renal function following methotrexate administration,
which are significant but less severe than the abnormalities described
in the table above. These abnormalities may or may not be associated with
significant clinical toxicity. If significant clinical toxicity is observed,
leucovorin rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total
14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy. The possibility
that the patient is taking other medications which interact with methotrexate
(eg, medications which may interfere with methotrexate binding to serum
albumin, or elimination) should always be reconsidered when laboratory
abnormalities or clinical toxicities are observed. </p>

<p>PSORIASIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: The Patient Should Be Fully Informed
Of The Risks Involved And Should Be Under Constant Supervision Of The Physician.
(See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS under PRECAUTIONS.) Assessment of hematologic,
hepatic, renal, and pulmonary function should be made by history, physical
examination, and laboratory tests before beginning, periodically during,
and before reinstituting methotrexate therapy (see PRECAUTIONS). Appropriate
steps should be taken to avoid conception during methotrexate therapy.
(See PRECAUTIONS and CONTRAINDICATIONS.) </p>

<p>Weekly therapy may be instituted with the Methotrexate Methotrexate
2.5 mg Tablet Dose Packs which are designed to provide doses over a range
of 5 mg to 15 mg administered as a single weekly dose. The dose packs are
not recommended for administration of methotrexate in weekly doses greater
than 15 mg. All schedules should be continually tailored to the individual
patient. An initial test dose may be given prior to the regular dosing
schedule to detect any extreme sensitivity to adverse effects (see ADVERSE
REACTIONS). Maximal myelosuppression usually occurs in 7 to 10 days. </p>

<p>Psoriasis: Recommended Starting Dose Schedules </p>

<p>1. Weekly single oral, IM, or IV dose schedule: 10 to 25 mg per week
until adequate response is achieved. </p>

<p>2. Divided oral dose schedule: 2.5 mg at 12-hour intervals for three
doses. Dosages in each schedule may be gradually adjusted to achieve optimal
clinical response; 30mg/week should not ordinarily be exceeded. </p>

<p>Once optimal clinical response has been achieved, each dosage schedule
should be reduced to the lowest possible amount of drug and to the longest
possible rest period. The use of methotrexate may permit the return to
conventional topical therapy, which should be encouraged. </p>

<p>Rheumatoid Arthritis: Recommended Starting Dosage Schedules </p>

<p>1. Single oral doses of 7.5 mg once weekly. </p>

<p>2. Divided oral dosages of 2.5 mg at 12-hour intervals for three doses
given as a course once weekly. </p>

<p>Dosages in each schedule may be adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal
response, but not ordinarily to exceed a total weekly dose of 20 mg. Limited
experience shows a significant increase in the incidence and severity of
serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression, at doses greater
than 20 mg/wk. </p>

<p>Once response has been achieved, each schedule should be reduced, if
possible, to the lowest possible effective dose. </p>

<p>Therapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient
may continue to improve for another 12 weeks or more. </p>

<p>The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Limited data available from
long- term studies indicate that the initial clinical improvement is maintained
for at least 2 years with continued therapy. When methotrexate is discontinued,
the arthritis usually worsens within 3 to 6 weeks. </p>

<p>HANDLING AND DISPOSAL </p>

<p>Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should
be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.
(REF. 1-6) There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended
in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. </p>

<p>RECONSTITUTION OF LOW SODIUM CRYODESICCATED POWDERS Reconstitute immediately
prior to use. </p>

<p>Methotrexate Sodium for Injection should be reconstituted with an appropriate
sterile, preservative-free medium such as 5% Dextrose Solution, USP, or
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Reconstitute the 20 mg and 50 mg vials
to a concentration no greater than 25 mg/mL. THE 1 GRAM VIAL SHOULD BE
RECONSTITUTED WITH 19.4 ML TO A CONCENTRATION OF 50 MG/ML. When high doses
of methotrexate are administered by IV infusion, the total dose is diluted
in 5% Dextrose Solution. For intrathecal injection, reconstitute to a concentration
of 1 mg/mL with an appropriate sterile, preservative-free medium such as
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. </p>

<p>DILUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIQUID METHOTREXATE SODIUM INJECTION PRODUCTS
</p>

<p>METHOTREXATE SODIUM INJECTION, PRESERVATIVE PROTECTED: If desired, the
solution may be further diluted with a compatible medium such as Sodium
Chloride Injection, USP. Storage for 24 hours at a temperature of 21 deg
to 25 deg C results in a product which is within 90% of label potency.
METHOTREXATE LPF SODIUM (METHOTREXATE SODIUM INJECTION), ISOTONIC, PRESERVATIVE
FREE, FOR SINGLE USE ONLY: If desired, the solution may be further diluted
immediately prior to use with an appropriate sterile, preservative-free
medium such as 5% Dextrose Solution, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection,
USP. </p>

<p>Ketorolac is a member of the pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). The chemical name for ketorolac tromethamine is (+/-)-5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic
acid, 2 amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol. </p>

<p>Ketorolac is a racemic mixture of R-(+)- and S-(-)- ketorolac tromethamine.
Ketorolac tromethamine may exist in three crystal forms. All forms are
equally soluble in water. Ketorolac tromethamine has a pKa of 3.5 and an
n-octanol/ water partition coefficient of 0.26. The molecular weight of
ketorolac tromethamine is 376.41. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits
analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activity. Ketorolac inhibits
synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered a peripherally acting
analgesic. As with other NSAIDs, the biological activity of ketorolac is
associated with the S form. Ketorolac does not have any known effects on
opiate receptors. </p>

<p>Pain relief, following extraction of impacted third molars, is clinically
evident when steady state plasma levels average approximately 0.3 mcgm/mL,
while side effects are frequent above concentrations of 5 mcgm/mL. Pain
relief is comparable following IM or oral administration. Pain relief is
statistically different from that following placebo at 1/2 hour (the first
time point at which it was measured) following the largest recommended
doses of ketorolac and by 1 hour following the smallest recommended dose.
The peak analgesic effect occurs at 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically
significantly different over the recommended dosage range of ketorolac.
The greatest difference between large and small doses of Ketorolac by either
route is in the duration of analgesia. In controlled clinical trials 75%
of patients receiving 90 mg of Ketorolac IM or 100 mg Ketorolac ORAL did
not request remedication at 6 hours as compared to 56% of those patients
receiving 10 mg of Ketorolac IM or 10 to 12.5 mg Ketorolac ORAL. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS (see Tables) </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac in humans, following single or multiple
intramuscular or oral doses, are apparently linear, i.e., plasma levels
are approximately proportional to dosage. Steady state plasma levels are
achieved after dosing every 6 hours for one day. No changes in clearance
occur with chronic dosing. More than 99% of the ketorolac in plasma is
protein bound over a wide concentration range. </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetic profiles of IM and oral doses are very similar.
Following IM administration, some individuals have slower absorption which
is reflected below in the two tables showing results of studies of 15,
30, and 60 mg of Ketorolac IM and 10 mg of Ketorolac ORAL. Note that the
studies used different but comparable subject populations. The tables show
slightly longer times to peak plasma levels and slightly longer apparent
half-lives following IM administration. </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is completely absorbed following intramuscular administration
with mean peak plasma concentrations of 2.2-3.0 mcgm/mL occurring an average
of 50 minutes after a single 30 mg dose. The terminal plasma half-life
is 3.5-9.2 hours in young adults and 4.7-8.6 hours in elderly subjects
(mean age 72).</p>

<p>Ketorolac ORAL is completely absorbed following oral administration
with a mean peak plasma concentration of 0.7-1.1 mcgm/mL occurring an average
of 44 minutes after a single 10 mg dose in fasted subjects. The terminal
plasma half-life is 2.4-9.0 hours in young adults and 4.3-7.6 hours in
elderly subjects (mean age 72). </p>

<p>A high fat meal decreased the peak and delayed the time to peak concentration,
but did not affect the extent of absorption, while antacid had no effect
upon absorption of Ketorolac ORAL. </p>

<p>Ketorolac, following intravenous, intramuscular and oral administration,
displays characteristics of a two-compartment model. In order to minimize
the time delay in achieving adequate analgesic effect, an IM or oral loading
dose equal to twice the maintenance dose is recommended. This is based
upon the pharmacokinetic principle that when the dosing interval is near
the drug's half life, the target steady-state plasma level is achieved
faster if the first dose is twice the maintenance dose. Due to the two-compartment
characteristics of ketorolac, the loading dose results in plasma levels
during the first dosing interval that are higher than in subsequent intervals
(see graph of IM dosing which illustrates this).</p>

<p>METABOLISM AND EXCRETION </p>

<p>The primary route of excretion of ketorolac and its metabolites (conjugates
and a para-hydroxy metabolite) is in the urine (mean 91.4%) and the remainder
(mean 6.1%) is excreted in the feces. In patients with serum creatinine
values ranging from 1.9 to 5.0 mg/dL, the rate of ketorolac clearance was
reduced to approximately two-thirds of normal. </p>

<p>Decreases in serum albumin, such as encountered in liver cirrhosis,
would be expected to change ketorolac clearance. However, in a study of
7 patients with liver cirrhosis, no correlation was found between serum
albumin concentration and ketorolac clearance. </p>

<p>Hemodynamics of anesthetized patients were not altered by parenteral
administration of ketorolac. Unlike opiate analgesics such as morphine,
ketorolac does not cause respiratory depression. </p>

<p>Ketorolac poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier (levels in the cerebrospinal
fluid were found to be 0.002 times or less than those in plasma). </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>The analgesic efficacy of intramuscularly and orally administered ketorolac
was investigated in two postoperative pain models: general surgery (orthopedic,
gynecologic and abdominal) and oral surgery (removal of impacted third
molars). The studies were primarily double-blind, single dose, parallel
trial designs in patients with moderate to severe pain at baseline. Ketorolac
IM was compared to meperidine or morphine administered intramuscularly.
Ketorolac ORAL was compared to naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen
and aspirin or acetaminophen with codeine. </p>

<p>SHORT TERM USE (UP TO 5 DAYS) </p>

<p>In the comparisons of intramuscular administration during the first
hour, the onset of analgesic action was similar to Ketorolac and the narcotics.
Ketorolac 30 or 90 mg intramuscularly gave pain relief comparable to meperidine
100 mg or morphine 12 mg. Ketorolac 10 mg was comparable to 50 mg of meperidine
or 6 mg morphine. The duration of analgesia was longer with all three doses
of Ketorolac. The percentage of patients who did not remedicate by 6 hours,
i.e., by the end of the studies, was roughly 70%, 60% and 50% for Ketorolac
90, 30 and 10 mg respectively, as compared to 30% and 20% for the high
and low doses of the two narcotics. In a multi-dose, postoperative (general
surgery) double-blind trial of Ketorolac 30 mg versus morphine 6 and 12
mg, each drug given on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis for up to 5 days,
the overall analgesic effect of Ketorolac 30 mg was in between that of
morphine 6 and 12 mg. Ketorolac 30 mg caused less drowsiness, nausea and
vomiting than morphine 12 mg. The majority of patients treated with either
Ketorolac or morphine were dosed for up to 3 days; a small percentage of
patients received 5 days of dosing. </p>

<p>In the first hour, the comparisons of Ketorolac ORAL in dental surgery
studies, 10 or 20 mg of Ketorolac ORAL gave comparable pain relief to ibuprofen
400 mg, aspirin 650 mg, acetaminophen 600 mg and acetaminophen 600 mg combined
with codeine 60 mg. The peak effects of the 2 Ketorolac ORAL doses and
ibuprofen were comparable and beyond 2 to 3 hours, the patients who received
those 3 treatments had statistically significantly better pain relief than
patients who received the other 3 treatments. The percentage of patients
who required remedication after 3 hours were as follows: </p>

<br>LIMITED DURATION USE OF Ketorolac IM FOLLOWED BY Ketorolac ORAL PRN
FOR ACUTE POST- SURGICAL PAIN </p>

<p>The use of Ketorolac ORAL (10 mg) following Ketorolac IM (30 mg) therapy
after surgery was evaluated in 210 patients in a double-blind trial compared
to IM meperidine 100 mg followed by oral acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine
60 mg. The use of both IM and oral treatment in this study was prn. Patients
received Ketorolac IM for a median duration of 2 days (median dose 60 mg/day)
followed by Ketorolac ORAL for a median duration of 8 days (median dose
25 mg/day). The efficacy of the ketorolac was comparable to the meperidine/acetaminophen
plus codeine regimen. The adverse events are shown in the following table:

or 30 mg single dose or qid prn followed by Ketorolac ORAL 10 mg qid prn
for 3-10 days. </p>

<p>LONG-TERM USE OF Ketorolac </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is not recommended for use beyond 5 days at recommended
doses because of the increase in side effects which may occur. </p>

<p>In a clinical trial in 823 patients with chronic pain states comparing
Ketorolac ORAL 10 mg qid (553 patients) with aspirin 650 mg qid (270 patients),
during the first week there was a 2.4% dropout rate because of upper GI
complaints in the Ketorolac ORAL treated patients as compared with a 0.4%
rate in the aspirin treated group. After the first 2 weeks, the dropout
rates due to GI pain or discomfort were comparable in both treatment groups.
The time-adjusted percentages of patients who developed ulcers or upper
GI bleeding are as follows: </p>

<p>PHYSICIANS SHOULD CAREFULLY WEIGH THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF
Ketorolac ORAL USE ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED
TO WATCH FOR SIGNS OF SERIOUS GI ADVERSE EVENTS AND THEY SHOULD BE MONITORED
MORE CLOSELY THAN IF THEY WERE ON ANOTHER NSAID. </p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE: Suggestions For Using KetorolacIM On A
PRN Schedule. Since the half-life of Ketorolac is approximately 6 hours,
an assessment of the size of a repeat dose can be based on the duration
of pain relief from the previous dose. For example, if pain returns within
3 to 5 hours of a maintenance dose (15 or 30 mg), the next dose could be
increased by up to 50% (Note: The recommended maximum total daily dose
is 120 mg (150 mg on the first day); an alternative would be to use morphine
or meperidine concomitantly (see INDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS)). Alternatively,
if pain does not return for 8 to 12 hours, the next dose could be decreased
by as much as 50%, or the dosage interval could be increased to 8 to 12
hours. </p>

<p>NOTE: THE INITIAL INTRAMUSCULAR LOADING DOSE (30 OR 60 MG) SHOULD BE
GIVEN ONLY ONCE, UNLESS THERAPY HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED FOR 3 HALF-LIVES (15-40
HOURS, SEE HALF-LIFE OF Ketorolac IM IN TABLE IN ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
</p>

<p>Ketorolac IM IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR SHORT-TERM THERAPY (NOT OVER 5
DAYS), BECAUSE ADVERSE REACTIONS MAY INCREASE WITH LONGER USE AT RECOMMENDED
DOSES (SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>The lower end of the dosage range is recommended for patients under
50 kg (110 pounds) of body weight, for patients over 65 years of age, and
for patients with reduced renal function (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
and PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>If management by regular scheduled doses is elected, see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION for dosing recommendations. </p>

<p>The most logical use of Ketorolac ORAL is in patients who have benefited
from Ketorolac IM without limiting side effects. They can be continued
on analgesic treatment with Ketorolac ORAL (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION--Transition
from Ketorolac IM to Ketorolac ORAL). It is recommended to use the lowest
effective dose of Ketorolac IM at the transition to Ketorolac ORAL and
to continue treatment with Ketorolac ORAL for as short a time as possible
(see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is indicated for the short-term management (up to 5 days)
of pain (see &quot;Clinical Studies&quot; in ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
Ketorolac IM is not recommended for longer use (more than 5 days) because
of the possibility of increased frequency and severity of adverse reactions
associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
and ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is not recommended as a pre-operative medication for support
of anesthesia, because it inhibits platelet aggregation and may prolong
bleeding time (see PRECAUTIONS--Hematologic Effects) and because it possesses
no sedative or anxiolytic properties. </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is not recommended in obstetric analgesia because it has
not been adequately studied for such use and because of the known effects
of drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis on uterine contraction and
fetal circulation. </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM has been used concomitantly with morphine and meperidine
without apparent adverse effects. </p>

<p>Ketorolac ORAL is indicated for limited duration prn use in the management
of pain (see WARNINGS, ADVERSE REACTIONS and ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-
Clinical Studies Sections for details about relative risks associated with
Ketorolac ORAL). </p>

<p>Ketorolac ORAL is not recommended for long-term use in patients with
chronic painful conditions. </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM and ORAL are not recommended for concurrent use with other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because of the potential
for additive side effects. The protein-binding of ketorolac is affected
by aspirin (see PRECAUTIONS) but not by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen
or piroxicam; studies with other nonsteroidals have not been performed.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Ketorolac should not be used in patients with previously demonstrated
hypersensitivity to ketorolac tromethamine, or in individuals with the
complete or partial syndrome of nasal polyps, angioedema, bronchospastic
reactivity (e.g., asthma) or other allergic manifestations to aspirin or
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Severe anaphylactic-like
reactions to Ketorolac have been reported in such patients. Therefore,
before starting therapy, careful questioning of patients for such things
as asthma, nasal polyps, urticaria, and hypotension associated with nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drugs is important. In addition, if such symptoms occur
during therapy, treatment should be discontinued. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>The most serious risks associated with Ketorolac are: GASTROINTESTINAL
ulcerations, bleeding and perforation (see PRECAUTIONS); RENAL events ranging
from interstitial nephritis to acute renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS), especially
in patients with pre-existing kidney problems; HEMORRHAGE, especially in
patients where strict hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS); HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTIONS such as anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, vascular collapse urticaria,
angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and vesicular bullous rash. Anaphylactoid
reactions may occur in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to aspirin,
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or Ketorolac. They may, however,
also occur in patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity
to these agents. Both types of reactions may be fatal. </p>

<p>The use of Ketorolac IM at recommended doses for more than 5 days is
associated with an increased frequency and severity of adverse events.
</p>

<p>The use of Ketorolac ORAL 10 mg on a long-term basis is associated with
more GI tract adverse effects than aspirin 650 mg qid (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY--Clinical Studies). Long-term treatment is not recommended
(see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). </p>

<p>High oral doses (e.g., 80 or 120 mg/day) are not recommended because
risks of serious adverse events are greater with daily doses exceeding
the recommended 40 mg oral per day (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE ALERT TO THE PHARMACOLOGIC SIMILARITY OF Ketorolac
TO OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS) THAT INHIBIT CYCLO-OXYGENASE.
</p>

<p>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p>RISK OF GASTROINTESTINAL ULCERATIONS, BLEEDING AND PERFORATION: Serious
gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation,
can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated
with NSAIDs. </p>

<p>Studies to date with NSAIDs have not identified any subset of patients
not at risk of developing peptic ulceration and bleeding. Except for a
prior history of serious GI events and other risk factors known to be associated
with peptic ulcer disease, such as alcoholism, smoking, etc., no other
factors have been associated with increased risk. Elderly or debilitated
patients seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals,
and most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in this population.
Postmarketing experience with Ketorolac IM suggests that there may be a
greater risk of gastrointestinal ulcerations, bleeding and perforation
in the elderly. </p>

<p>Studies so far are inconclusive concerning the relative risk of various
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in causing such reactions.
High doses of any such agent probably carry a greater risk of these reactions,
although this is rarely established in controlled clinical trials. In considering
the intramuscular use of relatively large doses (within the recommended
dosage range), or treatment with Ketorolac IM for a duration longer than
5 days, sufficient benefit should be anticipated to offset the potential
increased risk of GI toxicity. </p>

<p>The risks of gastrointestinal side effects associated with long-term
use of Ketorolac ORAL are described under ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Clinical
Studies (Long-Term Use of Ketorolac). </p>

<p>IMPAIRED RENAL OR HEPATIC FUNCTION: As with other nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Ketorolac should be used with caution in patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function, or a history of kidney or liver
disease.</p>

<p>RENAL EFFECTS: As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
administration of ketorolac tromethamine to animals resulted in renal papillary
necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been
reports of hematuria, proteinuria, glomerular nephritis, interstitial nephritis,
renal papillary necrosis, nephrotic syndrome, and acute renal failure.
</p>

<p>Another, equally important, renal toxicity has been seen in patients
with conditions leading to a reduction in blood volume and/or renal blood
flow, where renal prostaglandins have a supportive role in the maintenance
of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal
anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) may cause a dose-dependent reduction in
renal prostaglandin formation and may precipitate acute renal failure.
Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal
function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and
the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery
to the pretreatment state. </p>

<p>Ketorolac and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys
which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished
clearance of the drug (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, Ketorolac
should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see
WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed
closely. </p>

<p>FLUID RETENTION AND EDEMA: As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis, fluid retention,
edema, retention of NaCl, oliguria, elevations of serum urea nitrogen and
creatinine have been reported in clinical trials with Ketorolac. Therefore,
Ketorolac should be used with caution in patients with acute renal failure,
cardic decompensation, hypertension, or similar conditions. </p>

<p>HEPATIC EFFECTS: As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) treatment with Ketorolac may cause elevations of liver enzymes,
and in patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, it may lead to the
development of a more severe hepatic reaction. The ALT (SGPT) test is probably
the most sensitive indicator of liver injury. In patients with symptoms
and signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test
has occurred as a result of Ketorolac therapy, the administration of the
drug should be discontinued. </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC EFFECTS: Ketorolac inhibits platelet aggregation and may
prolong bleeding time. Unlike aspirin, the inhibition of platelet function
by Ketorolac disappears within 24 to 48 hours after the drug is discontinued.
Ketorolac does not appear to affect platelet count, prothrombin time (PT)
or partial thromboplastin time (PTT). In controlled clinical studies where
Ketorolac was administered intramuscularly or intravenously postoperatively,
the incidence of clinically significant postoperative bleeding was 0.4%
for Ketorolac compared to 0.2% in the control groups receiving narcotic
analgesics. </p>

<p>Because prostaglandins play an important role on hemostasis, NSAIDs
affect platelet aggregation as well, use of Ketorolac in patients who have
coagulation disorders should be undertaken with caution, and those patients
should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants
(e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding
complications if given Ketorolac concurrently; physicians should administer
such concomitant therapy with extreme caution. The concurrent use of Ketorolac
and prophylactic, low-dose heparin (2500-5000 units q12h) has not been
studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk
of bleeding. Physicians should weigh the benefits against the risk, and
exercise caution in using such concomitant therapy in these patients. In
patients who receive anticoagulants for any reason, there is an increased
risk of intramuscular hematoma formation from Ketorolac IM injections (see
PRECAUTIONS--Drug Interactions). </p>

<p>In postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs
of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the perioperative
use of Ketorolac IM. Caution should be used, therefore, when Ketorolac
is administered pre or intra-operatively. Perioperative use of Ketorolac
should be undertaken with caution when strict hemostasis is critical. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Ketorolac, like other drugs of its class, is not free of side effects.
The side effects of these drugs can cause discomfort and, rarely, there
are more serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which
may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcomes. </p>

<p>Physicians may wish to discuss with their patients the potential risks
(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS Sections) and likely
benefits of Ketorolac treatment, particularly when it is used for less
serious conditions when lengthy treatment is anticipated and when acceptable
alternatives to both the patient and physician may be available. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Because serious GI tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without warning
symptoms, physicians should follow patients for the signs and symptoms
of ulceration and bleeding and should inform them of the importance of
this follow up (see PRECAUTIONS--Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation).
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%) and binding
is independent of concentration. </p>

<p>The In Vitro binding of WARFARIN to plasma proteins is only slightly
reduced by Ketorolac (99.5% control vs 99.3%) with Ketorolac plasma concentrations
of 5 to 10 mcgm/mL. Ketorolac does not alter DIGOXIN protein binding. </p>

<p>In Vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic plasma concentrations
of SALICYLATE (300 mcgm/mL), the binding of Ketorolac was reduced from
approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential two-fold increase
in unbound Ketorolac plasma levels; hence, Ketorolac should be used with
caution (or at a reduced dosage) in patients being treated with high-dose
salicylate regimens. Therapeutic concentrations of DIGOXIN, WARFARIN, IBUPROFEN,
NAPROXEN, PIROXICAM ACETAMINOPHEN, PHENYTOIN, and TOLBUTAMIDE did not alter
Ketorolac protein binding. </p>

<p>In a study involving 12 volunteers, oral Ketorolac was co-administered
with a single dose of 25 mg WARFARIN, causing no significant changes in
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. In another study, intramuscular
Ketorolac (following oral dosing) was given with two doses of 5000 U of
HEPARIN to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding
time of 6.4 minutes (3.2-11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes (3.4-7.5
min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5-8.5 min) for placebo. Although
these results do not indicate significant interaction between Ketorolac
and warfarin or heparin, the administration of Ketorolac, or other NSAIDs,
to patients taking anticoagulants should be done with caution and patients
should be closely monitored (see PRECAUTIONS--Hematologic Effects). </p>

<p>Intramuscular Ketorolac reduced the diuretic response to FUROSEMIDE
in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20% (mean sodium and
urinary output decreased 17%). </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of oral Ketorolac and PROBENECID resulted
in decreased clearance of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac
plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately 3-fold from 5.4 to 17.8
mcgm.h/mL) and terminal half-life (increased approximately 2-fold from
6.6 to 15.1 hours). </p>

<p>Inhibition of renal LITHIUM clearance, leading to an increase in plasma
lithium concentration, has been reported with some prostaglandin synthesis
inhibiting drugs. The effect of Ketorolac on plasma lithium has not been
studied. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of METHOTREXATE and some NSAIDs has been
reported to reduce the clearance of methotrexate, enhancing the toxicity
of methotrexate. The effect of Ketorolac on methotrexate clearance has
not been studied. </p>

<p>In post-marketing experience, there have been three reports of a possible
interaction between Ketorolac IM and NON-DEPOLARIZING MUSCLE RELAXANTS,
appearing to enhance the effect of the muscle relaxant. The concurrent
use of Ketorolac with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied. </p>

<p>Intramuscular Ketorolac has been administered concurrently with MORPHINE
in several clinical trials of postoperative pain without evidence of adverse
interactions. </p>

<p>There is no evidence, in animal or human studies, that Ketorolac induces
or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.
</p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>An 18-month study in mice at oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine equal
to the parenteral MRHD (Maximum Recommended Human Dose) and a 24-month
study in rats at oral doses 2.5 times the parenteral MRHD, showed no evidence
of tumorigenicity. </p>

<p>Ketorolac tromethamine was not mutagenic in Ames test, unscheduled DNA
synthesis and repair, and in forward mutation assays. Ketorolac did not
cause chromosome breakage in the In Vivo mouse micronucleus assay. At 1590
mcgm/mL (approximately 1000 times the average human plasma levels) and
at higher concentrations, ketorolac tromethamine increased the incidence
of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian cells. </p>

<p>Impairment of fertility did not occur in male or female rats at oral
doses of 9 mg/kg (53.1 mg/M(square)) and 16 mg/kg (94.4 mg/M(square)),
respectively. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C. </p>

<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits, using daily oral
doses at 3.6 mg/kg (42.35 mg/M(square)) and in rats at 10 mg/kg (59 mg/M(square))
during organogenesis. Results of these studies did not reveal evidence
of teratogenicity to the fetus. Oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at
1.5 mg/kg (8.8 mg/M(square)), which was half of the human oral exposure,
administered after gestation day 17 caused dystocia and higher pup mortality
in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women. Ketorolac tromethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>Ketorolac is not recommended for use during labor and delivery (see
INDICATIONS). </p>

<p>LACTATION AND NURSING </p>

<p>After a single oral administration of 10 mg of Ketorolac ORAL to humans,
the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL and the maximum milk-to
plasma ratio was 0.037. After one day of dosing (qid), the maximum milk
concentration was 7.9 ng/mL and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025.
Caution should be exercised when Ketorolac IM or ORAL is administered to
a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Therefore,
Ketorolac is not recommended for use in children. </p>

<p>USE IN THE ELDERLY </p>

<p>Because ketorolac tromethamine is cleared somewhat more slowly by the
elderly (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) who are also more sensitive
to the renal effects of NSAIDs (see PRECAUTIONS--Renal Effects), extra
caution and reduced dosages (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) should be used
when treating the elderly with Ketorolac. </p>

HEPARIN to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding
time of 6.4 minutes (3.2-11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes (3.4-7.5
min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5-8.5 min) for placebo. Although
these results do not indicate significant interaction between Ketorolac
and warfarin or heparin, the administration of Ketorolac, or other NSAIDs,
to patients taking anticoagulants should be done with caution and patients
should be closely monitored (see PRECAUTIONS--Hematologic Effects). </p>

<p>Intramuscular Ketorolac reduced the diuretic response to FUROSEMIDE
in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20% (mean sodium and
urinary output decreased 17%). </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of oral Ketorolac and PROBENECID resulted
in decreased clearance of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac
plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately 3-fold from 5.4 to 17.8
mcgm.h/mL) and terminal half-life (increased approximately 2-fold from
6.6 to 15.1 hours). </p>

<p>Inhibition of renal LITHIUM clearance, leading to an increase in plasma
lithium concentration, has been reported with some prostaglandin synthesis
inhibiting drugs. The effect of Ketorolac on plasma lithium has not been
studied. </p>

<p>Concomitant administration of METHOTREXATE and some NSAIDs has been
reported to reduce the clearance of methotrexate, enhancing the toxicity
of methotrexate. The effect of Ketorolac on methotrexate clearance has
not been studied. </p>

<p>In post-marketing experience, there have been three reports of a possible
interaction between Ketorolac IM and NON-DEPOLARIZING MUSCLE RELAXANTS,
appearing to enhance the effect of the muscle relaxant. The concurrent
use of Ketorolac with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied. </p>

<p>Intramuscular Ketorolac has been administered concurrently with MORPHINE
in several clinical trials of postoperative pain without evidence of adverse
interactions. </p>

<p>There is no evidence, in animal or human studies, that Ketorolac induces
or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.
</p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse reaction rates from short-term use of NSAIDs are generally from
1/10 to 1/2 the rates associated with long-term use. This is also true
for Ketorolac. Adverse reaction rates also may increase with higher doses
of Ketorolac (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM is indicated for short-term use. Physicians using Ketorolac
IM should be alert for the usual complications of NSAID treatment, and
should be aware that with longer use (exceeding 5 days) of Ketorolac IM,
the frequency and severity of adverse reactions may increase. </p>

<p>Physicians using Ketorolac ORAL should be alert to the relative risks
associated with dose and dose duration as described in ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY-- Clinical Studies. </p>

<p>Physicians using Ketorolac should be alert for the usual complications
of NSAID treatment. </p>

<p>The adverse reactions listed below were reported in clinical trials
with Ketorolac in which patients received up to 20 doses, in 5 days, of
Ketorolac IM 30 mg or up to 4 doses a day from long-term studies of Ketorolac
ORAL 10 mg qid. In addition, adverse reactions that were reported from

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Ketorolac is not a narcotic agonist or antagonist. Subjects did not
show any subjective symptoms or objective signs of drug withdrawal upon
abrupt discontinuation of intravenous or intramuscular dosing. Patients
receiving Ketorolac ORAL for long-term therapy have not developed tolerance
to the drug and there is no pharmacologic basis to expect addiction. Ketorolac
did not exhibit activity in classical animal studies which are reasonable
predictors of opiate analgesic action. In Vitro, ketorolac does not bind
to opiate receptors. These studies demonstrate that ketorolac does not
have central opiate-like activity. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The absence of experience with acute overdosage precludes characterization
of sequelae and assessment of antidotal efficacy at this time. At single
oral doses greater than 100 mg/kg in rats, mice and monkeys, symptoms such
as decreased activity, diarrhea, pallor, labored breathing, rales, and
vomiting were observed. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Ketorolac IM may be used on a regular schedule or prn (&quot;as needed&quot;),
based on the return of pain. For the short-term management of pain on a
regular schedule (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for details of clinical
trials), the recommended initial dose is 30 or 60 mg IM, as a loading dose,
followed by half of the loading dose, i.e., 15 or 30 mg, every 6 hours.
The maximum recommended daily dose is 150 mg for the first day and 120
mg/day thereafter. It is recommended that intramuscular Ketorolac be limited
to short-term therapy (not over 5 days) because the frequency and severity
of adverse events may increase with longer use at recommended doses (see
WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>NOTE: THE INITIAL INTRAMUSCULAR LOADING DOSE SHOULD BE GIVEN ONLY ONCE,
UNLESS THERAPY HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED FOR 3 HALF-LIVES (15-40 HOURS, SEE
HALF-LIFE OF Ketorolac IM IN TABLE IN ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). </p>

<p>The lower end of the dosage range is recommended for patients under
50 kg (110 pounds) of body weight, for patients over 65 years of age, and
for patients with reduced renal function (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
and PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>If prn management is elected, see Individualization of Dosage in ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY for suggestions. </p>

<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate
matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and
container permit. </p>

<p>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPATIBILITY OF Ketorolac IM </p>

<p>Ketorolac IM should not be mixed in small volume (e.g., in a syringe)
with morphine sulfate, meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride
or hydrolyzine hydrochloride; this will result in precipitation of ketorolac
from solution. </p>

<p>Ketorolac ORAL is indicated for the management of pain. The recommended
oral dose is 10 mg prn every 4 to 6 hours for limited duration. Doses of
10 mg qid chronically are not recommended (see WARNINGS, ADVERSE REACTIONS
and ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY--Clinical Studies Sections for details
about relative risks associated with Ketorolac ORAL). </p>

<p>TRANSITION FROM Ketorolac IM TO Ketorolac ORAL </p>

<p>When Ketorolac ORAL is used as follow-on therapy to Ketorolac IM, the
total combined dose should not exceed 120 mg on the day of transition,
including a maximum of 40 mg orally. Subsequent oral dosing should not
exceed the recommended daily maximum of 40 mg. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride, methylphenidate hydrochloride USP, is
a mild central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Methylphenidate hydrochloride
is methyl alpha phenyl-2-piperidine-acetate hydrochloride. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride USP is a white, odorless, fine crystalline
powder. Its solutions are acid to litmus. It is freely soluble in water
and in methanol, soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in chloroform
and in acetone. Its molecular weight is 269.77. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Methylphenidate is a mild central nervous system stimulant. </p>

<p>The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but methylphenidate
presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce
its stimulant effect. </p>

<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism
whereby methylphenidate produces its mental and behavioral effects in children,
nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition
of the central nervous system. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate in the SR tablets is more slowly but as extensively
absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability of the SR
tablet compared to the methylphenidate tablet, measured by the urinary
excretion of methylphenidate major metabolite (alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine
acetic acid) was 105% (49-168%) in children and 101% (85-152%) in adults.
The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3-8.2 hours) for the
SR tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) for the tablets. An average of
67% of SR tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDERS, NARCOLEPSY </p>

<p>Attention Deficit Disorders (previously known as Minimal Brain Dysfunction
in Children). Other terms being used to describe the behavioral syndrome
below include: Hyperkinetic Child Syndrome, Minimal Brain Damage, Minimal
Cerebral Dysfunction, Minor Cerebral Dysfunction. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment
program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological,
educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with a behavioral
syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate
symptoms: moderate-to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity,
emotional lability and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should
not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively
recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability,
and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central
nervous system dysfunction may or may not be warranted. </p>

<p>Special Diagnostic Considerations </p>

<p>Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single
diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical
but of special psychological, educational, and social resources. </p>

<p>Characteristics commonly reported include: chronic history of short
attention span, distractibility, emotional lability, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe
hyperactivity; minor neurological signs and abnormal EEG. Learning may
or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history
and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of one or more
of these characteristics. </p>

<p>Drug treatment is not indicated for all children with this syndrome.
Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms
secondary to environmental factors and/or primary psychiatric disorders,
including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential and
psychosocial intervention is generally necessary. When remedial measures
alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication
will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity
of the child's symptoms. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Marked anxiety, tension, and agitation are contraindications to methylphenidate,
since the drug may aggravate these symptoms. methylphenidate is contraindicated
also in patients known to be hypersensitive to the drug, in patients with
glaucoma, and in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis
of Tourette's syndrome. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Methylphenidate should not be used in children under six years, since
safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established. </p>

<p>Sufficient data on safety and efficacy of long-term use of methylphenidate
in children are not yet available. Although a causal relationship has not
been established, suppression of growth (ie, weight gain, and/or height)
has been reported with the long-term use of stimulants in children. Therefore,
patients requiring long term therapy should be carefully monitored. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate should not be used for severe depression of either exogenous
or endogenous origin. Clinical experience suggests that in psychotic children,
administration of methylphenidate may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance
and thought disorder. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate should not be used for the prevention or treatment of
normal fatigue states. </p>

<p>There is some clinical evidence that methylphenidate may lower the convulsive
threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, with prior EEG abnormalities
in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in absence of history of seizures
and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. Safe concomitant use of anticonvulsants
and methylphenidate has not been established. In the presence of seizures,
the drug should be discontinued. </p>

<p>Use cautiously in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should
be monitored at appropriate intervals in all patients taking methylphenidate,
especially those with hypertension. </p>

<p>Symptoms of visual disturbances have been encountered in rare cases.
Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Methylphenidate may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine.
Use cautiously with pressor agents and MAO inhibitors. </p>

<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate may inhibit
the metabolism of coumarin anti-coagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital,
diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine,
clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs
may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Adequate animal reproduction studies to establish safe use of methylphenidate
during pregnancy have not been conducted. Therefore, until more information
is available, methylphenidate should not be prescribed for women of childbearing
age unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh
the possible risks. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Patients with an element of agitation may react adversely; discontinue
therapy if necessary. </p>

<p>Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged
therapy. </p>

<p>Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of this behavioral syndrome
and should be considered only in light of the complete history and evaluation
of the child. The decision to prescribe methylphenidate should depend on
the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's
symptoms and their appropriateness for his/her age. Prescription should
not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.
</p>

<p>When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment
with methylphenidate is usually not indicated. </p>

<p>Long-term effects of methylphenidate in children have not been well
established. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Methylphenidate may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine.
Use cautiously with pressor agents and MAO inhibitors. </p>

<p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate may inhibit
the metabolism of coumarin anti-coagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital,
diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine,
clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs
may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. </p>

<p>(See Also WARNINGS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Nervousness and insomnia are the most common adverse reactions but are
usually controlled by reducing dosage and omitting the drug in the afternoon
or evening. Other reactions include hypersensitivity (including skin rash,
urticaria, fever, arthralgia, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme
with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic
purpura); anorexia; nausea, dizziness; palpitations; headache, dyskinesia;
drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia;
angina; cardiac arrhythmia; abdominal pain; weight loss during prolonged
therapy. There have been rare reports of Tourette's syndrome. Toxic psychosis
has been reported. Although a definite causal relationship has not been
established, the following have been reported in patients taking this drug:
isolated cases of cerebral arteritis and/or occlusion; leukopenia and/or
anemia; transient depressed mood; a few instances of scalp hair loss. </p>

<p>In children, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss during prolonged
therapy, insomnia, and tachycardia may occur more frequently; however,
any of the other adverse reactions listed above may also occur. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Methylphenidate should be given cautiously to emotionally unstable patients,
such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism, because
such patients may increase dosage on their own initiative. </p>

<p>Chronically abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychic dependence
with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can
occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required
during drug withdrawal, since severe depression as well as the effects
of chronic overactivity can be unmasked. Long-term follow-up may be required
because of the patient's basic personality disturbances. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation
of the central nervous system and from excessive sympathomimetic effects,
may include the following: vomiting, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia,
muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma) euphoria, confusion,
hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia,
palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis, and dryness
of mucous membranes. </p>

<p>Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures. The patient must
be protected against self-injury and against external stimuli that would
aggravate overstimulation already present. If signs and symptoms are not
too severe and the patient is conscious, gastric contents may be evacuated
by induction of emesis or gastric lavage. In the presence of severe intoxication,
use a carefully titrated dosage of a Short-Acting barbiturate Before performing
gastric lavage. </p>

<p>Intensive care must be provided to maintain adequate circulation and
respiratory exchange; external cooling procedures may be required for hyperpyrexia.
</p>

<p>Efficacy of peritoneal dialysis or extracorporeal hemodialysis for methylphenidate
overdosage has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses
of the patient. </p>

<p>ADULTS </p>

<p>Tablets: Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably
30 to 45 minutes before meals. Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some
patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily. In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will
be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late
in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m. </p>

<p>SR Tablets: methylphenidate-SR tablets have a duration of action of
approximately 8 hours. Therefore, methylphenidate-SR tablets may be used
in place of methylphenidate tablets when the 8-hour dosage of methylphenidate-SR
corresponds to the titrated 8-hour dosage of methylphenidate. methylphenidate-SR
tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. </p>

<p>CHILDREN (6 YEARS AND OVER) </p>

<p>methylphenidate should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly
increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. </p>

<p>If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over
a one month period, the drug should be discontinued. </p>

<p>Tablets: Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with
gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. </p>

<p>SR Tablets: methylphenidate-SR tablets have a duration of action of
approximately 8 hours. Therefore, methylphenidate-SR tablets may be used
in place of methylphenidate tablets when the 8-hour dosage of methylphenidate-SR
corresponds to the titrated 8-hour dosage of methylphenidate. methylphenidate-SR
tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. </p>

<p>If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur,
reduce dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. </p>

<p>Methylphenidate should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's
condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily
or permanently discontinued. </p>

<p>Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may
be discontinued after puberty. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic and anticholinergic (antimuscarinic).
</p>

<p>Chemically, Dicyclomine (dicyclomine hydrochloride) is (bicyclohexyl)-1-carboxylic
acid, 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester, hydrochloride with the chemical structure:
</p>

<p>Dicyclomine hydrochloride occurs as a fine, white, crystalline, practically
odorless powder with a bitter taste. It is soluble in water, freely soluble
in alcohol and chloroform, and very slightly soluble in ether. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Dicyclomine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract.
Animal studies indicate that this action is achieved via a dual mechanism:
(1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor
sites with approximately 1/8 the milligram potency of atropine (In Vitro,
guinea pig ileum); and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic)
as evidenced by dicyclomine's antagonism of bradykinin- and histamine-induced
spasms of the isolated guinea pig ileum. Atropine did not affect responses
to these two agonists. In Vivo studies in cats and dogs showed dicyclomine
to be equally potent against acetylcholine (ACh)- or barium chloride (BaCl2)-induced
intestinal spasm while atropine was at least 200 times more potent against
effects of ACh than BaCl2. Tests for mydriatic effects in mice showed that
dicyclomine was approximately 1/500 as potent as atropine: antisialogogue
tests in rabbits showed dicyclomine to be 1/300 as potent as atropine.
</p>

<p>In man, dicyclomine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching
peak values within 60-90 minutes. The principal route of elimination is
via the urine (79.5% of the dose). Excretion also occurs in the feces,
but to a lesser extent (8.4%). Mean half-life of plasma elimination in
one study was determined to be approximately 1.8 hours when plasma concentrations
were measured for 9 hours after a single dose. In subsequent studies, plasma
concentrations were followed for up to 24 hours after a single dose, showing
a secondary phase of elimination with a somewhat longer half-life. Mean
volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is approximately 3.65 L/kg
suggesting extensive distribution in tissues. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients who received
drug, 82% of patients treated for functional bowel/ irritable bowel syndrome
with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg
q.i.d.) demonstrated a favorable clinical response compared with 55% treated
with placebo. (P&lt;.05). In these trials, most of the side effects were
typically anticholinergic in nature (see table) and were reported by 61%
of the patients. </p>

<p>Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from the drug because
of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group).
In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were
tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction
from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46%
of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable
clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated.

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS</b></p>

<p> In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration
can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating).
If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures
instituted. </p>

<p>Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction,
especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment
with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. </p>

<p>Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should
be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such
as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous
work while taking this drug. </p>

<p>Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic
drugs. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term
memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, decreased
anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate
affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours
after discontinuation of the drug. </p>

<p>There are reports that administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride syrup
to infants has been followed by serious respiratory symptoms (dyspnea,
shortness of breath, breathlessness, respiratory collapse, apnea, asphyxia),
seizures, syncope, pulse rate fluctuations, muscular hypotonia, and coma.
Death has been reported. No causal relationship between these effects observed
in infants and dicyclomine administration has been established. Dicyclomine
IS CONTRAINDICATED IN </p>

<p>INFANTS LESS THAN 6 MONTHS OF AGE AND IN NURSING MOTHERS. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS
and PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers and Pediatric Use.) </p>

<p>Safety and efficacy of dicyclomine hydrochloride in children have not
been established. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Use with caution in patients with: </p>

<p>1. Autonomic neuropathy </p>

<p>2. Hepatic or renal disease </p>

<p>3. Ulcerative colitis--large doses may suppress intestinal motility
to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may
precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS) </p>

<p>4. Hyperthyroidism </p>

<p>5. Hypertension </p>

<p>6. Coronary heart disease</p>

<p> 7. Congestive heart failure </p>

<p>8. Cardiac tachyarrhythmia </p>

<p>9. Hiatal hernia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS: reflux esophagitis) </p>

<p>10. Known or suspected prostatic hypertrophy. </p>

<p>Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride,
since it may increase the heart rate. </p>

<p>With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular
blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should
be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such
as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous
work while taking this drug. </p>

<p>Dicyclomine is contraindicated in infants less than 6 months of age
and in nursing mothers. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS:
Nursing Mothers and Pediatric Use.) </p>

<p>In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration
can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating).
If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and a physician contacted.
</p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of
anticholinergic drugs: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of class I (e.g.,
quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines),
benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine),
nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants,
and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. </p>

<p>Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic
drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous
when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also
CONTRAINDICATIONS.) </p>

<p>Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various
drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum
digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize
the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide.
Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents,
simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. </p>

<p>The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric
acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and
those used to test gastric secretion. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Inpairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicity
or mutagenicity. </p>

<p>Long-term studies in animals to determine carcinogenic potential are
not known to have been conducted. </p>

<p>In studies in rats at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day, Dicyclomine produced
no deleterious effects on breeding, conception, or parturition. </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category B </p>

<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses
up to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose based on 160 mg/day (3
mg/kg) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the
fetus due to dicyclomine. Epidemiologic studies in pregnant women with
products containing dicyclomine hydrochloride (at doses up to 40 mg/day)
have not shown that dicyclomine increases the risk of fetal abnormalities
if administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. There are, however,
no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women at the recommended
doses (80-160 mg/day). Because animal reproduction studies are not always
predictive of human response Dicyclomine as indicated for functional bowel/irritable
bowel syndrome should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
</p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>Since dicyclomine hydrochloride has been reported to be excreted in
human milk, Dicyclomine IS CONTRAINDICATED IN NURSING MOTHERS. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p>Pediatric Use (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Nursing
Mothers.) Dicyclomine IS CONTRAINDICATED IN INFANTS LESS THAN 6 MONTHS
OF AGE. </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

following the I.M. injection of the drug. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Tolerance, abuse, or dependence with Dicyclomine has not been reported.
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs And Symptoms </p>

<p>The signs and symptoms of overdosage are headache; nausea; vomiting;
blurred vision; dilated pupils; hot, dry skin; dizziness; dryness of the
mouth; difficulty in swallowing; and CNS stimulation. A curare-like action
may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and
possible paralysis). </p>

<p>Oral LD50 </p>

<p>The acute oral LD50 of the drug is 625 mg/kg in mice. </p>

<p>Minimum Human Lethal Dose/Maximum Human Dose Recorded </p>

<p>The amount of drug in a single dose that is ordinarily associated with
symptoms of overdosage or that is likely to be life threatening, has not
been defined. The maximum human oral dose recorded was 600 mg by mouth
in a 10-month-old child and approximately 1500 mg in an adult, each of
whom survived. </p>

<p>In three of the infants who died following administration of dicyclomine
hydrochloride (see WARNINGS), the blood concentrations of drug were 200,
220, and 505 ng/mL, respectively. </p>

<p>Dialysis </p>

<p>It is not known if Dicyclomine is dialyzable. </p>

<p>Treatment </p>

<p>Treatment should consist of gastric lavage, emetics, and activated charcoal.
Sedatives (e.g., short-acting barbiturates, benzodiazepines) may be used
for management of overt signs of excitement. If indicated, an appropriate
parenteral cholinergic agent may be used as an antidote. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>DOSAGE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENT NEEDS. (See ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY.) </p>

<p>Adults--Oral </p>

<p>The only oral dose clearly shown to be effective is 160 mg per day (in
4 equally divided doses). Since this dose is associated with a significant
incidence of side effects, it is prudent to begin with 80 mg per day (in
4 equally divided doses). Depending upon the patient's response during
the first week of therapy, the dose should be increased to 160 mg per day
unless side effects limit dosage escalation. </p>

<p>If efficacy is not achieved within 2 weeks or side effects require doses
below 80 mg per day, the drug should be discontinued. Documented safety
data are not available for doses above 80 mg daily for periods longer than
2 weeks. </p>

<p>Adults--Intramuscular injection </p>

<p>NOT FOR INTRAVENOUS USE. </p>

<p>The intramuscular dosage form is to be used temporarily when the patient
cannot take oral medication. Intramuscular injection is about twice as
bioavailable as oral dosage forms; consequently, the recommended intramuscular
dose is 80 mg daily (in 4 equally divided doses). </p>

<p>Oral dicyclomine hydrochloride should be started as soon as possible
and the intramuscular form should not be used for periods longer than 1
or 2 days. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Imipramine, the original tricyclic antidepressant, is a member of the
dibenzazepine group of compounds. It is designated 5-(3- (Dimethylamino)
propyl)-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz (b,f)azepine monohydrochloride. Imipramine
hydrochloride USP is a white to off- white, odorless, or practically odorless
crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and in alcohol, soluble
in acetone, and insoluble in ether and in benzene. Its molecular weight
is 316.87. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The mechanism of action of Imipramine is not definitely known. However,
it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system.
The clinical effect is hypothesized as being due to potentiation of adrenergic
synapses by blocking uptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. The mode
of action of the drug in controlling childhood enuresis is thought to be
apart from its antidepressant effect. </p>

<p>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY &amp; TOXICOLOGY </p>

<p>A. Acute: Oral LD50 ranges are as follows: </p>

<p>Rat 355 to 682 mg/kg </p>

<p>Dog 100 to 215 mg/kg </p>

<p>Depending on the dosage in both species, toxic signs proceeded progressively
from depression, irregular respiration and ataxia to convulsions and death.
B. Reproduction/Teratogenic: The overall evaluation may be summed up in
the following manner: </p>

<p>Oral: Independent studies in three species (rat, mouse and rabbit) revealed
that when Imipramine is administered orally in doses up to approximately
2 1/2 times the maximum human dose in the first 2 species and up to 25
times the maximum human dose in the third species, the drug is essentially
free from teratogenic potential. In the three species studied, only one
instance of fetal abnormality occurred (in the rabbit) and in that study
there was likewise an abnormality in the control group. However, evidence
does exist from the rat studies that some systemic and embryotoxic potential
is demonstrable. This is manifested by reduced litter size, a slight increase
in the stillborn rate and a reduction in the mean birth weight. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Depression: For the relief of symptoms of depression. Endogenous depression
is more likely to be alleviated than other depressive states. One to three
weeks of treatment may be needed before optimal therapeutic effects are
evident. Childhood Enuresis: May be useful as temporary adjunctive therapy
in reducing enuresis in children aged 6 years and older, after possible
organic causes have been excluded by appropriate tests. In patients having
daytime symptoms of frequency and urgency, examination should include voiding
cystourethrography and cystoscopy, as necessary. The effectiveness of treatment
may decrease with continued drug administration. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibiting compounds is contraindicated.
Hyperpyretic crises or severe convulsive seizures may occur in patients
receiving such combinations. The potentiation of adverse effects can be
serious, or even fatal. When it is desired to substitute Imipramine in
patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, as long an interval should
elapse as the clinical situation will allow, with a minimum of 14 days.
Initial dosage should be low and increases should be gradual and cautiously
prescribed. The drug is contraindicated during the acute recovery period
after a myocardial infarction. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to
this compound should not be given the drug. The possibility of cross-sensitivity
to other dibenzazepine compounds should be kept in mind. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Children: A dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day of Imipramine should not be exceeded
in childhood. ECG changes of unknown significance have been reported in
pediatric patients with doses twice this amount. </p>

<p>Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given to: </p>

<p>patients with cardiovascular disease because of the possibility of conduction
defects, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,
strokes and tachycardia. These patients require cardiac surveillance at
all dosage levels of the drug; </p>

<p>patients with increased intraocular pressure, history of urinary retention,
or history of narrow-angle glaucoma because of the drug's anticholinergic
properties; </p>

<p>hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication because of the
possibility of cardiovascular toxicity; </p>

<p>patients with a history of seizure disorder because this drug has been
shown to lower the seizure threshold; </p>

<p>patients receiving guanethidine, clonidine, or similar agents, since
Imipramine may block the pharmacologic effects of these drugs; </p>

<p>patients receiving methylphenidate hydrochloride. Since methylphenidate
hydrochloride may inhibit the metabolism of Imipramine, downward dosage
adjustment of imipramine hydrochloride may be required when given concomitantly
with methylphenidate hydrochloride. </p>

<p>Imipramine may enhance the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. Therefore,
it should be borne in mind that the dangers inherent in a suicide attempt
or accidental overdosage with the drug may be increased for the patient
who uses excessive amounts of alcohol. (See PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p>Since Imipramine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required
for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an
automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned accordingly. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>An ECG recording should be taken prior to the initiation of larger-than-usual
doses of Imipramine and at appropriate intervals thereafter until steady
state is achieved. (Patients with any evidence of cardiovascular disease
require cardiac surveillance at all dosage levels of the drug. See WARNINGS.)
Elderly patients and patients with cardiac disease or a prior history of
cardiac disease are at special risk of developing the cardiac abnormalities
associated with the use of Imipramine. </p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the possibility of suicide in seriously
depressed patients is inherent in the illness and may persist until significant
remission occurs. Such patients should be carefully supervised during the
early phase of treatment with Imipramine, and may require hospitalization.
Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Hypomanic
or manic episodes may occur, particularly in patients with cyclic disorders.
Such reactions may necessitate discontinuation of the drug. If needed,
Imipramine may be resumed in lower dosage when these episodes are relieved.
</p>

<p>Administration of a tranquilizer may be useful in controlling such episodes.
An activation of the psychosis may occasionally be observed in schizophrenic
patients and may require reduction of dosage and the addition of a phenothiazine.
</p>

<p>Concurrent administration of Imipramine with electroshock therapy may
increase the hazards; such treatment should be limited to those patients
for whom it is essential, since there is limited clinical experience. </p>

<p>Patients taking imipramine hydrochloride should avoid excessive exposure
to sunlight since there have been reports of photosensitization. </p>

<p>Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported
with imipramine hydrochloride use. </p>

<p>Imipramine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with
significantly impaired renal or hepatic function. </p>

<p>Patients who develop a fever and a sore throat during therapy with imipramine
hydrochloride should have leukocyte and differential blood counts performed.
Imipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued if there is evidence of
pathological neutrophil depression. </p>

<p>Prior to elective surgery, imipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued
for as long as the clinical situation will allow. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>DRUGS METABOLIZED BY P450 2D6: The biochemical activity of the drug
metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced
in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7%-10% of Caucasians are
so-called &quot;poor metabolizers&quot;); reliable estimates of the prevalence
of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations
are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma
concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.
Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase
in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in
plasma AUC of the TCA). </p>

<p>In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and
make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who
is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one
of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit
cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme
(quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many
other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics
propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit
P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which
SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree
of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs
with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.
Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating
TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long
half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be
necessary). </p>

<p>Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit
cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for
either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever
one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose
of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor
TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another
drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. </p>

<p>The plasma concentration of imipramine may increase when the drug is
given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine)
and decrease by concomitant administration with hepatic enzyme inducers
(e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine
may therefore be necessary. </p>

<p>In occasional susceptible patients or in those receiving anticholinergic
drugs (including antiparkinsonism agents) in addition, the atropine-like
effects may become more pronounced (e.g., paralytic ileus). Close supervision
and careful adjustment of dosage is required when imipramine hydrochloride
is administered concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. </p>

<p>Avoid the use of preparations, such as decongestants and local anesthetics,
that contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine),
since it has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate
the effects of catecholamines. </p>

<p>Caution should be exercised when imipramine hydrochloride is used with
agents that lower blood pressure. Imipramine hydrochloride may potentiate
the effects of CNS depressant drugs. </p>

<p>Patients should be warned that imipramine hydrochloride may enhance
the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Usage During Pregnancy And Lactation: Animal reproduction studies have
yielded inconclusive results. (See also ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY &amp; TOXICOLOGY.)
There have been no well-controlled studies conducted with pregnant women
to determine the effect of Imipramine on the fetus. However, there have
been clinical reports of congenital malformations associated with the use
of the drug. Although a causal relationship between these effects and the
drug could not be established, the possibility of fetal risk from the maternal
ingestion of Imipramine cannot be excluded. Therefore, Imipramine should
be used in women who are or might become pregnant only if the clinical
condition clearly justifies potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Limited data suggest that Imipramine is likely to be excreted in human
breast milk. As a general rule, a woman taking a drug should not nurse
since the possibility exists that the drug may be excreted in breast milk
and be harmful to the child. </p>

<p>Usage In Children: The effectiveness of the drug in children for conditions
other than nocturnal enuresis has not been established. The safety and
effectiveness of the drug as temporary adjunctive therapy for nocturnal
enuresis in children less than 6 years of age has not been established.
</p>

<p>The safety of the drug for long-term, chronic use as adjunctive therapy
for nocturnal enuresis in children 6 years of age or older has not been
established; consideration should be given to instituting a drug-free period
following an adequate therapeutic trial with a favorable response. </p>

<p>A dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day should not be exceeded in childhood. ECG changes
of unknown significance have been reported in pediatric patients with doses
twice this amount. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Note: Although the listing which follows includes a few adverse reactions
which have not been reported with this specific drug, the pharmacological
similarities among the tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each
of the reactions be considered when Imipramine is administered. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia,
palpitation, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart block, ECG changes,
precipitation of congestive heart failure, stroke. </p>

<p>Psychiatric: Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations,
disorientation, delusions; anxiety, restlessness, agitation; insomnia and
nightmares; hypomania; exacerbation of psychosis. </p>

<p>Neurological: Numbness, tingling, paresthesias of extremities; incoordination,
ataxia, tremors; peripheral neuropathy; extrapyramidal symptoms; seizures,
alterations in EEG patterns; tinnitus. </p>

<p>Anticholinergic: Dry mouth, and, rarely, associated sublingual adenitis;
blurred vision, disturbances of accommodation, mydriasis; constipation,
paralytic ileus; urinary retention, delayed micturition, dilation of the
urinary tract. </p>

<p>Allergic: Skin rash, petechiae, urticaria, itching, photosensitization;
edema (general or of face and tongue); drug fever; cross-sensitivity with
desipramine. Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis;
eosinophilia; purpura; thrombocytopenia. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting, anorexia, epigastric distress,
diarrhea; peculiar taste, stomatitis, abdominal cramps, black tongue. </p>

<p>Endocrine: Gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea
in the female; increased or decreased libido, impotence; testicular swelling;
elevation or depression of blood sugar levels; inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone (ADH) secretion syndrome. </p>

<p>Other: Jaundice (simulating obstructive); altered liver function; weight
gain or loss; perspiration; flushing; urinary frequency; drowsiness; dizziness,
weakness and fatigue; headache; parotid swelling; alopecia; proneness to
falling. </p>

<p>Withdrawal Symptoms: Though not indicative of addiction, abrupt cessation
of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache and malaise.
</p>

<p>NOTE: In enuretic children treated with Imipramine the most common adverse
reactions have been nervousness, sleep disorders, tiredness, and mild gastrointestinal
disturbances. These usually disappear during continued drug administration
or when dosage is decreased. Other reactions which have been reported include
constipation, convulsions, anxiety, emotional instability, syncope, and
collapse. All of the adverse reactions reported with adult use should be
considered. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Children have been reported to be more sensitive than adults to an acute
overdosage of imipramine hydrochloride. An acute overdose of any amount
in infants or young children, especially, must be considered serious and
potentially fatal. </p>

<p>Signs And Symptoms: These may vary in severity depending upon factors
such as the amount of drug absorbed, the age of the patient, and the interval
between drug ingestion and the start of treatment. Blood and urine levels
of Imipramine may not reflect the severity of poisoning; they have chiefly
a qualitative rather than quantitative value, and are unreliable indicators
in the clinical management of the patient. </p>

<p>CNS abnormalities may include drowsiness, stupor, coma, ataxia, restlessness,
agitation, hyperactive reflexes, muscle rigidity, athetoid and choreiform
movements, and convulsions. </p>

<p>Cardiac abnormalities may include arrhythmia, tachycardia, ECG evidence
of impaired conduction, and signs of congestive failure. Respiratory depression,
cyanosis, hypotension, shock, vomiting, hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis
may also be present. </p>

<p>Treatment: The recommended treatment for overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants
may change periodically. Therefore, it is recommended that the physician
contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Because
CNS involvement, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia can occur
suddenly, hospitalization and close observation may be necessary, even
when the amount ingested is thought to be small or the initial degree of
intoxication appears slight or moderate. All patients with ECG abnormalities
should have continuous cardiac monitoring and be closely observed until
well after cardiac status has returned to normal; relapses may occur after
apparent recovery. In the alert patient, empty the stomach promptly by
lavage. In the obtunded patient, secure the airway with a cuffed endotracheal
tube before beginning lavage (do not induce emesis). Instillation of activated
charcoal slurry may help reduce absorption of imipramine. </p>

<p>Minimize external stimulation to reduce the tendency to convulsions.
If anticonvulsants are necessary, diazepam and phenytoin may be useful.
Maintain adequate respiratory exchange. Do not use respiratory stimulants.
</p>

<p>Shock should be treated with supportive measures, such as appropriate
position, intravenous fluids, and, if necessary, a vasopressor agent. The
use of corticosteroids in shock is controversial and may be contraindicated
in cases of overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants. Digitalis may increase
conduction abnormalities and further irritate an already sensitized myocardium.
If congestive heart failure necessitates rapid digitalization, particular
care must be exercised. </p>

<p>Hyperpyrexia should be controlled by whatever external means are available,
including ice packs and cooling sponge baths, if necessary. Hemodialysis,
peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions and forced diuresis have been
generally reported as ineffective because of the rapid fixation of Imipramine
in tissues. Blood and urine levels of Imipramine may not correlate with
the degree of intoxication, and are unreliable indicators in the clinical
management of the patient. </p>

<p>The slow intravenous administration of physostigmine salicylate has
been used as a last resort to reverse severe CNS anticholinergic manifestations
of overdosage with tricyclic antidepressants; however, it should not be
used routinely, since it may induce seizures and cholinergic crises. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>DEPRESSION </p>

<p>Lower dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents.
Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients as compared to hospitalized
patients who will be under close supervision. Dosage should be initiated
at a low level and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response
and any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication
may be required for a longer period of time, at the lowest dose that will
maintain remission. </p>

<p>Usual Adult Dose: </p>

<p>Hospitalized Patients-- Initially, 100 mg/day in divided doses gradually
increased to 200 mg/day as required. If no response after two weeks, increase
to 250-300 mg/day. </p>

<p>Outpatients--Initially, 75 mg/day increased to 150 mg/day. Dosages over
200 mg/day are not recommended. Maintenance, 50-150 mg/day. </p>

<p>Adolescent And Geriatric Patients--Initially, 30-40 mg/day; it is generally
not necessary to exceed 100 mg/day. </p>

<p>CHILDHOOD ENURESIS </p>

<p>Initially, an oral dose of 25 mg/day should be tried in children aged
6 and older. Medication should be given one hour before bedtime. If a satisfactory
response does not occur within one week, increase the dose to 50 mg nightly
in children under 12 years; children over 12 may receive up to 75 mg nightly.
A daily dose greater than 75 mg does not enhance efficacy and tends to
increase side effects. Evidence suggests that in early night bedwetters,
the drug is more effective given earlier and in divided amounts, i.e.,
25 mg in midafternoon, repeated at bedtime. Consideration should be given
to instituting a drug-free period following an adequate therapeutic trial
with a favorable response. Dosage should be tapered off gradually rather
than abruptly discontinued; this may reduce the tendency to relapse. Children
who relapse when the drug is discontinued do not always respond to a subsequent
course of treatment. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day should not be exceeded. ECG
changes of unknown significance have been reported in pediatric patients
with doses twice this amount. </p>

<p>The safety and effectiveness of Imipramine as temporary adjunctive therapy
for nocturnal enuresis in children less than 6 years of age has not been
established. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Each capsule contains Isometheptene Mucate 65 mg., Dichloralphenazone
100 mg., and Acetaminophen 325 mg. Isometheptene Mucate is a white crystalline
powder having a characteristic aromatic odor and bitter taste. It is an
unsaturated aliphatic amine with sympathomimetic properties. Dichloralphenazone
is a white, microcrystalline powder, with slight odor and tastes saline
at first, becoming acrid. It is a mild sedative. Acetaminophen, a non-salicylate,
occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder possessing a slightly bitter
taste. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Isometheptene Mucate, a sympathomimetic amine, acts by constricting
dilated cranial and cerebral arterioles, thus reducing the stimuli that
lead to vascular headaches. Dichloralphenazone, a mild sedative, reduces
the patient's emotional reaction to the pain of both vascular and tension
headaches. Acetaminophen raises the threshold to painful stimuli, thus
exerting an analgesic effect against all types of headaches. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Based on a review of this drug (isometheptene mucate) by the National
Academy of Sciences- National Research Council and/ or other information,
FDA has classified the other indication as &quot;possibly&quot; effective
in the treatment of migraine headache. Final classification of the less-than-effective
indication requires further investigation. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Isometheptene/dichloralphenazone/acetaminophen is contraindicated in
glaucoma and/or severe cases of renal disease, hypertension, organic heart
disease, hepatic disease and in those patients who are on monoamine-oxidase
(MAO) inhibitor therapy. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Caution should be observed in hypertension, peripheral vascular disease
and after recent cardiovascular attacks. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Chemically, Morphine Sulfate is, Morphinan- 3,6-diol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-
17-methyl-, (5alpha,6alpha)-, sulfate (2:1) (salt), pentahydrate. Morphine
Sulfate acts as a narcotic analgesic. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The major effects of morphine are on the central nervous system and
the bowel. Opioids act as agonists, interacting with stereospecific and
saturable binding sites or receptors in the brain and other tissues. </p>

<p>Morphine is about two-thirds absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
with the maximum analgesic effect occurring 60 minutes post administration.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Morphine is indicated for the relief of severe acute and severe chronic
pain. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to morphine; respiratory insufficiency or depression;
severe CNS depression; attack of bronchial asthma; heart failure secondary
to chronic lung disease; cardiac arrhythmias; increased intracranial or
cerebrospinal pressure; head injuries; brain tumor; acute alcoholism; delirium
tremens; convulsive disorders; after biliary tract surgery; suspected surgical
abdomen; surgical anastomosis; concomitantly with MAO inhibitors or within
14 days of such treatment. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Morphine can cause tolerance, psychological and physical dependence.
Withdrawal will occur on abrupt discontinuation or administration of a
narcotic antagonist. Interaction With Other Central-Nervous-System Depressants--Morphine
should be used with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently
receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines,
other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and
other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Respiratory depression, hypotension,
and profound sedation or coma may result. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure- -The respiratory
depressant effects of morphine and its capacity to elevate cerebrospinal-fluid
pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of increased intracranial
pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce side effects that may obscure
the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, morphine
must be used with caution and only if it is deemed essential. Asthma And
Other Respiratory Conditions--Morphine should be used with caution in patients
having an acute asthmatic attack, in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease or cor pulmonale, and in individuals with a substantially decreased
respiratory reserve, preexisting respiratory depression, hypoxia, or hypercapnia.
In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of narcotics may decrease
respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to
the point of apnea. </p>

<p>Hypotensive Effect--The administration of morphine may result in severe
hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain his blood pressure
has already been compromised by a depleted blood volume or concurrent administration
of such drugs as the phenothiazines or certain anesthetics. </p>

<p>Special-Risk Patients--Morphine should be given with caution and the
initial dose should be reduced in certain patients, such as the elderly
or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function,
hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture.
Acute Abdominal Conditions--The administration of morphine or other narcotics
may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal
conditions. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: </p>

<p>Use In Ambulatory Patients--Morphine may impair the mental and/or physical
abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks,
such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned
accordingly. </p>

<p>Morphine, like other narcotics, may produce orthostatic hypotension
in ambulatory patients. </p>

<p>Patients should be cautioned about the combined effects of alcohol or
other central nervous system depressants with morphine. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>Generally, effects of morphine may be potentiated by alkalizing agents
and antagonized by acidifying agents. Analgesic effect of morphine is potentiated
by chlorpromazine and methocarbamol. CNS depressants such as anaesthetics,
hypnotics, barbiturates, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, glutethimide,
sedatives, MAO inhibitors (including procarbazine hydrochloride), antihistamines,
beta-blockers (propranolol), alcohol, furazolidone and other narcotics
may enhance the depressant effects of morphine. Morphine may increase anticoagulant
activity of coumarin and other anticoagulants. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENICITY/MUTAGENICITY: </p>

<p>Long-term studies to determine the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential
of morphine are not available. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects--Pregnancy Category C: Animal production studies
have not been conducted with morphine. It is also not known whether morphine
can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect
reproduction capacity. Morphine should be given to a pregnant woman only
if clearly needed. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY: </p>

<p>Morphine readily crosses the placental barrier and, if administered
during labor, may lead to respiratory depression in the neonate. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: </p>

<p>Morphine has been detected in human milk. For this reason, caution should
be exercised when morphine is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USAGE: </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Generally, effects of morphine may be potentiated by alkalizing agents
and antagonized by acidifying agents. Analgesic effect of morphine is potentiated
by chlorpromazine and methocarbamol. CNS depressants such as anaesthetics,
hypnotics, barbiturates, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, glutethimide,
sedatives, MAO inhibitors (including procarbazine hydrochloride), antihistamines,
beta-blockers (propranolol), alcohol, furazolidone and other narcotics
may enhance the depressant effects of morphine. Morphine may increase anticoagulant
activity of coumarin and other anticoagulants. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>THE MAJOR HAZARDS OF MORPHINE AS OF OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, ARE RESPIRATORY
DEPRESSION AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, CIRCULATORY DEPRESSION, RESPIRATORY
ARREST, SHOCK, AND CARDIAC ARREST HAVE OCCURRED. </p>

<p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness,
dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem
to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering
severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse
reactions may be alleviated in the ambulatory patient if he lies down.
</p>

<p>Other adverse reactions include the following: </p>

<p>Central Nervous System--Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, insomnia,
agitation, disorientation, and visual disturbances. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Dry mouth, anorexia, constipation, and biliary tract
spasm. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Flushing of the face, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness,
and syncope. </p>

<p>Genitourinary--Urinary retention or hesitancy, anti-diuretic effect,
and reduced libido and/or potency. </p>

<p>Allergic--Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, edema, and, rarely
hemorrhagic urticaria. </p>

<p>TREATMENT OF THE MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE REACTIONS: </p>

<p>Constipation--Ample intake of water or other liquids should be encouraged.
Concomitant administration of a stool softener and a peristaltic stimulant
with the narcotic analgesic can be an effective preventive measure for
those patients in need of therapeutics. If elimination does not occur for
two days, an enema should be administered to prevent impaction. </p>

<p>In the event diarrhea occurs, seepage around a fecal impaction is a
possible cause to consider before antidiarrheal measures are employed.
</p>

<p>Nausea And Vomiting--Phenothiazines and antihistamines can be effective
treatments for nausea of the medullary and vestibular sources respectively.
However, these drugs may potentiate the side effects of the narcotics or
the antinauseant. </p>

<p>Drowsiness (Sedation)--Once pain control is achieved, undesirable sedation
can be minimized by titrating the dosage to a level that just maintains
a tolerable pain or pain free state. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: </p>

<p>Morphine Sulfate, narcotic, is a Schedule II controlled substance under
the Federal Controlled Substance Act. As with other narcotics, some patients
may develop a physical and psychological dependence on morphine. They may
increase dosage without consulting a physician and subsequently may develop
a physical dependence on the drug. In such cases, abrupt discontinuance
may precipitate typical withdrawal symptoms, including convulsions. Therefore
the drug should be withdrawn gradually from any patient known to be taking
excessive dosages over a long period of time. </p>

<p>In treating the terminally ill patient the benefit of pain relief may
outweigh the possibility of drug dependence. THE CHANCE OF DRUG DEPENDENCE
IS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED WHEN THE PATIENT IS PLACED ON SCHEDULED NARCOTIC
PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF A &quot;PAIN TO RELIEF-OF-PAIN&quot; CYCLE TYPICAL
OF A PRN REGIMEN. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Signs And Symptoms: Serious overdose with morphine is characterized
by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal
volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing
to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold or clammy skin, and
sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory
collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. </p>

<p>Treatment: Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment
of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and
the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist
naloxone is a specific antidote against respiratory depression which may
result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics, including morphine.
Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone (usual initial adult dose: 0.4
mg) should be administered, preferably by the intravenous route and simultaneously
with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action
of morphine may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept
under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should
be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. </p>

<p>An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically
significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. </p>

<p>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other supportive measures
should be employed as indicated. </p>

<p>Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Usual Adult Oral Dose: 10 to 30 mg every 4 hours or as directed by physician.
Dosage is a patient dependent variable, therefore increased dosage may
be required to achieve adequate analgesia. For control of chronic, agonizing
pain in patients with certain terminal disease, this drug should be administered
on a regularly scheduled basis, every 4 hours, at the lowest dosage level
that will achieve adequate analgesia. Note: Medication may suppress respiration
in the elderly, the very ill, and those patients with respiratory problems,
therefore lower doses may be required. </p>

<p>MORPHINE DOSAGE REDUCTION: During the first two to three days of effective
pain relief, the patient may sleep for many hours. This can be misinterpreted
as the effect of excessive analgesic dosing rather than the first sign
of relief in a pain exhausted patient. The dose, therefore, should be maintained
for at least three days before reduction, if respiratory activity and other
vital signs are adequate. </p>

<p>Following successful relief of severe pain, periodic attempts to reduce
the narcotic dose should be made. Smaller doses or complete discontinuation
of the narcotic analgesic may become feasible due to a physiologic change
or the improved mental state of the patient. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Each teaspoon (5 mL) of Promethazine with codeine contains 10 mg codeine
phosphate (Warning--may be habit-forming) and 6.25 mg promethazine hydrochloride.
</p>

<p>Codeine is one of the naturally occurring phenanthrene alkaloids of
opium derived from the opium poppy; it is classified pharmacologically
as a narcotic analgesic. Codeine phosphate may be chemically named as (5alpha,
6alpha)-7,8- didehydro-4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-ol phosphate
(1:1) (salt) hemihydrate. </p>

<p>The phosphate salt of codeine occurs as white, needle-shaped crystals
or white crystalline powder. Codeine phosphate is freely soluble in water
and slightly soluble in alcohol with a molecular weight of 406.37. The
empirical formula is C18H21NO3.H3PO4.1/2H2O, and the stereochemistry is
5alpha, 6alpha isomer as indicated in the structure. </p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride is a racemic compound; the empirical formula
is C17H20N2S.HCl and its molecular weight is 320.88. </p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride, a phenothiazine derivative, is designated
chemically as N,N,alpha-trimethyl-10H-phenothiazine-10-ethanamine monohydrochloride.
</p>

<p>Promethazine hydrochloride occurs as a white to faint yellow, practically
odorless, crystalline powder which slowly oxidizes and turns blue on prolonged
exposure to air. It is soluble in water and freely soluble in alcohol.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects
on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic
effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise
sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear
to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically,
but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder,
with less sedation, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal, urinary,
and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure,
but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than
morphine. </p>

<p>Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine
at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects
are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine. </p>

<p>Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects
on the cardiovascular system. </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the
chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting
center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea
is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine. </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible
for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral
administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous
blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus,
and sweating. </p>

<p>Codeine and its salts are well absorbed following both oral and parenteral
administration. Codeine is about 2/3 as effective orally as parenterally.
Codeine is metabolized primarily in the liver by enzymes of the endoplasmic
reticulum, where it undergoes O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and partial
conjugation with glucuronic acid. The drug is excreted primarily in the
urine, largely as inactive metabolites and small amounts of free and conjugated
morphine. Negligible amounts of codeine and its metabolites are found in
the feces. </p>

<p>Following oral or subcutaneous administration of codeine, the onset
of analgesia occurs within 15 to 30 minutes and lasts for four to six hours.
</p>

<p>The cough-depressing action, in animal studies, was observed to occur
15 minutes after oral administration of codeine, peak action at 45 to 60
minutes after ingestion. The duration of action, which is dose-dependent,
usually did not exceed 3 hours. </p>

<p>PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs structurally
from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side
chain and no ring substitution. It is thought that this configuration is
responsible for its lack (1/10 that of chlorpromazine) of dopaminergic
(CNS) action. </p>

<p>Promethazine is an H1 receptor blocking agent. In addition to its antihistaminic
action, it provides clinically useful sedative and antiemetic effects.
In therapeutic dosages, promethazine produces no significant effects on
the cardiovascular system. </p>

<p>Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical
effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally
last four to six hours, although they may persist as long as 12 hours.
Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds; the
sulfoxides of promethazine and N-demethylpromethazine are the predominant
metabolites appearing in the urine. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Promethazine with codeine is indicated for the temporary relief of coughs
and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergy or the common cold.
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Codeine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity
to the drug. </p>

<p>Promethazine is contraindicated in individuals known to be hypersensitive
or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines.
Antihistamines and codeine are both contraindicated for use in the treatment
of lower respiratory tract symptoms, including asthma. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Dosage of codeine SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED if cough fails to respond;
an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible
underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease.
</p>

<p>Codeine may cause or aggravate constipation. </p>

<p>Respiratory depression leading to arrest, coma, and death has occurred
with the use of codeine antitussives in young children, particularly in
the under-one year infants whose ability to deactivate the drug is not
fully developed. </p>

<p>Administration of codeine may be accompanied by histamine release and
should be used with caution in atopic children. </p>

<p>Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure </p>

<p>The respiratory-depressant effects of narcotic analgesics and their
capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated
in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or a preexisting
increase in intracranial pressure. Narcotics may produce adverse reactions
which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. </p>

<p>Asthma And Other Respiratory Conditions </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics or cough suppressants, including codeine, should
not be used in asthmatic patients (see &quot;Contraindications&quot; ).
Nor should they be used in acute febrile illness associated with productive
cough or in chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability
to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious
effect on the patient's respiratory function. </p>

<p>Hypotensive Effect </p>

<p>Codeine may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.
</p>

<p>PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>Promethazine may cause marked drowsiness. Ambulatory patients should
be cautioned against such activities as driving or operating dangerous
machinery until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from
promethazine therapy. </p>

<p>The sedative action of promethazine hydrochloride is additive to the
sedative effects of central nervous system depressants; therefore, agents
such as alcohol, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers
should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence
of promethazine hydrochloride. When given concomitantly with promethazine
hydrochloride, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half,
and the dose of analgesic depressants, such as morphine or meperidine,
should be reduced by one quarter to one-half. </p>

<p>Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. This should be taken into
consideration when administering to persons with known seizure disorders
or when giving in combination with narcotics or local anesthetics which
may also affect seizure threshold. </p>

<p>Sedative drugs or CNS depressants should be avoided in patients with
a history of sleep apnea. </p>

<p>Antihistamines should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle
glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and urinary
bladder obstruction due to symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy and narrowing
of the bladder neck. </p>

<p>Administration of promethazine has been associated with reported cholestatic
jaundice. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the drug combination-
promethazine and codeine. It is not known whether this drug combination
can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect
reproduction capacity. Promethazine with codeine should be given to a pregnant
woman only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, should be administered with
caution and the initial dose reduced in patients with acute abdominal conditions,
convulsive disorders, significant hepatic or renal impairment, fever, hypothyroidism,
Addison's disease, ulcerative colitis, prostatic hypertrophy, in patients
with recent gastrointestinal or urinary tract surgery, and in the very
young or elderly or debilitated patients.</p>

<p> Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular
disease or with impairment of liver function. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Promethazine with codeine may cause marked drowsiness or may impair
the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially
hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory
patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is
known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from Promethazine with codeine
therapy. Children should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike
riding or in other hazardous activities. </p>

<p>The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants,
including narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers,
may have an additive effect and should be avoided or their dosage reduced.
</p>

<p>Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements
or unusual sensitivity to sunlight. </p>

<p>Codeine, like other narcotic analgesics, may produce orthostatic hypotension
in some ambulatory patients. Patients should be cautioned accordingly.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, an initial small test dose is
advisable to allow observation of any excessive narcotic effects or MAOI
interaction.</p>

<p> PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>The sedative action of promethazine is additive to the effects of other
central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, narcotic analgesics,
sedatives, hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore,
these agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients
receiving promethazine. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Because narcotic analgesics may increase biliary tract pressure, with
resultant increases in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of
these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after a narcotic analgesic
has been given. </p>

<p>The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving
therapy with promethazine hydrochloride: </p>

<p>Pregnancy Tests </p>

<p>Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between
HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.
</p>

<p>Glucose Tolerance Test </p>

<p>An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving
promethazine. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic
potential of codeine or of promethazine, nor are there other animal or
human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility
with these agents. Codeine has been reported to show no evidence of carcinogenicity
or mutagenicity in a variety of test systems, including the micronucleus
and sperm abnormality assays and the Salmonella assay. Promethazine was
nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects--Pregnancy Category C </p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>A study in rats and rabbits reported no teratogenic effect of codeine
administered during the period of organogenesis in doses ranging from 5
to 120 mg/kg. In the rat, doses at the 120-mg/kg level, in the toxic range
for the adult animal, were associated with an increase in embryo resorption
at the time of implantation. In another study a single 100-mg/kg dose of
codeine administered to pregnant mice reportedly resulted in delayed ossification
in the offspring. </p>

<p>There are no studies in humans, and the significance of these findings
to humans, if any, is not known. </p>

<p>PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies
at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine. These doses are 8.3 and
16.7 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for
a 50-kg subject. </p>

<p>Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation,
and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary
study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines,
including promethazine, have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents,
the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel
those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of promethazine
in pregnant women. </p>

<p>Promethazine with codeine should be used during pregnancy only if the
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects </p>

<p>Dependence has been reported in newborns whose mothers took opiates
regularly during pregnancy. Withdrawal signs include irritability, excessive
crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Signs usually
appear during the first few days of life. </p>

<p>Promethazine taken within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet
aggregation in the newborn. </p>

<p>LABOR AND DELIVERY </p>

<p>Narcotic analgesics cross the placental barrier. The closer to delivery
and the larger the dose used, the greater the possibility of respiratory
depression in the newborn. Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during
labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has
received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed
closely for signs of respiratory depression. Resuscitation may be required
(see &quot;Overdosage&quot;). The effect of codeine, if any, on the later
growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.
</p>

<p>See also &quot;Nonteratogenic Effects.&quot; </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Some studies, but not others, have reported detectable amounts of codeine
in breast milk. The levels are probably not clinically significant after
usual therapeutic dosage. The possibility of clinically important amounts
being excreted in breast milk in individuals abusing codeine should be
considered. </p>

<p>It is not known whether promethazine is excreted in human milk.</p>

<p> Caution should be exercised when Promethazine with codeine is administered
to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>This product should not be used in children under 2 years of age because
safety for such use has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Nervous System--CNS depression, particularly respiratory depression,
and to a lesser extent circulatory depression; light-headedness, dizziness,
sedation, euphoria, dysphoria, headache, transient hallucination, disorientation,
visual disturbances, and convulsions. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope,
orthostatic hypotension (common to narcotic analgesics). </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Nausea, vomiting, constipation, and biliary tract
spasm. Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis may experience increased
colonic motility; in patients with acute ulcerative colitis, toxic dilation
has been reported. </p>

<p>Genitourinary--Oliguria, urinary retention; antidiuretic effect has
been reported (common to narcotic analgesics). </p>

<p>Allergic--Infrequent pruritus, giant urticaria, angioneurotic edema,
and laryngeal edema. </p>

<p>Other--Flushing of the face, sweating and pruritus (due to opiate-induced
histamine release); weakness. </p>

<p>PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>Nervous System--Sedation, sleepiness, occasional blurred vision, dryness
of mouth, dizziness; rarely confusion, disorientation, and extrapyramidal
symptoms such as oculogyric crisis, torticollis, and tongue protrusion
(usually in association with parenteral injection or excessive dosage).
</p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Increased or decreased blood pressure. </p>

<p>Dermatologic--Rash, rarely photosensitivity. </p>

<p>Hematologic--Rarely leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; agranulocytosis (1
case). </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE </p>

<p>Promethazine with codeine is a Schedule V Controlled Substance. </p>

<p>ABUSE </p>

<p>Codeine is known to be subject to abuse; however, the abuse potential
of oral codeine appears to be quite low. Even parenteral codeine does not
appear to offer the psychic effects sought by addicts to the same degree
as heroin or morphine. However, codeine must be administered only under
close supervision to patients with a history of drug abuse or dependence.
</p>

<p>DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Psychological dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance are known
to occur with codeine. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>CODEINE </p>

<p>Serious overdose with codeine is characterized by respiratory depression
(a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration,
cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle
flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension.
The triad of coma, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression is strongly
suggestive of opiate poisoning. In severe overdosage, particularly by the
intravenous route, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death
may occur. Promethazine is additive to the depressant effects of codeine.
</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine what constitutes a standard toxic or lethal
dose. However, the lethal oral dose of codeine in an adult is reported
to be in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 gram. Infants and children are believed
to be relatively more sensitive to opiates on a body-weight basis. Elderly
patients are also comparatively intolerant to opiates. </p>

<p>PROMETHAZINE </p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine range from mild depression
of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension
respiratory depression, and unconsciousness. </p>

<p>Stimulation may be evident, especially in children and geriatric patients.
Convulsions may rarely occur. A paradoxical reaction has been reported
in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally, characterized
by hyperexcitability and nightmares. </p>

<p>Atropine-like signs and symptoms--dry mouth, fixed, dilated pupils,
flushing, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, may occur. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>The treatment of overdosage with Promethazine with codeine is essentially
symptomatic and supportive. Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual
sensitivity do vital signs including respiration, pulse, blood pressure,
temperature, and EKG need to be monitored. Activated charcoal orally or
by lavage may be given, or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic.
Attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory
exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted
or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist, naloxone hydrochloride,
may be administered when significant respiratory depression occurs with
Promethazine with codeine; any depressant effects of promethazine are not
reversed with naloxone. Diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Avoid
analeptics, which may cause convulsions. Acidosis and electrolyte losses
should be corrected. A rise in temperature or pulmonary complications may
signal the need for institution of antibiotic therapy. </p>

<p>Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine
or phenylephrine. EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED, since its use in a patient
with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure.
</p>

<p>Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful. </p>

</b> <p>
PATIENTS SHOULD BE COUNSELED THAT THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST HIV 
INFECTION (AIDS) AND OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES.  
 <p>

Levonorgestrel chemically is (D(-)-13 beta-ethyl-17-alpha-ethinyl-17-beta 
hydroxygon-4-en-3-one), a totally synthetic progestogen and ethinyl estradiol is 
(19-nor-17 alpha-pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3, 17-diol).
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although
the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other
alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the
difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce
the likelihood of implantation).  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Oral contraceptives are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who
elect to use this product as a method of contraception.  
 <p>
Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table I lists the typical accidental
pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods
of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except
sterilization and the IUD, depends upon the reliability with which they are
used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke,
hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the risk of
serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without
underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases
significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as
hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity and diabetes.  
 <p>
Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the
following information relating to these risks.  
 <p>
The information contained in this package insert is based principally on
studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher
formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The
effect of long- term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of
both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.  
 <p>
Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: 
retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case
control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, a
ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral-contraceptive users to that
among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual
clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of
attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between
oral-contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide
information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population. For
further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological
methods.  
 <p>
1. THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS AND OTHER VASCULAR PROBLEMS 
 <p>
a. Myocardial Infarction 
 <p>
An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral-
contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other
underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart
attack for current oral-contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to
six.  The risk is very low under the age of 30.  
 <p>
Smoking in combination with oral-contraceptive use has been shown to contribute 
substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid- 
thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. 
Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase 
substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and nonsmokers over the age of 40
among women who use oral contraceptives.  
 <p>
Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such
as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity. In particular,
some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose
intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Oral
contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see
section 9 in &quot;WARNINGS&quot;). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated
with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with
caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.  
 <p>
b. Thromboembolism 
 <p>
An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the
use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found 
the relative risk of users compared to nonusers to be 3 for the first episode
of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous
thromboembolic disease. Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be
somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring
hospitalization. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives
is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped.  
 <p>
A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic
complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The
relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is 
twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral
contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two
weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of
thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the
immediate post partum period is also associated with an increased risk of
thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four to
six weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed, or a
midtrimester pregnancy termination.  
 <p>
c. Cerebrovascular Diseases 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and
attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic
strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years),
hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor
for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking
interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.  
 <p>
In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to
range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. 
The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers
who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral
contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for
normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The
attributable risk is also greater in older women.  
 <p>
d. Dose-Related Risk Of Vascular Disease From Oral Contraceptives 
 <p>
A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and
progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline
in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many
progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been
associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because
estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive
depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the 
nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount 
of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive. 
 <p>
Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good
principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination 
the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of
estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the
needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral-contraceptive agents
should be started on preparations containing less than 50 mcg of estrogen.  
 <p>
e. Persistence Of Risk Of Vascular Disease 
 <p>
There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease
for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the
risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral
contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40-49 years who had used 
oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not
demonstrated in other age groups. In another study in Great Britain, the risk
of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after
discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small. 
However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations
containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.  
 <p>
2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE 
 <p>
One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the
mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different
ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated 
with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event 
of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and
risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral-contraceptive users
35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated
with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth. 
The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral-
contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's--but not reported
until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower
estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral-
contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in
this labeling.  
 <p>
Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new
data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral 
contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and
Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. 
The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be
increased with oral-contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women
(even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health 
risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative
surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not
have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.  
 <p>
Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral-contraceptive
use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of
course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the 
lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.  <p>

3. CARCINOMA OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS 
 <p>
Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast 
endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.
The overwhelming evidence in the literature suggests that use of oral
contraceptives is not associated with an increase in the risk of developing
breast cancer, regardless of the age and parity of first use or with most of
the marketed brands and doses. The Cancer and Steroid Hormone (CASH) study also 
showed no latent effect on the risk of breast cancer for at least a decade
following long- term use. A few studies have shown a slightly increased
relative risk of developing breast cancer, although the methodology of these
studies, which included differences in examination of users and nonusers and
differences in age at start of use, has been questioned.  
 <p>
Some studies suggest that oral-contraceptive use has been associated with an
increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations
of women. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which
such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 
 <p>
In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral-contraceptive use and 
breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been
established.  
 <p>
4. HEPATIC NEOPLASIA 
 <p>
Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral-contraceptive use, although
the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect
calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3
cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use. 
Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra
abdominal hemorrhage.  
 <p>
Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular
carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) oral-contraceptive users. However, these
cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess
incidence) of liver cancers in oral-contraceptive users approaches less than
one per million users.  
 <p>
5. OCULAR LESIONS 
 <p>
There have been clincial case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the 
use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there 
is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or
diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and
therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.  
 <p>
6. ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVE USE BEFORE OR DURING EARLY PREGNANCY 
 <p>
Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth
defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies
also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac
anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently
during early pregnancy.  
 <p>
The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should
not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used
during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.  
 <p>
It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods,
pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral-contraceptive use. If the
patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of
pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral
contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.  
 <p>
7. GALLBLADDER DISEASE 
 <p>
Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of
gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens. More recent
studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder
disease among oral-contraceptive users may be minimal. The recent findings of
minimal risk may be related to the use of oral-contraceptive formulations
containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.  
 <p>
8. CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID METABOLIC EFFECTS 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a
significant percentage of users. Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 
micrograms of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen
cause less glucose intolerance. Progestogens increase insulin secretion and
create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational
agents. However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have
no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects,
prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral
contraceptives.  
 <p>
A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on
the pill. As discussed earlier (see &quot;WARNINGS&quot; 1a. and 1d.), changes in serum
triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral-contraceptive
users.  
 <p>
9. ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE 
 <p>
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral
contraceptives and this increase is more likely in older oral-contraceptive
users and with continued use. Data from the Royal College of General
Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of 
hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.  
 <p>
Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal 
disease should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women
with hypertertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored 
closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral
contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure
will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no
difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.  
 <p>
10. HEADACHE 
 <p>
The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new
pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of
oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.  
 <p>
11. BLEEDING IRREGULARITIES 
 <p>
Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on
oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. The type
and dose of progestogen may be important. Nonhormonal causes should be
considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or
pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal 
vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another
formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should 
be ruled out.  
 <p>
Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially
when such a condition was preexistent.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
1. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND FOLLOW UP 
 <p>
A complete medical history and physical examination should be taken prior to
the initiation or reinstitution of oral contraceptives and at least annually
during use of oral contraceptives. These physical examinations should include
special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs,
including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of
undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate
diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a
strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be
monitored with particular care.  
 <p>
2. LIPID DISORDERS 
 <p>
Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if
they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels 
and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult. (See &quot;WARNINGS&quot;
1d.) 
 <p>
3. LIVER FUNCTION 
 <p>
If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should
be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with
impaired liver function.  
 <p>
4. FLUID RETENTION 
 <p>
Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be
prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with
conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.  
 <p>
5. EMOTIONAL DISORDERS 
 <p>
Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives
should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an
attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related. Women with a history
of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if
depression recurs to a serious degree.  
 <p>
6. CONTACT LENSES 
 <p>
Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance
should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.  
 <p>
7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual 
irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar 
assocation, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates,
phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, and possibly with griseofulvin, ampicillin,
and tetracyclines.  
 <p>
8. INTERACTIONS WITH LABORATORY TESTS 
 <p>
Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be
affected by oral contraceptives:  
 <p>
a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased
antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.  
 <p>
b. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column
or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the
elevated TBG, free T4 concentration is unaltered.  
 <p>
c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.  
 <p>
d. Sex-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total
circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active
levels remain unchanged.  
 <p>
e. Triglycerides may be increased.  
 <p>
f. Glucose tolerance may be decreased.  
 <p>
g. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral-contraceptive therapy. This may 
be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after
discontinuing oral contraceptives.  
 <p>
9. CARCINOGENESIS 
 <p>

 <p>
10. PREGNANCY 
<p>
Pregnancy Category X. See &quot;Contraindications&quot; and &quot;Warnings&quot; sections.  
 <p>
11. NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
Small amounts of oral-contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk
of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported,
including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives
given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the
quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be
advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception
until she has completely weaned her child.  
 <p>
 
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS

Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual 
irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar

and tetracyclines.  <p>
 
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been
associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see &quot;WARNINGS&quot; Section).

 <a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Serious ill effects have not been reported following acute ingestion of large
doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea,
and withdrawal bleeding may occur in females.  
 <p>
NONCONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS 
 <p>
The following noncontraceptive health benefits related to the use of oral
contraceptives are supported by epidemiological studies which largely utilized
oral-contraceptive formulations containing doses exceeding 0.035 mg of ethinyl
estradiol or 0.05 mg of mestranol.  
 <p>
Effects on menses:  
 <p>
increased menstrual cycle regularity 
 <p>
decreased blood loss and decreased incidence of iron deficiency anemia 
 <p>
decreased incidence of dysmenorrhea 
 <p>
Effects related to inhibition of ovulation:  
 <p>
decreased incidence of functional ovarian cysts 
 <p>
decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancies 
 <p>
Effects from long-term use:  
 <p>
decreased incidence of fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease of the breast 
 <p>
decreased incidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease 
 <p>
decreased incidence of endometrial cancer 
 <p>
decreased incidence of ovarian cancer 
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets should be
taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24-hours.  
 <p>
It is recommended that Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets be taken at the 
same time each day.
<p>
If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, the patient is instructed to
continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and
without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the
patient is advised to consult her physician. Although the occurrence of
pregnancy is highly unlikely if levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets 
are taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the 
possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to 
the prescribed schedule(missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a 
day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered 
at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken 
before the medication is resumed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen 
and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing 
the contraceptive regimen.  
 <p>
In the nonlactating mother,levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol may be initiated
postpartum, for contraception. When the tablets are administered in the
postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with 
the postpartum period must be considered. (See &quot;CONTRAINDICATIONS&quot;, &quot;WARNINGS&quot;, 
and &quot;PRECAUTIONS&quot; concerning thromboembolic disease.)

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 

</b> <p>

Phenytoin Sodium is an antiepileptic drug. Phenytoin sodium is related to the

barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five-membered ring. The chemical

name is sodium 5,5-diphenyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione.  

 <p>

<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 

</b> <p>

Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be useful in the treatment of

epilepsy. The primary site of action appears to be The Motor Cortex where

spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux

from neurons, phenytoin tends to Stabilize the threshold against

hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes

capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of

posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents 

cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin

reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic

phase of tonic- clonic (grand mal) seizures.  <p>

 

The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22

hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Steady-state therapeutic levels are

achieved 7 to 10 days after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 

mg/day.  

 <p>

When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 

5-7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or

subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state

will have been achieved. Trough levels provide information about clinically

effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance and are obtained

just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an

individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are

obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. For Phenytoin extended

release capsules, peak serum levels occur 4-12 hours after administration.  

 <p>

Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum 

levels between 10 and 20 mcg/ml, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic

(grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower-serum levels of phenytoin.  

 <p>

In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels

are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum

levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be

noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result

from liver disease, congenital enzyme deficiency or drug interactions which

result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in

phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical

problem.  Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly

helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be

altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. 

 <p>

Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then 

reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary

excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular

filtration but more importantly, by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is

hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable, small

incremental doses may produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when

these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately

increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or

more.  

 <p>

<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

</b> <p>

Phenytoin is indicated for the control of tonic-clonic and psychomotor (grand

mal and temporal lobe) seizures and prevention and treatment of seizures

occurring during or following neurosurgery.  

 <p>

Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage

adjustments (see Dosage and Administration).  

 <p>

<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 

</b> <p>

Phenytoin is contraindicated in those patients who are hypersensitive to

phenytoin or other hydantoins.  

 <p>

<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 

</b> 
<p>
Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status

epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage

reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic

medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an

allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative

therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an

antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.  

 <p>

There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin 

and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign

lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease.  

 <p>

Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the

occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a

condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may

occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling serum sickness eg, fever,

rash and liver involvement.  

 <p>

In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period

is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using

alternative antiepileptic drugs.  

 
<p>
Acute alcoholic intake may increase phenytoin serum levels while chronic

alcoholic use may decrease serum levels.  

 
<p>
In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of

porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients

suffering from this disease.  

 
<p>
USAGE IN PREGNANCY:  

 
<p>
A number of reports suggests an association between the use of antiepileptic

drugs by women with epilepsy and a higher incidence of birth defects in

children born to these women. Data are more extensive with respect to phenytoin 

and phenobarbital, but these are also the most commonly prescribed

antiepileptic drugs; less systematic or anecdotal reports suggest a possible

similar association with the use of all known antiepileptic drugs.  

 <p>

The reports suggesting a higher incidence of birth defects in children of drug- 

treated epileptic women cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite

cause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in

obtaining adequate data on drug teratogenicity in humans; genetic factors or

the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in

leading to birth defects. The great majority of the mothers on antiepileptic

medication deliver normal infants. It is important to note that antiepileptic

drugs should not be discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered

to prevent major seizures, because of the strong possibility of precipitating

status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual

cases where the severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that

the removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient,

discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy,

although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do not

pose some hazards to the developing embryo or fetus. The prescribing physician

will wish to weigh these considerations in treating and counseling epileptic

women of childbearing potential.  

 
<p>
In addition to the reports of increased incidence of congenital malformation,

such as cleft lip/palate and heart malformations in children of women receiving 

phenytoin and other antiepileptic drugs, there have more recently been reports

of a fetal hydantoin syndrome. This consists of prenatal growth deficiency,

microcephaly and mental deficiency in children born to mothers who have

received phenytoin, barbiturates, alcohol, or trimethadione. However, these

features are all interrelated and are frequently associated with intrauterine

growth retardation from other causes.  

 <p>

There have been isolated reports of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in

children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy.  

 
<p>
An increase in seizure frequency during pregnancy occurs in a high proportion

of patients, because of altered phenytoin absorption or metabolism. Periodic

measurement of serum phenytoin levels is particularly valuable in the

management of a pregnant epileptic patient as a guide to an appropriate

adjustment of dosage. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage

will probably be indicated.  

 <p>

Neonatal coagulation defects have been reported within the first 24 hours in

babies born to epileptic mothers receiving phenobarbital and/or phenytoin. 

Vitamin K1 has been shown to prevent or correct this defect and has been

recommended to be given to the mother before delivery and the neonate after

birth.  

 
<p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 

</b> <p>

GENERAL:  

<p>
The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with

impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may

show early signs of toxicity.  

 
<p>
A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have

been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited 

enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically

determined.  

 <p>

Phenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears (see &quot;Warnings&quot; section 

regarding drug discontinuation). If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or

bullous or if lupus erythematosus or Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic

epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of the drug should not be resumed. (See

Adverse Reactions.) If the rash is of a milder type (measles-like or

scarlatiniform), therapy may be resumed after the rash has completely

disappeared. If the rash recurs upon reinstitution of therapy, further

phenytoin medication is contraindicated.  

 
<p>
Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have

experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity. Additionally, caution should be

exercised if using structurally similar compounds (eg, barbiturates,

succinimides, oxazolidinediones and other related compounds) in these same

patients.  

 <p>

Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, 

has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic 

patients.  

 
<p>
Osteomalacia has been associated with phenytoin therapy and is considered to be 

due to phenytoin's interference with Vitamin D metabolism.  

 <p>

Phenytoin is not indicated for seizures due to hypoglycemic or other causes. 

Appropriate diagnostic procedures should be performed as indicated.  
<p>
 

Phenytoin is not effective for absence (petit mal) seizures. If tonic-clonic

(grand-mal) and absence (petit mal) seizures are present, combined drug therapy 

is needed.  

 
<p>
Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the optimal range may produce

confusional states referred to as &quot;delirium,&quot; &quot;psychosis,&quot; or &quot;encephalopathy,&quot; 

or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction. Accordingly, at the first sign

of acute toxicity, plasma levels are recommended. Dose reduction of phenytoin

therapy is indicated if plasma levels are excessive; if symptoms persist,

termination is recommended. (See Warnings.) 
<p>
 

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS:  
<p>
 

Patients taking phenytoin should be advised of the importance of adhering

strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of

any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as

prescribed, eg, surgery, etc.  

 
<p>
Patients should also be cautioned on the use of other drugs or alcoholic

beverages without first seeking the physician's advice.  

 <p>

Patients should be instructed to call their physician if skin rash develops.  

<p>

The importance of good dental hygiene should be stressed in order to minimize

the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications.  

 <p>

LABORATORY TESTS:  

 <p>

Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary to achieve optimal dosage 

adjustments.  

 <p>

DRUG INTERACTIONS:  

 <p>

There are many drugs which may increase or decrease phenytoin levels or which

phenytoin may affect. Serum level determinations for phenytoin are especially

helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. The most commonly

occurring drug interactions are listed below.  

 <p>

1. Drugs which may increase phenytoin serum levels include: acute alcohol

intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, dicumarol,

disulfiram, estrogens, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate,

phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides,

tolbutamide, trazodone.  
<p>
 

2. Drugs which may decrease phenytoin levels include: carbamazepine, chronic

alcohol abuse, reserpine, and sucralfate. Moban(R) brand of molindone

hydrochloride contains calcium ions which interfere with the absorption of

phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations containing

calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin levels to

prevent absorption problems.  

 <p>

3. Drugs which may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels include:  

phenobarbital, sodium valproate, and valproic acid. Similarly, the effect of

phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is

unpredictable.  

 <p>

4. Although not a true drug interaction, tricyclic antidepressants may

precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and phenytoin dosage may need to

be adjusted.  

 <p>

5. Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin include: corticosteroids,

coumarin anticoagulants, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral

contraceptives, quinidine, rifampin, theophylline, vitamin D.  

 
<p>
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS:  

 <p>

Phenytoin may cause decreased serum levels of protein-bound iodine (PBI). It

may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone

tests.  Phenytoin may cause raised serum levels of glucose, alkaline

phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).  

 <p>

CARCINOGENESIS:  
<p>
 

See 'Warnings' section for information on carcinogenesis.

PREGNANCY:  

 <p>

See Warnings            <p>

NURSING MOTHERS:  
<p>
 

Infant breast feeding is not recommended for women taking this drug because

phenytoin appears to be secreted in low concentrations in human milk.

<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 

</b> <p>

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: The most common manifestations encountered with

phenytoin therapy are referable to this system and are usually dose-related. 

These include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, and mental confusion. 

Dizziness, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, and headaches

have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced 

dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those 

induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs.  
<p>
 

A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients 

receiving long-term phenytoin therapy.  

 <p>

GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, toxic hepatitis and

liver damage.  

 <p>

INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by

fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash

(measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more

rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous,

exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson

syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (see Precautions).  

 <p>

HEMOPOIETIC SYSTEM: Hemopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally

been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have

included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and

pancytopenia. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these

conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including

benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease

have been reported (see Warnings).  
<p>
 

CONNECTIVE TISSUE SYSTEM: Coarsening of the facial features, enlargement of the 

lips, gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, and Peyronie's Disease.  

 <p>

CARDIOVASCULAR: Periarteritis nodosa.  

 <p>

IMMUNOLOGIC: Hypersensitivity syndrome (which may include, but is not limited

to, symptoms such as arthralgias, eosinophilia, fever, liver dysfunction,

lymphadenopathy or rash), systemic lupus erythematosus, immunoglobulin

abnormalities.  

 <p>

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 

</b> <p>

The lethal dose in children is not known. The lethal dose in adults is

estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and

dysarthria.  Other signs are tremor, hyperflexia, lethargy, slurred speech,

nausea, vomiting.  The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is

due to respiratory and circulatory depression.  

 <p>

There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin plasma

levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 

20 mcg/ml, ataxia at 30 mcg/ml, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the plasma

concentration is over 40 mcg/ml, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/ml has

been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic 

dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/ml with

complete recovery.  

 <p>

TREATMENT:  

 <p>

Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.  
<p>

The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully

observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be

considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total

exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in

children.  
<p>
 

In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol 

should be borne in mind.  

 
<p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

</b> <p>

Serum concentrations should be monitored in changing from extended Phenytoin

sodium capsules USP to Prompt Phenytoin sodium capsules USP, and

from the sodium salt to the free acid form.  

 <p>

Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug

content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage

adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a

product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium

salt and vice versa.  

 <p>

GENERAL:  

 
<p>
Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases serum 

blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments--the 

clinically effective serum level is usually 10-20 mcg/ml. With recommended

dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state

blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should 

not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.  

 <p>

ADULT DOSAGE:  

 <p>

DIVIDED DAILY DOSAGE 

 <p>

Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100 mg

Phenytoin (Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsule) three times daily and the dosage

then adjusted to suit individual requirements. For most adults, the

satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day.

An increase up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary.  

 <p>

ONCE-A-DAY DOSAGE:  

 <p>

In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg 

Phenytoin capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin

sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg

with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma

levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and

urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the 

individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and

is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A 

major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the 

patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned

not to miss a dose, inadvertently.  

 <p>

Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing.  

Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption

rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage

forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change

in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin

serum levels should be carried out.  

 <p>

LOADING DOSE:  

 <p>

Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in

adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous

administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for

patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be

closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not 

receive the oral loading regimen.  

 <p>

Initially, one gram of phenytoin capsules is divided into 3 doses (400 mg, 300

mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hourly intervals. Normal maintenance dosage 

is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level

determinations.  

 <p>

PEDIATRIC DOSAGE:  

 <p>

Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent

dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily

maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years old may

require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day).

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Cefuroxime tablets contain a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin
antibiotic for oral administration. Cefuroxime axetil is the 1- (acetyloxy)
ethyl ester of cefuroxime which in turn is chemically designated as (6R,7R)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-(Z-2-methoxyimino-2-
(fur-2-yl)acetamido)ceph-3-em-4-carboxylate. Cefuroxime axetil is in the
amorphous form. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>After oral administration, cefuroxime axetil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract and rapidly hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases in the intestinal
mucosa and blood to release cefuroxime into the circulation. Cefuroxime
is subsequently distributed throughout the extracellular fluids. The axetil
moiety is metabolized to acetaldehyde and acetic acid. Cefuroxime is excreted
unchanged in the urine. </p>

<p>Serum cefuroxime concentrations and urinary excretion data are shown
in the table below. </p>

* Administered immediately after a meal. <BR>**Mean values
of 12 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred around 2 hours after
the dose. </p>

While cefuroxime axetil can be taken after food or on an empty stomach,
absorption is greater when taken after food (absolute bioavailability of 52%
compared with 37%). Peak serum cefuroxime concentrations after a 500-mg dose
are also greater when taken with food (mean = 7.0 mcg/mL) compared with the
fasting state (mean = 4.9 mcg/mL). Despite this difference in absorption, the
clinical and bacteriologic responses of patients were independent of food
intake at the time of dosing in two studies where this was assessed.
Approximately 50% of serum cefuroxime is bound to protein. The half-life of
cefuroxime after oral administration of Cefuroxime Tablets
is 1.2 hours.  Concomitant administration of probenecid increases the area
under the serum concentration versus time curve by 50%. Peak serum cefuroxime
concentration after a 1.5-g single dose is greater when taken with 1 g of
probenecid (mean = 14.8 mcg/mL) than without probenecid (mean = 12.2 mcg/mL).
Concomitant probenecid also increases the time for which serum cefuroxime
concentrations exceed 0.25 mcg/mL from 10.7 hours to 14.0 hours. Because
cefuroxime is renally eliminated, the serum half-life is increased in elderly
patients with declining renal function associated with normal aging. In a study 
of twenty elderly patients (mean age=83.9 years) having a mean creatinine
clearance of 34.9 mL per minute, the mean serum elimination half-life was 3.5
hours. (see Geriatric Use subsection under PRECAUTIONS). 

<p>MICROBIOLOGY: The In Vivo bactericidal activity of cefuroxime axetil
is due to cefuroxime. Cefuroxime has bactericidal activity against a wide
range of common pathogens, including many beta-lactamase-producing strains.
</p>

<p>Cefuroxime is highly stable to bacterial beta-lactamases, especially
plasmid- mediated enzymes that are commonly found in enterobacteriaceae.
The bactericidal action of cefuroxime results from inhibition of cell-wall
synthesis by binding to essential target proteins. </p>

<p>Cefuroxime has been shown to be active against most strains of the following
organisms both In Vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND
USAGE): </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE: Staphylococcus Aureus, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, And
Streptococcus Pyogenes. </p>

<p>NOTE: Certain strains of enterococci, e.g., Enterococcus Faecalis (formerly
Streptococcus Faecalis), are resistant to cefuroxime. Methicillin-resistant
staphylococci are resistant to cefuroxime. </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE: Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis, Escherichia Coli,
Haemophilus Influenzae, Haemophilus Parainfluenzae, Klebsiella Pneumoniae,
and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (non-penicillinase-producing strains). </p>

<p>NOTE: Pseudomonas spp. and Campylobacter spp., Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus,
and most strains of Serratia spp. and Proteus Vulgaris are resistant to
most first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Some strains of Morganella
Morganii, Enterobacter Cloacae, And Citrobacter spp. have been shown by
In Vitro tests to be resistant to cefuroxime and other cephalosporins.
</p>

<p>Cefuroxime has been shown to be active In Vitro against the following
micoorganisms; however, the clinical significance of these findings is
unknown. </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE: Staphylococcus Epidermidis, Staphylococcus Saprophyticus,
and Streptococcus Agalactiae. </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE: Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp.,
Morganella Morganii, Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase- and
non-penicillinase producing strains), Proteus Inconstans, Proteus Mirabilis,
Providencia Rettgeri, Salmonella spp., And Shigella spp. </p>

<p>ANAEROBES: Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp., Peptococcus
spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium spp. </p>

<p>NOTE: Most strains of Clostridium Difficile and Bacteroides Fragilis
are resistant to cefuroxime. </p>

<p>SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS: DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES: Quantitative methods that
require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimate of
antibiotic susceptibility. One such standard procedure (REF. 1) that has
been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility of organisms
to cefuroxime uses the 30-mcg cefuroxime disk. Interpretation involves
the correlation of the diameters obtained in the disk test with the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for cefuroxime. </p>

<p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 30-mcg cefuroxime disk should be interpreted
according to the following criteria: </p>

<p>ZONE DIAMETER (MM) INTERPRETATION &gt;/=23 (S) Susceptible 15-22 (MS)
Moderately Susceptible &lt; or =14 Resistant A report of &quot;Susceptible&quot;
indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by generally achievable
blood levels. A report of &quot;Moderately Susceptible&quot; suggests that
the organism would be susceptible if high dosage is used or if the infection
is confined to tissues and fluids in which high antibiotic levels are attained.
A report of &quot;Resistant&quot; indicates that achievable concentrations
of the antibiotic are unlikely to be inhibitory and other therapy should
be selected. </p>

<p>Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms.
The 30 mcg cefuroxime disk should give the following zone diameters: </p>

<p>ORGANISM ZONE DIAMETER (MM) Staphylococcus Aureus ATCC 25923 27-35 Escherichia
Coli ATCC 25922 20-26 DILUTION TECHNIQUES: Use a standardized dilution
method (REF. 2) (broth, agar, microdilution) or equivalent with cefuroxime
powder. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the
following criteria: </p>

<p>MIC (MCG/ML) INTERPRETATION &lt; or =4 (S) Susceptible 8-16 (MS) Moderately
Susceptible &gt;/=32 Resistant As with standard diffusion techniques, dilution
methods require the use of laboratory control organisms. Standard cefuroxime
powder should provide the following MIC values: </p>

<p>ORGANISM MIC (MCG/ML) Staphylococcus Aureus ATCC 29213 0.5-2 Escherichia
Coli ATCC 25922 2-8 <a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS
AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Cefuroxime Tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with
infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in
the following diseases: </p>

<p>1. PHARYNGITIS AND TONSILLITIS caused by Streptococcus Pyogenes. (Penicillin
is the usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal
infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefuroxime Tablets
are generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the oropharynx.
Cefuroxime Tablets are not indicated for the prophylaxis of subsequent
rheumatic fever because data to support such use are not yet available.)
</p>

<p>2. OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae
(ampicillin-susceptible and ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella (Branhamella)
Catarrhalis and Streptococcus Pyogenes. </p>

<p>3. LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS (bronchitis) caused by Streptococcus
Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae (ampicillin-susceptible strains), and
Haemophilus Parainfluenzae (ampicillin-susceptible strains). </p>

<p>4. URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Escherichia Coli and Klebsiella
Pneumoniae in the absence of urological complications. </p>

<p>5. SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Staphylococcus Aureus
and Streptococcus Pyogenes. </p>

<p>6. UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (urethral and endocervical) caused by non
penicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. </p>

<p>Bacteriologic studies to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility
to cefuroxime should be performed. Therapy may be started while awaiting
the results of these studies. Once these results become available, antibiotic
treatment should be adjusted accordingly. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Cefuroxime Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known allergy
to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>BEFORE THERAPY WITH Cefuroxime TABLETS IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY
SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY
REACTIONS TO CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT
IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED
BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY
DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN
ALLERGY. ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WITH CAUTION TO ANY PATIENT
WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED SOME FORM OF ALLERGY, PARTICULARLY TO DRUGS. IF AN
ALLERGIC REACTION TO Cefuroxime TABLETS OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS
ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE
AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS
ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT,
AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. </p>

<p>PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL ANTIBACTERIAL
AGENTS INCLUDING CEFUROXIME, AND MAY RANGE FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING.
THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THIS DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT
WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS.
</p>

<p>Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics alters normal flora of the
colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a
toxin produced by Clostridium Difficile is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated
colitis. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins have been shown to bind the
toxin In Vitro. </p>

<p>Mild cases of colitis may respond to drug discontinuation alone. Moderate
to severe cases should be managed with fluid, electrolyte, and protein
supplementation as indicated. Elderly patients may be susceptible to fluid
losses and should be treated aggressively. </p>

<p>When the colitis is not relieved by drug discontinuation or when it
is severe, metronidazole and oral vancomycin have been shown to be beneficial.
Oral vancomycin is the treatment of choice for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous
colitis produced by Clostridium Difficile. Other causes of colitis should
also be considered. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: If an allergic reaction to Cefuroxime Tablets occurs, the drug
should be discontinued, and, if necessary, the patient should be treated
with appropriate agents, e.g., antihistamines, pressor amines, or corticosteroids.
</p>

<p>As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of Cefuroxime Tablets may result
in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If superinfection occurs during
therapy appropriate measures should be taken. </p>

<p>Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be prescribed with caution for individuals
with a history of colitis. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: (PEDIATRIC) Cefuroxime is only available in
tablet form. During clinical trials, the tablet was well tolerated by children
who could swallow the tablet whole. Children who cannot swallow the tablet
whole may have the tablet crushed and mixed with food (e.g., applesauce,
ice cream). However, it should be noted that the crushed tablet has a strong,
persistent, bitter taste. Discontinuation of therapy due to the taste and/or
problems of administering this drug occurred in 13% of children (range,
2%-28% across centers). Thus, the physician and parent should ascertain,
preferably while still in the physician's office, that the child can ingest
Cefuroxime Tablets reliably. If not, alternative therapy should be considered.
</p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE: In clinical trials when 12- to 64-year-old patients and
geriatric patients (65 years of age or older) were treated with usual recommended
dosages (i.e., 125-500 mg b.i.d., depending on type of infection), no overall
differences in effectiveness were observed between the two age groups.
The geriatric patients reported somewhat fewer gastrointestinal events
and vaginal candidiasis when compared with adult patients (12-64 years
old); however, no clinically significant differences were reported between
the two age-groups. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG/LABORATORY TEST"></a>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS:
A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper
reduction tests (Benedict's or Fehling's solution or with Clinitest tablets),
but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria (e.g., Clinistix, Tes-Tape).
As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended
that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine
blood plasma glucose levels in patients receiving Cefuroxime Tablets. </p>

<p>Cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine
by the alkaline picrate method. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Although no long-term
studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential,
no mutagenic potential of cefuroxime was found in standard laboratory tests.
</p>

<p>Reproductive studies revealed no impairment of fertility in animals.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY: PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: Reproduction studies have been performed
in rats and mice at doses up to 50-160 times the human dose and have revealed
no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cefuroxime
axetil. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of human response this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Since cefuroxime is excreted in human milk, consideration
should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with
Cefuroxime Tablets. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The adverse reactions to Cefuroxime Tablets are similar to reactions
to other orally administered cephalosporins. Cefuroxime Tablets were usually
well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Pediatric patients taking
crushed tablets during clinical trials complained of the bitter taste of
Cefuroxime Tablets (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal and PRECAUTIONS:
Information for Patients: (Pediatric)). The majority of adverse events
were mild, reversible in nature, and did not require discontinuation of
the drug. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with
the higher recommended doses. Twenty-five (25) patients have received Cefuroxime
Tablets 500 mg twice a day for 1- 2.5 months with no increase in frequency
or severity of adverse events. </p>

<p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials
using dosage regimens of 125-500 mg twice a day. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea occurred in 2.4% of patients. Vomiting occurred
in 2.0% of patients. Diarrhea occurred in 3.5% of patients. Loose stools
occurred in 1.3% of patients. </p>

<p>Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after
antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>Crushed tablets have a bitter taste. In pediatric clinical studies conducted
with crushed tablets, complaints due to taste ranged from 0/8 (0%) in one
center to 47/71 (66%) in another center. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY: Rash (0.6% of patients), pruritus (0.3% of patients),
and urticaria (0.2% of patients) have been observed. One case of severe
bronchospasm has been reported among the approximately 1,600 patients treated
with Cefuroxime Tablets. Of the patients treated with Cefuroxime Tablets
who reported a history of delayed hypersensitivity to a penicillin and
not a cephalosporin, 2.9% of patients experienced a delayed hypersensitivity
reaction to Cefuroxime Tablets. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema
multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug fever, serum sickness-like
reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Headache occurred in less than 0.7% of patients,
and dizziness occurred in less than 0.2% of patients. </p>

<p>Vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis, occurred in 1.9% of female
patients. </p>

<p>CLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS: Transient elevations in AST (SGOT, 2.0% of
patients) ALT (SGPT, 1.6% of patients), and LDH (1.0% of patients) have
been observed. Eosinophilia (1.1% of patients) and positive Coombs' test
(0.4% of patients) have been reported. </p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS FOLLOWING A SINGLE ORAL 1-G DOSE FOR THE TREATMENT
OF GONORRHEA: The incidence of drug-related adverse experiences in patients
treated for gonorrhea who received a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil
was 16%. The most common adverse experiences were diarrhea (4.8%), nausea
(4.6%), vomiting (2.5%), abdominal pain (1.2%), and dizziness (1.2%). </p>

<p>In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed
in patients treated with Cefuroxime Tablets, the following adverse reactions
and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin class
antibiotics: </p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS: Fever, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic
dysfunction including cholestasis, abdominal pain, superinfection, aplastic
anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, and pain and/or phlebitis at the
injection site. </p>

<p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures,
particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not
reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy should occur, the drug
should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically
indicated. </p>

<p>ALTERED LABORATORY TESTS: Increased prothrombin time, increased BUN,
increased creatinine, false-positive test for urinary glucose, increased
alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, elevated
bilirubin, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage of cephalosporins can cause cerebral irritation leading to
convulsions. Serum levels of cefuroxime can be reduced by hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Cefuroxime Tablets may be given orally without regard to meals. However,
absorption is enhanced when Cefuroxime Tablets are administered with food.
</p>

<p>ADULTS AND CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER: The recommended dosage
is 250 mg twice a day. For more severe infections or infections caused
by less susceptible organisms, the dosage may be increased to 500 mg twice
a day. </p>

<p>For uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the usual recommended dosage
is 125 mg twice a day. Dosage may be increased to 250 mg twice a day for
some patients with urinary tract infections. </p>

<p>TREATMENT OF GONORRHEA: A single oral 1-g dose is recommended for treating

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Glipizide is an oral blood-glucose-lowering drug of the sulfonylurea
class. The Chemical Abstracts name of glipizide is 1-cyclohexyl-3-((p-
(2-(5- methylpyrazinecarboxamido)ethyl)phenyl)sulf onyl)urea. The molecular
formula is C21H27N5O4S; the molecular weight is 445.55. </p>

<p>Glipizide is a whitish, odorless powder with a pKa of 5.9. It is insoluble
in water and alcohols, but soluble in 0.1 N NaOH; it is freely soluble
in dimethylformamide.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION: Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely
by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent
upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects
also may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic
drugs. Two extrapancreatic effects shown to be important in the action
of glipizide are an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in hepatic
glucose production. However, the mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood
glucose during long- term administration has not been clearly established.
</p>

<p>Stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal
is of major importance. The insulinotropic response to a meal is enhanced
with Glipizide (extended release) administration in diabetic patients.
The postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses continue to be enhanced
after at least 6 months of treatment. In 2 randomized, double-blind, dose-response
studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase
in fasting insulin in all Glipizide XL- treated patients combined compared
to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses. There
was no increase in fasting insulin over the long-term.</p>

<p> Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness
to sulfonylurea drugs, including glipizide. Alternatively, glipizide may
be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to
respond to other sulfonylureas.</p>

<p> EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE </p>

<p>The effectiveness of Glipizide (extended release)Tablets in NIDDM at
doses from 5-60 mg once daily has been evaluated in 4 therapeutic clinical
trials each with long-term open extensions involving a total of 598 patients.
Once daily administration of 5, 10 and 20 mg produced statistically significant
reductions from placebo in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial
glucose in mild to severe NIDDM patients. In a pooled analysis of the patients
treated with 5 mg and 20 mg, the relationship between dose and Glipizide
(extended release)'s effect of reducing hemoglobin A1C was not established.
However, in the case of fasting plasma glucose patients treated with 20
mg had a statistically significant reduction of fasting plasma glucose
compared to the 5 mg-treated group. </p>

<p>The reductions in hemoglobin A1C and fasting plasma glucose were similar
in younger and older patients. Efficacy of Glipizide (extended release)
was not affected by gender, race or weight (as assessed by body mass index).
In long term extension trials, efficacy of Glipizide (extended release)
was maintained in 81% of patients for up to 12 months. In an open, two-way
crossover study 132 patients were randomly assigned to either Glipizide
(extended release) or Glipizide for 8 weeks and then crossed over to the
other drug for an additional 8 weeks. Glipizide (extended release) administration
resulted in significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels and equivalent
hemoglobin A1C levels, as compared to Glipizide.</p>

<p> OTHER EFFECTS: It has been shown that Glipizide (extended release)
therapy is effective in controlling blood glucose without deleterious changes
in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for NIDDM.</p>

<p> In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, glipizide
had no anti-diuretic activity, and, in fact, led to a slight increase in
free water clearance.</p>

<p> PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM: Glipizide is rapidly and completely
absorbed following oral administration in an immediate release dosage form.
The absolute bioavailability of glipizide was 100% after single oral doses
in patients with NIDDM. Beginning 2 to 3 hours after administration of
Glipizide (extended release) Tablets, plasma drug concentrations gradually
rise reaching maximum concentrations within 6 to 12 hours after dosing.
With subsequent once daily dosing of Glipizide (extended release) Tablets,
effective plasma glipizide concentrations are maintained throughout the
24 hour dosing interval with less peak to trough fluctuation than that
observed with twice daily dosing of immediate release glipizide. The mean
relative bioavailability of glipizide in 21 males with NIDDM after administration
of 20 mg Glipizide (extended release) Tablets, compared to immediate release
Glipizide (10 mg given twice daily), was 90% at steady state. Steady state
plasma concentrations were achieved by at least the fifth day of dosing
with Glipizide (extended release) Tablets in 21 males with NIDDM and patients
younger than 65 years. Approximately 1 to 2 days longer were required to
reach steady state in 24 elderly (&gt;/=65 years) males and females with
NIDDM. No accumulation of drug was observed in patients with NIDDM during
chronic dosing with Glipizide (extended release) Tablets. Administration
of Glipizide (extended release) with food has no effect on the 2 to 3 hour
lag time in drug absorption. In a single dose, food effect study in 21
healthy male subjects, the administration of Glipizide (extended release)
immediately before a high fat breakfast resulted in a 40% increase in the
glipizide mean Cmax value, which was significant, but the effect on the
AUC was not significant. There was no change in glucose response between
the fed and fasting state. Markedly reduced GI retention times of the Glipizide
(extended release) tablets over prolonged periods (e.g., short bowel syndrome)
may influence the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and potentially result
in lower plasma concentrations. In a multiple dose study in 26 males with
NIDDM, the pharmacokinetics of glipizide were linear over the dose range
of 5 to 60 mg of Glipizide (extended release) in that the plasma drug concentrations
increased proportionately with dose. In a single dose study in 24 healthy
subjects, four 5 mg, two 10 mg, and one 20 mg Glipizide (extended release)
Tablets were bioequivalent. Glipizide is eliminated primarily by hepatic
biotransformation: less than 10% of a dose is excreted as unchanged drug
in urine and feces; approximately 90% of a dose is excreted as biotransformation
products in urine (80%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites of glipizide
are products of aromatic hydroxylation and have no hypoglycemic activity.
A minor metabolite which accounts for less than 2% of a dose, an acetylamino-ethyl
benzine derivative, is reported to have 1/10 to 1/3 as much hypoglycemic
activity as the parent compound. The mean total body clearance of glipizide
was approximately 3 liters per hour after single intravenous doses in patients
with NIDDM. The mean apparent volume of distribution was approximately
10 liters. Glipizide is 98-99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin.
The mean terminal elimination half-life of glipizide ranged from 2 to 5
hours after single or multiple doses in patients with NIDDM. There were
no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glipizide after single
dose administration to older diabetic subjects compared to younger healthy
subjects. There is only limited information regarding the effects of renal
impairment on the disposition of glipizide, and no information regarding
the effects of hepatic disease. However, since glipizide is highly protein
bound and hepatic biotransformation is the predominant route of elimination,
the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glipizide may be altered
in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p>

<p> In mice no glipizide or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically
in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of
pregnant females. In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity
were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug.</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b> INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Glipizide (extended release) is indicated as an adjunct to diet for
the control of hyperglycemia and its associated symptomatology in patients
with non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; type II), formerly
known as maturity-onset diabetes, after an adequate trial of dietary therapy
has proved unsatisfactory. Glipizide XL is indicated when diet alone has
been unsuccessful in correcting hyperglycemia, but even after the introduction
of the drug in the patient's regimen, dietary measures should continue
to be considered as important. In 12 week, well- controlled studies there
was a maximal average net reduction in hemoglobin A1C of 1.7% in absolute
units between placebo-treated and Glipizide XL-treated patients.</p>

<p> In initiating treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes, diet should
be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and
weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary
management alone may be effective in controlling blood glucose and symptoms
of hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity should also
be stressed, cardiovascular risk factors should be identified, and corrective
measures taken where possible. If this treatment program fails to reduce
symptoms and/or blood glucose, the use of an oral sulfonylurea should be
considered. If additional reduction of symptoms and/or blood glucose is
required, the addition of insulin to the treatment regimen should be considered.
Use of Glipizide (extended release) must be viewed by both the physician
and patient as a treatment in addition to diet, and not as a substitute
for diet or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore,
loss of blood glucose control on diet alone also may be transient, thus
requiring only short-term administration of glipizide. During maintenance
programs, Glipizide (extended release) should be discontinued if satisfactory
lowering of blood glucose is no longer achieved. Judgments should be based
on regular clinical and laboratory evaluations. Hemoglobin A1C levels may
be useful.</p>

<p> In considering the use of Glipizide (extended release) in asymptomatic
patients, it should be recognized that controlling blood glucose in non-insulin-
dependent diabetes has not been definitely established to be effective
in preventing the long-term cardiovascular or neural complications of diabetes.
However, in insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus controlling blood glucose
has been effective in slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy,
nephropathy, and neuropathy. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Glipizide is contraindicated in patients with:</p>

<p> 1. Known hypersensitivity to the drug.</p>

<p> 2. Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should
be treated with insulin.</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b> WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY: THE ADMINISTRATION
OF ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED
CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AS COMPARED TO TREATMENT WITH DIET ALONE OR DIET
PLUS INSULIN. THIS WARNING IS BASED ON THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY
GROUP DIABETES PROGRAM (UGDP), A LONG-TERM PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED
TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLUCOSE-LOWERING DRUGS IN PREVENTING OR
DELAYING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT
DIABETES. THE STUDY INVOLVED 823 PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO
ONE OF FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS (DIABETES, 19, SUPP. 2: 747-830, 1970). UGDP
REPORTED THAT PATIENTS TREATED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS WITH DIET PLUS A FIXED
DOSE OF TOLBUTAMIDE (1.5 GRAMS PER DAY) HAD A RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY
APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 TIMES THAT OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH DIET ALONE. A SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN TOTAL MORTALITY WAS NOT OBSERVED, BUT THE USE OF TOLBUTAMIDE
WAS DISCONTINUED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, THUS
LIMITING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STUDY TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OVERALL MORTALITY.
DESPITE CONTROVERSY REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS, THE
FINDINGS OF THE UGDP STUDY PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE BASIS FOR THIS WARNING.
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND ADVANTAGES OF
GLIPIZIDE AND OF ALTERNATIVE MODES OF THERAPY.</p>

<p> ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE DRUG IN THE SULFONYLUREA CLASS (TOLBUTAMIDE) WAS
INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, IT IS PRUDENT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT TO CONSIDER
THAT THIS WARNING MAY ALSO APPLY TO OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS IN THIS
CLASS, IN VIEW OF THEIR CLOSE SIMILARITIES IN MODE OF ACTION AND CHEMICAL
STRUCTURE.</p>

<p> As with any other non-deformable material, caution should be used when
administering Glipizide (extended release) Tablets in patients with preexisting
severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have
been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures
in association with the ingestion of another drug in this non- deformable
sustained release formulation.</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b> PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>RENAL AND HEPATIC DISEASE: The pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics
of glipizide may be affected in patients with impaired renal or hepatic
function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged
and appropriate management should be instituted.</p>

<p> GI DISEASE: Markedly reduced GI retention times of the Glipizide (extended
release) Extended Release Tablets may influence the pharmacokinetic profile
and hence the clinical efficacy of the drug.</p>

<p> HYPOGLYCEMIA: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe
hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important
to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may affect
the disposition of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic
capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.
Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or
pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic
action of glucose-lowering drugs. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize
in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient,
after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more
than one glucose-lowering drug is used.</p>

<p> LOSS OF CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE: When a patient stabilized on any
diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection,
or surgery, a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary
to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin.</p>

<p> The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including glipizide,
in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients
over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity
of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon
is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in
which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.
Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before
classifying a patient as a secondary failure.</p>

<p> LABORATORY TESTS: Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.
Measurement of hemoglobin A1C may be useful.</p>

<p> INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Patients should be informed that Glipizide
(extended release) Tablets should be swallowed whole. Patients should not
chew, divide or crush tablets. Patients should not be concerned if they
occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet.
In the Glipizide (extended release) Extended Release Tablet, the medication
is contained within a nonabsorbable shell that has been specially designed
to slowly release the drug so the body can absorb it. When this process
is completed, the empty tablet is eliminated from the body.</p>

<p> Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of
Glipizide XL and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed
about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular
exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.</p>

<p> The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions
that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and
responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure also should be
explained.</p>

<p> DRUG INTERACTIONS: The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be
potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides,
chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and
beta-adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a
patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for
hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide,
the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. In Vitro binding
studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently
than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However,
caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical
situation and in the use of glipizide with these drugs.</p>

<p> Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of
control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids,
phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin,
nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the
patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs
are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be
observed closely for hypoglycemia.</p>

<p> A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic
agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction
also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole
is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of Diflucan (fluconazole)
and Glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo- controlled crossover
study in normal volunteers. All subjects received Glipizide alone and following
treatment with 100 mg of Diflucan as a single daily oral dose for 7 days.
The mean percentage increase in the Glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration
was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81%).</p>

<p> CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</p>

<p> A twenty month study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at
doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related
carcinogenicity. Bacterial and In Vivo mutagenicity tests were uniformly
negative. Studies in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human
dose showed no effects on fertility. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C: Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in
rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5-50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity
has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide
and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related
to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glipizide. In studies in
rats and rabbits no teratogenic effects were found. There are no adequate
and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Glipizide should be used
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
risk to the fetus.</p>

<p> Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels
during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities,
many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain
blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.</p>

<p> NONTERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days)
has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea
drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with
the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. If glipizide is used during
pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected
delivery date. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: Although it is not known whether glipizide is excreted
in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human
milk. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist,
a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling
blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.</p>

<p> PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
</p>

<p>GERIATRIC USE: Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of
Glipizide XL, 33 percent were 65 and over. No overall differences in effectiveness
or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but
greater sensitivity of some individuals cannot be ruled out. Approximately
1-2 days longer were required to reach steady state in the elderly. (See
ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b> ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In U.S. controlled studies the frequency of serious adverse experiences
reported was very low and causal relationship has not been established.</p>

<p> The 580 patients from 31 to 87 years of age who received Glipizide
(extended release) Extended Release Tablets in doses from 5 mg to 60 mg
in both controlled and open trials were included in the evaluation of adverse
experiences. All adverse experiences reported were tabulated independently
of their possible causal relation to medication.</p>

<p> HYPOGLYCEMIA: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections.</p>

<p> Only 3.4% of patients receiving Glipizide (extended release) Tablets
had hypoglycemia documented by a blood glucose measurement &lt;60 mg/dL
and/or symptoms believed to be associated with hypoglycemia. In a comparative
efficacy study of Glipizide (extended release) and Glipizide, hypoglycemia
occurred rarely with an incidence of less than 1% with both drugs.</p>

<p>Although these adverse experiences occurred in patients treated with
Glipizide XL, a causal relationship to the medication has not been established
in all cases.</p>

<p> There have been rare reports of gastrointestinal irritation and gastrointestinal
bleeding with use of another drug in this non-deformable sustained release
formulation, although causal relationship to the drug is uncertain.</p>

<p> The following are adverse experiences reported with immediate release
glipizide and other sulfonylureas, but have not been observed with Glipizide
(extended release): </p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic
anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas.
</p>

<p>METABOLIC: Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been
reported with sulfonylureas. In the mouse, glipizide pretreatment did not
cause an accumulation of acetaldehyde after ethanol administration. Clinical
experience to date has shown that glipizide has an extremely low incidence
of disulfiram- like alcohol reactions. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE REACTIONS: Cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with glipizide
and other sulfonylureas. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: The pattern of laboratory test abnormalities observed
with glipizide was similar to that for other sulfonylureas. Occasional
mild to moderate elevations of SGOT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, BUN and
creatinine were noted. One case of jaundice was reported. The relationship
of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain, and they have rarely
been associated with clinical symptoms.</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b> OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>There is no well-documented experience with Glipizide (extended release)
overdosage in humans. </p>

<p>There have been no known suicide attempts associated with purposeful
overdosing with Glipizide (extended release). In nonclinical studies the
acute oral toxicity of glipizide was extremely low in all species tested
(LD50 greater than 4 g/kg). Overdosage of sulfonylureas including glipizide
can produce hypoglycemia. Mild hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness
or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose
and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should
continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger.
Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological
impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring
immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected,
the patient should be given rapid intravenous injection of concentrated
(50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion
of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the
blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored
for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent
clinical recovery. Clearance of glipizide from plasma may be prolonged
in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding
of glipizide, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit.</p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus
with Glipizide (extended release) Tablets or any other hypoglycemic agent.
Glycemic control should be monitored with hemoglobin A1C and/or blood glucose
levels to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect
primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum
recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e.,
loss of an adequate blood- glucose-lowering response after an initial period
of effectiveness. Home blood glucose monitoring may also provide useful
information to the patient and physician. Short- term administration of
Glipizide (extended release) Extended Release Tablet may be sufficient
during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled
on diet.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In general, Glipizide (extended release) should be given with breakfast.
</p>

<p>RECOMMENDED DOSING: The recommended starting dose of Glipizide (extended
release) is 5 mg per day, given with breakfast. The recommended dose for
geriatric patients is also 5 mg per day.</p>

<p> Dosage adjustment should be based on laboratory measures of glycemic
control. While fasting blood glucose levels generally reach steady state
following initiation or change in Glipizide (extended release) dosage,
a single fasting glucose determination may not accurately reflect the response
to therapy. In most cases, hemoglobin A1C level measured at three month
intervals is the preferred means of monitoring response to therapy.</p>

<p> Hemoglobin A1C should be measured as Glipizide (extended release) therapy
is initiated at the 5 mg dose and repeated approximately three months later.
If the result of this test suggests that glycemic control over the preceding
three months was inadequate, the Glipizide (extended release) dose may
be increased to 10 mg. Subsequent dosage adjustments should be made on
the basis of hemoglobin A1C levels measured at three month intervals. If
no improvement is seen after three months of therapy with a higher dose,
the previous dose should be resumed. Decisions which utilize fasting blood
glucose to adjust Glipizide (extended release) therapy should be based
on at least two or more similar, consecutive values obtained seven days
or more after the previous dose adjustment.</p>

<p> Most patients will be controlled with 5 mg or 10 mg taken once daily.
However, some patients may require up to the maximum recommended daily
dose of 20 mg. While the glycemic control of selected patients may improve
with doses which exceed 10 mg, clinical studies conducted to date have
not demonstrated an additional group average reduction of hemoglobin A1C
beyond what was achieved with the 10 mg dose.</p>

<p> Based on the results of a randomized crossover study patients receiving
immediate release glipizide may be switched safely to Glipizide (extended
release)tablets once-a-day at the nearest equivalent total daily dose.
Patients receiving immediate release Glipizide also may be titrated to
the appropriate dose of Glipizide (extended release) starting with 5 mg
once daily. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to
titrate should be based on clinical judgment. </p>

<p>In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients
with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing
should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions (see PRECAUTIONS
section). </p>

<p>PATIENTS RECEIVING INSULIN: As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics,
many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may
be transferred safely to treatment with Glipizide (extended release) Tablets.
When transferring patients from insulin to Glipizide (extended release),
the following general guidelines should be considered:</p>

<p> For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin
may be discontinued and Glipizide (extended release) therapy may begin
at usual dosages. Several days should elapse between titration steps.</p>

<p> For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units,
the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and Glipizide (extended release)
therapy may begin at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage
should depend on individual patient response. Several days should elapse
between titration steps. </p>

<p>During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine
samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily. Patients
should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests
are abnormal. In some cases, especially when the patient has been receiving
greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider
hospitalization during the transition period.</p>

<p> PATIENTS RECEIVING OTHER ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS: As with other sulfonylurea-
class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring
patients to Glipizide (extended release) Tablets. Patients should be observed
carefully (1-2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer
half- life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to Glipizide (extended
release) due to potential overlapping of drug effect. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Fexofenadine hydrochloride, is a histamine H1 receptor antagonist with
the chemical name (I)-4-[1 -hydroxy-4-[4- (hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinyl]-butyl]-alpha,alpha-dimethyl
benzeneacetic acid hydrochloride. </p>

<p>The molecular weight is 538.13 and the empirical formula is C32H39NO4.HCl.
Fexofenadine hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder.
It is freely soluble in methanol and ethanol, slightly soluble in chloroform
and water, and insoluble in hexane. Fexofenadine hydrochloride is a racemate
and exists as a zwitterion in aqueous media at physiological pH </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Mechanism of Action </p>

<p>Fexofenadine, a metabolite of terfenadine, is an antihistamine with
selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. Fexofenadine inhibited
antigen-induced bronchospasm in sensitized guinea pigs and histamine release
from peritoneal mast cells in rats. In laboratory animals, no anticholinergic
or alpha1-adrenergic-receptor blocking effects were observed. Moreover,
no sedative or other central nervous system effects were observed. Radio
labeled tissue distribution studies in rats indicated that fexofenadine
does not cross the blood-brain barrier. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>Fexofenadine hydrochloride was rapidly absorbed following oral administration
of a single dose of two 60-mg capsules to healthy male volunteers with
a mean time to maximum plasma concentration occurring at 2.6 hours postdose.
After administration of a single 60-mg dose as an oral solution to heathy
subjects, the mean plasma concentration was 209 ng/ml. Mean steady-state
peak plasma concentrations of 286 ng/mL were observed when healthy volunteers
were administered multiple doses of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg oral
solution every 12 hours for 10 doses). Fexofenadine pharmacokinetics were
linear for oral doses up to 120 mg twice daily. Although the absolute bioavailability
of fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules is unknown, the capsules are bioequivalent
to an oral solution. The mean elimination half-life of fexofenadine was
14.4 hours following administration of 60 mg, twice daily, to steady-state
in normal volunteers. </p>

<p>Human mass balance studies documented a recovery of approximately 80%
and 11 % of the [14C] fexofenadine hydrochloride dose in the feces and
urine, respectively. Approximately 5% of the total dose was metabolized.
Because the absolute bioavailability of fexofenadine hydrochloride has
not been established, it is unknown if the fecal component represents unabsorbed
drug or the result of biliary excretion. </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride in seasonal allergic
rhinitis patients were similar to those in healthy subjects. Peak fexofenadine
plasma concentrations were similar between adolescent (12-16 years of age)
and adult patients. </p>

<p>Fexofenadine is 60% to 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin
and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. </p>

<p>Special Populations: </p>

<p>Special population pharmacokinetics (for age and renal and hepatic impairment),
obtained after a single dose of 80 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride, were
compared to those from normal subjects in a separate study of similar design.
While subject weights were relatively uniform between studies, these special
population patients were substantially older than the healthy, young volunteers.
Thus, an age effect may be confounding the pharmacokinetic differences
observed in some of the special populations. </p>

<p>Effect of Age. In older subjects (&gt;=65 years old), peak plasma levels
of fexofenadine were 99% greater than those observed in normal volunteers
(&lt;65 years old). Mean elimination half-lives were similar to those observed
in normal volunteers. </p>

<p>Renally Impaired. In patients with mild (creatinine clearance 41 -80
ml /min) to severe (creatinine clearance 11-40 mL/min) renal impairment,
peak plasma levels of fexofenadine were 87% and 111 % greater, respectively,
and mean elimination half-lives were 59% and 72% longer, respectively,
than observed in normal volunteers. Peak plasma levels in patients on dialysis
(creatinine clearance &lt; 10 mL/min) were 82% greater and half-life was
31 % longer than observed in normal volunteers. Based on increases in bioavailability
and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting
dose in patients with decreased renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
</p>

<p>Hepatically Impaired. The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride
in patients with hepatic disease did not differ substantially from that
observed in healthy subjects Effect of Gender. Across several trials, no
clinically significant gender-related differences were observed in the
pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine. </p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics </p>

<p>Wheal and Flare. Human histamine skin wheal and flare studies following
single and twice daily doses of 20 mg and 40 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride
demonstrated that the drug exhibits an antihistamine effect by 1 hour,
achieves maximum effect at 2-3 hours, and an effect is still seen at 12
hours. There was no evidence of tolerance to these effects after 28 days
of dosing. </p>

<p>Effects on QTc. In dogs, (10 mg/kg/day, orally for 5 days) and rabbits
(10 mg/kg, intravenously over one hour) fexofenadine did not prolong QTc
at plasma concentrations that were at least 28 and 63 times, respectively,
the therapeutic plasma concentrations in man (based on a 60 mg twice daily
fexofenadine hydrochloride dose). No effect was observed on calcium channel
current, delayed K+ channel current, or action potential duration in guinea
pig myocytes, Na+ current in rat neonatal myocytes or on the delayed rectifier
K+ channel cloned rom human heart at concentrations up to 1 x 1 0-5 of
fexofenadine. is concentration was at least 32 times the therapeutic plasma
concentration in man (based on a 60-mg twice daily fexofenadine hydrochloride
dose). </p>

<p>No statistically significant increase in mean QTc interval compared
to placebo was observed in 714 seasonal allergic rhinitis patients given
fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules in doses of 60 mg to 240 mg twice daily
for two weeks or in 40 healthy volunteers given fexofenadine hydrochloride
as an oral solution at doses up to 400 mg twice daily for 6 days. </p>

<p>Clinical Studies </p>

<p>In three, 2-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials in patients 12-68 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis (n=1
634), fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced
total symptom scores (the sum of the individual scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea,
itchy nose/palate/throat, itchy/watery/red eyes) compared to placebo. Statistically
significant reductions in symptom scores were observed following the first
60-mg dose, with the effect maintained throughout the 12-hour interval.
In general, there was no additional reduction in total symptom scores with
higher doses of fexofenadine up to 240 mg twice daily. Although the number
of subjects in some of the subgroups was small, there were no significant
differences in the effect of fexofenadine hydrochloride across subgroups
of patients defined by gender, age, and race. Onset of action for reduction
in total symptom scores, excluding nasal congestion, was observed at 60
minutes compared to placebo following a single 60-mg fexofenadine hydrochloride
dose administered to patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who were
exposed to ragweed pollen in an environmental exposure unit. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Fexofenadine is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with
seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children 12 years of age and older.
Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose/palate/throat,
itchy/watery/red eyes. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>In two separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily
(twice the recommended dose) was co-administered with erythromycin 500
mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400mg once dally under steady state conditions
to normal, healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse
events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine
hydrochloride alone or in combination with erythromycin or ketoconazole.

<p>The mechanisms of these interactions are unknown, and the potential
for interaction with other azole antifungal or macrolide agents has not
been studied. These changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma
levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Fexofenadine
had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of erythromycin or ketoconazole.
</p>

<p>The carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity of fexofenadine
hydrochloride were assessed using terfenadine studies with adequate fexofenadine
exposure (based on plasma area-under-the-curve [AUC] values). No evidence
of carcinogenicity was observed when mice and rats were given daily oral
doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg of terfenadine for 18 and 24 months, respectively;
these doses resulted in plasma AUC values of fexofenadine that were up
to four times the human therapeutic value (based on a 60-mg twice-daily
fexofenadine hydrochloride dose). </p>

<p>In in-vitro (Bacterial Reverse Mutation, CHO/HGPRT Forward Mutation,
and Rat Lymphocyte Chromosomal Aberration assays) and in-vivo (Mouse Bone
Marrow Micronucleus assay) tests, fexofenadine hydrochloride revealed no
evidence of mutagenicity. </p>

<p>In rat fertility studies, dose-related reductions in implants and increases
in postimplantation losses were observed at oral doses equal to or greater
than 150 mg/kg of terfenadine; these doses produced plasma AUC values of
fexofenadine that were equal to or greater than three times the human therapeutic
value (based on a 60-mg twice-daily fexofenadine hydrochloride dose). </p>

<p>Teratogenic Effects: Category C. There was no evidence of teratogenicity
in rats or rabbits at oral terfenadine doses up to 300 mg/kg; these doses
produced fexofenadine plasma AUC values that were up to 4 and 37 times
the human therapeutic value (based on a 60-mg twice-daily fexofenadine
hydrochloride dose), respectively. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should be used during
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to
the fetus. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects. Dose-related decreases in pup weight gain and
survival were observed in rats exposed to oral doses equal to and greater
than 150 mg/kg of terfenadine; at these doses the plasma AUC values of
fexofenadine were equal to or greater than 3 times the human therapeutic
values (based on a 60-mg twice-daily fexofenadine hydrochloride dose).
</p>

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in women during lactation.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised
when fexofenadine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness of Fexofenadine in pediatric patients under
the age of 12 years have not been established. Across well-controlled clinical
trials in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, a total of 205 patients
between the ages of 12 to 16 years received doses ranging from 20 mg to
240 mg twice daily for up to two weeks. Adverse events were similar in

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Selegiline is a levorotatory acetylenic derivative of phenethylamine.
It is commonly referred to in the clinical and pharmacological literature
as l- deprenyl. </p>

<p>The chemical name is: (R)-(-)-N,2-dimethyl-N- 2-propynylphenethylamine
hydrochloride. It is a white to near white crystalline powder, freely soluble
in water, chloroform, and methanol, and has a molecular weight of 223.75.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The mechanisms accounting for selegiline's beneficial adjunctive action
in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood. Inhibition
of monoamine oxidase, type B, activity is generally considered to be of
primary importance; in addition, there is evidence that selegiline may
act through other mechanisms to increase dopaminergic activity. </p>

<p>Selegiline is best known as an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase
(MAO), an intracellular enzyme associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria.
Selegiline inhibits MAO by acting as a 'suicide' substrate for the enzyme;
that is, it is converted by MAO to an active moiety which combines irreversibly
with the active site and/or the enzyme's essential FAD cofactor. Because
selegiline has greater affinity for type B than for type A active sites,
it can serve as a selective inhibitor of MAO type B if it is administered
at the recommended dose. </p>

<p>MAOs are widely distributed throughout the body; their concentration
is especially high in liver, kidney, stomach, intestinal wall, and brain.
MAOs are currently subclassified into two types, A and B, which differ
in their substrate specificity and tissue distribution. In humans, intestinal
MAO is predominantly type A, while most of that in brain is type B. </p>

<p>In CNS neurons, MAO plays an important role in the catabolism of catecholamines
(dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) and serotonin. MAOs are also
important in the catabolism of various exogenous amines found in a variety
of foods and drugs. MAO in the GI tract and liver (primarily type A), for
example, is thought to provide vital protection from exogenous amines (e.g.,
tyramine) that have the capacity, if absorbed intact, to cause a 'hypertensive
crisis,' the so-called 'cheese reaction.' (If large amounts of certain
exogenous amines gain access to the systemic circulation--e.g., from fermented
cheese, red wine, herring, over-the- counter cough/cold medications, etc.--they
are taken up by adrenergic neurons and displace norepinephrine from storage
sites within membrane bound vesicles. Subsequent release of the displaced
norepinephrine causes the rise in systemic blood pressure, etc.) </p>

<p>In theory, therefore, because MAO A of the gut is not inhibited, patients
treated with selegiline at a dose of 10 mg a day can take medications containing
pharmacologically active amines and consume tyramine-containing foods without
risk of uncontrolled hypertension. To date, clinical experience appears
to confirm this prediction; cheese reactions have not been reported in
selegiline treated patients. The pathophysiology of the 'cheese reaction'
is complicated and, in addition to its ability to inhibit MAO B selectively,
selegiline's apparent freedom from this reaction has been attributed to
an ability to prevent tyramine and other indirect acting sympathomimetics
from displacing norepinephrine from adrenergic neurons. </p>

<p>However, until the pathophysiology of the cheese reaction is more completely
understood, it seems prudent to assume that selegiline can only be used
safely without dietary restrictions at doses where it presumably selectively
inhibits MAO B (e.g., 10 mg/day). IN SHORT, ATTENTION TO THE DOSE DEPENDENT
NATURE OF SELEGILINE'S SELECTIVITY IS CRITICAL IF IT IS TO BE USED WITHOUT
ELABORATE RESTRICTIONS BEING PLACED ON DIET AND CONCOMITANT DRUG USE. (SEE
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p>It is important to be aware that selegiline may have pharmacological
effects unrelated to MAO B inhibition. As noted above, there is some evidence
that it may increase dopaminergic activity by other mechanisms, including
interfering with dopamine re-uptake at the synapse. Effects resulting from
selegiline administration may also be mediated through its metabolites.
Two of its three principal metabolites, amphetamine and methamphetamine,
have pharmacological actions of their own; they interfere with neuronal
uptake and enhance release of several neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin). However, the extent to which these metabolites contribute
to the effects of selegiline are unknown. </p>

<p>RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF A SELECTIVE MONOAMINE OXIDASE TYPE B INHIBITOR
IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE: </p>

<p>Many of the prominent symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to a deficiency
of striatal dopamine that is the consequence of a progressive degeneration
and loss of a population of dopaminergic neurons which originate in the
substantia nigra of the midbrain and project to the basal ganglia or striatum.
Early in the course of Parkinson's, the deficit in the capacity of these
neurons to synthesize dopamine can be overcome by administration of exogenous
levodopa, usually given in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase
inhibitor (carbidopa). </p>

<p>With the passage of time, due to the progression of the disease and/or
the effect of sustained treatment, the efficacy and quality of the therapeutic
response to levodopa diminishes. Thus, after several years of levodopa
treatment, the response, for a given dose of levodopa, is shorter, has
less predictable onset and offset (i.e., there is 'wearing off'), and is
often accompanied by side effects (e.g., dyskinesia, akinesias, on-off
phenomena, freezing, etc.). </p>

<p>This deteriorating response is currently interpreted as a manifestation
of the inability of the ever decreasing population of intact nigrostriatal
neurons to synthesize and release adequate amounts of dopamine. </p>

<p>MAO B inhibition may be useful in this setting because, by blocking
the catabolism of dopamine, it would increase the net amount of dopamine
available (i.e., it would increase the pool of dopamine). Whether or not
this mechanism or an alternative one actually accounts for the observed
beneficial effects of adjunctive selegiline is unknown. </p>

<p>Selegiline's benefit in Parkinson's disease has only been documented
as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa. Whether or not it might be effective
as a sole treatment is unknown, but past attempts to treat Parkinson's
disease with non- selective MAOI monotherapy are reported to have been
unsuccessful. It is important to note that attempts to treat Parkinsonian
patients with combinations of levodopa and currently marketed non-selective
MAO inhibitors were abandoned because of multiple side effects including
hypertension, increase in involuntary movement, and toxic delirium. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETIC INFORMATION (ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM AND
ELIMINATION--ADME): </p>

<p>Only preliminary information about the details of the pharmacokinetics
of selegiline and its metabolites is available. </p>

<p>Data obtained in a study of 12 healthy subjects that was intended to
examine the effects of selegiline on the ADME of an oral hypoglycemic agent,
however, provides some information. Following the oral administration of
a single dose of 10 mg of selegiline hydrochloride to these subjects, serum
levels of intact selegiline were below the limit of detection (less than
10 ng/mL). Three metabolites, N-desmethyldeprenyl, the major metabolite
(mean half-life 2.0 hours), amphetamine (mean half-life 17.7 hours), and
methamphetamine (mean half- life 20.5 hours), were found in serum and urine.
Over a period of 48 hours, 45% of the dose administered appeared in the
urine as these 3 metabolites. In an extension of this study intended to
examine the effects of steady state conditions, the same subjects were
given a 10 mg dose of selegiline hydrochloride for seven consecutive days.
Under these conditions, the mean trough serum levels for amphetamine were
3.5 ng/mL and 8.0 ng/mL for methamphetamine; trough levels of N- desmethyldeprenyl
were below the levels of detection. </p>

<p>The rate of MAO B regeneration following discontinuation of treatment
has not been quantitated. It is this rate, dependent upon de novo protein
synthesis, which seems likely to determine how fast normal MAO B activity
can be restored. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Selegiline is indicated as an adjunct in the management of Parkinsonian
patients being treated with levodopa/carbidopa who exhibit deterioration
in the quality of their response to this therapy. There is no evidence
from controlled studies that selegiline has any beneficial effect in the
absence of concurrent levodopa therapy. </p>

<p>Evidence supporting this claim was obtained in randomized controlled
clinical investigations that compared the effects of added selegiline or
placebo in patients receiving levodopa/carbidopa. Selegiline was significantly
superior to placebo on all three principal outcome measures employed: change
from baseline in daily levodopa/carbidopa dose, the amount of 'off' time,
and patient self- rating of treatment success. Beneficial effects were
also observed on other measures of treatment success (e.g., measures of
reduced end of dose akinesia, decreased tremor and sialorrhea, improved
speech and dressing ability and improved overall disability as assessed
by walking and comparison to previous state). </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Selegiline is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity
to this drug. </p>

<p>Selegiline is contraindicated for use with meperidine (DEMEROL &amp;
other trade names). This contraindication is often extended to other opioids.
(See DRUG INTERACTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>SELEGILINE SHOULD NOT BE USED AT DAILY DOSES EXCEEDING THOSE RECOMMENDED
(10 MG/DAY) BECAUSE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NON-SELECTIVE INHIBITION
OF MAO. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) </p>

<p>The selectivity of selegiline for MAO B may not be absolute even at
the recommended daily dose of 10 mg a day and selectivity is further diminished
with increasing daily doses. The precise dose at which selegiline becomes
a non- selective inhibitor of all MAO is unknown, but may be in the range
of 30 to 40 mg a day. </p>

<p>Severe CNS toxicity associated with hyperpyrexia and death have been
reported with the combination of tricyclic antidepressants and non-selective
MAOIs (NARDIL, PARNATE). A similar reaction has been reported for a patient
on amitriptyline and Selegiline. Another patient receiving protriptyline
and Selegiline developed tremors, agitation, and restlessness followed
by unresponsiveness and death two weeks after Selegiline was added. Related
adverse events including hypertension, syncope, asystole, diaphoresis,
seizures, changes in behavioral and mental status, and muscular rigidity
have also been reported in some patients receiving Selegiline and various
tricyclic antidepressants. </p>

<p>Serious, sometimes fatal, reactions with signs and symptoms that may
include hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with rapid
fluctuations of the vital signs, and mental status changes that include
extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma have been reported with
patients receiving a combination of fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) and
non- selective MAOIs. Similar signs have been reported in some patients
on the combination of Selegiline (10 mg a day) and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors including fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine. </p>

<p>Since the mechanisms of these reactions are not fully understood, it
seems prudent, in general, to avoid this combination of Selegiline and
tricyclic antidepressants as well as Selegiline and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation
of Selegiline and initiation of treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant
or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Because of the long half lives
of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, at least five weeks (perhaps longer,
especially if fluoxetine has been prescribed chronically and/or at higher
doses) should elapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation
of treatment with Selegiline. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Some patients given selegiline may experience an exacerbation of levodopa
associated side effects, presumably due to the increased amounts of dopamine
reacting with super-sensitive post- synaptic receptors. These effects may
often be mitigated by reducing the dose of levodopa/carbidopa by approximately
10 to 30%. </p>

<p>The decision to prescribe selegiline should take into consideration
that the MAO system of enzymes is complex and incompletely understood and
there is only a limited amount of carefully documented clinical experience
with selegiline. Consequently, the full spectrum of possible responses
to selegiline may not have been observed in pre-marketing evaluation of
the drug. It is advisable, therefore, to observe patients closely for atypical
responses. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be advised of the possible need to reduce levodopa dosage
after the initiation of Selegiline therapy. </p>

<p>Patients (or their families if the patient is incompetent) should be
advised not to exceed the daily recommended dose of 10 mg. The risk of
using higher daily doses of selegiline should be explained, and a brief
description of the 'cheese reaction' provided. While hypertensive reactions
with selegiline associated with dietary influences have not been reported,
documented experience is limited. Consequently, it may be useful to inform
patients (or their families) about the signs and symptoms associated with
MAOI induced hypertensive reactions. In particular, patients should be
urged to report, immediately, any severe headache or other atypical or
unusual symptoms not previously experienced. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: </p>

<p>No specific laboratory tests are deemed essential for the management
of patients on Selegiline. Periodic routine evaluation of all patients,
however, is appropriate. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>The occurrence of stupor, muscular rigidity, severe agitation, and elevated
temperature has been reported in some patients receiving the combination
of selegiline and meperidine. Symptoms usually resolve over days when the
combination is discontinued. This is typical of the interaction of meperidine
and MAOIs. Other serious reactions (including severe agitation, hallucinations,
and death) have been reported in patients receiving this combination (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS). Severe toxicity has also been reported in patients
receiving the combination of tricyclic antidepressants and Selegiline and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and Selegiline. (See WARNINGS for
details). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: </p>

<p>Studies have not been performed to date to evaluate the carcinogenic
potential of selegiline hydrochloride. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY: </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category C. Insufficient animal reproduction studies have
been done with selegiline to conclude that selegiline poses no teratogenic
risk. However, one rat study carried out at doses as much as 180 fold the
recommended human dose revealed no evidence of a teratogenic effect. It
is not known whether selegiline can cause fetal harm when administered
to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Selegiline should
be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: </p>

<p>It is not known whether selegiline hydrochloride is excreted in human
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, consideration should
be given to discontinuing the use of all but absolutely essential drug
treatments in nursing women. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: </p>

<p>The effects of selegiline hydrochloride in children have not been evaluated.
</p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: </p>

<p>The number of patients who received selegiline in prospectively monitored
pre- marketing studies is limited. While other sources of information about
the use of selegiline are available (e.g., literature reports, foreign
post-marketing reports, etc.) they do not provide the kind of information
necessary to estimate the incidence of adverse events. Thus, overall incidence
figures for adverse reactions associated with the use of selegiline cannot
be provided. Many of the adverse reactions seen have also reported as symptoms
of dopamine excess. Moreover, the importance and severity of various reactions
reported often cannot be ascertained. One index of relative importance,
however, is whether or not a reaction caused treatment discontinuation.
In prospective pre-marketing studies, the following events led, in decreasing
order of frequency, to discontinuation of treatment with selegiline: nausea,
hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, orthostatic
hypotension, increased akinetic involuntary movements, agitation, arrhythmia,
bradykinesia, chorea, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina
pectoris, and syncope. Events reported only once as a cause of discontinuation
are ankle edema, anxiety, burning lips/mouth, constipation, drowsiness/lethargy,
dystonia, excess perspiration, increased freezing, gastrointestinal bleeding,
hair loss, increased tremor, nervousness, weakness, and weight loss. </p>

<p>Experience with Selegiline obtained in parallel, placebo controlled,
randomized studies provides only a limited basis for estimates of adverse
reaction rates. The following reactions that occurred with greater frequency
among the 49 patients assigned to selegiline as compared to the 50 patients
assigned to placebo in the only parallel, placebo controlled trial performed
in patients with Parkinson's disease are shown in the following Table.
None of these adverse reactions led to a discontinuation of treatment.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS: asthma, diplopia, shortness of breath, speech affected.
</p>

<p>POSTMARKETING REPORTS: The following experiences were described in spontaneous
post-marketing reports. These reports do not provide sufficient information
to establish a clear causal relationship with the use of Selegiline. </p>

<p>CNS Seizure in dialyzed chronic renal failure patient on concomitant
medications. * indicates events reported only at doses greater than 10
mg/day. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>SELEGILINE: </p>

<p>No specific information is available about clinically significant overdoses
with Selegiline. However, experience gained during selegiline's development
reveals that some individuals exposed to doses of 600 mg d,l-selegiline
suffered severe hypotension and psychomotor agitation. </p>

<p>Since the selective inhibition of MAO B by selegiline hydrochloride
is achieved only at doses in the range recommended for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease (e.g., 10 mg/day), overdoses are likely to cause significant
inhibition of both MAO A and MAO B. Consequently, the signs and symptoms
of overdose may resemble those observed with marketed non-selective MAO
inhibitors (e.g., tranylcypromine (PARNATE), isocarboxazide (MARPLAN),
and phenelzine (NARDIL)). </p>

<p>OVERDOSE WITH NON-SELECTIVE MAO INHIBITION: </p>

<p>NOTE: This section is provided for reference; it does not describe events
that have actually been observed with selegiline in overdose. </p>

<p>Characteristically, signs and symptoms of non- selective MAOI overdose
may not appear immediately. Delays of up to 12 hours between ingestion
of drug and the appearance of signs may occur. Importantly, the peak intensity
of the syndrome may not be reached for upwards of a day following the overdose.
Death has been reported following overdosage. Therefore, immediate hospitalization,
with continuous patient observation and monitoring for a period of at least
two days following the ingestion of such drugs in overdose, is strongly
recommended. The clinical picture of MAOI overdose varies considerably;
its severity may be a function of the amount of drug consumed. The central
nervous and cardiovascular systems are prominently involved. </p>

<p>Signs and symptoms of overdosage may include, alone or in combination,
any of the following: drowsiness, dizziness, faintness, irritability, hyperactivity,
agitation, severe headache, hallucinations, trismus, opisthotonus, convulsions,
and coma; rapid and irregular pulse, hypertension, hypotension and vascular
collapse; precordial pain, respiratory depression and failure, hyperpyrexia,
diaphoresis, and cool, clammy skin. </p>

<p>TREATMENT SUGGESTIONS FOR OVERDOSE: </p>

<p>NOTE: BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECORDED EXPERIENCE WITH SELEGILINE OVERDOSE,
THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS ARE OFFERED BASED UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELEGILINE
OVERDOSE MAY BE MODELED BY NON- SELECTIVE MAOI POISONING. IN ANY CASE,
UP-TO- DATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF OVERDOSE CAN OFTEN BE OBTAINED
FROM A CERTIFIED REGIONAL POISON CONTROL CENTER. TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF CERTIFIED
POISON CONTROL CENTERS ARE LISTED IN THE PHYSICIANS' DESK REFERENCE (PDR).
</p>

<p>Treatment of overdose with non-selective MAOIs is symptomatic and supportive.
Induction of emesis or gastric lavage with instillation of charcoal slurry
may be helpful in early poisoning, provided the airway has been protected
against aspiration. Signs and symptoms of central nervous system stimulation,
including convulsions, should be treated with diazepam, given slowly intravenously.
Phenothiazine derivatives and central nervous system stimulants should
be avoided. Hypotension and vascular collapse should be treated with intravenous
fluids and, if necessary, blood pressure titration with an intravenous
infusion of a dilute pressor agent. It should be noted that adrenergic
agents may produce a markedly increased pressor response. </p>

<p>Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management
of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory assistance,
as required. </p>

<p>Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of
hyperpyrexia may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance
is essential. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Selegiline is intended for administration to Parkinsonian patients receiving
levodopa/carbidopa therapy who demonstrate a deteriorating response to
this treatment. The recommended regimen for the administration of Selegiline
is 10 mg per day administered as divided doses of 5 mg each taken at breakfast
and lunch. There is no evidence that additional benefit will be obtained
from the administration of higher doses. Moreover, higher doses should
ordinarily be avoided because of the increased risk of side effects. </p>

<p>After two to three days of selegiline treatment, an attempt may be made
to reduce the dose of levodopa/carbidopa. A reduction of 10 to 30% was
achieved with the typical participant in the domestic placebo controlled
trials who was assigned to selegiline treatment. Further reductions of
levodopa/carbidopa may be possible during continued selegiline therapy.

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Etodolac is a pyranocarboxylic acid chemically designated as (+/- ) 1
8-diethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano-(3,4-b)indole-1-acetic acid.  
 <p>
The empirical formula for etodolac is C17H21NO3. The molecular weight of the
base is 287.37. It has a pKa of 4.65 and an n-octanol:water partition
coefficient of 11.4 at pH 7.4. Etodolac is a white crystalline compound,
insoluble in water but soluble in alcohols, chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, and 
aqueous polyethylene glycol.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
PHARMACOLOGY 
 <p>
Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-
inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities in animal models. The
mechanism of action of etodolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not known but is 
believed to be associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis.  
 <p>
Etodolac is a racemic mixture of R- and S-etodolac. As with other NSAIDs, it has
been demonstrated in animals that the S-form is biologically active and the R
form is not. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no R-to-S conversion In
Vivo.  
 <p>
PHARMACODYNAMICS 
 <p>
Analgesia was demonstrable by 1/2 hour following single doses of 200 to 400 mg
Etodolac, with the peak effect occurring in 1 to 2 hours. The analgesic effect
generally lasts for 4 to 6 hours (with some patients maintaining analgesia up
to 8 to 12 hours; see &quot;Analgesia&quot; and &quot;Osteoarthritis&quot; sections under &quot;CLINICAL 
TRIALS&quot; below).  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS 
 <p>
The pharmacokinetics of etodolac have been evaluated in 267 normal subjects, 44 
elderly patients (&gt; 65 years old), 19 patients with renal failure (creatinine
clearance 37 to 88 mL/min), 9 patients on hemodialysis, and 10 patients with
compensated hepatic cirrhosis. Etodolac is well absorbed and had a relative
bioavailability of 100% when 200 mg capsules were compared with a solution of
etodolac. Based on mass balance studies, the systemic availability of Etodolac is 
at least 80%, and etodolac does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism
following oral administration. The dose-proportionality based on AUC (the area
under the plasma concentration-time curve) is linear following doses up to 600
mg every 12 hours. Peak concentrations are dose-proportional for both total and 
free etodolac following doses up to 400 mg every 12 hours, but following a 600
mg dose, the peak is about 20% higher than predicted on the basis of lower
doses. As shown on the graphs below, etodolac plasma concentrations, after
multiple-dose administration, are slightly higher than after single doses, as
predicted, indicating no change in pharmacokinetics with multiple dose use. 
Etodolac is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The free fraction is less
than 1% and is independent of etodolac total concentration over the dose range
studied.  
 <p>
Etodolac, when administered orally, exhibits characteristics which are well
described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption.  Mean (+/-1
SD) peak plasma concentrations range from approximately 14+/-4 to 37+/-9
mcgm/mL after 200 to 600 mg single doses and are reached in 80+/-30 minutes.
The mean plasma clearance of etodolac is 47 (+/-16) mL/h/kg, and terminal
disposition half-life is 7.3 (+/-4.0) hours (see Table for Summary of
Pharmacokinetic Parameters).  <p>
As with many drugs which are hepatically metabolized and not dosed on a mg/kg
basis, the intersubject variability of etodolac plasma levels, achieved after
recommended doses, is substantial. The graph of simulated curves below
demonstrates the range of plasma concentrations that would be expected for 95%
of the patients following 200 or 400 mg single doses on the top and on t.i.d. 
regimens on the bottom (at steady-state). The cross-hatched area represents the 
overlap in plasma levels following 200 or 400 mg of Etodolac orally as single or
multiple doses. The area above the upper 95% C.L. lines represents blood levels 
which would be achieved by larger doses or in individuals with decreased
clearance in whom one should anticipate increased adverse reactions. The area
below the 95% C.L. lines represents blood levels following lower doses or in
individuals with high clearance of etodolac, and one would expect less
effectiveness in such patients. The data used to produce these simulations were 
derived from the mean +/- 2 SD of the plasma concentrations at each time point
from a total of 267 normal subjects following multiple dosing. As with other
drugs, including NSAIDs, greater variability is to be expected in patients,
particularly those with GI problems and those taking other drugs affecting the
GI tract, protein binding, or hepatic or renal function.

Etodolac is extensively metabolized in the liver, with renal elimination of
etodolac and its metabolites being the primary route of excretion.
Approximately 72% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as the
following, indicated as % of the administered dose:  
 
--etodolac, unchanged                          1%                               
--etodolac glucuronide                        13%                               
--hydroxylated metabolites                                                      
  (6-, 7- and 8-OH)                            5%                               
--hydroxylated metabolite                                                       
  glucuronides                                20%                               
--unidentified metabolites                    33%        </pre><p>                       
Fecal excretion accounted for 16% of the dose. Therefore, enterohepatic
circulation, if present, is not extensive.  
 <p>
The extent of absorption of etodolac is not affected when Etodolac is
administered after a meal or with an antacid. Food intake, however, reduces the 
peak concentration reached by approximately one half, and increases the time-to 
peak concentration by 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Coadministration with an antacid
decreases the peak concentration reached by about 15 to 20%, with no measurable 
effect on time-to-peak.  
 <p>
In studies in the elderly, age was found to have no effect on etodolac t1/2 or
protein binding, and there was no drug accumulation. Etodolac clearance was
reduced by about 15%. Because the reduction in clearance is small, no dosage
adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of
pharmacokinetics. The elderly may need dosage adjustment, however, on the basis 
of body size (see GERIATRIC POPULATION), and they may be more sensitive to
antiprostaglandin effects than younger patients (see PRECAUTIONS).  <p>
 
In studies of the effects of mild-to-moderate renal impairment, no significant
differences in the disposition of total and free etodolac were observed. In
patients undergoing hemodialysis, there was a 50% greater apparent clearance of 
total etodolac, due to a 50% greater unbound fraction. Free etodolac clearance
was not altered, indicating the importance of protein binding in etodolac's
disposition. Nevertheless etodolac is not dialyzable. No dosage adjustment of
Etodolac is generally required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal
impairment; however, etodolac should be used with caution in such patients
because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some
patients with impaired renal function (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
In patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, the disposition of total and
free etodolac is not altered. Although no dosage adjustment is generally
required in this patient population, etodolac clearance is dependent on hepatic 
function and could be reduced in patients with severe hepatic failure.  
 <p>
SPECIAL STUDIES 
 <p>
Etodolac was compared with other NSAIDs in inducing gastrointestinal (GI)
microbleeding. Etodolac 1200 mg/day caused less GI blood loss than ibuprofen 2400 
mg/day, indomethacin 200 mg/day, or naproxen 750 mg/day. Etodolac was also
compared with piroxicam 20 mg/day in two studies; piroxicam caused more blood
loss than Etodolac in one of these studies but not the other.  
 <p>
Etodolac was also compared to other NSAIDs in GI endoscopic studies. Endoscopic
scores in studies of 12 healthy subjects following 1 week of Etodolac 1200 mg/day 
showed significantly fewer GI mucosal erosions with Etodolac than with aspirin
3900 mg/day. In another study performed in healthy males 18 to 41 years of age, 
12 subjects treated with Etodolac 1000 mg/day for one week had lower endoscopic
scores than 12 subjects treated with indomethacin 200 mg/day, naproxen 1000
mg/day, or ibuprofen 2400 mg/day. Another endoscopic study comparing effects of 
Etodolac 1000 mg/day with piroxicam 20 mg/day, each administered to 12 normal
volunteers for one month, yielded equivocal results, with both treatments
showing higher scores than the 12-subject placebo-treated group.  
 <p>
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.  
 <p>
CLINICAL TRIALS 
 <p>
Analgesia 
 <p>
Controlled clinical trials in analgesia were single-dose, randomized, double-
blind, parallel studies in 3 pain models (dental extractions, post-general
surgery, and post-episiotomy pain). In these studies there were patients
treated with placebo, 2 or more doses of etodolac, and varying combinations of
aspirin, acetaminophen with codeine (oral surgery only), or zomepirac. The
analgesic effective dose for Etodolac established in these acute pain models was
200 to 400 mg. The onset of analgesia occurred approximately 30 minutes after
oral administration and was comparable for Etodolac (200 to 400 mg), aspirin (650 
mg), acetaminophen with codeine (600 mg +60 mg), and zomepirac (100 mg). The
peak analgesic effect was between 1 to 2 hours. Duration of relief averaged 4
to 5 hours for 200 mg of Etodolac and 5 to 6 hours for 400 mg of Etodolac as
measured by when approximately half of the patients required remedication.
However, in some studies there were still statistically significant differences 
between the degree of pain relief experienced by patients treated with 200 and
400 mg of Etodolac and placebo-treated patients at 8 hours.  
 <p>
Osteoarthritis 
 <p>
The use of Etodolac in managing the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the
hip or knee was assessed in double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical
trials in 341 patients. In patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, Etodolac in
doses of 600 to 1000 mg/day was better than placebo in 2 studies. The clinical
trials in osteoarthritis used b.i.d. dosage regimens. The initial dosing
recommendation for Etodolac in patients with osteoarthritis is t.i.d.
administration, due to etodolac's pharmacokinetic profile (See PHARMACOKINETICS 
and INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE).  
 <p>
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
 <p>
Etodolac is not recommended for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis because in controlled clinical trials, although Etodolac treatment was
sometimes better than placebo treatment, it was generally not as effective as
treatment with other marketed NSAIDs.  
 <p>
INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE 
 <p>
Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, shows considerable interindividual variation in
response. Consequently, the recommended strategy for initiating therapy is to
use a starting dose likely to be effective for the majority of patients and to
adjust dosage thereafter based on observations of Etodolac's beneficial and
adverse effects.  
 <p>
The effectiveness of Etodolac in otherwise healthy, young to middle-aged adults
in acute pain studies showed symptom relief to last approximately 5 to 6 hours
following single 400 mg doses and 4 to 5 hours following 200 mg doses as judged 
by the time by which approximately half of the patients needed remedication. In 
dental extraction studies, hourly comparisons were made of the number of
placebo-treated patients versus the number of Etodolac-treated patients who
needed to be remedicated. In these studies, the 200 mg Etodolac group had
significantly fewer patients who needed remedication up to 6 hours than the
placebo group, while the 400 mg Etodolac group had significantly fewer patients
who required remedication for up to 12 hours.  
 <p>
These results suggest an initial Etodolac dose of 400 mg for acute pain followed
by doses of 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, not to exceed a
maximum total daily dose of 1200 mg. If a patient taking 400 mg doses has
adequate pain relief that does not last 8 hours, then 300 mg every 6 hours
(q.i.d.) is a reasonable schedule to try. As with all NSAIDs, if symptoms are
still not adequately controlled by recommended doses, another analgesic should
be tried.  
 <p>
In osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose of Etodolac is 800 to 1200
mg/day in divided doses: 400 mg t.i.d. or b.i.d. or 300 mg q.i.d. or t.i.d.
which is derived from pharmacokinetic and single-dose analgesic trial data. In
controlled clinical trials in patients with osteoarthritis, total daily doses
of 600 to 1000 mg of Etodolac were successfully given on a b.i.d. schedule. In
one study some patients were apparently adequately treated with as little as
200 mg Etodolac b.i.d. The pharmacokinetic profile of Etodolac and the results of
single-dose analgesia studies suggest, however, that the drug may provide
greater benefit when given on a t.i.d. schedule. As with other NSAIDs, the
lowest dose and longest dosing interval should be sought for each patient.
Therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy with Etodolac, the
dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit individual patient's needs. The
recommended total daily dose of Etodolac is 600 to 1200 mg/day given in divided
doses: 400 mg t.i.d.  or b.i.d.; 300 mg q.i.d., t.i.d. or b.i.d.; 200 mg q.i.d. 
or t.i.d..  
 <p>
Total daily doses of Etodolac above 20 mg/kg/day have not been studied. Therefore 
in patients weighing less than 60 kg (132 lbs), or where the severity of the
disease, concomitant medications, or other diseases warrant, the maximum
recommended total daily dose of 1200 mg should be reduced. (See PRECAUTIONS) 
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Etodolac is indicated for acute and long-term use in the management of signs and
symptoms of osteoarthritis. Etodolac is also indicated for the management of
pain.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Etodolac is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown
hypersensitivity to it. Etodolac should not be given to patients in whom Etodolac,
aspirin, or ther NSAIDs induce asthma, rhinitis, urticaria, or other allergic
reactions. Fatal asthmatic reactions have been reported in such patients
receiving NSAIDs.  
 <p>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <p>
RISK OF GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) ULCERATION, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION WITH
NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG THERAPY 
 <p>
Serious GI toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, can occur
at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated chronically
with NSAIDs. Although minor upper GI problems, such as dyspepsia, are common,
usually developing early in therapy, physicians should remain alert for
ulceration and bleeding in patients treated chronically with NSAIDs even in the 
absence of previous GI-tract symptoms. In patients observed in clinical trials
of such agents for several months to 2 years' duration, symptomatic upper GI
ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation appear to occur in approximately 1% of
patients treated for 3 to 6 months and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated
for 1 year.  Physicians should inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms
of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if they occur.  
 <p>
Studies to date have not identified any subset of patients not at risk of
developing peptic ulceration and bleeding. Except for a prior history of
serious GI events and other risk factors known to be associated with peptic
ulcer disease, such as alcoholism, smoking, etc., no risk factors (e.g., age,
sex) have been associated with increased risk. Elderly or debilitated patients
seem to tolerate ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals, and
most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in this population. Studies to
date are inconclusive concerning the relative risk of various NSAIDs in causing 
such reactions. High doses of any NSAID probably carry a greater risk of these
reactions, although controlled clinical trials showing this do not exist in
most cases. In considering the use of relatively large doses (within the
recommended dosage range), sufficient benefit should be anticipated to offset
the potential increased risk of GI toxicity.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL PRECAUTIONS 
 <p>
Renal Effects 
 <p>
As with other NSAIDs, long-term administration of etodolac to rats has resulted 
in renal papillary necrosis and other renal medullary changes. Renal pelvic
transitional epithelial hyperplasia, a spontaneous change occurring with
variable frequency, was observed with increased frequency in treated male rats
in a 2-year chronic study. The cause-effect relationship to etodolac has not
been established.  
 <p>
A second form of renal toxicity encountered with Etodolac, as with other NSAIDs,
is seen in patients with conditions in which renal prostaglandins have a
supportive role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients,
administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-
dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood 
flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest
risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure,
liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to
the pretreatment state.  
 <p>
Etodolac metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The extent to
which the inactive glucuronide metabolites may accumulate in patients with
renal failure has not been studied. As with other drugs whose metabolites are
excreted by the kidney, the possibility that adverse reactions (not listed in
ADVERSE REACTIONS) may be attributable to these metabolites should be
considered.  
 <p>
Hepatic Effects 
 <p>
As with all NSAIDs, borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur
in up to 15% of patients. These abnormalities may disappear, remain essentially 
unchanged, or progress with continued therapy. Meaningful elevations of ALT or
AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been
reported in approxiamtely 1% of patients in clinical trials with Etodolac. A
patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an
abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Etodolac. 
Although such reactions are rare, if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if 
clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if
systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Etodolac should
be discontinued.  
 <p>
Hematological Effect 
 <p>
Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving Etodolac or other NSAIDs. This may 
be due to fluid retention, gastrointestinal blood loss, or an incompletely
described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with
NSAIDs, including Etodolac, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if 
they develop signs or symptoms of anemia.  
 <p>
All drugs which inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins may interfere to
some extent with platelet function and vascular responses to bleeding. Patients 
receiving Etodolac who may be adversely affected by such actions should be
carefully observed.  
 <p>
Fluid Retention And Edema 
 <p>
Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking Etodolac. 
Therefore, as with other NSAIDs, Etodolac should be used with caution in patients 
with fluid retention, hypertension, or heart failure.  
 <p>
Information For Patients 
 <p>
Etodolac, like other NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs), is not free
of side effects. The side effects of these drugs can cause discomfort and,
rarely, there may be serious side effects, such as GI bleeding, that may result 
in hospitalization and even fatal outcomes.  
 <p>
NSAIDs are often essential agents in the management of arthritis and have a
major role in the treatment of pain, but they also may be commonly employed for 
conditions that are less serious.  
 <p>
Physicians may wish to discuss with their patients the potential risks (see
WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections) and likely benefits of
Etodolac treatment, particularly when it may be used for less serious conditions
in which treatment without Etodolac may represent an acceptable alternative to
both the patient and physician.  
 <p>
LABORATORY TESTS 
 <p>
Because serious GI-tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without warning
symptoms, physicians should observe chronically treated patients for the signs
and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding and should inform them of the
importance of this follow-up (see &quot;RISK OF GI ULCERATIONS, BLEEDING, AND
PERFORATION WITH NSAID THERAPY&quot;).  
 <p>
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
<p>
Antacids 
 <p>
The concomitant administration of antacids has no apparent effect on the extent 
of absorption of Etodolac. However, antacids can decrease the peak concentration
reached by 15 to 20% but have no detectable effect on the time-to-peak.  
 <p>
Aspirin 
 <p>
When Etodolac is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced,
although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered. The clinical
significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs,
concomitant administration of Etodolac and aspirin is not generally recommended
because of the potential of increased adverse effects.  
 <p>
Warfarin 
 <p>
Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant
administration of warfarin and Etodolac results in reduced protein binding of
warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was
no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin
administered alone and warfarin administered with Etodolac as measured by
prothrombin time.  Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and Etodolac should
not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, following US market
introduction of Etodolac, there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged
prothrombin times in Etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin
therapy. Caution should be exercised because interactions have been seen with
other NSAIDS.  
 <p>
Phenytoin 
 <p>
Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with
phenytoin.  
 <p>
Glyburide 
 <p>
Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction when
administered with glyburide.  
 <p>
Diuretics 
 <p>
Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with
furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide; nor does Etodolac attenuate the diuretic
response of either of these drugs in normal volunteers. Etodolac, and other
NSAIDs, nevertheless, should be used with caution in patients receiving
diuretics, who have cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure (see Renal Effects).  
 <p>
Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Lithium, Methotrexate 
 <p>
Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause
changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of
digoxin, lithium, and methotrexate and increased toxicity. Nephrotoxicity
associated with cyclosporine may also be enhanced. Patients receiving these
drugs who are given Etodolac, or any other NSAID, and particularly those patients 
with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the
specific toxicities of these drugs.  
 <p>
Protein Binding 
 <p>
Data from In Vitro studies, using peak serum concentrations at reported
therapeutic doses in humans, show that the etodolac free fraction is not
significantly altered by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen,
piroxicam, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, phenytoin, and probenecid. In
contrast, phenylbutazone causes an increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction 
of etodolac. Although In Vivo studies have not been done to see if etodolac
clearance is changed by coadministration of phenylbutazone, it is not
recommended that they be coadministered.  
 <p>
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
The urine of patients who take Etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for
urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of
etodolac.  
 <p>
Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has
resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with Etodolac. 
Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically
significant events. No dose-relationship has been observed.  
 <p>
Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. 
In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic
patients receiving etodolac (600 mg to 1000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. 
These levels then remained stable for up to one year of therapy.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
No carcinogenic effect of etodolac was observed in mice or rats receiving oral
doses of 15 mg/kg/day (45 to 89 mg/M(square), respectively) or less for periods 
of 2 years or 18 months, respectively. Etodolac was not mutagenic in In Vitro
tests performed with S. typhimurium and mouse lymphoma cells as well as in an
In Vivo mouse micronucleus test. However, data from the In Vitro human
peripheral lymphocyte test showed an increase (p = 0.06) in the number of gaps
(3.0 to 5.3% unstained regions in the chromatid without dislocation) among the
Etodolac-treated cultures (50 to 200 mcgm/mL) compared to negative controls
(2.0%); no other difference was noted between the controls and drug-treated
groups. Etodolac showed no impairment of fertility in male and female rats up
to oral doses of 16 mg/kg (94 mg/M(square)). However, reduced implantation of
fertilized eggs occurred in the 8 mg/kg group.  <p>
 
TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: PREGNANCY CATEGORY C 
 <p>
In teratology studies, isolated occurrences of alterations in limb development
were found and included polydactyly, oligodactyly, syndactyly, and unossified
phalanges in rats and oligodactyly and synostosis of metatarsals in rabbits. 
These were observed at dose levels (2 to 14 mg/kg/day) close to human clinical
doses. However, the frequency and the dosage group distribution of these
findings in initial or repeated studies did not establish a clear drug or dose- 
response relationship.  
 <p>
There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Etodolac
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justifies the
potential risk of the fetus. Because of the known effects of NSAIDs on
parturition and on the human fetal cardiovascular system with respect to
closure of the ductus arteriosus, use during late pregnancy should be avoided.  <p>
 
LABOR AND DELIVERY 
 <p>
In rat studies with etodolac, as with other drugs known to inhibit
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of Etodolac on
labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
Caution should be exercised if Etodolac is administered to a nursing woman,
because many drugs are excreted in human milk. It is not known whether etodolac 
is excreted in human milk.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.  
 <p>
GERIATRIC POPULATION 
 <p>
In patients 65 years and older, no substantial differences in the
pharmacokinetics or the side-effect profile of Etodolac were seen compared with
the general population. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary
in the elderly. As with any NSAID, however, caution should be exercised in
treating the elderly, and when individualizing their dosage, extra care should
be taken when increasing the dose because the elderly seem to tolerate NSAID
side effects less well than younger patients (see PHARMACOKINETICS).

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 
Etodolac is a non-narcotic drug. Several predictive animal studies indicated that 
Etodolac has no addiction potential in humans.  
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy,
drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain which are generally
reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur and coma
has occurred following massive ibuprofen or mefenamic-acid overdose.
Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression may occur but are 
rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of
NSAIDs, and may occur following overdose.  
 <p>
Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Gut decontamination may be
indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or
following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). This should be
accomplished via emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to
2 g/kg in children) with an osmotic cathartic. Forced diuresis, alkalinization
of the urine, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to 
etodolac's high protein binding.  <p>
 
One case of intentional etodolac overdosage has been reported (Human Toxicol. 
1988; 7:203-4). This 53-year-old female ingested from 15 to 46 two-hundred mg
etodolac capsules (3 to 8.6 grams). Plasma etodolac concentrations were
measured frequently over the next 4 days. At 5 hours after ingestion (3 hours
after gastric lavage) the plasma etodolac level was 22 mcgm/mL. These plasma
levels and her subsequent recovery with no signs or symptoms of etodolac
toxicity were consistent with systemic absorption of 600 to 800 mg. Her
laboratory tests on admission showed a prolonged prothrombin time and a false
positive urine bilirubin (attributed to the phenolic etodolac metabolites).  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
ANALGESIA 
 <p>
The recommended dose of Etodolac for acute pain is 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8
hours, as needed, not to exceed a total daily dose of 1200 mg. For patients
weighing 60 kg or less, the total daily dose of Etodolac should not exceed 20
mg/kg. For more details see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE.  
 <p>
OSTEOARTHRITIS 
 <p>
The recommended dose of Etodolac for the management of the signs and symptoms of
osteoarthritis is initially 800 to 1200 mg/day in divided doses, followed by
dosage adjustment within the range of 600 to 1200 mg/day given in divided
doses:  400 mg t.i.d. or b.i.d.; 300 mg q.i.d., t.i.d., or b.i.d.; 200 mg
q.i.d. or t.i.d. The total daily dose of Etodolac should not exceed 1200 mg. For
patients weighing 60 kg or less, the total daily dose of Etodolac should not
exceed 20 mg/kg. For more details see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE.

<p>Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic, an analog of ampicillin,
with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive
and gram-negative microorganisms. Chemically it is D-(-)-alpha-amino-p
hydroxybenzyl penicillin trihydrate. </p>

<p>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible
strains of the following: </p>

<p>GRAM-NEGATIVE ORGANISMS--H. Influenzae, E. Coli, P. Mirabilis and N.
Gonorrhoeae. </p>

<p>GRAM-POSITIVE ORGANISMS--Streptococci (including Streptococcus Faecalis),
D. Pneumoniae and nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci. </p>

<p>Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results from bacteriological
and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organisms and their
susceptibility to amoxicillin. Indicated surgical procedures should be
performed. </p>

<p>CONTRAINDICATIONS </p>

<p>A history of allergic reaction to any of the penicillins is a contraindication.
</p>

<p>WARNINGS </p>

<p>SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (anaphylactoid) REACTIONS
HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS ON PENICILLIN THERAPY. THESE REACTIONS ARE
MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY
AND/OR A HISTORY OF SENSITIVITY TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. BEFORE INITIATING
THERAPY WITH AMOXICILLIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING PREVIOUS
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS OR OTHER ALLERGENS.
IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, AMOXICILLIN SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND
APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED. SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS REQUIRE
IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS
AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED
AS INDICATED. PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL
ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS, INCLUDING AMOXICILLIN, AND MAY RANGE IN SEVERITY
FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THIS
DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION
OF ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS </p>

<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon
and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin
produced by Clostridium Difficile is a primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated
colitis.&quot; After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been
established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe
cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes
protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically
effective against C. Difficile colitis. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY </p>

<p>Safety for use in pregnancy has not been established. </p>

<p>PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p>As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of renal, hepatic and hematopoietic
function should be made during prolonged therapy. The possibility of superinfections
with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy.
If superinfections occur (usually involving Enterobacter, Pseudomonas or
Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted.
</p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS </p>

<p>As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions
will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely
to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity
to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever
or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated
with the use of penicillins: </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and urticaria
have been reported. </p>

<p>NOTE: These hypersensitivity reactions may be controlled with antihistamines
and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur,
amoxicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician,
the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to amoxicillin
therapy. </p>

<p>LIVER: A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. </p>

<p>HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic
purpura eosinophilia, leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported
during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible
on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.
</p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety,
insomnia, confusion, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported
rarely. </p>

<p>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and may be given
without regard to meals. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
It diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception
of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. The half-life
of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged
in the urine; its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration
of probenecid.</p>

<p>Amoxicillin is not highly protein-bound. In blood serum, amoxicillin
is approximately 20% protein-bound as compared to 60% for penicillin G.
</p>

<p>Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin capsules
result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in
the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.
</p>

<p>Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension 125 mg/5 mL and
250 mg/5 mL result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration
in the range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3.0 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL,
respectively. </p>

<p>Amoxicillin chewable tablets, 125 mg and 250 mg, produced blood levels
similar to those achieved with the corresponding doses of amoxicillin oral
suspensions. </p>

<p>Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered
dose of amoxicillin. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a special skin
window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that
therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. Approximately
60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine
within 6 to 8 hours. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY </p>

<p>Amoxicillin is similar to ampicillin in its bactericidal action against
susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts
through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide. In Vitro
studies have demonstrated the susceptibility of most strains of the following
gram-positive bacteria: alpha- and beta-hemolytic streptococci, Diplococcus
Pneumoniae, nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci, and Streptococcus
Faecalis. It is active In Vitro against many strains of Haemophilus Influenzae,
Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, Escherichia Coli and Proteus Mirabilis. </p>

<p>Because it does not resist destruction by penicillinase, it is not effective
against penicillinase-producing bacteria, particularly resistant staphylococci.
All strains of Pseudomonas and most strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter
are resistant. </p>

<p>DISK SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS: Quantitative methods that require measurement
of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility.
One such procedure* has been recommended for use with disks for testing
susceptibility to ampicillin-class antibiotics. Interpretations correlate
diameters of the disk test with MIC values for amoxicillin. With this procedure
a report from the laboratory of &quot;susceptible&quot; indicates that
the infecting organism is likely to respond to therapy. A report of &quot;resistant&quot;
indicates that the infecting organism is not likely to respond to therapy.
A report of &quot;intermediate susceptibility&quot; suggests that the organism
would be susceptible if high dosage is used, or if the infection is confined
to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are
attained. </p>

<p>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>INFECTIONS OF THE EAR, NOSE AND THROAT due to streptococci, pneumococci,
nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci and H. Influenzae; </p>

<p>INFECTIONS OF THE GENITOURINARY TRACT due to E. Coli, Proteus Mirabilis
and Streptococcus Faecalis; </p>

<p>INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN AND SOFT-TISSUES due to streptococci, susceptible
staphylococci and E. Coli: </p>

<p>USUAL DOSAGE: </p>

<p>Adults: 250 mg every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Children: 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Children weighing 20 kg or more should be dosed according to the adult
recommendations. </p>

<p><b>In severe infections or those caused by less susceptible organisms:
</b></p>

<p>500 mg every 8 hours for adults and 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses every
8 hours for children may be needed. </p>

<p>INFECTIONS OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT due to streptococci, pneumococci,
nonpenicillinase-producing staphylococci and H. Influenzae: </p>

<p>USUAL DOSAGE: </p>

<p>Adults: 500 mg every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Children: 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Children weighing 20 kg or more should be dosed according to the adult
recommendations. </p>

<p>GONORRHEA, ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED ano-genital and urethral infections due
to N. Gonorrhoeae (males and females): </p>

<p>USUAL DOSAGE: </p>

<p>Adults: 3 grams as a single oral dose. </p>

<p>Prepubertal children: 50 mg/kg amoxicillin combined with 25 mg/kg probenecid
as a single dose. </p>

<p>NOTE: SINCE PROBENECID IS CONTRAINDICATED IN CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS,
THIS REGIMEN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THESE CASES. </p>

<p>Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected lesion of syphilis should have dark-field
examinations before receiving amoxicillin, and monthly serological tests
for a minimum of 4 months. </p>

<p>Larger doses may be required for stubborn or severe infections. The
children's dosage is intended for individuals whose weight will not cause
a dosage to be calculated greater than that recommended for adults. </p>

<p>It should be recognized that in the treatment of chronic urinary tract
infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisals are necessary.
Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Even higher
doses may be needed at times. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required
for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological
follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Except for gonorrhea,
treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the
time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication
has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment
for any infection caused by hemolytic streptococci to prevent the occurrence
of acute rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. </p>

<p>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OF PEDIATRIC DROPS </p>

<p>Usual dosage for all indications except infections of the lower respiratory
tract: </p>

<p>Under 6 kg (13 lbs): 0.75 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>6 to 7 kg (13 to 15 lbs): 1.0 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>8 kg (16 to 18 lbs): 1.25 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Infections of the lower respiratory tract: </p>

<p>Under 6 kg (13 lbs): 1.25 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>6 to 7 kg (13 to 15 lbs): 1.75 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>8 kg (16 to 18 lbs): 2.25 mL every 8 hours. </p>

<p>Children weighing more than 8 kg (18 lbs) should receive the appropriate
dose of the Oral Suspension 125 mg or 250 mg/5 mL. </p>

<p>After reconstitution, the required amount of suspension should be placed
directly on the child's tongue for swallowing. Alternate means of administration
are to add the required amount of suspension to formula, milk, fruit juice,
water, ginger ale or cold drinks. These preparations should then be taken
immediately. To be certain the child is receiving full dosage, such preparations
should be consumed in entirety. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant
activity. Peripheral actions include elevation of systolic and diastolic
blood pressures and weak bronchodilator and respiratory stimulant action.
Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as &quot;anorectics&quot;
or &quot;anorexigenics&quot;. It has not been established, however, that
the action of such drugs in treating obesity is primarily one of appetite
suppression. For example, other central nervous system actions or metabolic
effects may be involved. </p>

<p>Adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with
&quot;anorectic&quot; drugs, lose more weight on the average than those
treated with placebo and diet, as determined in relatively short-term clinical
trials. The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug- treated patients
over placebo- treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The
rate of weight loss is greater in the first weeks of therapy for both drug
and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The origins
of the increased weight loss due to the various possible drug effects are
not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an
&quot;anorectic&quot; drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased
weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drug
prescribed, such as the physician- investigator, the population treated,
and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative
importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss. The natural
history of obesity is measured in years, whereas the studies cited are
restricted to a few weeks duration, thus, the total impact of drug-induced
weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.
</p>

<p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism
whereby amphetamine produces mental and behavioral effects in children,
nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition
of the central nervous system. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER WITH HYPERACTIVITY: Mixed amphetamine salts
is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically
includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for
a stabilizing effect in children with behavioral syndrome characterized
by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate
to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional
lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be
made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent
origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability and
abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous
system dysfunction may or may not be warranted. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, moderate
to severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, known hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy
to the sympathomimetic amines, glaucoma. </p>

<p>Agitated states. </p>

<p>Patients with a history of drug abuse. </p>

<p>During or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (hypertensive crises may result). </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<pre>                                                                  
                     AMPHETAMINES HAVE A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR       
                     ABUSE. THEY SHOULD THUS BE TRIED ONLY IN     
                     WEIGHT REDUCTION PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS IN    
                     WHOM ALTERNATIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN            
                     INEFFECTIVE. ADMINISTRATION OF AMPHETAMINES  
                     FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME IN OBESITY     
                     MAY LEAD TO DRUG DEPENDENCE AND MUST BE      
                     AVOIDED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE      
                     PAID TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBJECTS          
                     OBTAINING AMPHETAMINES FOR NON-THERAPEUTIC   
                     USE OR DISTRIBUTION TO OTHERS, AND THE       
                     DRUGS SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED OR DISPENSED      
                     SPARINGLY.     </pre>

<p>When tolerance to the &quot;anorectic&quot; effect develops, the recommended
dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather,
the drug should be discontinued. Clinical experience suggests that in psychotic
children, administration of amphetamine may exacerbate symptoms of behavior
disturbance and thought disorder. Data are inadequate to determine whether
chronic administration of amphetamine may be associated with growth inhibition:
therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment. </p>

<p>USAGE IN NURSING MOTHERS: Amphetamines are excreted in human milk. Mothers
taking amphetamines should be advised to refrain from nursing. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Caution is to be exercised in prescribing amphetamines for
patients with even mild hypertension. </p>

<p>The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time
in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Amphetamines may impair the ability of the
patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating
machinery or vehicles: the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Acidifying Agents- -Gastrointestinal acidifying agents
(guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices,
etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Urinary Acidifying Agents--(ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate,
etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine
molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower
blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Adrenergic Blockers--Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.
</p>

<p>Alkalinizing Agents--Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate,
etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase
the concentration of the non- ionized species of the amphetamine molecule,
thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood
levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Antidepressants, Tricyclic--Amphetamines may enhance the activity of
tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents: d-amphetamine with desipramine or
protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained
increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular
effects can be potentiated. </p>

<p>MAO Inhibitors--MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone,
slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing
their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from
adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive
crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia
can occur, sometimes with fatal results. </p>

<p>Antihistamines-Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.
</p>

<p>Antihypertensives--Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects
of antihypertensives. </p>

<p>Chlorpromazine--Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake,
thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can
be used to treat amphetamine poisoning. </p>

<p>Ethosuximide--Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.
Haloperidol--Haloperidol blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus
inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Lithium Carbonate--The antiobesity and stimulatory effects of amphetamines
may be inhibited by lithium carbonate. </p>

<p>Meperidine--Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.
</p>

<p>Methenamine therapy--Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased,
and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.
</p>

<p>Norepinephrine--Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.
Phenobarbital--Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital;
co-administration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant
action. </p>

<p>Phenytoin--Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin;
co- administration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant
action. Propoxyphene--In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine
CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur. </p>

<p>Veratrum Alkaloids--Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum
alkaloids. </p>

<p>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS: </p>

<p>--Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid
levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. </p>

<p>--Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis: Mutagenicity studies and long-term studies
in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of Amphetamine, have
not been performed. </p>

<p>Pregnancy--Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Amphetamine has
been shown to have embryotoxic and teratogenic effects when administered
to A/Jax mice and C57BL mice in doses approximately 41 times the maximum
human dose. Embryotoxic effects were not seen in New Zealand white rabbits
given the drug in doses 7 times the human dose nor in rats given 12.5 times
the maximum human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies
in pregnant women. Amphetamines should be used during pregnancy only if
the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nonteratogenic Effects: Infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines
have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight. Also,
these infants may experience symptoms of withdrawal as demonstrated by
dysphoria, including agitation, and significant lassitude. </p>

<p>Pediatric Use: Long-term effects of amphetamines in children have not
been well established. Amphetamines are not recommended for use as anorectic
agents in children under 12 years of age, or in children under 3 years
of age with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity described under
INDICATIONS AND USAGE. </p>

<p>Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics
and Tourette's syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's
syndrome in children and their families should precede the use of stimulant
medications. </p>

<p>Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of Attention Deficit Disorder
with Hyperactivity and should be considered only in light of the complete
history and evaluation of the child. The decision to prescribe amphetamines
should depend on the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity
of the child's symptoms and their appropriateness for his/her age. Prescription
should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral
characteristics. When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions,
treatment with amphetamines is usually not indicated. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Acidifying Agents--Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine,
reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower
absorption of amphetamines. </p>

<p>Urinary Acidifying Agents--(ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate,
etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine

CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur. </p>

<p>Veratrum Alkaloids--Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum
alkaloids. (See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR: Palpitations, tachycardia, elevation of blood pressure.
There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic
amphetamine use. </p>

<p>CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Psychotic episodes at recommended doses (rare),
overstimulation, restlessness, dizziness, insomnia, euphoria, dyskinesia,
dysphoria, tremor, headache, exacerbation of motor and phonic tics and
Tourette's syndrome. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL: Dryness of the mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea,
constipation, other gastrointestinal disturbances. Anorexia and weight
loss may occur as undesirable effects when amphetamines are used for other
than the anorectic effect. </p>

<p>ALLERGIC: Urticaria. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE: Impotence, changes in libido. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: </p>

<p>Dextroamphetamine sulfate is a Schedule II controlled substance. </p>

<p>Amphetamines have been extensively abused. Tolerance, extreme psychological
dependence, and severe social disability have occurred. There are reports
of patients who have increased the dosage to many times that recommended.
Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results
in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the
sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with amphetamines include
severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity, and personality
changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis,
often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. This is rare with
oral amphetamines. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. While toxic
symptoms occasionally occur as an idiosyncrasy at doses as low as 2 mg,
they are rare with doses of less than 15 mg; 30 mg can produce severe reactions,
yet doses of 400 to 500 mg area not necessarily fatal. </p>

<p>In rats, the oral LD50 of dextroamphetamine sulfate is 96.8 mg/kg. SYMPTOMS--Manifestations
of acute overdosage with amphetamines include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia,
rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states,
hyperpyrexia and rhabdomolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the
central stimulation. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular effects include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension
and circulatory collapse. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal
cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma. </p>

<p>TREATMENT--Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up to
date guidance and advice. Management of acute amphetamine intoxication
is largely symptomatic and includes gastric lavage, administration of activated
charcoal, administration of a cathartic and sedation. Experience with hemodialysis
or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard.
Acidification of the urine increases amphetamine excretion, but is believed
to increase risk of acute renal failure if myoglobinuria is present. If
acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage; administration
of intravenous phentolamine (Regitine(R), CIBA) has been suggested. However,
a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation
has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulant effects
of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Regardless of indication, amphetamines should be administered at the
lowest effective dosage and dosage should be individually adjusted. Late
evening doses should be avoided because of the resulting insomnia. </p>

<p>ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER WITH HYPERACTIVITY: Not recommended for children
under 3 years of age. In children from 3 to 5 years of age, start with
2.5 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 2.5 mg at weekly
intervals until optimal response is obtained. </p>

<p>In children 6 years of age and older, start with 5 mg once or twice
daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals
until optimal response is obtained. Only in rare cases will it be necessary
to exceed a total of 40 mg per day. Give first dose on awakening; additional
doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours. </p>

<p>Where possible, drug administration should be interrupted occasionally
to determine if there is a recurrence of behavioral symptoms sufficient
to require continued therapy. </p>

<p>NARCOLEPSY: Usual doses 5 to 60 mg per day in divided doses, depending
on the individual patient response. </p>

<p>Narcolepsy seldom occurs in children under 12 years of age; however,
when it does, dextroamphetamine sulfate, may be used. The suggested initial
dose for patients aged 6-12 is 5 mg daily; daily dose may be raised in
increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.
In patients 12 years of age and older, start with 10 mg daily; daily dosage
may be raised in increments of 10 mg at weekly intervals until optimal
response is obtained. If bothersome adverse reactions appear (e.g., insomnia
or anorexia), dosage should be reduced. Give first dose on awakening; additional
doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours. </p>

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Nitroglycerin is 1,2,3-propanetriol trinitrate, an organic nitrate.
</p>

<p>Molecular weight is 227.09. The organic nitrates are vasodilators, active
on both arteries and veins. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation
of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries
and veins, especially the latter. </p>

<p>Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases
venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation
reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean
arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also
occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction
and coronary dilatation remains undefined. </p>

<p>Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide
plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective
concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several
well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the
anti anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large
majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo
after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate
tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used
acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent
from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy restored.
</p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about
3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid
rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed
clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow;
known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular
walls. </p>

<p>The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic
nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less
effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in
the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic
nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized
to (nonvasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon
dioxide. </p>

<p>To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals
of 10 12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been
well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving
nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that
their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was
Less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo. </p>

<p>In the healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin
are reached by about 2 hours after application of a patch and are maintained
for the duration of wearing the system (observations have been limited
to 24 hours). Upon removal of the patch, the plasma concentration declines
with a half-life of about an hour. </p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS: Regimens in which nitroglycerin patches were worn for
12 hours daily have been studied in well-controlled trials up to 4 weeks
in duration. Starting about 2 hours after application and continuing until
10-12 hours after application, patches that deliver at least 0.4 mg of
nitroglycerin per hour have consistently demonstrated greater anti-anginal
activity than placebo. Lower-dose patches have not been as well studied,
but in one large, well- controlled trial in which higher-dose patches were
also studied, patches delivering 0.2 mg/hr had significantly Less anti-anginal
activity than placebo. </p>

<p>It is reasonable to believe that the rate of nitroglycerin absorption
from patches may vary with the site of application, but this relationship
has not been adequately studied. </p>

<p>The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently
rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Transdermal nitroglycerin is indicated for the prevention of angina
pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of transdermal
nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in
aborting an acute attack. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Allergic reactions to organic nitrates are extremely rare, but they
do occur. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are allergic
to it. Allergy to the adhesives used in nitroglycerin patches has also
been reported, and it similarly constitutes a contraindication to the use
of this product. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial
infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one
elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic
monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.
</p>

<p>A cardiovertor/defibrillator should not be discharged through a paddle
electrode that overlies a Nitroglycerin (transdermal) patch. The arcing
that may be seen in this situation is harmless in itself, but it may be
associated with local current concentration that can cause damage to the
paddles and burns to the patient. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may
occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore
be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for
whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin
may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.
</p>

<p>Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
</p>

<p>As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effects of
sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable,
is somewhat blunted. </p>

<p>In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably
high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain,
acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during
temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the
existence of true physical dependence. </p>

<p>Several clinical trials in patients with angina pectoris have evaluated
nitroglycerin regimens which incorporated a 10-to-12 hour, nitrate-free
interval. In some of these trials, an increase in the frequency of anginal
attacks during the nitrate-free interval was observed in a small number
of patients. In one trial, patients had decreased exercise tolerance at
the end of the nitrate-free interval. Hemodynamic rebound has been observed
only rarely; on the other hand, few studies were so designed that rebound,
if it had occurred, would have been detected. The importance of these observations
to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is unknown. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment
with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches
may be a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the
temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment
with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous
loss of antianginal efficacy. </p>

<p>Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness
on standing especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position.
This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.
</p>

<p>After normal use, there is enough residual nitroglycerin in discarded
patches that they are a potential hazard to children and pets. </p>

<p>A patient leaflet is supplied with the systems. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be
additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has
been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: No long-term animal
studies have examined the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of nitroglycerin.
Nitroglycerin's effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown.
</p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted
with nitroglycerin. It is also not known whether nitroglycerin can cause
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect
reproductive capacity. Nitroglycerin should be given to a pregnant woman
only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should
be exercised when nitroglycerin is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those
of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit
additive effects of this variety. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Adverse reactions to nitroglycerin are generally dose-related, and almost
all of these reactions are the result of nitroglycerin's activity as a
vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported
side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially
at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related
to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently,
but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation
of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been
reported but are uncommon. </p>

<p>Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia
in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these
doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred
(see OVERDOSAGE). </p>

<p>Application-site irritation may occur but is rarely severe. </p>

<p>In two placebo-controlled trials of intermittent therapy with nitroglycerin
patches at 0.2 to 0.8 mg/hr, the most frequent adverse reactions among
307 subjects were as follows: </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>HEMODYNAMIC EFFECTS: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally
the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous
pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes
may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure,
with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate
fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting
(possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in
the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced
ventilatory effort, diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and
clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death.
</p>

<p>Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites
are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no
established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose. </p>

<p>No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers
to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin
and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which--if any--of
these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.
</p>

<p>No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is
known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy
of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin
overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent
therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central
fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient,
but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be
necessary. </p>

<p>The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting
is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or
congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion
is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients
may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. </p>

<p>METHEMOGLOBINEMIA: Nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of nitroglycerin
can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without
cytochrome b5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate
moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin
about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients
manifests clinically significant (&gt;/= 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients
with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin
should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study in which
36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1
to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was
comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo.
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant
methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates.
None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible.
</p>

<p>Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories.
The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired
oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2.
Classically methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without
color change on exposure to air. </p>

<p>When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene
blue, 1-2 mg/kg intravenously. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg/hr*, and 0.4 mg/hr*. Doses
between 0.4 mg/hr* and 0.8 mg/hr* have shown continued effectiveness for
10-12 hours daily for at least one month (the longest period studied) of
intermittent administration. Although the minimum nitrate-free interval
has not been defined data show that a nitrate-free interval of 10-12 hours
is sufficient (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Thus, an appropriate
dosing schedule for nitroglycerin patches would include a daily patch-on
period of 12-14 hours and a daily patch-off period of 10-12 hours. </p>

<p>Although some well controlled clinical trials using exercise tolerance
testing have shown maintenance of effectiveness when patches are worn continuously,
the large majority of such controlled trials have shown the development
of tolerance (i.e., complete loss of effect) within the first 24 hours
after therapy was initiated. Dose adjustment even to levels much higher
than generally used, did not restore efficacy. </p>

<p>* Release rates were formerly described in terms of drug delivered per
24 hours. In these terms, the supplied Nitroglycerin (transdermal) systems
would be rated at 2.5 mg/24 hours (0.1 mg/hour), 5 mg/24 hours (0.2 mg/hour),
7.5 mg/24 hours (0.3 mg/hour), 10 mg/24 hours (0.4 mg/hour), and 15 mg/24
hours (0.6 mg/hour). </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>FOR TOPICAL DERMATOLOGIC USE ONLY--NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC, ORAL, OR INTRAVAGINAL
USE. </p>

<p>Terbinafine hydrochloride Cream, 1%, is a synthetic antifungal agent.
It is intended for topical dermatologic use only. Chemically, terbinafine
hydrochloride is (E)-N- (6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl)- N-methyl- 1-naphthalenemethanamine
hydrochloride. The compound has the empirical formula C21H26ClN, a molecular
weight of 327.90. Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white to off-white fine
crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in methanol and methylene chloride,
soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>Following a single application of 100 microL of Terbinafine Cream, 1%
(containing 1 mg of 14C-terbinafine) to a 30 cm(squared) area of the ventral
forearm of 6 healthy subjects, the recovery of radioactivity in urine and
feces averaged 3.5% of the administered dose. </p>

<p>In a study of 16 healthy subjects, 8 of whose skin was artificially
compromised by stripping the stratum corneum to the viable layer, single
and multiple applications (average 0.1 mg/cm(squared) B.I.D. for 5 days)
of terbinafine as Terbinafine Cream, 1% were made to various sites. In
this study, systemic absorption was highly variable. The maximum measured
plasma concentration of terbinafine was 11.4 ng/mL, and the maximum measured
plasma concentration of the de-methylated metabolite was 11.0 ng/mL. In
many patients there were no detectable plasma levels of either parent compound
or metabolite. Urinary excretion accounted for up to 9% of the topically
applied dose; the majority excreted less than 4%. No measurement of fecal
drug content was performed. </p>

<p>In a study of 10 patients with tinea cruris, once daily application
of Terbinafine Cream, 1% for 7 days resulted in plasma concentrations of
terbinafine of 0-11 ng/mL on day 7. Plasma concentrations of the metabolites
of terbinafine ranged from 11-80 ng/mL in these patients. </p>

<p>Approximately 75% of cutaneously absorbed terbinafine is eliminated
in the urine predominantly as metabolites. </p>

<p>MICROBIOLOGY </p>

<p>Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative. Terbinafine
hydrochloride exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting squalene epoxidase,
a key enzyme in sterol biosynthesis in fungi. This action results in a
deficiency in ergosterol and a corresponding accumulation of squalene within
the fungal cell and causes fungal cell death. </p>

<p>Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the
following organisms both In Vitro and in clinical infections at indicated
body sites (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE): </p>

<p>Epidermophyton Floccosum </p>

<p>Trichophyton Mentagrophytes </p>

<p>Trichophyton Rubrum </p>

<p>The following In Vitro data are available; HOWEVER, THEIR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
IS UNKNOWN. Terbinafine exhibits satisfactory In Vitro MIC's against most
strains of the following organisms; however, the safety and efficacy of
terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these organisms have
not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. </p>

<p>Microsporum Canis </p>

<p>Microsporum Gypseum </p>

<p>Microsporum Nanum </p>

<p>Trichophyton Verrucosum </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Terbinafine Cream, 1% is indicated for the topical treatment of the
following dermatologic infections: interdigital tinea pedis (athlete's
foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), or tinea corporis (ringworm) due to Epidermophyton
Floccosum, Trichophyton Mentagrophytes, Or Trichophyton Rubrum (See DOSAGE
AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>Diagnosis of the disease should be confirmed either by direct microscopic
examination of scrapings from infected tissue mounted in a solution of
potassium hydroxide or by culture. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Terbinafine Cream, 1% is contraindicated in individuals who have known
or suspected hypersensitivity to terbinafine or any other of its components.
</p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Terbinafine Cream, 1% is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>If irritation or sensitivity develops with the use of Terbinafine Cream,
1% , treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.
</p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>The Patient Should Be Told To: </p>

<p>1. Use Terbinafine Cream, 1% as directed by the physician and avoid
contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, or other mucous membranes, </p>

<p>2. Use the medication for the treatment time recommended by the physician,
3. Inform the physician if the area of application shows signs of increased
irritation or possible sensitization (redness, itching, burning, blistering,
swelling, or oozing). </p>

<p>4. Avoid the use of occlusive dressings unless otherwise directed by
the physician. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Potential interactions between Terbinafine Cream, 1% (terbinafine hydrochloride
cream) and other drugs have not been systematically evaluated. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY In a 2-year oral
carcinogenicity study in mice, a 4% incidence of splenic hemangiosarcomas
and a 6% incidence of leiomyosarcoma-like tumors of the seminal vesicles
were observed in males at the highest dose level, 156 mg/kg/day (equivalent
to at least 390 times the maximum potential exposure at the recommended
human topical dose*). In a carcinogenicity study in rats at the highest
dose level, 69 mg/kg/day (equivalent to at least 173 times the maximum
potential exposure at the recommended human topical dose*), a 6% incidence
of both liver tumors and skin lipomas were observed in males. In rats,
the formation of liver tumors was associated with peroxisomal proliferation.
A battery of In Vitro and In Vivo genotoxicity tests, including Ames assay,
mutagenicity evaluation in Chinese hamster ovarian cells, chromosome aberration
test, sister chromatid exchanges, and mouse micronucleus test revealed
no evidence for a mutagenic or clastogenic potential for the drug. </p>

<p>Reproductive studies in rats administered up to 300 mg/kg/day orally
(equivalent to at least 750 times the maximum potential exposure at the
recommended human topical dose*) did not reveal any adverse effects on
fertility or other reproductive parameters. Intravaginal mucosal application
of terbinafine hydrochloride at 150 mg/day in pregnant rabbits did not
increase the incidence of abortions or premature deliveries or affect fetal
parameters. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: Oral doses of terbinafine hydrochloride, up to
300 mg/kg/day (equivalent to at least 750 times the maximum potential exposure
at the recommended human topical dose*), during organogenesis in rats and
rabbits were not teratogenic. Similarly, a subcutaneous study in rats at
doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to at least 250 times the maximum
potential exposure at the recommended human topical dose*) and a percutaneous
study in rabbits, including doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (equivalent to at
least 350 times the maximum potential exposure at the recommended human
topical dose*) did not reveal any teratogenic potential. </p>

<p>There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, this drug should be used only if clearly indicated during
pregnancy. </p>

<p>* The above comparisons between oral animal doses and maximum potential
exposure at the recommended human topical doses are based upon the application
to human skin of 0.1 mg of terbinafine/cm(squared), the assumption of average
human cutaneous exposure of 100 cm(squared) (assuming the use of 1 gram
of Terbinafine Cream, 1% per dose), and the THEORETICAL worst case scenario
of 100% human cutaneous absorption. At present, comparative animal and
human systemic exposure pharmacokinetic data are not available. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>After a single ORAL dose of 500 mg of terbinafine hydrochloride to 2
volunteers, the total dose of terbinafine hydrochloride secreted in human
milk during the 72-hour post-dosing period was 0.65 mg in one person and
0.15 mg in the other. The total excretion of terbinafine in human milk
was 0.13% and 0.03% of the administered dose, respectively. The concentrations
of the 1 metabolite measured in the human milk of these 2 volunteers were
below the detection limit of the assay used (150 ng/mL of milk). </p>

<p>Because of the small amount of data on human neonatal exposure, a decision
should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug,
taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother, as well as
the findings of tumors in male mice and rats following ORAL administration
of terbinafine hydrochloride and the lack of data on carcinogenicity in
neonatal animals. Nursing mothers should avoid application of Terbinafine
Cream, 1% (terbinafine hydrochloride cream) to the breast. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and efficacy in children or infants below the age of 12 years
have not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Potential interactions between Terbinafine Cream, 1% (terbinafine hydrochloride
cream) and other drugs have not been systematically evaluated. (See Also
PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>In clinical trials, 6 (0.2%) of 2265 patients treated with Terbinafine
Cream, 1% discontinued therapy due to adverse events and 52 (2.3%) reported
adverse reactions thought to be possibly, probably, or definitely related
to drug therapy. These reactions included irritation (1%), burning (0.8%),
itching (0.2%), and dryness (0.2%). </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Overdosage of terbinafine hydrochloride in humans has not been reported
to date. Acute overdosage with topical application of terbinafine hydrochloride
is unlikely due to the limited absorption of topically applied drug and
would not be expected to lead to a life threatening situation. </p>

<p>Overdosage in rats and mice by the oral and intravenous routes of drug
administration has produced sedation, drowsiness, ataxia, dyspnea, exophthalmus,
and piloerection. The majority of deaths in animals occurred following
oral administration of doses exceeding 3 grams/kilogram or following 200
mg/kg administered intravenously. In rabbits, overdosage produced erythema,
edema, and scale formation following topical administration of doses in
excess of 1.5 grams/kilogram. </p>

<p>When terbinafine hydrochloride cream, 1% was administered as a single
ORAL dose at 10 and 25 mL/kg (100 and 250 mg/kg, respectively) to rats
and mice, no deaths or other drug-related toxicities were observed. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>In the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis (athlete's foot), Terbinafine
Cream, 1% should be applied to cover the affected and immediately surrounding
areas twice daily UNTIL CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED.
In many patients this occurs by day 7 of drug therapy. </p>

<p>The duration of drug therapy should be for a minimum of 1 week and should
not exceed 4 weeks. (See CLINICAL STUDIES And Following Note.) </p>

<p>In the treatment of tinea cruris (jock itch) or tinea corporis (ringworm),
Terbinafine Cream, 1% should be applied to cover the affected and immediately
surrounding areas once or twice daily UNTIL CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. In many patients this occurs by day 7 of drug
therapy. The duration of drug therapy should be for a minimum of 1 week
and should not exceed 4 weeks. (See CLINICAL STUDIES And Following Note.)
</p>

<p>NOTE: </p>

<p>Many patients treated with shorter durations of therapy (1-2 weeks)
continue to improve during the 2-4 weeks after drug therapy has been completed.
As a consequence, patients should not be considered therapeutic failures
until they have been observed for a period of 2-4 weeks off therapy. (See
CLINICAL STUDIES). </p>

<p>If successful outcome is not achieved during the post-treatment observation
period, the diagnosis should be reviewed. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>In the following data presentations, the term &quot;successful outcome&quot;
refers to those patients evaluated at a specific time point, who had both
negative mycological results (culture and KOH preparation) and a TOTAL
clinical score of less than 2. The clinical score is the sum of the scores
of each sign and symptom graded on a scale from 0=absent to 3=severe. Mean
clinical scores at entry ranged from 8-11 in the pivotal clinical trials.
All studies included, at a minimum, clinical evaluation of erythema, desquamation,
and pruritus. </p>

<p>A. TINEA PEDIS </p>

<p>In 3 studies of Terbinafine Cream, 1% used B.I.D. in the treatment of
tinea pedis, 2 (combined in the table below) were vehicle-controlled (placebo)
evaluations of 1 week treatment duration. The third study (see following
table) was of 4 weeks therapy compared to another active drug. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>KCl SR is an electrolyte replenisher. The chemical name of the active
ingredient is potassium chloride, and the structural formula is KCl. Potassium
chloride USP occurs as a white, granular powder or as colorless crystals.
It is odorless and has a saline taste. Its solutions are neutral to litmus.
It is freely soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues.
Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes
including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of
nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle
and the maintenance of normal renal function. </p>

<p>The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to
160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq
per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across
the plasma membrane. </p>

<p>Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady state conditions
the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal
to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium
is 50 to 100 mEq per day. </p>

<p>Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through
renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the
rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops slowly as a consequence
of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic
ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged
parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea,
especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these
causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is
manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion
may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily
ectopic beats), prominent U- waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced
cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.
</p>

<p>If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be
managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where
the patient requires long term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium
in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to
restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients
with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with
metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients potassium replacement
should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such
as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium
gluconate. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>BECAUSE OF REPORTS OF INTESTINAL AND GASTRIC ULCERATION AND BLEEDING
WITH CONTROLLED RELEASE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE PREPARATIONS, THESE DRUGS SHOULD
BE RESERVED FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO CANNOT TOLERATE OR REFUSE TO TAKE LIQUID
OR EFFERVESCENT POTASSIUM PREPARATIONS OR FOR PATIENTS IN WHOM THERE IS
A PROBLEM OF COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PREPARATIONS. </p>

<p>1. For the treatment of patients with hypokalemia with or without metabolic
alkalosis, in digitalis intoxication and in patients with hypokalemic familial
periodic paralysis. If hypokalemia is the result of diuretic therapy, consideration
should be given to the use of a lower dose of diuretic, which may be sufficient
without leading to hypokalemia. </p>

<p>2. For the prevention of hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular
risk if hypokalemia were to develop, e.g., digitalized patients or patients
with significant cardiac arrhythmias. </p>

<p>The use of potassium salts in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated
essential hypertension is often unnecessary when such patients have a normal
dietary pattern and when low doses of the diuretic are used. Serum potassium
should be checked periodically, however, and if hypokalemia occurs, dietary
supplementation with potassium-containing foods may be adequate to control
milder cases. In more severe cases, and if dose adjustment of the diuretic
is ineffective or unwarranted, supplementation with potassium salts may
be indicated. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Potassium supplements are contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia
since a further increase in serum potassium concentration in such patients
can produce cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia may complicate any of the following
conditions: chronic renal failure, systemic acidosis such as diabetic acidosis,
acute dehydration, extensive tissue breakdown as in severe burns, adrenal
insufficiency, or the administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g.,
spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) (see OVERDOSAGE). </p>

<p>Controlled release formulations of potassium chloride have produced
esophageal ulceration in certain cardiac patients with esophageal compression
due to enlarged left atrium. Potassium supplementation, when indicated
in such patients, should be given as a liquid preparation or as an aqueous
(water) suspension of KCl SR (see PRECAUTIONS; INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS,
and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections). </p>

<p>All solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride are contraindicated
in any patient in whom there is structural, pathological (e.g., diabetic
gastroparesis) or pharmacologic (use of anticholinergic agents or other
agents with anticholinergic properties at sufficient doses to exert anticholinergic
effects) cause for arrest or delay in tablet passage through the gastrointestinal
tract. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>HYPERKALEMIA (see OVERDOSAGE) In patients with impaired mechanisms for
excreting potassium, the administration of potassium salts can produce
hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients
given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients
given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly
and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic
renal disease or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion,
requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration
and appropriate dosage adjustment. </p>

<p>INTERACTION WITH POTASSIUM SPARING DIURETICS--Hypokalemia should not
be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and a potassium-sparing
diuretic (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride) since the simultaneous
administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. </p>

<p>INTERACTION WITH ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS--Angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril) will produce
some potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium
supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with
close monitoring. </p>

<p>GASTROINTESTINAL LESIONS--Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride
can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal
tract. Based on spontaneous adverse reaction reports, enteric coated preparations
of potassium chloride are associated with an increased frequency of small
bowel lesions (40-50 per 100,000 patient years) compared to sustained release
wax matrix formulations (less than one per 100,000 patient years). Because
of the lack of extensive marketing experience with microencapsulated products,
a comparison between such products and wax matrix or enteric coated products
is not available. KCl SR is a tablet formulated to provide a controlled
rate of release of microencapsulated potassium chloride and thus to minimize
the possibility of a high local concentration of potassium near the gastrointestinal
wall. </p>

<p>Prospective trials have been conducted in normal human volunteers in
which the upper gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by endoscopic inspection
before and after one week of solid oral potassium chloride therapy. The
ability of this model to predict events occurring in usual clinical practice
is unknown. Trials which approximated usual clinical practice did not reveal
any clear differences between the wax matrix and microencapsulated dosage
forms. In contrast, there was a higher incidence of gastric and duodenal
lesions in subjects receiving a high dose of a wax matrix controlled release
formulation under conditions which did not resemble usual or recommended
clinical practice (i.e., 96 mEq per day in divided doses of potassium chloride
administered to fasted patients, in the presence of an anticholinergic
drug to delay gastric emptying). The upper gastrointestinal lesions observed
by endoscopy were asymptomatic and were not accompanied by evidence of
bleeding (Hemoccult testing). The relevance of these findings to the usual
conditions (i.e., non-fasting, no anticholinergic agent, smaller doses)
under which controlled release potassium chloride products are used is
uncertain; epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated risk,
compared to microencapsulated products, for upper gastrointestinal lesions
in patients receiving wax matrix formulations. KCl SR should be discontinued
immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction or perforation
considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, or gastrointestinal
bleeding occurs. </p>

<p>METABOLIC ACIDOSIS--Hypokalemia in patients with metabolic acidosis
should be treated with an alkalinizing potassium salt such as potassium
bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by
demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting
some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium
level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can
produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium
while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration
into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium.
The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac
disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base
balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram,
and the clinical status of the patient. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Physicians should consider reminding the patient
of the following: </p>

<p>To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other
liquid. </p>

<p>To take each dose without crushing, chewing, or sucking the tablets.
If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they
may try one of the following alternate methods of administration: </p>

<p>a. Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass
of water. </p>

<p>b. Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows: </p>

<p>1. Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately one-half glass of water
(4 fluid ounces). </p>

<p>2. Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.
</p>

<p>3. Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.
</p>

<p>4. Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass
immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw. </p>

<p>5. Add another one fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.
</p>

<p>6. Then, add an additional one fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume
immediately. </p>

<p>Aqueous suspension of KCl SR tablets that is not taken immediately should
be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending KCl SR tablets is
not recommended. </p>

<p>To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed
by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking
diuretics and/or digitalis preparations. </p>

<p>To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence
of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed. </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS: When blood is drawn for analysis of plasma potassium
it is important to recognize that artifactual elevations can occur after
improper venipuncture technique or as a result of in-vitro hemolysis of
the sample. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY: Carcinogenicity,
mutagenicity and fertility studies in animals have not been performed.
Potassium is a normal dietary constituent. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted
with KCl SR. It is unlikely that potassium supplementation that does not
lead to hyperkalemia would have an adverse effect on the fetus or would
affect reproductive capacity. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS: The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about
13 mEq per liter. Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium
pool, so long as body potassium is not excessive, the contribution of potassium
chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in
human milk. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
(see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>One of the most severe adverse effects is hyperkalemia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS,
WARNINGS, and OVERDOSAGE). There have also been reports of upper and lower
gastrointestinal conditions including obstruction, bleeding, ulceration,
and perforation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). </p>

<p>The most common adverse reactions to oral potassium salts are nausea,
vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. These symptoms
are due to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract and are best managed
by diluting the preparation further, taking the dose with meals or reducing
the amount taken at one time. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory
mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if
excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly
intravenously, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result (see CONTRAINDICATIONS
and WARNINGS). It is important to recognize that hyperkalemia is usually
asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium
concentration (6.5-8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes
(peaking of T-waves, loss of P-waves, depression of S-T segment, and prolongation
of the QT-interval). Late manifestations include muscle-paralysis and cardiovascular
collapse from cardiac arrest. (9-12 mEq/L). </p>

<p>Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following: </p>

<p>1. Elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and of
any agents with potassium-sparing properties. </p>

<p>2. Intravenous administration of 300 to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution
containing 10-20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL. </p>

<p>3. Correction of acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
</p>

<p>4. Use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis. </p>

<p>In treating hyperkalemia, it should be recalled that in patients who
have been stabilized on digitalis, too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium
concentration can produce digitalis toxicity. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to
100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually
requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
</p>

<p>Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The
dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20
mEq per day. Doses of 40-100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment
of potassium depletion. </p>

<p>Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that
no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.</p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Tetracycline is an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces Aureofaciens.
Chemically it is the monohydrochloride of (4S-(4alpha,4aalpha, 5aalpha,6beta
12aalpha,))-4-(Dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro- 3,6,10,12,12a
pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert
their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Tetracyclines
are active against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
</p>

<p>The drugs in the tetracycline class have closely similar antimicrobial
spectra, and cross-resistance among them is common. Microorganisms may
be considered susceptible if the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration)
is not more than 4 mcg/mL and intermediate if the MIC is 4 to 12.5 mcg/mL.
</p>

<p>Susceptibility plate testing: A tetracycline disc may be used to determine
microbial susceptibility to drugs in the tetracycline class. If the Kirby-Bauer
method of disc susceptibility testing is used, a 30 mcg tetracycline HCl
disc should give a zone of at least 19 mm when tested against a tetracycline-
susceptible bacterial strain. </p>

<p>Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins
in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and
excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically
active form. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Tetracycline is indicated in infections caused by the following microorganisms.
</p>

<p>Rickettsiae: (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever, and the typhus
group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, tick fevers). </p>

<p>Mycoplasma Pneumoniae (PPLO, Eaton agent). </p>

<p>Agents of psittacosis and ornithosis. </p>

<p>Agents of lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale. </p>

<p>The spirochetal agent of relapsing fever (Borrelia Recurrentis). </p>

<p>The following gram-negative microorganisms: </p>

<p>Haemophilus Ducreyi (chancroid), </p>

<p>Yersinia Pestis and Francisella Tularensis, formerly </p>

<p>Pasteurella Pestis and Pasteurella Tularensis, </p>

<p>Bartonella Bacilliformis, </p>

<p>Bacteroides species, </p>

<p>Vibrio Comma and Vibrio Fetus, </p>

<p>Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin).</p>

<p>Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have
been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility
testing are recommended. </p>

<p>Tetracycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the
following gram-negative microorganisms, when bacteriologic testing indicates
appropriate susceptibility to the drug: </p>

<p>Escherichia Coli, </p>

<p>Enterobacter Aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter Aerogenes), </p>

<p>Shigella species, </p>

<p>Mima species and Herellea species, </p>

<p>Haemophilus Influenzae (respiratory infections), </p>

<p>Klebsiella species (respiratory and urinary infections). </p>

<p>Tetracycline HCl is indicated for treatment of infections caused by
the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates
appropriate susceptibility to the drug: </p>

<p>Streptococcus species: </p>

<p>Up to 44% of strains of Streptococcus Pyogenes and 74% of Streptococcus
Faecalis have been found to be resistant to tetracycline drugs. Therefore,
tetracyclines should not be used for streptococcal disease unless the organism
has been demonstrated to be sensitive. </p>

<p>For upper respiratory infections due to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci,
penicillin is the usual drug of choice, including prophylaxis of rheumatic
fever. </p>

<p>Streptococcus Pneumoniae, </p>

<p>Staphylococcus Aureus, skin and soft tissue infections. </p>

<p>Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type
of staphylococcal infection. </p>

<p>When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs
in the treatment of infections due to: </p>

<p>Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, </p>

<p>Treponema Pallidum and Treponema Pertenue (syphilis and yaws), </p>

<p>Listeria Monocytogenes, </p>

<p>Clostridium species, </p>

<p>Bacillus Anthracis, </p>

<p>Fusobacterium Fusiforme (Vincent's infection), </p>

<p>Actinomyces species. </p>

<p>In acute intestinal amebiasis, the tetracyclines may be a useful adjunct
to amebicides. </p>

<p>In severe acne, the tetracyclines may be useful adjunctive therapy.
</p>

<p>Tetracycline is indicated in the treatment of trachoma, although the
infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.
</p>

<p>Inclusion conjunctivitis may be treated with oral tetracyclines or with
a combination of oral and topical agents. </p>

<p>Tetracycline is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urethral,
endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia Trachomatis
</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity
to any of the tetracyclines. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT
(LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY
CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse
reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been
observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also
been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS
AGE GROUP UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.
If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead
to excessive systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity.
Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated and,
if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be
advisable. </p>

<p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been
observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed
to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction
can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued
at the first evidence of skin erythema. </p>

<p>The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase
in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function,
in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of
tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: (See above WARNINGS about use during tooth development.)
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta,
are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing
fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence
of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy.
</p>

<p>USAGE IN NEWBORNS, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN: (See above WARNINGS about
use during tooth development.) </p>

<p>All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming
tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures
given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction
was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. </p>

<p>Tetracyclines are present in the milk of lactating women who are taking
a drug in this class. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL: Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults
has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations
are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated
with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions
and related symptoms usually resolve soon after discontinuation of the
tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. </p>

<p>As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in
overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection
occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should
be instituted. </p>

<p>In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, darkfield
examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology
repeated monthly for at least 4 months. </p>

<p>In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems,
including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.
</p>

<p>All infections due to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci should be
treated for at least 10 days. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS: Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress
plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy
may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. </p>

<p>Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the tetracycline class of antibiotics,
may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is not advisable
to administer these drugs concimitantly. </p>

<p>Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral
contraceptives less effective. Breakthrough bleeding has been reported.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin
activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward
adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. </p>

<p>Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the tetracycline class of antibiotics,
may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is not advisable
to administer these drugs concomitantly. </p>

<p>Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render
oral contraceptives less effective. Breakthrough bleeding has been reported.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Metoprolol succinate (extended release) is a beta1-selective (cardioselective)
adrenoceptor blocking agent, for oral administration. Its chemical name
is (+/-)1-(isopropylamino)-3-(p-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxy)-2 propanol succinate
(2:1) (salt). </p>

<p>Metoprolol succinate is a white crystalline powder with a molecular
weight of 652.8. It is freely soluble in water; soluble in methanol; sparingly
soluble in ethanol; slightly soluble in dichloromethane and 2-propanol;
practically insoluble in ethyl-acetate, acetone, diethylether and heptane.</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b> ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Metoprolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor
blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and
at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors,
chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Metoprolol has
no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity
is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required
for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol
slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction. </p>

<p>Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity
of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac
output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure
upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and
(4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. </p>

<p>The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the
following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the
beta2- mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with
the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the
vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol
reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker,
propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses. </p>

<p>In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, the same daily
doses of Metoprolol (extended release) and immediate release metoprolol
were compared in terms of the extent and duration of beta1-blockade produced.
Both formulations were given in a dose range equivalent to 100-400 mg of
immediate release metoprolol per day. In these studies, Metoprolol (extended
release) was administered once a day and immediate release metoprolol was
administered once to four times a day. A sixth controlled study compared
the beta1-blocking effects of a 50 mg daily dose of the two formulations.
In each study, beta1-blockade was expressed as the percent change from
baseline, in exercise heart rate following standardized submaximal exercise
tolerance tests at steady state. Metoprolol (extended release) administered
once a day, and immediate release metoprolol administered once to four
times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area
under the beta1 blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100-400 mg.
At a dosage of 50 mg once daily, Metoprolol (extended release) produced
significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate
release metoprolol. For Metoprolol (extended release), the percent reduction
in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage
interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses
from 50 to 300 mg daily. The effects at peak/trough (i.e. at 24 hours post
dosing) were; 14/9, 16/10, 24/14, 27/22 and 27/20% reduction in exercise
heart rate for doses of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg Metoprolol (extended
release) once a day, respectively. In contrast to Metoprolol (extended
release) immediate release metoprolol given at a dose of 50-100 mg once
a day, produced a significantly larger peak effect on exercise tachycardia,
but the effect was not evident at 24 hours. To match the peak to trough
ratio obtained with Metoprolol (extended release) over the dosing range
of 200 to 400 mg, a t.i.d. to q.i.d. divided dosing regimen was required
for immediate release metoprolol. </p>

<p>The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise
heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Using the
Emax model, the maximal beta1-blocking effect has been estimated to produce
a 28.3% reduction in exercise heart rate. Beta1-blocking effects in the
range of 30-80% of the maximal effect (corresponding to approximately 8-23%
reduction in exercise heart rate) are expected to occur at metoprolol plasma
concentrations ranging from 30-540 nmol/L. The concentration-effect curve
begins reaching a plateau between 200-300 nmol/L, and higher plasma levels
produce little additional beta1-blocking effect. The relative beta1-selectivity
of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases
at higher plasma concentrations. </p>

<p>Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment
of angina and hypertension, there are situations in which sympathetic stimulation
is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular
function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence of AV block,
beta-blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating effect of sympathetic
activity on conduction. Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial
constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity
in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous
bronchodilators in such patients. </p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents
has not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been
proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially
cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output;
(2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery;
and (3) suppression of renin activity. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical studies, an immediate release dosage form of
metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when
used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages
of 100-450 mg daily. Metoprolol (extended release), in dosages of 100 to
400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess comparable beta1-blockade
as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.
In addition, Metoprolol (extended release) administered at a dose of 50
mg once daily has been shown to lower blood pressure 24-hours post dosing
in placebo controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies,
immediate release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive
agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected
both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels
attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive
activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires
individual titration. </p>

<p>ANGINA PECTORIS </p>

<p>By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity
and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol
reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort,
thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris. However,
in patients with heart failure, beta-adrenergic blockade may increase oxygen
requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end-diastolic
pressure. </p>

<p>In controlled clinical trials, an immediate release formulation of metoprolol
has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number
of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in
these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol (extended release),
in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess comparable
beta1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four
times daily. </p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS </p>

<p>In man, absorption of metoprolol is rapid and complete. Plasma levels
following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however,
approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating
about 50% first pass metabolism. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier
and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous
plasma concentration. </p>

<p>Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration.
Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.
Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma
half- life ranges from approximately 3 to 7 hours. Less than 5% of an oral
dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted
by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no clinical significance.
Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery
of unchanged drug is approximately 10%. The systemic availability and half-life
of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically
significant degree from those in normal subjects. Consequently, no reduction
in dosage is usually needed in patients with chronic renal failure. </p>

<p>In comparison to conventional metoprolol, the plasma metoprolol levels
following administration of Metoprolol (extended release) are characterized
by lower peaks, longer time to peak and significantly lower peak to trough
variation. The peak plasma levels following once daily administration of
Metoprolol (extended release) average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma
levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol,
administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average
bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of Metoprolol (extended
release), across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative
to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.
Nevertheless, over the 24 hour dosing interval, beta1-blockade is comparable
and dose-related (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The bioavailability
of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional
increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following
Metoprolol (extended release) administration. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) tablets are indicated for the treatment
of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive
agents. </p>

<p>ANGINA PECTORIS </p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) tablets are indicated in the long-term
treatment of angina pectoris. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION AND ANGINA </p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) is contraindicated in sinus bradycardia,
heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac
failure (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>HYPERTENSION AND ANGINA </p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting
circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade carries
the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and
precipitating more severe failure. In hypertensive and angina patients
who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics,
Metoprolol (extended release) should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis
and Metoprolol (extended release) slow AV conduction. </p>

<p>IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF CARDIAC FAILURE: Continued depression
of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can,
in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of
impending cardiac failure, patients should be fully digitalized and/or
given a diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure
continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, Metoprolol
(extended release) should be withdrawn. </p>

<p>ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE: Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain
beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases,
myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered
Metoprolol (extended release), particularly in patients with ischemic heart
disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1-2 weeks
and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens
or acute coronary insufficiency develops, Metoprolol (extended release)
administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and
other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should
be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation
of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease
is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue
Metoprolol (extended release) therapy abruptly even in patients treated
only for hypertension. </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES: PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD,
IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta1-selectivity,
however, Metoprolol (extended release) may be used with caution in patients
with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate,
other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta1-selectivity is not absolute,
a beta2-stimulating agent should be administered concomitantly, and the
lowest possible dose of Metoprolol (extended release) should be used (see
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). </p>

<p>MAJOR SURGERY: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta-blocking
therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of
the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks
of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. </p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) like other beta-blockers, is a competitive
inhibitor of beta-receptor agonists, and its effects can be reversed by
administration of such agents, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However,
such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Difficulty
in restarting and maintaining the heart beat has also been reported with
beta-blockers. </p>

<p>DIABETES AND HYPOGLYCEMIA: Metoprolol (extended release) should be used
with caution in diabetic patients if a beta-blocking agent is required.
Beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other
manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly
affected. </p>

<p>THYROTOXICOSIS: Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs
(e.g. tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing
thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of
beta blockade, which might precipitate a thyroid storm. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) should be used with caution in patients
with impaired hepatic function. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Patients should be advised to take Metoprolol (extended release) regularly
and continuously, as directed, preferably with or immediately following
meals. If a dose should be missed, the patient should take only the next
scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not discontinue Metoprolol
(extended release) without consulting the physician. </p>

<p>Patients should be advised (1) to avoid operating automobiles and machinery
or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient's response
to therapy with Metoprolol (extended release) has been determined; (2)
to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing occurs; (3) to
inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she
is taking Metoprolol (extended release). </p>

<p>LABORATORY TESTS </p>

<p>Clinical laboratory findings may include elevated levels of serum transaminase,
alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase. </p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive
effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Metoprolol
(extended release) plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely
observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY </p>

<p>Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic
potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral
dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day, there was no increase in the development
of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The
only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased
incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in
pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month
study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day,
benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female
mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There
was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors,
nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month
study was repeated in CD 1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant
differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex
for any type of tumor. </p>

<p>All mutagenicity tests performed on metoprolol tartrate (a dominant
lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a Salmonella/mammalian
microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase
nuclei) and metoprolol succinate (a Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity
test) were negative. </p>

<p>No evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol tartrate was observed
in a study performed in rats at doses up to 55.5 times the maximum daily
human dose of 450 mg. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C </p>

<p>Metoprolol tartrate has been shown to increase post-implantation loss
and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 55.5 times the maximum
daily human dose of 450 mg. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure
of the fetus when metoprolol tartrate is administered to the pregnant animal.
These studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenicity.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,
this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. An infant
consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than
1 mg of the drug. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol (extended
release) is administered to a nursing woman. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>RISK OF ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS </p>

<p>While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic
reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge,
either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive
to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive
effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Metoprolol
(extended release) plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely
observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. </p>

<p>(See Also PRECAUTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation
for time and place short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly
clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. </p>

<p>CARDIOVASCULAR: Intensification of AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
</p>

<p>HEMATOLOGIC: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytopenic
purpura. </p>

<p>HYPERSENSITIVE REACTIONS: Fever combined with aching and sore throat,
laryngospasm, and respiratory distress. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>ACUTE TOXICITY </p>

<p>No overdosage has been reported with Metoprolol (extended release) and
no specific overdosage information was obtained with this drug, with the
exception of animal toxicology data. However, since Metoprolol (extended
release) (metoprolol succinate salt) contains the same active moiety, metoprolol,
as conventional metoprolol tablets (metoprolol tartrate salt), the recommendations
on overdosage for metoprolol conventional tablets are applicable to Metoprolol
(extended release). </p>

<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS </p>

<p>Potential signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with metoprolol
are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and cardiac failure. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>There is no specific antidote. </p>

<p>In general, patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction may
be more hemodynamically unstable than other patients and should be treated
accordingly. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol tartrate,
the following general measures should be employed. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION OF THE DRUG: Gastric lavage should be performed. </p>

<p>BRADYCARDIA: Atropine should be administered. If there is no response
to vagal blockade, isoproterenol should be administered cautiously. </p>

<p>HYPOTENSION: A vasopressor should be administered, e.g., levarterenol
or dopamine. </p>

<p>BRONCHOSPASM: A beta2-stimulating agent and/or a theophylline derivative
should be administered. </p>

<p>CARDIAC FAILURE: A digitalis glycoside and diuretics should be administered.
In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, administration
of dobutamine, isoproterenol or glucagon may be considered. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) is an extended release tablet intended
for once-a-day administration. When switching from immediate release metoprolol
tablet to Metoprolol (extended release), the same total daily dose of Metoprolol
(extended release) should be used. </p>

<p>As with immediate release metoprolol, dosages of Metoprolol (extended
release) should be individualized and titration may be needed in some patients.
</p>

<p>Metoprolol (extended release) tablets are scored and can be divided;
however, the whole or half tablet should be swallowed whole and not chewed
or crushed. </p>

<p>HYPERTENSION </p>

<p>The usual initial dosage is 50 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether
used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased at weekly
(or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved.
In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent
after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.
</p>

<p>ANGINA PECTORIS </p>

<p>The dosage of Metoprolol (extended release) should be individualized.
The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. The dosage
may be gradually increased at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response
has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages
above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued,
the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks (see
WARNINGS). </p>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
WARNINGS <p>
 
1. ESTROGENS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA
IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.  
 <p>
Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important.
Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated,
should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed
persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that
&quot;natural&quot; estrogens are more or less hazardous than &quot;synthetic&quot; estrogens at
equi-estrogenic doses.  
 <p>
2. ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.  
 <p>
There is no indication for estrogen therapy during pregnancy or during the
immediate postpartum period. Estrogens are ineffective for the prevention or
treatment of threatened or habitual abortion. Estrogens are not indicated for
the prevention of postpartum breast engorgement.  
 <p>
Estrogen therapy during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of
congenital defects in the reproductive organs of the fetus, and possibly other
birth defects. Studies of women who received diethylstilbestrol (DES) during
pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an increased risk of vaginal
adenosis, squamous cell dysplasia of the uterine cervix, and clear cell vaginal 
cancer later in life; male offspring have an increased risk of urogenital
abnormalities and possibly testicular cancer later in life. The 1985 DES Task
Force concluded that use of DES during pregnancy is associated with a
subsequent increased risk of breast cancer in the mothers, although a causal
relationship remains unproven and the observed level of excess risk is similar
to that for a number of other breast cancer risk factors.  
 <p>
Estradiol (17beta-estradiol) is a white, crystalline solid, chemically described as
estra-1,3,5,(10)-triene-3, 17beta-diol. It has an empirical formula of 
C18H24O2 and molecular weight of 272.37. 
 <p>

<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Estrogen drug products act by regulating the transcription of a limited number
of genes. Estrogens diffuse through cell membranes, distribute themselves
throughout the cell, and bind to and activate the nuclear estrogen receptor, a
DNA-binding protein which is found in estrogen-responsive tissues. The
activated estrogen receptor binds to specific DNA sequences, or hormone
response elements, which enhance the transcription of adjacent genes and in
turn lead to the observed effects. Estrogen receptors have been identified in
tissues of the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, liver, and
bone of women.  
 <p>
Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female
reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. By a direct action, they 
cause growth and development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and vagina. With
other hormones, such as pituitary hormones and progesterone, they cause
enlargement of the breasts through promotion of ductal growth, stromal
development, and the accretion of fat. Estrogens are intricately involved with
other hormones, especially progesterone, in the processes of the ovulatory
menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and affect the release of pituitary
gonadotropins. They also contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance 
of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of
the long bones that allow for the pubertal growth spurt and its termination,
and pigmentation of the nipples and genitals.  
 <p>
Estrogens occur naturally in several forms. The primary source of estrogen in
normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500
micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. 
This is converted primarily to estrone, which circulates in roughly equal
proportion to estradiol, and to small amounts of estriol. After menopause, most 
endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by
the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone--especially 
in its sulfate ester form--is the most abundant circulating estrogen in
postmenopausal women. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic
equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal
intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than estrone or
estriol at the receptor.  <p>
 
Estrogens used in therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, 
and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is
usually sufficient to cause systemic effects. When conjugated with aryl and
alkyl groups for parenteral administration, the rate of absorption of oily
preparations is slowed with a prolonged duration of action, such that a single
intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate is
absorbed over several weeks.  
 <p>
Administered estrogens and their esters are handled within the body essentially 
the same as the endogenous hormones. Metabolic conversion of estrogens occurs
primarily in the liver (first pass effect), but also at local target tissue
sites. Complex metabolic processes result in a dynamic equilibrium of
circulating conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic forms which are continually
interconverted, especially between estrone and estradiol and between esterified 
and unesterified forms. Although naturally-occurring estrogens circulate in the 
blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin, only unbound
estrogens enter target tissue cells. A significant proportion of the
circulating estrogen exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate,
which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active
estrogenic species.  A certain proportion of the estrogen is excreted into the
bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. During this enterohepatic
recirculation, estrogens are desulfated and resulfated and undergo degradation
through conversion to less active estrogens (estriol and other estrogens),
oxidation to nonestrogenic substances (catecholestrogens, which interact with
catecholamine metabolism, especially in the central nervous system), and
conjugation with glucuronic acid (which is then rapidly excreted in the urine). 
 <p>
When given orally, naturally-occurring estrogens and their esters are
extensively metabolized (first pass effect) and circulate primarily as estrone
sulfate, with smaller amounts of other conjugated and unconjugated estrogenic
species. This results in limited oral potency. By contrast, synthetic estrogens 
such as ethinyl estradiol and the nonsteroidal estrogens, are degraded very
slowly in the liver and other tissues, which results in their high intrinsic
potency. Estrogen drug products administered by non-oral routes are not subject 
to first-pass metabolism, but also undergo significant hepatic uptake,
metabolism, and enterohepatic recycling.  
 <p>
<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Estradiol is indicated in the:  
 <p>
1. Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the
menopause. There is no adequate evidence that estrogens are effective for
nervous symptoms or depression which might occur during menopause and they
should not be used to treat these conditions.  
 <p>
2. Treatment of vulval and vaginal atrophy.  
 <p>
3. Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary
ovarian failure.  <p>
4. Treatment of breast cancer (for palliation only) in appropriately selected
women and men with metastatic disease.  
 <p>
5. Treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate (for
palliation only).  
 <p>
6. Prevention of osteoporosis.  <p>
Since estrogen administration is associated with risk, selection of patients
should ideally be based on prospective identification of risk factors for
developing osteoporosis. Unfortunately, there is no certain way to identify
those women who will develop osteoporotic fractures. Most prospective studies
of efficacy for this indication have been carried out in white menopausal women 
without stratification by other risk factors, and tend to show a universally
salutary effect on bone. Thus, patient selection must be individualized based
on the balance of risks and benefits. A more favorable risk/benefit ratio
exists in a hysterectomized woman because she has no risk of endometrial cancer 
(see WARNINGS).  
 <p>
Estrogen replacement therapy reduces bone resorption and retards or halts post
menopausal bone loss. Case-control studies have shown an approximately 60
percent reduction in hip and wrist fractures in women whose estrogen
replacement was begun within a few years of menopause. Studies also suggest
that estrogen reduces the rate of vertebral fractures. Even when started as
late as 6 years after menopause, estrogen prevents further loss of bone mass
for as long as the treatment is continued. When estrogen therapy is
discontinued, bone mass declines at a rate comparable to the immediate
postmenopausal period. There is no evidence that estrogen replacement therapy
restores bone mass to premenopausal levels.  
 <p>
At skeletal maturity there are sex and race differences in both the total
amount of bone present and its density, in favor of men and blacks. Thus, women 
are at higher risk than men because they start with less bone mass and, for
several years following natural or induced menopause, the rate of bone mass
decline is accelerated. White and Asian women are at higher risk than black
women.  <p>
Early menopause is one of the strongest predictors for the development of
osteoporosis. In addition, other factors affecting the skeleton which are
associated with osteoporosis include genetic factors (small build, family
history), and endocrine factors (nulliparity, thyrotoxicosis,
hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, Type I diabetes),
lifestyle (cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, sedentary exercise habits) and
nutrition (below average body weight, dietary calcium intake).  
 <p>
The mainstays of prevention and management of osteoporosis are estrogen, an
adequate lifetime calcium intake, and exercise. Postmenopausal women absorb
dietary calcium less efficiently than premenopausal women and require an
average of 1500 mg/day of elemental calcium to remain in neutral calcium
balance. By comparison, premenopausal women require about 1000 mg/day and the
average calcium intake in the USA is 400-600 mg/day. Therefore, when not
contraindicated, calcium supplementation may be helpful.  <p>
 
Weight-bearing exercise and nutrition may be important adjuncts to the
prevention and management of osteoporosis. Immobilization and prolonged bed
rest produce rapid bone loss, while weight-bearing exercise has been shown both 
to reduce bone loss and to increase bone mass. The optimal type and amount of
physical activity that would prevent osteoporosis have not been established,
however in two studies an hour of walking and running exercise twice or three
times weekly significantly increased lumbar spine bone mass.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Estrogens should not be used in individuals with any of the following
conditions:  <p>
 
1. Known or suspected pregnancy (see BOXED WARNINGS). Estrogens may cause fetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  
 <p>
2. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.  
 <p>
3. Known or suspected cancer of the breast except in appropriately selected
patients being treated for metastatic disease.  
 <p>
4. Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia.  
 <p>
5. Active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders.

birth defects. Studies of women who received diethylstilbestrol (DES) during
pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an increased risk of vaginal

Force concluded that use of DES during pregnancy is associated with a
subsequent increased risk of breast cancer in the mothers, although a causal
relationship remains unproven and the observed level of excess risk is similar
to that for a number of other breast cancer risk factors.  
 <p>
 
1. INDUCTION OF MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS 
 <p>
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed
estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in non-users, and appears
dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no
significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one
year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use--with increased
risks of 15- to 24-fold for five to ten years or more. In three studies,
persistence of risk was demonstrated for 8 to over 15 years after cessation of
estrogen treatment. In one study a significant decrease in the incidence of
endometrial cancer occurred six months after estrogen withdrawal. Concurrent
progestin therapy may offset this risk but the overall health impact in
postmenopausal women is not known (see PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
BREAST CANCER. While the majority of studies have not shown an increased risk
of breast cancer in women who have ever used estrogen replacement therapy, some 
have reported a moderately increased risk (relative risks of 1.3-2.0) in those
taking higher doses or those taking lower doses for prolonged periods of time,
especially in excess of 10 years. Other studies have not shown this
relationship.  <p>
 
CONGENITAL LESIONS WITH MALIGNANT POTENTIAL. Estrogen therapy during pregnancy
is associated with an increased risk of fetal congenital reproductive tract
disorders, and possibly other birth defects. Studies of women who received DES
during pregnancy have shown that female offspring have an increased risk of
vaginal adenosis, squamous cell dysplasia of the uterine cervix, and clear cell 
vaginal cancer later in life; male offspring have an increased risk of
urogenital abnormalities and possibly testicular cancer later in life. Although 
some of these changes are benign, others are precursors of malignancy.  
<p>
2. GALLBLADDER DISEASE. Two studies have reported a 2- to 4-fold increase in
the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in women receiving
postmenopausal estrogens.  
 <p>
3. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens
per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast,
have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the
risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and
thrombophlebitis. These risks cannot necessarily be extrapolated from men to
women. However, to avoid the theoretical cardiovascular risk to women caused by 
high estrogen doses, the dose for estrogen replacement therapy should not
exceed the lowest effective dose.  <p>
 
4. ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE. Occasional blood pressure increases during estrogen 
replacement therapy have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to
estrogens. More often, blood pressure has remained the same or has dropped. One 
study showed that postmenopausal estrogen users have higher blood pressure than 
nonusers. Two other studies showed slightly lower blood pressure among estrogen 
users compared to nonusers. Postmenopausal estrogen use does not increase the
risk of stroke. Nonetheless, blood pressure should be monitored at regular
intervals with estrogen use.  
 <p>
5. HYPERCALCEMIA. Administration of estrogens may lead to severe hypercalcemia
in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If this occurs, the drug
should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium
level.  <p>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
A. GENERAL <p>
 
1. ADDITION OF A PROGESTIN. Studies of the addition of a progestin for seven or 
more days of a cycle of estrogen administration have reported a lowered
incidence of endometrial hyperplasia which would otherwise be induced by
estrogen treatment. Morphological and biochemical studies of endometrium
suggest that 10 to 14 days of progestin are needed to provide maximal
maturation of the endometrium and to eliminate any hyperplastic changes. There
are possible additional risks which may be associated with the inclusion of
progestins in estrogen replacement regimens. These include: (1) adverse effects 
on lipoprotein metabolism (lowering HDL and raising LDL) which may diminish the 
possible cardioprotective effect of estrogen therapy (see PRECAUTIONS D.4.,
below); (2) impairment of glucose tolerance; and (3) possible enhancement of
mitotic activity in breast epithelial tissue (although few epidemiological data 
are available to address this point). The choice of progestin, its dose, and
its regimen may be important in minimizing these adverse effects, but these
issues remain to be clarified.  
 <p>
2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION. A complete medical and family history should be taken
prior to the initiation of any estrogen therapy. The pretreatment and periodic
physical examinations should include special reference to blood pressure,
breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, and should include a Papanicolaou smear.
As a general rule, estrogen should not be prescribed for longer than one year
without reexamining the patient.  <p>
 
3. HYPERCOAGULABILITY. Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen
replacement therapy have hypercoagulability, primarily related to decreased
antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration-dependent and is
less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use. Also,
postmenopausal women tend to have increased coagulation parameters at baseline
compared to premenopausal women. There is some suggestion that low dose
postmenopausal mestranol may increase the risk of thromboembolism, although the 
majority of studies (of primarily conjugated estrogens users) report no such
increase. There is insufficient information on hypercoagulability in women who
have had previous thromboembolic disease.  <p>
 
4. FAMILIAL HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA. Estrogen therapy may be associated with
massive elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other
complications in patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism.  
 <p>
5. FLUID RETENTION. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, 
conditions which might be exacerbated by this factor, such as asthma, epilepsy, 
migraine, and cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful observation.  
 <p>
6. UTERINE BLEEDING AND MASTODYNIA. Certain patients may develop undesirable
manifestations of estrogenic stimulation, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and 
mastodynia.  
 <p>
7. IMPAIRED LIVER FUNCTION. Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients
with impaired liver function and should be administered with caution.  
 <p>

B. INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT. See text of Patient Package Insert below.  
 <p>
C. LABORATORY TESTS. Estrogen administration should generally be guided by
clinical response at the smallest dose, rather than laboratory monitoring, for
relief of symptoms for those indications in which symptoms are observable. For
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, however, see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION section.  
 <p>
<b>D. <a name="DRUG/LABORATORY TEST"></a>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS.  
</b> <p>
1. Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet
aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen,
VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X
complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and
antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of
fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 
 <p>
2. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating
total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI). T4 levels (by 
column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay, T3 resin
uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3
concentrations are unaltered.  
 <p>
3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid
binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to
increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free or
biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma proteins 
may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin,
ceruloplasmin).  
 <p>
4. Increased plasma HDL and HDL-2 subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL
cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels.  
 <p>
5. Impaired glucose tolerance.  
 <p>
6. Reduced response to metyrapone test.  
 <p>
7. Reduced serum folate concentration.  
 <p>
E. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY. Long term
continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal
species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix,
vagina, testis, and liver. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.  
 <p>
F. PREGNANCY CATEGORY X. Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy. See
CONTRAINDICATIONS and BOXED WARNINGS.  <p>
 
G. NURSING MOTHERS. As a general principle, the administration of any drug to
nursing mothers should be done only when clearly necessary since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk. In addition, estrogen administration to nursing mothers 
has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk.  
 <p>

INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT 
 <p>
INTRODUCTION 
 <p>
This leaflet describes when and how to use estrogens, and the risks and
benefits of estrogen treatment.  
 <p>
Estrogens have important benefits but also some risks. You must decide, with
your doctor, whether the risks to you of estrogen use are acceptable because of 
their benefits. If you use estrogens, check with your doctor to be sure you are 
using the lowest possible dose that works, and that you don't use them longer
than necessary. How long you need to use estrogens will depend on the reason
for use.  
 <p>
 
WARNINGS 
 <p>
1. ESTROGENS INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER OF THE UTERUS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD
THEIR MENOPAUSE (&quot;CHANGE OF LIFE&quot;).  
 <p>
If you use any estrogen-containing drug, it is important to visit your doctor
regularly and report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away. Vaginal bleeding
after menopause may be a warning sign of uterine cancer. Your doctor should
evaluate any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.  
 <p>
2. ESTROGENS SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY.  
 <p>
Estrogens do not prevent miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) and are not needed
in the days following childbirth. If you take estrogens during pregnancy, your
unborn child has a greater than usual chance of having birth defects. The risk
of developing these defects is small, but clearly larger than the risk in
children whose mothers did not take estrogens during pregnancy. These birth
defects may affect the baby's urinary system and sex organs. Daughters born to
mothers who took DES (an estrogen drug) have a higher than usual chance of
developing cancer of the vagina or cervix when they become teenagers or young
adults. Sons may have a higher than usual chance of developing cancer of the
testicles when they become teenagers or young adults.  
 <p>
 
USES OF ESTROGEN 
 <p>
(NOT EVERY ESTROGEN DRUG IS APPROVED FOR EVERY USE LISTED IN THIS SECTION. If
you want to know which of these possible uses are approved for the medicine
prescribed for you, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you the professional
labeling. You can also look up the specific estrogen product in a book called
the &quot;Physicians' Desk Reference&quot;, which is available in many book stores and
public libraries. Generic drugs carry virtually the same labeling information
as their brand name versions.) 
 <p>
--TO REDUCE MODERATE OR SEVERE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.  
 <p>
Estrogens are hormones made by the ovaries of normal women. Between ages 45 and 
55, the ovaries normally stop making estrogens. This leads to a drop in body
estrogen levels which causes the &quot;change of life&quot; or menopause (the end of
monthly menstrual periods). If both ovaries are removed during an operation
before natural menopause takes place, the sudden drop in estrogen levels causes 
&quot;surgical menopause&quot;.  <p>
 
When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable
symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden
intense episodes of heat and sweating (&quot;hot flashes&quot; or &quot;hot flushes&quot;). Using
estrogen drugs can help the body adjust to lower estrogen levels and reduce
these symptoms. Most women have only mild menopausal symptoms or none at all
and do not need to use estrogen drugs for these symptoms. Others may need to
take estrogens for a few months while their bodies adjust to lower estrogen
levels.  The majority of women do not need estrogen replacement for longer than 
six months for these symptoms.  
 <p>
--TO TREAT VULVAL AND VAGINAL ATROPHY (itching, burning, dryness in or around
the vagina, difficulty or burning on urination) associated with menopause.  
 <p>
--TO TREAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN WHICH A YOUNG WOMAN'S OVARIES DO NOT PRODUCE
ENOUGH ESTROGEN NATURALLY.  
 <p>
--TO TREAT CERTAIN TYPES OF ABNORMAL VAGINAL BLEEDING DUE TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE 
WHEN YOUR DOCTOR HAS FOUND NO SERIOUS CAUSE OF THE BLEEDING.  
 <p>
--TO TREAT CERTAIN CANCERS IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS, IN MEN AND WOMEN.  
 <p>
--TO PREVENT THINNING OF BONES.  
 <p>
Osteoporosis is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and allows them
to break more easily. The bones of the spine, wrists and hips break most often
in osteoporosis. Both men and women start to lose bone mass after about age 40, 
but women lose bone mass faster after the menopause. Using estrogens after the
menopause slows down bone thinning and may prevent bones from breaking.
Lifelong adequate calcium intake, either in the diet (such as dairy products)
or by calcium supplements (to reach a total daily intake of 1000 milligrams per 
day before menopause or 1500 milligrams per day after menopause), may help to
prevent osteoporosis. Regular weight-bearing exercise (like walking and running 
for an hour, two or three times a week) may also help to prevent osteoporosis.  
Before you change your calcium intake or exercise habits, it is important to
discuss these lifestyle changes with your doctor to find out if they are safe
for you.  <p>
 
Since estrogen use has some risks, only women who are likely to develop
osteoporosis should use estrogens for prevention. Women who are likely to
develop osteoporosis often have the following characteristics: white or Asian
race, slim, cigarette smokers, and a family history of osteoporosis in a mother 
sister, or aunt. Women who have relatively early menopause, often because
their ovaries were removed during an operation (&quot;surgical menopause&quot;), are more 
likely to develop osteoporosis than women whose menopause happens at the
average age.  <p>
 
WHO SHOULD NOT USE ESTROGENS 
 <p>
Estrogens should not be used:  
 <p>
--DURING PREGNANCY (SEE WARNINGS).  
 <p>
If you think you may be pregnant, do not use any form of estrogen-containing
drug. Using estrogens while you are pregnant may cause your unborn child to
have birth defects. Estrogens do not prevent miscarriage.  
 <p>
--IF YOU HAVE UNUSUAL VAGINAL BLEEDING WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY YOUR
DOCTOR (SEE BOXED WARNINGS).  
 <p>
Unusual vaginal bleeding can be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus,
especially if it happens after menopause. Your doctor must find out the cause
of the bleeding so that he or she can recommend the proper treatment. Taking
estrogens without visiting your doctor can cause you serious harm if your
vaginal bleeding is caused by cancer of the uterus.  
 <p>
--IF YOU HAVE HAD CANCER.  
 <p>
Since estrogens increase the risk of certain types of cancer, you should not
use estrogens if you have ever had cancer of the breast or uterus, unless your
doctor recommends that the drug may help in the cancer treatment. (For certain
patients with breast or prostate cancer, estrogens may help.) 
 <p>
--IF YOU HAVE ANY CIRCULATION PROBLEMS.  
 <p>
Estrogen drugs should not be used except in unusually special situations in
which your doctor judges that you need estrogen therapy so much that the risks
are acceptable. Men and women with abnormal blood clotting conditions should
avoid estrogen use (see Dangers of Estrogens, below).  
 <p>
--WHEN THEY DO NOT WORK.  <p>
 
During menopause, some women develop nervous symptoms or depression. Estrogens
do not relieve these symptoms. You may have heard that taking estrogens for
years after menopause will keep your skin soft and supple and keep you feeling
young. There is no evidence for these claims and such long-term estrogen use
may have serious risks.  <p>
 
--AFTER CHILDBIRTH OR WHEN BREASTFEEDING A BABY.  
 <p>
Estrogens should not be used to try to stop the breasts from filling with milk
after a baby is born. Such treatment may increase the risk of developing blood
clots (see Dangers of Estrogens, below).  <p>
 
If you are breastfeeding, you should avoid using any drugs because many drugs
pass through to the baby in the milk. While nursing a baby, you should take
drugs only on the advice of your health care provider.  
 <p>
DANGERS OF ESTROGENS 
 <p>
--CANCER OF THE UTERUS.  <p>
 
Your risk of developing cancer of the uterus gets higher the longer you use
estrogens and the larger doses you use. One study showed that after women stop
taking estrogens, this higher cancer risk quickly returns to the usual level of 
risk (as if you had never used estrogen therapy). Three other studies showed
that the cancer risk stayed high for 8 to more than 15 years after stopping
estrogen treatment. Because of this risk IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE LOWEST
DOSE THAT WORKS AND TO TAKE IT ONLY AS LONG AS YOU NEED IT.  
 <p>
Using progestin therapy together with estrogen therapy may reduce the higher
risk of uterine cancer related to estrogen use (but see Other Information,
below).  
 <p>
If you have had your uterus removed (total hysterectomy), there is no danger of 
developing cancer of the uterus.  <p>
 
--CANCER OF THE BREAST.  
 <p>
Most studies have not shown a higher risk of breast cancer in women who have
ever used estrogens. However, some studies have reported that breast cancer
developed more often (up to twice the usual rate) in women who used estrogens
for long periods of time (especially more than 10 years), or who used higher
doses for shorter time periods.  <p>
 
Regular breast examinations by a health professional and monthly self-
examination are recommended for all women.  
 <p>
--GALLBLADDER DISEASE.  
 <p>
Women who use estrogens after menopause are more likely to develop gallbladder
disease needing surgery than women who do not use estrogens.  
 <p>
--ABNORMAL BLOOD CLOTTING.  <p>
 
Taking estrogens may cause changes in your blood clotting system. These changes 
allow the blood to clot more easily, possibly allowing clots to form in your
bloodstream. If blood clots do form in your bloodstream, they can cut off the
blood supply to vital organs, causing serious problems. These problems may
include a stroke (by cutting off blood to the brain), a heart attack (by
cutting off blood to the heart), a pulmonary embolus (by cutting off blood to
the lungs), or other problems. Any of these conditions may cause death or
serious long term disability. However, most studies of low dose estrogen usage
by women do not show an increased risk of these complications.  
 <p>
SIDE EFFECTS <p>
In addition to the risks listed above, the following side effects have been
reported with estrogen use:  
 <p>
Nausea and vomiting.  
 <p>
Breast tenderness or enlargement.  
 <p>
Enlargement of benign tumors (&quot;fibroids&quot;) of the uterus.  
 <p>
Retention of excess fluid. This may make some conditions worsen, such as asthma 
epilepsy, migraine, heart disease, or kidney disease.  
 <p>
A spotty darkening of the skin, particularly on the face.  
 <p>
REDUCING RISK OF ESTROGEN USE 
 <p>
If you use estrogens, you can reduce your risks by doing these things:  
 <p>
--SEE YOUR DOCTOR REGULARLY.  
 <p>
While you are using estrogens, it is important to visit your doctor at least
once a year for a check-up. If you develop vaginal bleeding while taking
estrogens, you may need further evaluation. If members of your family have had
breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram
(breast x-ray), you need to have more frequent breast examinations.  
 <p>
--REASSESS YOUR NEED FOR ESTROGENS.  
 <p>
You and your doctor should reevaluate whether or not you still need estrogens
at least every six months.  <p>
 
--BE ALERT FOR SIGNS OF TROUBLE.  
 <p>
If any of these warning signals (or any other unusual symptoms) happen while
you are using estrogens, call your doctor immediately:  
 <p>
Abnormal bleeding from the vagina (possible uterine cancer) 
 <p>
Pains in the calves or chest, sudden shortness of breath, or coughing blood
(possible clot in the legs, heart, or lungs) 
 <p>
Severe headache or vomiting, dizziness, faintness, changes in vision or speech, 
weakness or numbness of an arm or leg (possible clot in the brain or eye) <p>
 
Breast lumps (possible breast cancer; ask your doctor or health professional to 
show you how to examine your breasts monthly) 
 <p>
Yellowing of the skin or eyes (possible liver problem) 
 <p>
Pain, swelling, or tenderness in the abdomen (possible gallbladder problem) 
 <p>
OTHER INFORMATION 
 <p>
Some doctors may choose to prescribe a progestin, a different hormonal drug,
for you to take together with your estrogen treatment. Progestins lower your
risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia (a possible pre-cancerous condition
of the uterus) while using estrogens. Taking estrogens and progestins together
may also protect you from the higher risk of uterine cancer, but this has not
been clearly established. Combined use of progestin and estrogen treatment may
have additional risks, however. The possible risks include unhealthy effects on 
blood fats (especially a lowering of HDL cholesterol, the &quot;good&quot; blood fat
which protects against heart disease risk), unhealthy effects on blood sugar
(which might worsen a diabetic condition), and a possible further increase in
the breast cancer risk which may be associated with long-term estrogen use. The 
type of progestin drug used and its dosage schedule may be important in
minimizing these effects.  
 <p>
Your doctor has prescribed this drug for you and you alone. Do not give the
drug to anyone else.  <p>
 
If you will be taking calcium supplements as part of the treatment to help
prevent osteoporosis, check with your doctor about how much to take.  
 <p>
Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of overdose, call 
your doctor, hospital or poison control center immediately.  
 <p>
This leaflet provides a summary of the most important information about
estrogens. If you want more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show
you the professional labeling.<p>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Cefprozil is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic.  <p>
 
Cefprozil is a cis and trans isomeric mixture (&gt;/=90% cis). The chemical name
for the monohydrate is (6R,7R)-7-((R)-2- amino-2- (p-hydroxy-phenyl) acetamido) 
8-oxo-3-propenyl-5-thia-1-azabicyclo (4.2.0)oct-2-ene-2- carboxylic acid
monohydrate.  
 <p>
Cefprozil is a white to yellowish powder with a molecular formula for the
monohydrate of C18H19N3O5S.H2O and a molecular weight of 407.45.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
Following oral administration of cefprozil to fasting subjects, approximately
95% of the dose was absorbed. Using the investigational capsule formulation, no 
food effect was observed. The food effect on the tablet and on the suspension
formulations has not been studied.  
 <p>
The pharmacokinetic data were derived from the capsule dosing; however,
bioequivalence has been demonstrated for the oral solution, capsule, tablet and 
suspension formulations under fasting conditions.  
 <p>
Average peak plasma concentrations after administration of 250 mg, 500 mg, or 1 
g doses of cefprozil to fasting subjects were approximately 6.1, 10.5, and 18.3 
mcg/mL respectively, and were obtained within 1.5 hours after dosing. Urinary
recovery accounted for approximately 60% of the administered dose. (See Table.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------   </pre><p> 
*Data represent mean values of 12 healthy volunteers.                           
During the first 4-hour period after drug administration, the average urine
concentrations following the 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1g doses were approximately
700 mcg/mL, 1000 mcg/mL, and 2900 mcg/mL.  
 <p>
Plasma protein binding is approximately 36% and is independent of concentration 
in the range of 2 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL.  
 <p>
The average plasma half-life in normal subjects is 1.3 hours.  
 <p>
There was no evidence of accumulation of cefprozil in the plasma in individuals 
with normal renal function following multiple oral doses of up to 1000 mg every 
8 hours for 10 days.  
 <p>
In patients with reduced renal function, the plasma half-life may be prolonged
up to 5.2 hours depending on the degree of the renal dysfunction. In patients
with complete absence of renal function the plasma half-life of cefprozil has
been shown to be as long as 5.9 hours. The half-life is shortened during
hemodialysis. Excretion pathways in patients with markedly impaired renal
function have not been determined. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION.) 
 <p>
The average AUC observed in elderly subjects (&gt;/=65 years of age) is
approximately 35%-60% higher relative to young adults, and the average AUC in
females is approximately 15%-20% higher than in males. The magnitude of these
age and gender related changes in the pharmacokinetics of cefprozil are not
sufficient to necessitate dosage adjustments.  
 <p>
In patients with impaired hepatic function, the half-life increases to
approximately 2 hours. The magnitude of the changes does not warrant a dosage
adjustment for patients with impaired hepatic function.  
 <p>
Adequate data on CSF levels of cefprozil are not available.  
 <p>
MICROBIOLOGY 
 <p>
Cefprozil has In Vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram 
negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of cefprozil results from
inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Cefprozil has been shown to be active
against most strains of the following organisms both In Vitro and in clinical
infections.  (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.) 
 <p>
AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE:  
    <p>
Staphylococcus Aureus 
 <p>
(including penicillinase-producing strains) 
 <p>
NOTE: Cefprozil is inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococci

 <p>
The following In Vitro data are available; however, their clinical significance 
is unknown.  
 <p>
Cefprozil exhibits In Vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 8 mcg/mL 
or less against most strains of the following organisms. The safety and
efficacy of cefprozil in treating infections due to these organisms have not
been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS 
 <p>
DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES 
 <p>
Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most
precise estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One 
such standardized procedure recommended for use with the 30-mcg cefprozil disk
is the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) approved
procedure. (REF.1) Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained 
in the disk test with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for cefprozil.  
 <p>
The class disk for cephalosporin susceptibility testing (the cephalothin disk)
is not appropriate because of spectrum differences with cefprozil. The 30-mcg
cefprozil disk should be used for all In Vitro testing of isolates.  
 <p>
Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk
susceptibility test with a 30-mcg cefprozil disk should be interpreted
according to the following criteria:  <p><pre>
 
ZONE DIAMETER (MM)       INTERPRETATION

A report of &quot;Susceptible&quot; indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited 
by generally achievable blood concentrations. A report of &quot;Moderately
Susceptible&quot; indicates that the organism would be susceptible if high dosage is 
used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids (eg, urine) in which 
high antibiotic levels are attained. A report of &quot;Resistant&quot; indicates that the 
achievable concentration of the antibiotic is unlikely to be inhibitory and
other therapy should be selected.  
 <p>
Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. The 30 
mcg cefprozil disk should give the following zone diameters:  <p>

Staphylococcus Aureus ATCC 25923          27-33                                 
DILUTION TECHNIQUES 
 
Use a standardized dilution method (REF. 2) (broth, agar, microdilution) or
equivalent with cefprozil powder. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted 
according to the following criteria:  
 
MIC (MCG/ML)                 INTERPRETATION

As with standard diffusion techniques, dilution techniques require the use of
laboratory control organisms. Standard cefprozil powder should give the
following MIC values:

<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Cefprozil(R)  is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to
moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated
microorganisms in the conditions listed below:  
 <p>
UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT 
 <p>
PHARYNGITIS/TONSILLITIS caused by Streptococcus Pyogenes.  
 <p>
NOTE: The usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal 
infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever, is penicillin given
by the intramuscular route. Cefprozil is generally effective in the eradication 
of Streptococcus Pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data
establishing the efficacy of cefprozil in the subsequent prevention of
rheumatic fever are not available at present.  
 <p>
OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae and
Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis. (See CLINICAL STUDIES section.) 
 <p>
NOTE: In the treatment of otitis media due to beta-lactamase producing
organisms, cefprozil had bacteriologic eradication rates somewhat lower than
those observed with a product containing a specific beta-lactamase inhibitor.
In considering the use of cefprozil, lower overall eradication rates should be
balanced against the susceptibility patterns of the common microbes in a given
geographic area and the increased potential for toxicity with products
containing beta-lactamase inhibitors.  
 <p>
LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT 
 <p>
SECONDARY BACTERIAL INFECTION OF ACUTE BRONCHITIS AND ACUTE BACTERIAL
EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae,
Haemophilus Influenzae, (beta-lactamase positive and negative strains), and
Moraxella (Branhamella) Catarrhalis.  
 <p>
SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE 
 <p>
UNCOMPLICATED SKIN AND SKIN-STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Staphylococcus
Aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains) and Streptococcus Pyogenes.  
Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.  
 <p>
Culture and susceptibility testing should be performed when appropriate to
determine susceptibility of the causative organism to cefprozil.  
 <p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Cefprozil is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin
class of antibiotics.  
 <p>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <p>
BEFORE THERAPY WITH Cefprozil IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO
DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO
Cefprozil, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE
GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE
CROSS-SENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND 
MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN
ALLERGIC REACTION TO Cefprozil OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER
EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS
ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS
CLINICALLY INDICATED.  <p>
 
PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH NEARLY ALL ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS 
AND MAY RANGE FROM MILD TO LIFE-THREATENING. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO
CONSIDER THIS DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH DIARRHEA SUBSEQUENT TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS.  
 <p>
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and
may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by
Clostridium Difficile is a primary cause of &quot;antibiotic-associated colitis&quot;.  
 <p>
After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established,
therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous
colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to
severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and
electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug
effective against Clostridium Difficile.  <p>
 
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
Evaluation of renal status before and during therapy is recommended, especially 
in seriously ill patients. In patients with known or suspected renal impairment 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), careful clinical observation and appropriate
laboratory studies should be done prior to and during therapy. The total daily
dose of Cefprozil  should be reduced in these patients because high 
and/or prolonged plasma antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals 
from usual doses. Cephalosporins, including Cefprozil, should be given with
caution to patients receiving concurrent treatment with potent diuretics since
these agents are suspected of adversely affecting renal function.  
 <p>
Prolonged use of Cefprozil may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible
organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection
occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.  
 <p>
Cefprozil should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of
gastrointestinal disease particularly colitis.  
 <p>
Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with
cephalosporin antibiotics.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS <p>
 
Phenylketonurics: Cefprozil for oral suspension contains phenylalanine 28 mg per 5 
mL (1 teaspoon) constituted suspension for both the 125 mg/5mL and 250 mg/5mL
dosage forms.  <p>
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of
aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporin antibiotics. Concomitant
administration of probenecid doubled the AUC for cefprozil.  
 <p>
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
Cephalosporin antibiotics may produce a false positive reaction for glucose in
the urine with copper reduction tests (Benedict's or Fehling's solution or with 
Clinitest(R) (REF. 3) tablets), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria
(eg, Tes-Tape(R) (REF. 4)). A false negative reaction may occur in the
ferricyanide test for blood glucose. The presence of cefprozil in the blood
does not interfere with the assay of plasma or urine creatinine by the alkaline 
picrate method.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
No mutagenic potential of cefprozil was found in appropriate prokaryotic or
eukaryotic cells In Vitro or In Vivo. No In Vivo long-term studies have been
performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.  
 <p>
Reproductive studies revealed no impairment of fertility in animals.  
 <p>
PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS. PREGNANCY CATEGORY B 
 <p>
Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses 14 
7, and 0.7 times the maximum daily human dose (1000 mg) based upon
mg/M(square), and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to
cefprozil. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive
of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed.  
 <p>
LABOR AND DELIVERY 
 <p>
Cefprozil has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment
should only be given if clearly needed.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
It is not known whether cefprozil is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs 
are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cefprozil
 is administered to a nursing mother.  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 6 months have not been
established. However, accumulation of other cephalosporin antibiotics in
newborn infants (resulting from prolonged drug half-life in this age group) has 
been reported.  
 <p>
GERIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Healthy geriatric volunteers (&gt;/=65 years old) who received a single 1 g dose
of cefprozil had 35%-60% higher AUC and 40% lower renal clearance values when
compared to healthy adult volunteers 20-40 years of age. In clinical studies,
when geriatric patients received the usual recommended adult doses, clinical
efficacy and safety were acceptable and comparable to results in nongeriatric
adult patients.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of
aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporin antibiotics. Concomitant
administration of probenecid doubled the AUC for cefprozil.  
 <p>
(See Also PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
The adverse reactions to cefprozil are similar to those observed with other
orally administered cephalosporins. Cefprozil was usually well tolerated in
controlled clinical trials. Approximately 2% of patients discontinued cefprozil 
therapy due to adverse events.  
 <p>
The most common adverse effects observed in patients treated with cefprozil
are:  
 <p>
GASTROINTESTINAL--Diarrhea (2.9%), nausea (3.5%), vomiting (1%) and abdominal
pain (1%).  <p>
 
HEPATOBILIARY--Elevation of AST (SGOT) (2%), ALT (SGPT) (2%), alkaline
phosphatase (0.2%), and bilirubin values (&lt;0.1%). As with some penicillins and
some other cephalosporin antibiotics, cholestatic jaundice has been reported
rarely.  
 <p>
HYPERSENSITIVITY--Rash (0.9%), urticaria (0.1%). Such reactions have been
reported more frequently in children than in adults. Signs and symptoms usually 
occur a few days after initiation of therapy and subside within a few days
after cessation of therapy.  <p>
 
CNS--Dizziness (1%), Hyperactivity, headache, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, 
and somnolence have been reported rarely (&lt;1%). All were reversible.  
 <p>
HEMATOPOIETIC--Decreased leukocyte count (0.2%), eosinophilia (2.3%).  
 <p>
RENAL--Elevated BUN (0.1%), serum creatinine (0.1%).  
 <p>
OTHER--Diaper rash and superinfection (1.5%), genital pruritus and vaginitis
(1.6%).  <p>
 
CEPHALOSPORIN CLASS PARAGRAPH 
 <p>
In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in
patients treated with cefprozil, the following adverse reactions and altered
laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics:  
 <p>
Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal
necrolysis, serum-sickness like reaction, fever, renal dysfunction, toxic
nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, prolonged
prothrombin time, positive Coombs' test, elevated LDH, pancytopenia,
neutropenia agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia.  
 <p>
Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures,
particularly in patients with renal impairment, when the dosage was not
reduced. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE.) If seizures associated 
with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant
therapy can be given if clinically indicated.  <p>
 
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
Cefprozil is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. In case of severe overdosage, 
especially in patients with comprised renal function, hemodialysis will aid in
the removal of cefprozil from the body.

In a controlled clinical study of Acute Otitis Media performed in the United
States, where significant rates of beta-lactamase producing organisms were
found, cefprozil was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a
specific beta-lactamase inhibitor. In this study, using very strict
evaluability criteria and microbiologic and clinical response criteria at the
10-16 days post-therapy follow-up, the following presumptive bacterial

The incidence of adverse events, primarily diarrhea and rash,* were clinically
and statistically significantly higher in the control arm versus the cefprozil
arm.

STUDY TWO:  
 
In a controlled clinical study of acute otitis media performed in Europe,
cefprozil was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific 
beta-lactamase inhibitor. As expected in a European population, this study had
a lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms than usually seen in
U.S.  trials. In this study, using very strict evaluability criteria and
microbiologic and clinical response criteria at the 10-16 days post-therapy
follow-up, the following presumptive bacterial eradication/clinical cure
outcomes (ie, clinical success) were obtained:

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Nortriptyline is 1-Propanamine,3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo (a d)cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-
N-methyl-, hydrochloride. </p>

<p>C19H21N.HCl : Mol. wt. 299.8 </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The mechanism of mood elevation by tricyclic antidepressants is at present
unknown. Nortriptyline is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. It inhibits
the activity of such diverse agents as histamine, 5 hydroxytryptamine,
and acetylcholine. It increases the pressor effect of norepinephrine but
blocks the pressor response of phenethylamine. Studies suggest that Nortriptyline
interferes with the transport, release, and storage of catecholamines.
Operant conditioning techniques in rats and pigeons suggest that Nortriptyline
has a combination of stimulant and depressant properties. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of symptoms of depression.
Endogenous depressions are more likely to be alleviated than are other
depressive states. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>The use of Nortriptyline or other tricyclic antidepressants concurrently
with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Hyperpyretic
crises, severe convulsions, and fatalities have occurred when similar tricyclic
antidepressants were used in such combinations. It is advisable to have
discontinued the MAO inhibitor for at least two weeks before treatment
with Nortriptyline is started. Patients hypersensitive to Nortriptyline
should not be given the drug. </p>

<p>Cross-sensitivity between Nortriptyline and other dibenzazepines is
a possibility. </p>

<p>Nortriptyline is contraindicated during the acute recovery period after
myocardial infarction. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Patients with cardiovascular disease should be given Nortriptyline (nortriptyline
HCl) only under close supervision because of the tendency of the drug to
produce sinus tachycardia and to prolong the conduction time. Myocardial
infarction, arrhythmia, and strokes have occurred. The antihypertensive
action of guanethidine and similar agents may be blocked. Because of its
anticholinergic activity, Nortriptyline should be used with great caution
in patients who have glaucoma or a history of urinary retention. Patients
with a history of seizures should be followed closely when Nortriptyline
is administered, inasmuch as this drug is known to lower the convulsive
threshold. Great care is required if Nortriptyline (nortriptyline HCl)
is given to hyperthyroid patients or to those receiving thyroid medication
since cardiac arrhythmias may develop. </p>

<p>Nortriptyline may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required
for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or
driving a car; therefore, the patient should be warned accordingly. </p>

<p>Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy
may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased
suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories
of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. </p>

<p>The concomitant administration of quinidine and nortriptyline may result
in a significantly longer plasma half-life, higher AUC, and lower clearance
of nortriptyline. </p>

<p>Use In Pregnancy--Safe use of Nortriptyline during pregnancy and lactation
has not been established; therefore, when the drug is administered to pregnant
patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the potential
benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards. Animal reproduction
studies have yielded inconclusive results. </p>

<p>Use In Children--This drug is not recommended for use in children, since
safety and effectiveness in the pediatric age group have not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>The use of Nortriptyline in schizophrenic patients may result in an
exacerbation of the psychosis or may activate latent schizophrenic symptoms.
If the drug is given to overactive or agitated patients, increased anxiety
and agitation may occur. In manic-depressive patients, Nortriptyline may
cause symptoms of the manic phase to emerge. </p>

<p>Administration of reserpine during therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant
has been shown to produce a &quot;stimulating&quot; effect in some depressed
patients. </p>

<p>Troublesome patient hostility may be aroused by the use of Nortriptyline
. Epileptiform seizures may accompany its administration, as is true of
other drugs of its class. </p>

<p>Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required
when Nortriptyline is used with other anticholinergic drugs and sympathomimetic
drugs. </p>

<p>Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants
can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma concentrations
of the tricyclic antidepressant. The patient should be informed that the
response to alcohol may be exaggerated. </p>

<p>When it is essential, the drug may be administered with electroconvulsive
therapy, although the hazards may be increased. Discontinue the drug for
several days, if possible, prior to elective surgery. </p>

<p>The possibility of a suicidal attempt by a depressed patient remains
after the initiation of treatment; in this regard, it is important that
the least possible quantity of drug be dispensed at any given time. </p>

<p>Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported.
</p>

<p>A case of significant hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic
patient maintained on chlorpropamide (250 mg/day), after the addition of
nortriptyline (125 mg/day). </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Note: Included in the following list are a few adverse reactions that
have not been reported with this specific drug. However, the pharmacologic
similarities among the tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each
of the reactions be considered when nortriptyline is administered. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular--Hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitation,
myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart block, stroke. </p>

<p>Psychiatric--Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations
disorientation, delusions; anxiety, restlessness, agitation; insomnia,
panic, nightmares; hypomania; exacerbation of psychosis. </p>

<p>Neurologic--Numbness, tingling, paresthesias of extremities; incoordination,
ataxia, tremors; peripheral neuropathy; extrapyramidal symptoms; seizures,
alteration in EEG patterns; tinnitus. </p>

<p>Anticholinergic--Dry mouth and, rarely, associated sublingual adenitis;
blurred vision, disturbance of accommodation, mydriasis; constipation,
paralytic ileus; urinary retention, delayed micturition, dilation of the
urinary tract. </p>

<p>Allergic--Skin rash, petechiae, urticaria, itching, photosensitization
(avoid excessive exposure to sunlight); edema (general or of face and tongue),
drug fever, cross-sensitivity with other tricyclic drugs. </p>

<p>Hematologic--Bone marrow depression, including agranulocytosis; eosinophilia;
purpura; thrombocytopenia. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal--Nausea and vomiting, anorexia, epigastric distress,
diarrhea, peculiar taste, stomatitis, abdominal cramps, blacktongue. </p>

<p>Endocrine--Gynecomastia in the male, breast enlargement and galactorrhea
in the female; increased or decreased libido, impotence; testicular swelling;
elevation or depression of blood sugar levels; syndrome of inappropriate
ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion. </p>

<p>Other--Jaundice (simulating obstructive), altered liver function; weight
gain or loss; perspiration; flushing; urinary frequency, nocturia; drowsiness,
dizziness, weakness, fatigue; headache; parotid swelling; alopecia. </p>

<p>Withdrawal Symptoms--Though these are not indicative of addiction, abrupt
cessation of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache,
and malaise. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>Toxic overdosage may result in confusion, restlessness, agitation, vomiting,
hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, hyperactive reflexes, tachycardia, ECG evidence
of impaired conduction, shock, congestive heart failure, stupor, coma,
and CNS stimulation with convulsions followed by respiratory depression.
Deaths have occurred following overdosage with drugs of this class. </p>

<p>No specific antidote is known. General supportive measures are indicated,
with gastric lavage. Respiratory assistance is apparently the most effective
measure when indicated. The use of CNS depressants may worsen the prognosis.
</p>

<p>The administration of barbiturates for control of convulsions alleviates
an increase in the cardiac work load but should be undertaken with caution
to avoid potentiation of respiratory depression. </p>

<p>Intramuscular paraldehyde or diazepam provides anticonvulsant activity
with less respiratory depression than do the barbiturates; diazepam seems
to be preferred. </p>

<p>The use of digitalis and/or physostigmine may be considered in case
of serious cardiovascular abnormalities or cardiac failure. </p>

<p>The value of dialysis has not been established. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Nortriptyline is not recommended for children. </p>

<p>Nortriptyline is administered orally in the form of capsules or liquid.
Lower than usual dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents.
Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients than for hospitalized
patients who will be under close supervision. The physician should initiate
dosage at a low level and increase it gradually, noting carefully the clinical
response and any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance
medication may be required for a longer period of time at the lowest dose
that will maintain remission. </p>

<p>If a patient develops minor side effects, the dosage should be reduced.
The drug should be discontinued promptly if adverse effects of a serious
nature or allergic manifestations occur. </p>

<p>Usual Adult Dose--25 mg three or four times daily; dosage should begin
at a low level and be increased as required. As an alternate regimen, the
total daily dosage may be given once a day. When doses above 100 mg daily
are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and
maintained in the optimum range of 50-150 ng/mL. Doses above 150 mg/day
are not recommended. </p>

<p>Elderly And Adolescent Patients--30-50 mg/day, in divided doses, or
the total daily dosage may be given once a day. </p>

 <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION 
</b> <p>
Pravastatin  is one of a new class of lipid-lowering
compounds, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which reduce cholesterol
biosynthesis. These agents are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the early
rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, conversion of HMG-CoA to
mevalonate.  
 <p>
Pravastatin sodium is designated chemically as 1-Naphthalene-heptanoic acid, 1
2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-beta,o,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-8-(2-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-,
monosodium salt, (1S-(1alpha(betaS*,oS*),2alpha,6alpha,8beta(R*),8aalpha))-.  
 <p>
Pravastatin sodium is an odorless, white to off-white, fine or crystalline
powder. It is a relatively polar hydrophilic compound with a partition
coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.59 at a pH of 7.0. It is soluble in methanol
and water (&gt;300 mg/mL), slightly soluble in isopropanol, and practically
insoluble in acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform, and ether.  
 <p>
<a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
</b> <p>
MECHANISM OF ACTION 
 <p>
Cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream circulate as part of
lipoprotein complexes. These complexes can be separated by density
ultracentrifugation into high (HDL), intermediate (IDL), low (LDL), and very
low (VLDL) density lipoprotein fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol
synthesized in the liver are incorporated into very low density lipoproteins
(VLDLs) and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. In a
series of subsequent steps, VLDLs are transformed into intermediate density
lipoproteins (IDLs), and cholesterol-rich low density lipoproteins (LDLs). High 
density lipoproteins (HDLs), containing apolipoprotein A, are hypothesized to
participate in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues back to the
liver.  
 <p>
Pravastatin produces its lipid-lowering effect in two ways. First, as a
consequence of its reversible inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, it
effects modest reductions in intracellular pools of cholesterol. This results
in an increase in the number of LDL-receptors on cell surfaces and enhanced
receptor-mediated catabolism and clearance of circulating LDL. Second,
pravastatin inhibits LDL production by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of VLDL,
the LDL precursor.  
 <p>
Clinical and pathologic studies have shown that elevated levels of total
cholesterol (Total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and
apolipoprotein B (a membrane transport complex for LDL) promote human
atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and its 
transport complex, apolipoprotein A, are associated with the development of
atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C
and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C. In multicenter clinical trials 
those pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic interventions that simultaneously
lowered LDL-C and increased HDL-C reduced the rate of cardiovascular events
(both fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions). In both normal volunteers and 
patients with hypercholesterolemia, treatment with Pravastatin reduced Total-C,
LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B. Pravastatin also modestly reduced VLDL-C and TG
while producing increases of variable magnitude in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A.
The effects of pravastatin on Lp(a), fibrinogen, and certain other independent
biochemical risk markers for coronary heart disease are unknown. The effect of
pravastatin-induced changes in lipoprotein levels on the evolution of
atherosclerosis is also unknown. Although pravastatin is relatively more
hydrophilic than other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the effect of relative
hydrophilicity, if any, on either efficacy or safety has not been established.  
 <p>
PHARMACOKINETICS/METABOLISM 
 <p>
Pravastatin  is administered orally in the active form. In
clinical pharmacology studies in man, pravastatin is rapidly absorbed, with
peak plasma levels of parent compound attained 1 to 1.5 hours following
ingestion.  Based on urinary recovery of radiolabeled drug, the average oral
absorption of pravastatin is 34% and absolute bioavailability is 17%. While the 
presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces systemic bioavailability 
the lipid- lowering effects of the drug are similar whether taken with, or 1
hour prior to, meals.  
 <p>
Pravastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver (extraction
ratio 0.66), which is its primary site of action, and the primary site of
cholesterol synthesis and of LDL-C clearance. In Vitro studies demonstrated
that pravastatin is transported into hepatocytes with substantially less uptake 
into other cells. In view of pravastatin's apparently extensive first-pass
hepatic metabolism, plasma levels may not necessarily correlate perfectly with
lipid- lowering efficacy. Pravastatin plasma concentrations (including: area
under the concentration-time curve (AUC), peak (Cmax), and steady-state minimum 
(Cmin)) are directly proportional to administered dose. Systemic
bioavailability of pravastatin administered following a bedtime dose was
decreased 60% compared to that following an AM dose. Despite this decrease in
systemic bioavailability, the efficacy of pravastatin administered once daily
in the evening, although not statistically significant, was marginally more
effective than that after a morning dose. This finding of lower systemic
bioavailability suggests greater hepatic extraction of the drug following the
evening dose. Steady-state AUCs, Cmax and Cmin plasma concentrations showed no
evidence of pravastatin accumulation following once or twice daily
administration of Pravastatin tablets.  Approximately 50% of the circulating drug 
is bound to plasma proteins. Following single dose administration of 14C
pravastatin, the elimination half-life (t1/2) for total radioactivity
(pravastatin plus metabolites) in humans is 77 hours.  
 <p>
Pravastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, has variable
bioavailability. The coefficient of variation, based on between-subject
variability, was 50% to 60% for AUC.  
 <p>
Approximately 20% of a radiolabeled oral dose is excreted in urine and 70% in
the feces. After intravenous administration of radiolabeled pravastatin to
normal volunteers, approximately 47% of total body clearance was via renal
excretion and 53% by non-renal routes (i.e., biliary excretion and
biotransformation). Since there are dual routes of elimination, the potential
exists both for compensatory excretion by the alternate route as well as for
accumulation of drug and/or metabolites in patients with renal or hepatic
insufficiency.  
 <p>
In a study comparing the kinetics of pravastatin in patients with biopsy
confirmed cirrhosis (N=7) and normal subjects (N=7), the mean AUC varied 18
fold in cirrhotic patients and 5-fold in healthy subjects. Similarly, the peak
pravastatin values varied 47-fold for cirrhotic patients compared to 6-fold for 
healthy subjects.  
 <p>
Biotransformation pathways elucidated for pravastatin include: (a)
isomerization to 6-epi pravastatin and the 3alpha-hydroxyisomer of pravastatin
(SQ 31,906), (b) enzymatic ring hydroxylation to SQ 31,945, (c)omega-1
oxidation of the ester side chain, (d) beta-oxidation of the carboxy side chain 
(e) ring oxidation followed by aromatization, (f) oxidation of a hydroxyl
group to a keto group, and (g) conjugation. The major degradation product is
the 3alpha-hydroxy isomeric metabolite, which has one-tenth to one-fortieth the 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound.  
 <p>
CLINICAL STUDIES 
 <p>
Pravastatin  is highly effective in reducing Total-C and LDL
C in patients with heterozygous familial, presumed familial combined, and non-
familial (non-FH) forms of primary hypercholesterolemia. A therapeutic response 
is seen within 1 week, and the maximum response usually is achieved within 4
weeks. This response is maintained during extended periods of therapy.  
 <p>
A single daily dose administered in the evening (the recommended dosing) is as
effective as the same total daily dose given twice a day. Once daily
administration in the evening appears to be marginally more effective than once 
daily administration in the morning, perhaps because hepatic cholesterol is
synthesized mainly at night. In multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
studies of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, treatment with
pravastatin in daily doses ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg consistently and
significantly decreased Total-C, LDL-C, and Total-C/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C
ratios; modestly decreased VLDL-C and plasma TG levels; and produced increases
in HDL-C of variable magnitude.  <p><pre>

In another clinical trial, patients treated with pravastatin in combination
with cholestyramine (70% of patients were taking cholestyramine 20 or 24 g per
day) had reductions equal to or greater than 50% in LDL-C. Furthermore,
pravastatin attenuated cholestyramine-induced increases in TG levels (which are 
themselves of uncertain clinical significance).

<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
</b> <p>
Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be considered a component of multiple 
risk factor intervention in those individuals at increased risk for
atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin
 is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of
elevated total and LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with primary
hypercholesterolemia (Type 11a and 11b) (REF. 1) when the response to a diet
restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol has not been adequate.  
 <p>
Prior to initiating therapy with pravastatin, secondary causes for
hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism 
nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug
therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to
measure Total-C, HDL-C, and TG. For patients with triglycerides (TG) &lt;400 mg/dL 
(&lt;4.5 mmol/ L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation:  
 <p>
LDL-C = Total-C - HDL-C - 1/5 TG 
 <p>
For TG levels &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less accurate and LDL
C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In many
hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated
Total-C. In such cases, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are not indicated\.  Lipid 
determinations should be performed at intervals of no less than four weeks and
dosage adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

As with other lipid-lowering therapy, Pravastatin  is not
indicated when hypercholesterolemia is due to hyperalphalipoproteinemia
(elevated HDL-C). The efficacy of pravastatin has not been evaluated in

as their primary lipid abnormality.  
 
<p>July 8, 1996 -- For the first time, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)
has cleared a cholesterol-lowering medication, pravastatin
sodium to help
prevent a first heart attack and reduce death from cardiovascular disease
in patients with elevated
cholesterol who are at risk of a first heart attack.
<p>
<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</b> <p>
Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.  
 <p>
Active liver disease or unexplained, persistent elevations in liver function
tests (see WARNINGS).  
                           <p>
Pregnancy And Lactation.   Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and
discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little
impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. 
Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential
components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell
membranes). Since HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis
and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from 
cholesterol, they may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. 
Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy
and in nursing mothers. PRAVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF
CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant
while taking this class of drug, therapy should be discontinued and the patient 
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
 <p>
<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 
</b> <p>
LIVER ENZYMES 
 <p>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have
been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Increases of
serum transaminase (ALT, AST) values to more than 3 times the upper limit of
normal occurring on 2 or more (not necessarily sequential) occasions have been
reported in 1.3% of patients treated with pravastatin in the US over an average 
period of 18 months. These abnormalities were not associated with cholestasis
and did not appear to be related to treatment duration. In those patients in
whom these abnormalities were believed to be related to pravastatin and who
were discontinued from therapy, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to
pretreatment levels. These biochemical findings are usually asymptomatic
although worldwide experience indicates that anorexia, weakness, and/or
abdominal pain may also be present in rare patients.  
 <p>
As with other lipid-lowering agents, liver function tests should be performed
during therapy with pravastatin. SERUM AMINOTRANSFERASES, INCLUDING ALT (SGPT), 
SHOULD BE MONITORED BEFORE TREATMENT BEGINS, EVERY SIX WEEKS FOR THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS, EVERY EIGHT WEEKS DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRST YEAR, AND
PERIODICALLY THEREAFTER (E.G., AT ABOUT SIX-MONTH INTERVALS). SPECIAL ATTENTION 
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO PATIENTS WHO DEVELOP INCREASED TRANSAMINASE LEVELS. LIVER
FUNCTION TESTS SHOULD BE REPEATED TO CONFIRM AN ELEVATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY
MONITORED AT MORE FREQUENT INTERVALS. If increases in AST and ALT equal or
exceed three times the upper limit of normal and persist, then therapy should
be discontinued. Persistence of significant aminotransferase elevations
following discontinuation of therapy may warrant consideration of liver biopsy. 
 <p>
Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are
contraindications to the use of pravastatin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Caution
should be exercised when pravastatin is administered to patients with a history 
of liver disease or heavy alcohol ingestion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 
Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism). Such patients should be closely monitored,
started at the lower end of the recommended dosing range, and titrated to the
desired therapeutic effect.  
 <p>
SKELETAL MUSCLE 
 <p>
RHABDOMYOLYSIS WITH RENAL DYSFUNCTION SECONDARY TO MYOGLOBINURIA HAS BEEN
REPORTED WITH PRAVASTATIN AND OTHER DRUGS IN THIS CLASS. Uncomplicated myalgia
has been reported in pravastatin-treated patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). 
Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with
increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the
upper limit of normal was reported to be possibly due to pravastatin in only
one patient in clinical trials (&lt;0.1%). Myopathy should be considered in any
patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked
elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained
muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or
fever.  PRAVASTATIN THERAPY SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED IF MARKEDLY ELEVATED CPK
LEVELS OCCUR OR MYOPATHY IS DIAGNOSED OR SUSPECTED. PRAVASTATIN THERAPY SHOULD
ALSO BE TEMPORARILY WITHHELD IN ANY PATIENT EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE OR SERIOUS
CONDITION PREDISPOSING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENAL FAILURE SECONDARY TO
RHABDOMYOLYSIS, E.G., SEPSIS; HYPOTENSION; MAJOR SURGERY; TRAUMA; SEVERE
METABOLIC, ENDOCRINE, OR ELECTROLYTE DISORDERS; OR UNCONTROLLED EPILEPSY.  
 <p>
The risk of myopathy during treatment with another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
lovastatin is increased if therapy with either cyclosporine, gemfibrozil,
erythromycin, or niacin is administered concurrently. There is no experience
with the use of pravastatin together with cyclosporine. Myopathy has not been
observed in clinical trials involving small numbers of patients who were
treated with pravastatin together with niacin. One trial of limited size
involving combined therapy with pravastatin and gemfibrozil showed a trend
toward more frequent CPK elevations and patient withdrawals due to
musculoskeletal symptoms in the group receiving combined treatment as compared
with the groups receiving placebo, gemfibrozil, or pravastatin monotherapy.
Myopathy was not reported in this trial (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).
One patient developed myopathy when clofibrate was added to a previously well
tolerated regimen of pravastatin; the myopathy resolved when clofibrate therapy 
was stopped and pravastatin treatment continued. THE USE OF FIBRATES ALONE MAY
OCCASIONALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MYOPATHY. THE COMBINED USE OF PRAVASTATIN AND
FIBRATES SHOULD GENERALLY BE AVOIDED.  
 <p>
<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 
</b> <p>
GENERAL 
 <p>
Pravastatin may elevate creatine phosphokinase and transaminase levels (see
ADVERSE REACTIONS). This should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
chest pain in a patient on therapy with pravastatin.  
 <p>
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin has not been evaluated in 
patients with rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In this group of
patients, it has been reported that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are less
effective because the patients lack functional LDL receptors.  
 <p>
Renal Insufficiency. A single 20 mg oral dose of pravastatin was administered
to 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (as determined by
creatinine clearance). No effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of
pravastatin or its 3alpha-hydroxy isomeric metabolite (SQ 31,906). A small
increase was seen in mean AUC values and half-life (t1/2) for the inactive
enzymatic ring hydroxylation metabolite (SQ 31,945). Given this small sample
size, the dosage administered, and the degree of individual variability,
patients with renal impairment who are receiving pravastatin should be closely
monitored.  
 <p>
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS 
 <p>
Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.  
 <p>
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 <p>
Immunosuppressive Drugs, Gemfibrozil, Niacin (Nicotinic Acid), Erythromycin:
See WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle.  
 <p>
Antipyrine: Since concomitant administration of pravastatin had no effect on
the clearance of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized via the
same hepatic cytochrome isozymes are not expected.  
 <p>
Cholestyramine/Colestipol: Concomitant administration resulted in an
approximately 40 to 50% decrease in the mean AUC of pravastatin. However, when
pravastatin was administered 1 hour before or 4 hours after cholestyramine or 1 
hour before colestipol and a standard meal, there was no clinically significant 
decrease in bioavailability or therapeutic effect. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION: Concomitant Therapy.) 
 <p>
Warfarin: In a study involving 10 healthy male subjects given pravastatin and
warfarin concomitantly for 6 days, bioavailability parameters at steady state
for pravastatin (parent compound) were not altered. Pravastatin did not alter
the plasma protein-binding of warfarin. Concomitant dosing did increase the AUC 
and Cmax of warfarin but did not produce any changes in its anticoagulant
action (i.e., no increase was seen in mean prothrombin time after 6 days of
concomitant therapy). However, bleeding and extreme prolongation of prothrombin 
time has been reported with another drug in this class. Patients receiving
warfarin-type anticoagulants should have their prothrombin times closely
monitored when pravastatin is initiated or the dosage of pravastatin is
changed.  
 <p>
Cimetidine: The AUC 0-12hr for pravastatin when given with cimetidine was not
significantly different from the AUC for pravastatin when given alone. A
significant difference was observed between the AUC's for pravastatin when
given with cimetidine compared to when administered with antacid.  
 <p>
Digoxin: In a crossover trial involving 18 healthy male subjects given
pravastatin and digoxin concurrently for 9 days, the bioavailability parameters 
of digoxin were not affected. The AUC of pravastatin tended to increase, but
the overall bioavailability of pravastatin plus its metabolites SQ 31,906 and
SQ 31,945 was not altered.  
 <p>
Gemfibrozil: In a crossover study in 20 healthy male volunteers given
concomitant single doses of pravastatin and gemfibrozil, there was a
significant decrease in urinary excretion and protein binding of pravastatin.
In addition, there was a significant increase in AUC, Cmax, and Tmax for the
pravastatin metabolite SQ 31,906. Combination therapy with pravastatin and
gemfibrozil is generally not recommended.  
 <p>
In interaction studies with Aspirin, Antacids (1 hour prior to Pravastatin),
Cimetidine, Nicotinic Acid, or Probucol, no statistically significant
differences in bioavailability were seen when Pravastatin 
was administered.  
 <p>
Other Drugs: During clinical trials, no noticeable drug interactions were
reported when Pravastatin was added to: diuretics, antihypertensives, digitalis,
converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, or
nitroglycerin.  
 <p>
ENDOCRINE FUNCTION 
 <p>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower
circulating cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal
or gonadal steroid hormone production. Results of clinical trials with
pravastatin in males and post-menopausal females were inconsistent with regard
to possible effects of the drug on basal steroid hormone levels. In a study of
21 males, the mean testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin was
significantly reduced (p&lt;0.004) after 16 weeks of treatment with 40 mg of
pravastatin. However, the percentage of patients showing a &gt;/=50% rise in
plasma testosterone after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation did not
change significantly after therapy in these patients. The effects of HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors on spermatogenesis and fertility have not been studied in
adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, of pravastatin on the
pituitary- gonadal axis in pre-menopausal females are unknown. Patients treated 
with pravastatin who display clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction should
be evaluated appropriately. Caution should be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitor or other agent used to lower cholesterol levels is administered to
patients also receiving other drugs (e.g., ketoconazole, spironolactone,
cimetidine) that may diminish the levels or activity of steroid hormones.  
 <p>
CNS TOXICITY 
 <p>
CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhage and edema and
mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, were seen in dogs treated 
with pravastatin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced a plasma drug
level about 50 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking 40
mg/day.  Similar CNS vascular lesions have been observed with several other
drugs in this class.  
 <p>
A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration
(Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs
in a dose-dependent fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean 
plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans
taking the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory
activity). This same drug also produced vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like
degeneration and retinal ganglion cell chromatolysis in dogs treated for 14
weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose which resulted in a mean plasma drug level
similar to that seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose.  
 <p>
CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY 
 <p>
In a 2-year study in rats fed pravastatin at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg body 
weight, there was an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males
at the highest dose (p &lt;0.01). Although rats were given up to 125 times the
human dose (HD) on a mg/kg body weight basis, their serum drug levels were only 
6 to 10 times higher than those measured in humans given 40 mg pravastatin as
measured by AUC.  
 <p>
The oral administration of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (producing plasma drug levels
approximately 0.5 to 5.0 times the human drug levels at 40 mg) of pravastatin
to mice for 22 months resulted in a statistically significant increase in the
incidence of malignant lymphomas in treated females when all treatment groups
were pooled and compared to controls (p &lt;0.05). The incidence was not dose-
related and male mice were not affected.  
 <p>
A chemically similar drug in this class was administered to mice for 72 weeks
at 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg body weight, which resulted in mean serum drug levels 
approximately 3, 15, and 33 times higher than the mean human serum drug
concentration (as total inhibitory activity) after a 40 mg oral dose. Liver
carcinomas were significantly increased in high-dose females and mid- and high- 
dose males, with a maximum incidence of 90 percent in males. The incidence of
adenomas of the liver was significantly increased in mid- and high-dose
females.  Drug treatment also significantly increased the incidence of lung
adenomas in mid- and high-dose males and females. Adenomas of the eye Harderian 
gland (a gland of the eye of rodents) were significantly higher in high-dose
mice than in controls.  
 <p>
No evidence of mutagenicity was observed In Vitro, with or without rat-liver
metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests, using
mutant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium or Escherichia Coli; a forward
mutation assay in L5178YTK +/- mouse lymphoma cells; a chromosomal aberration
test in hamster cells; and a gene conversion assay using Saccharomyces
Cerevisiae. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in either a
dominant lethal test in mice or a micronucleus test in mice.  
 <p>
In a study in rats, with daily doses up to 500 mg/kg, pravastatin did not
produce any adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance. 
However, in a study with another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, there was
decreased fertility in male rats treated for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body weight,
although this effect was not observed in a subsequent fertility study when this 
same dose was administered for 11 weeks (the entire cycle of spermatogenesis,
including epididymal maturation). In rats treated with this same reductase
inhibitor at 180 mg/kg/day, seminiferous tubule degeneration (necrosis and loss 
of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed. Although not seen with pravastatin,
two similar drugs in this class caused drug-related testicular atrophy,
decreased spermatogenesis, spermatocytic degeneration, and giant cell formation 
in dogs. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear.  
 <p>
PREGNANCY 
 <p>
PREGNANCY CATEGORY X.  
 <p>
See CONTRAINDICATIONS.  
 <p>
Safety in pregnant women has not been established. Pravastatin was not
teratogenic in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily or in rabbits at doses of
up to 50 mg/kg daily. These doses resulted in 20X (rabbit) or 240X (rat) the
human exposure based on surface area (mg/meter2). However, in studies with
another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, skeletal malformations were observed in
rats and mice. There has been one report of severe congenital bony deformity,
tranceo- esophageal fistula, and anal atresia (Vater association) in a baby
born to a woman who took another HMG-CoA reductase, inhibitor with
dextroamphetamine sulfate during the first trimester of pregnancy. Pravastatin
 should be administered to women of child-bearing potential 
only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed
of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking Pravastatin
, it should be discontinued and the patient advised again
as to the potential hazards to the fetus.  
 <p>
NURSING MOTHERS 
 <p>
A small amount of pravastatin is excreted in human breast milk. Because of the
potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking
Pravastatin  should not nurse (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).  
 <p>
PEDIATRIC USE 
 <p>
Safety and effectiveness in individuals less than 18 years old have not been
established. Hence, treatment in patients less than 18 years old is not
recommended at this time.  
 <p>
<a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Immunosuppressive Drugs, Gemfibrozil, Niacin (Nicotinic Acid), Erythromycin:
See WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle.  
 <p>
Antipyrine: Since concomitant administration of pravastatin had no effect on
the clearance of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized via the
same hepatic cytochrome isozymes are not expected.  
 <p>
Cholestyramine/Colestipol: Concomitant administration resulted in an
approximately 40 to 50% decrease in the mean AUC of pravastatin. However, when
pravastatin was administered 1 hour before or 4 hours after cholestyramine or 1 
hour before colestipol and a standard meal, there was no clinically significant 
decrease in bioavailability or therapeutic effect. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION: Concomitant Therapy.) 
 <p>
Warfarin: In a study involving 10 healthy male subjects given pravastatin and
warfarin concomitantly for 6 days, bioavailability parameters at steady state
for pravastatin (parent compound) were not altered. Pravastatin did not alter
the plasma protein-binding of warfarin. Concomitant dosing did increase the AUC 
and Cmax of warfarin but did not produce any changes in its anticoagulant
action (i.e., no increase was seen in mean prothrombin time after 6 days of
concomitant therapy). However, bleeding and extreme prolongation of prothrombin 
time has been reported with another drug in this class. Patients receiving
warfarin-type anticoagulants should have their prothrombin times closely
monitored when pravastatin is initiated or the dosage of pravastatin is
changed.  
 <p>
Cimetidine: The AUC 0-12hr for pravastatin when given with cimetidine was not
significantly different from the AUC for pravastatin when given alone. A
significant difference was observed between the AUC's for pravastatin when
given with cimetidine compared to when administered with antacid.  
 <p>
Digoxin: In a crossover trial involving 18 healthy male subjects given
pravastatin and digoxin concurrently for 9 days, the bioavailability parameters 
of digoxin were not affected. The AUC of pravastatin tended to increase, but
the overall bioavailability of pravastatin plus its metabolites SQ 31,906 and
SQ 31,945 was not altered.  
 <p>
Gemfibrozil: In a crossover study in 20 healthy male volunteers given
concomitant single doses of pravastatin and gemfibrozil, there was a
significant decrease in urinary excretion and protein binding of pravastatin.
In addition, there was a significant increase in AUC, Cmax, and Tmax for the
pravastatin metabolite SQ 31,906. Combination therapy with pravastatin and
gemfibrozil is generally not recommended.  
 <p>
In interaction studies with Aspirin, Antacids (1 hour prior to Pravastatin),
Cimetidine, Nicotinic Acid, or Probucol, no statistically significant
differences in bioavailability were seen when Pravastatin 
was administered.  
 <p>
Other Drugs: During clinical trials, no noticeable drug interactions were
reported when Pravastatin was added to: diuretics, antihypertensives, digitalis,
converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, or
nitroglycerin.  
 <p>
(See Also PRECAUTIONS).  
 <p>
<a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS 
</b> <p>
Pravastatin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have usually been
mild and transient. In 4-month long placebo-controlled trials, 1.7% of
pravastatin-treated patients and 1.2% of placebo-treated patients were
discontinued from treatment because of adverse experiences attributed to study
drug therapy; this difference was not statistically significant. In long-term
studies, the most common reasons for discontinuation were asymptomatic serum
transaminase increases and mild, non-specific gastrointestinal complaints. 
During clinical trials the overall incidence of adverse events in the elderly
was not different than the incidence observed in younger patients.

</font></pre><p>The following effects have been reported with drugs in this class; not all the
effects listed below have necessarily been associated with pravastatin therapy: <p>
 
Skeletal: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgia.  
 <p>
Neurological: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of
taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, vertigo,
memory loss, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy,
anxieth, insomnia, depression.  
 <p>
Hypersensitivity Reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been
reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features: 
anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia
rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia 
positive ANA, ESR increase, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia,
photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal
necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  
 <p>
Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active hepatitis,
cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, and, rarely, cirrhosis, fulminant
hepatic necrosis, and hepatoma; anorexia, vomiting.  
 <p>
Skin: alopecia.  
 <p>
Reproductive: gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction.  
 <p>
Eye: progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia.  
 <p>
LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES: elevated transaminase alkaline phosphatase, and
bilirubin; thyroid function abnormalities.  
 <p>
LABORATORY TEST ABNORMALITIES 
 <p>
Increases in serum transaminase (ALT, AST) values and CPK have been observed
(see WARNINGS).  
 <p>
Transient, asymptomatic eosinophilia has been reported. Eosinophil counts
usually returned to normal despite continued therapy. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
and leukopenia have been reported with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.  
 <p>
CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 <p>
Pravastatin has been administered concurrently with cholestyramine, colestipol, 
nicotinic acid, probucol and gemfibrozil. Preliminary data suggest that the
addition of either probucol or gemfibrozil to therapy with lovastatin or
pravastatin is NOT associated with greater reduction in LDL-cholesterol than
that achieved with lovastatin or pravastatin alone. No adverse reactions unique 
to the combination or in addition to those previously reported for each drug
alone have been reported. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute
renal failure) have been reported when another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was
used in combination with immunosuppressive drugs, gemfibrozil, erythromycin, or 
lipid-lowering doses of nicotinic acid. Concomitant therapy with HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors and these agents is generally not recommended. (See
WARNINGS: SKELETAL MUSCLE and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) 
 <p>
<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 
</b> <p>
There have been no reports of overdoses with pravastatin.  
 <p>
Should an accidental overdose occur, treat symptomatically and institute
supportive measures as required.  
 <p>
<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
</b> <p>
Prior to initiating Pravastatin , the patient should be
placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet (AHA Phase I or NCEP Step 1) for 
a minimum of 3 to 6 months, depending upon the severity of the lipid elevation. 
Dietary therapy should be continued during treatment.  
 <p>
The recommended starting dose is 10 or 20 mg once daily at bedtime. In primary
hypercholesterolemic patients with a history of significant significant renal
or hepatic dysfunction, and in the elderly, a starting dose of 10 mg daily at
bedtime is recommended. Pravastatin may be taken without regard to meals.  
 <p>
Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid 
determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according
to the patient's response to therapy and established treatment guidelines. The
recommended dosage range is generally 10 to 40 mg administered once a day at
bedtime. In the elderly, maximum reductions in LDL-cholesterol may be achieved
with daily doses of 20 mg or less.  
 <p>
CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 <p>
The lipid-lowering effects of Pravastatin  on total and LDL
cholesterol are enhanced when combined with a bile-acid-binding resin. When
administering a bile-acid-binding resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) and
pravastatin, Pravastatin should be given either 1 hour or more before or at least 
4 hours following the resin. See also ADVERSE REACTIONS: CONCOMITANT THERAPY.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Gemfibrozil is a lipid regulating agent. The empirical formula is C15H22O3
and the molecular weight is 250.35; the solubility in water and acid is
0.0019% and in dilute base it is greater than 1%. The melting point is
58 deg-61 deg C. Gemfibrozil is a white solid which is stable under ordinary
conditions. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>Gemfibrozil is a lipid regulating agent which decreases serum triglycerides
and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and increases high
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. While modest decreases in total
and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may be observed with Gemfibrozil
therapy, treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides due to Type
IV hyperlipoproteinemia often results in a rise in LDL-cholesterol. LDL
cholesterol levels in Type IIb patients with elevations of both serum LDL
cholesterol and triglycerides are, in general, minimally affected by Gemfibrozil
treatment; however, Gemfibrozil usually raises HDL-cholesterol significantly
in this group. Gemfibrozil increases levels of high density lipoprotein
(HDL) subfractions HDL2 and HDL3, as well as apolipoproteins AI and AII.
Epidemiological studies have shown that both low HDL-cholesterol and high
LDL-cholesterol are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.
</p>

<p>In the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study (REF.
1,2), in which 4081 male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 were studied
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, Gemfibrozil
therapy was associated with significant reductions in total plasma triglycerides
and a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moderate
reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol
were observed for the Gemfibrozil treatment group as a whole, but the lipid
response was heterogeneous, especially among different Fredrickson types.
The study involved subjects with serum non-HDL-cholesterol of over 200
mg/dL and no previous history of coronary heart disease. Over the 5-year
study period, the Gemfibrozil group experienced a 1.4% absolute (34% relative)
reduction in the rate of serious coronary events (sudden cardiac deaths
plus fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions) compared to placebo, p
= 0.04 (see Table I). There was a 37% relative reduction in the rate of
nonfatal myocardial infarction compared to placebo, equivalent to a treatment-related
difference of 13.1 events per thousand persons. Deaths from any cause during
the double-blind portion of the study totaled 44 (2.2%) in the Gemfibrozil
randomization group and 43 (2.1%) in the placebo group. </p>

<p>Among Fredrickson types, during the 5-year double-blind portion of the
primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, the greatest
reduction in the incidence of serious coronary events occurred in Type
IIb patients who had elevations of both LDL-cholesterol and total plasma
triglycerides. This subgroup of Type IIb gemfibrozil group patients had
a lower mean HDL cholesterol level at baseline than the Type IIa subgroup
that had elevations of LDL-cholesterol and normal plasma triglycerides.
The mean increase in HDL cholesterol among the Type IIb patients in this
study was 12.6% compared to placebo. The mean change in LDL-cholesterol
among Type IIb patients was -4.1% with Gemfibrozil compared to a rise of
3.9% in the placebo subgroup. The Type IIb subjects in the Helsinki Heart
Study had 26 fewer coronary events per thousand persons over 5 years in
the gemfibrozil group compared to placebo. The difference in coronary events
was substantially greater between Gemfibrozil and placebo for that subgroup
of patients with the triad of LDL-cholesterol &gt;175 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol),
triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL (&gt;2.2 mmol), and HDL-cholesterol &lt;35
mg/dL (&lt;0.90 mmol) (see Table I). </p>

<p>Further information is available from a 3.5 year (8.5 year cumulative)
follow up of all subjects who had participated in the Helsinki Heart Study.
At the completion of the Helsinki Heart Study, subjects could choose to
start, stop, or continue to receive Gemfibrozil; without knowledge of their
own lipid values or double-blind treatment, 60% of patients originally
randomized to placebo began therapy with Gemfibrozil and 60% of patients
originally randomized to Gemfibrozil continued medication. After approximately
6.5 years following randomization, all patients were informed of their
original treatment group and lipid values during the 5 years of the double-blind
treatment. After further elective changes in Gemfibrozil treatment status,
61% of patients in the group originally randomized to Gemfibrozil were
taking drug; in the group originally randomized to placebo, 65% were taking
Gemfibrozil. The event rate per 1000 occurring during the open-label follow-up
period is detailed in Table II. </p>

<p>It is not clear to what extent the findings of the primary prevention
component of the Helsinki Heart Study can be extrapolated to other segments
of the dyslipidemic population not studied (such as women, younger or older
males, or those with lipid abnormalities limited solely to HDL-cholesterol)
or to other lipid-altering drugs. </p>

<p>The secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study was conducted
over 5 years in parallel and at the same centers in Finland in 628 middle-aged
males excluded from the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart
Study because of a history of angina, myocardial infarction or unexplained
ECG changes. (REF. 3) The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was cardiac
events (the sum of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and sudden
cardiac deaths). The hazard ratio (Gemfibrozil:placebo) for cardiac events
was 1.47 (95% confidence limits 0.88-2.48, p = 0.14). Of the 35 patients
in the Gemfibrozil group who experienced cardiac events, 12 patients suffered
events after discontinuation from the study. Of the 24 patients in the
placebo group with cardiac events, 4 patients suffered events after discontinuation
from the study. There were 17 cardiac deaths in the Gemfibrozil group and
8 in the placebo group (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% confidence limits 0.94-5.05,
p = 0.06). Ten of these deaths in the Gemfibrozil group and 3 in the placebo
group occurred after discontinuation from therapy. In this study of patients
with known or suspected coronary heart disease, no benefit from Gemfibrozil
treatment was observed in reducing cardiac events or cardiac deaths. Thus,
Gemfibrozil has shown benefit only in selected dyslipidemic patients Without
suspected or established coronary heart disease. Even in patients with
coronary heart disease and the triad of elevated LDL- cholesterol, elevated
triglycerides, plus low HDL-cholesterol, the possible effect of Gemfibrozil
on coronary events has not been adequately studied. </p>

<p>No efficacy in the patients with established coronary heart disease
was observed during the Coronary Drug Project with the chemically and pharmacologically
related drug, clofibrate. The Coronary Drug Project was a 6 year randomized,
double-blind study involving 1000 clofibrate, 1000 nicotinic acid, and
3000 placebo patients with known coronary heart disease. A clinically and
statistically significant reduction in myocardial infarctions was seen
in the concurrent nicotinic acid group compared to placebo; no reduction
was seen with clofibrate. </p>

<p>The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil has not been definitely established.
In man, Gemfibrozil has been shown to inhibit peripheral lipolysis and
to decrease the hepatic extraction of free fatty acids, thus reducing hepatic
triglyceride production. Gemfibrozil inhibits synthesis and increases clearance
of VLDL carrier apolipoprotein B, leading to a decrease in VLDL production.
</p>

<p>Animal studies suggest that gemfibrozil may, in addition to elevating
HDL cholesterol, reduce incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into newly
formed triglycerides, accelerate turnover and removal of cholesterol from
the liver, and increase excretion of cholesterol in the feces. Gemfibrozil
is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
Peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 2 hours with a plasma half-life of 1.5
hours following multiple doses. Plasma levels appear proportional to dose
and do not demonstrate accumulation across time following multiple doses.
</p>

<p>Gemfibrozil mainly undergoes oxidation of a ring methyl group to successively
form a hydroxymethyl and a carboxyl metabolite. Approximately seventy percent
of the administered human dose is excreted in the urine, mostly as the
glucuronide conjugate, with less than 2% excreted as unchanged gemfibrozil.
Six percent of the dose is accounted for in the feces. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Gemfibrozil is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for: </p>

<p>1. Treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride
levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who present a risk of pancreatitis
and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control
them. Patients who present such risk typically have serum triglycerides
over 2000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-cholesterol as well as fasting
chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia). Subjects who consistently have total
serum or plasma triglycerides below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to present
a risk of pancreatitis. Gemfibrozil therapy may be considered for those
subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1000 and 2000 mg/dL who have
a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis.
It is recognized that some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1000
mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type
V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia,
but the influence of Gemfibrozil therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in
such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated
for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons
and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density
lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful
in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia (REF. 4). </p>

<p>2. Reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease ONLY in Type
IIb patients without history of or symptoms of existing coronary heart
disease who have had an inadequate response to weight loss, dietary therapy,
exercise, and other pharmacologic agents (such as bile acid sequestrants
and nicotinic acid, known to reduce LDL- and raise HDL-cholesterol AND
who have the following triad of lipid abnormalities: low HDL-cholesterol
levels in addition to elevated LDL- cholesterol and elevated triglycerides
(see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The National
Cholesterol Education Program has defined a serum HDL-cholesterol value
that is consistently below 35 mg/dL as constituting an independent risk
factor for coronary heart disease (REF. 5). Patients with significantly
elevated triglycerides should be closely observed when treated with gemfibrozil.
In some patients with high triglyceride levels, treatment with gemfibrozil
is associated with a significant increase in LDL- cholesterol. BECAUSE
OF POTENTIAL TOXICITY SUCH AS MALIGNANCY, GALLBLADDER DISEASE, ABDOMINAL
PAIN LEADING TO APPENDECTOMY AND OTHER ABDOMINAL SURGERIES, AN INCREASED
INCIDENCE IN NONCORONARY MORTALITY, AND THE 44% RELATIVE INCREASE DURING
THE TRIAL PERIOD IN AGE-ADJUSTED ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY SEEN WITH THE CHEMICALLY
AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY RELATED DRUG, CLOFIBRATE, THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF
GEMFIBROZIL IN TREATING TYPE IIA PATIENTS WITH ELEVATIONS OF LDL CHOLESTEROL
ONLY IS NOT LIKELY TO OUTWEIGH THE RISKS. Gemfibrozil IS ALSO NOT INDICATED
FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH LOW HDL-CHOLESTEROL AS THEIR ONLY LIPID
ABNORMALITY. </p>

<p>In a subgroup analysis of patients in the Helsinki Heart Study with
above median HDL-cholesterol values at baseline (greater than 46.4 mg/dL),
the incidence of serious coronary events was similar for gemfibrozil and
placebo subgroups (see Table I). </p>

<p>The initial treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary therapy specific for
the type of lipoprotein abnormality. Excess body weight and excess alcohol
intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be managed
prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary
measure, and has been associated with rises in HDL-cholesterol. Diseases
contributory to hyperlipidemia such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus
should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy is sometimes
associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects
with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of estrogen
therapy may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia.
The use of drugs should be considered only when reasonable attempts have
been made to obtain satisfactory results with nondrug methods. If the decision
is made to use drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not
reduce the importance of adhering to diet. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>1. Hepatic or severe renal dysfunction, including primary biliary cirrhosis.
</p>

<p>2. Preexisting gallbladder disease (see WARNINGS). </p>

<p>3. Hypersensitivity to gemfibrozil. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>1. Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between
gemfibrozil and clofibrate, the adverse findings with clofibrate in two
large clinical studies may also apply to gemfibrozil. In the first of those
studies, the Coronary Drug Project, 1000 subjects with previous myocardial
infarction were treated for 5 years with clofibrate. There was no difference
in mortality between the clofibrate-treated subjects and 3000 placebo-treated
subjects, but twice as many clofibrate-treated subjects developed cholelithiasis
and cholecystitis requiring surgery. In the other study, conducted by the
World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known coronary heart
disease were treated with clofibrate for 5 years and followed one year
beyond. There was a statistically significant, 44%, higher age-adjusted
total mortality in the clofibrate-treated than in a comparable placebo-treated
control group during the trial period. The excess mortality was due to
a 33% increase in noncardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy
complications, and pancreatitis. The higher risk of clofibrate-treated
subjects for gallbladder disease was confirmed. </p>

<p>Because of the more limited size of the Helsinki Heart Study, the observed
difference in mortality from any cause between the Gemfibrozil and placebo
group is not statistically significantly different from the 29% excess
mortality reported in the clofibrate group in the separate WHO study at
the 9 year follow up (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Noncoronary heart disease
related mortality showed an excess in the group originally randomized to
Gemfibrozil primarily due to cancer deaths observed during the open-label
extension. </p>

<p>During the 5 year primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart
Study mortality from any cause was 44 (2.2%) in the Gemfibrozil group and
43 (2.1%) in the placebo group; including the 3.5 year follow-up period
since the trial was completed, cumulative mortality from any cause was
101 (4.9%) in the Gemfibrozil group and 83 (4.1%) in the group originally
randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 1.20 in favor of placebo). Because
of the more limited size of the Helsinki Heart Study, the observed difference
in mortality from any cause between the Gemfibrozil and placebo groups
at year-5 or at year-8.5 is not statistically significantly different from
the 29% excess mortality reported in the clofibrate group in the separate
WHO study at the 9 year follow-up. Noncoronary heart disease related mortality
showed an excess in the group originally randomized to Gemfibrozil at the
8.5 year follow-up (65 Gemfibrozil versus 45 placebo noncoronary deaths).
</p>

<p>The incidence of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma) discovered
during the trial and in the 3.5 years after the trial was completed was
51 (2.5%) in both originally randomized groups. In addition, there were
16 basal cell carcinomas in the group originally randomized to Gemfibrozil
and 9 in the group randomized to placebo (p = 0.22). There were 30 (1.5%)
deaths attributed to cancer in the group originally randomized to Gemfibrozil
and 18 (0.9%) in the group originally randomized to placebo (p = 0.11).
Adverse outcomes, including coronary events, were higher in gemfibrozil
patients in a corresponding study in men with a history of known or suspected
coronary heart disease in the secondary prevention component of the Helsinki
Heart Study. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) </p>

<p>2. A gallstone prevalence substudy of 450 Helsinki Heart Study participants
showed a trend toward a greater prevalence of gallstones during the study
within the Gemfibrozil treatment group (7.5% vs 4.9% for the placebo group,
a 55% excess for the gemfibrozil group). A trend toward a greater incidence
of gallbladder surgery was observed for the Gemfibrozil group (17 vs 11
subjects, a 54% excess). This result did not differ statistically from
the increased incidence of cholecystectomy observed in the WHO study in
the group treated with clofibrate. Both clofibrate and gemfibrozil may
increase cholesterol excretion into the bile leading to cholelithiasis.
If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Gemfibrozil
therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found. </p>

<p>3. Since a reduction of mortality from coronary artery disease has not
been demonstrated and because liver and interstitial cell testicular tumors
were increased in rats, Gemfibrozil should be administered only to those
patients described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. If a significant
serum lipid response is not obtained, Gemfibrozil should be discontinued.
</p>

<p>4. Concomitant Anticoagulants--Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants
are given in conjunction with Gemfibrozil. The dosage of the anticoagulant
should be reduced to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level
to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent prothrombin determinations
are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the prothrombin
level has stabilized. </p>

<p>5. Concomitant therapy with Gemfibrozil and Mevacor (lovastatin) has
been associated with rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase
(CK) levels and myoglobinuria, leading in a high proportion of cases to
acute renal failure. IN VIRTUALLY ALL PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY
LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE, ANY POTENTIAL LIPID BENEFIT OF COMBINED
THERAPY WITH LOVASTATIN AND GEMFIBROZIL DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF
SEVERE MYOPATHY, RHABDOMYOLYSIS, AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (see Drug Interactions).
The use of fibrates alone, including Gemfibrozil, may occasionally be associated
with myositis. Patients receiving Gemfibrozil and complaining of muscle
pain, tenderness, or weakness should have prompt medical evaluation for
myositis, including serum creatine kinase level determination. If myositis
is suspected or diagnosed, Gemfibrozil therapy should be withdrawn. </p>

<p>6. Cataracts--Subcapsular bilateral cataracts occurred in 10% and unilateral
in 6.3% of male rats treated with gemfibrozil at 10 times the human dose.
</p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>1. INITIAL THERAPY--Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that
the lipid levels are consistently abnormal. Before instituting Gemfibrozil
therapy, every attempt should be made to control serum lipids with appropriate
diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical
problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothryroidism that are contributing
to the lipid abnormalities. </p>

<p>2. CONTINUED THERAPY--Periodic determination of serum lipids should
be obtained and the drug withdrawn if lipid response is inadequate after
3 months of therapy. </p>

<p>3. DRUG INTERACTIONS--(A) HMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS: Rhabdomyolysis
has occurred with combined gemfibrozil and lovastatin therapy. It may be
seen as early as 3 weeks after initiation of combined therapy or after
several months. In most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response
to either drug alone, the possible benefit of combined therapy with lovastatin
(or other HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors) and gemfibrozil does not outweigh
the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
There is no assurance that periodic monitoring of creatine kinase will
prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy and kidney damage. </p>

<p>(B) ANTICOAGULANTS: CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ANTICOAGULANTS
ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH Gemfibrozil. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANT
SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME AT THE DESIRED LEVEL
TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS
ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN
LEVEL HAS STABILIZED. </p>

<p>4. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY--LONG-TERM STUDIES
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN RATS AT 0.2 and 2 times the human dose (based on
surface area mg/meter(square)). Based on two-week toxicokinetic studies,
exposure (AUC) of the dose groups was estimated to be 0.2 and 1.3 times
the human exposure. The incidence of benign liver nodules and liver carcinomas
was significantly increased in high dose male rats. The incidence of liver
carcinomas increased also in low dose males, but this increase was not
statistically significant (p=0.1). Male rats had a dose-related and statistically
significant increase of benign Leydig cell tumors. The higher dose female
rats had a significant increase in the combined incidence of benign and
malignant liver neoplasms. </p>

<p>Long-term studies have been conducted in mice at 0.1 and 1 times the
human dose (based on surface area). Based on two-week toxicokinetic studies,
exposure (AUC) of the two dose groups was estimated to be 0.1 and 0.7 times
the human exposure. There were no statistically significant differences
from controls in the incidence of liver tumors, but the doses tested were
lower than those shown to be carcinogenic with other fibrates. </p>

<p>Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated a florid hepatic peroxisome
proliferation following Gemfibrozil administration to the male rat. An
adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation has not been done in
humans, but changes in peroxisome morphology have been observed. Peroxisome
proliferation has been shown to occur in humans with either of two other
drugs of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and
after treatment in the same individual. </p>

<p>Administration of approximately 0.6 and 2 times the human dose (based
on surface area) to male rats for 10 weeks resulted in a dose-related decrease
of fertility. Subsequent studies demonstrated that this effect was reversed
after a drug-free period of about eight weeks, and it was not transmitted
to the offspring. </p>

<p>5. PREGNANCY CATEGORY C--Gemfibrozil has been shown to produce adverse
effects in rats and rabbits at doses between 0.5 and 3 times the human
dose (based on surface area) but no developmental toxicity or teratogenicity
among offspring of either species. There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. Gemfibrozil should be used during pregnancy
only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
</p>

<p>Administration of Gemfibrozil to female rats at 0.6 and 2 times the
human dose (based on surface area) before and throughout gestation caused
a dose-related decrease in conception rate and, at the high dose, an increase
in stillborns and a slight reduction in pup weight during lactation. There
were also dose-related increased skeletal variations. Anophthalmia occurred,
but rarely. </p>

<p>Administration of 0.6 and 2 times the human dose (based on surface area)
of Gemfibrozil to female rats from gestation day 15 through weaning caused
dose-related decreases in birth weight and suppressions of pup growth during
lactation. </p>

<p>Administration of 1 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area)
of Gemfibrozil to female rabbits during organogenesis caused a dose-related
decrease in litter size and, at the high dose, an increased incidence of
parietal bone variations. </p>

<p>6. NURSING MOTHERS--It is not known whether this drug is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of
the potential for tumorigenicity shown for Gemfibrozil in animal studies,
a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
</p>

<p>7. HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES--Mild hemoglobin, hematocrit and white blood
cell decreases have been observed in occasional patients following initiation
of Gemfibrozil therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term
administration. Rarely, severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and
bone marrow hypoplasia have been reported. Therefore, periodic blood counts
are recommended during the first 12 months of Gemfibrozil administration.
</p>

<p>8. LIVER FUNCTION--Abnormal liver function tests have been observed
occasionally during Gemfibrozil administration, including elevations of
AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), LDH, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. These
are usually reversible when Gemfibrozil is discontinued. Therefore periodic
liver function studies are recommended and Gemfibrozil therapy should be
terminated if abnormalities persist. </p>

<p>9. KIDNEY FUNCTION--There have been reports of worsening renal insufficiency
upon the addition of Gemfibrozil therapy in individuals with baseline plasma
creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL. In such patients, the use of alternative therapy
should be considered against the risks and benefits of a lower dose of
Gemfibrozil. </p>

<p>10. USE IN CHILDREN--Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.
</p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>(A) HMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS: Rhabdomyolysis has occurred with combined
gemfibrozil and lovastatin therapy. It may be seen as early as 3 weeks
after initiation of combined therapy or after several months. In most subjects
who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the
possible benefit of combined therapy with lovastatin (or other HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors) and gemfibrozil does not outweigh the risks of severe
myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. There is no assurance
that periodic monitoring of creatine kinase will prevent the occurrence
of severe myopathy and kidney damage. </p>

<p>(B) ANTICOAGULANTS: CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ANTICOAGULANTS
ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH Gemfibrozil. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANT
SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME AT THE DESIRED LEVEL
TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS
ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN
LEVEL HAS STABILIZED. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In the double-blind controlled phase of the primary prevention component
of the Helsinki Heart Study, 2046 patients received Gemfibrozil for up
to 5 years. In that study, the following adverse reactions were statistically
more frequent in subjects in the Gemfibrozil group: </p>

<p>GALLBLADDER SURGERY was performed in 0.9% of Gemfibrozil and 0.5% of
placebo subjects in the primary prevention component, a 64% excess, which
is not statistically different from the excess of gallbladder surgery observed
in the clofibrate compared to the placebo group of the WHO study. Gallbladder
surgery was also performed more frequently in the Gemfibrozil group compared
to placebo (1.9% vs 0.3%, p = 0.07) in the secondary prevention component.
A statistically significant increase in appendectomy in the gemfibrozil
group was seen also in the secondary prevention component (6 on gemfibrozil
vs 0 on placebo, p = 0.014). </p>

<p>Nervous system and special senses adverse reactions were more common
in the Gemfibrozil group. These included hypesthesia, paresthesias, and
taste perversion. Other adverse reactions that were more common among Gemfibrozil
treatment group subjects but where a causal relationship was not established
include cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, and intracerebral hemorrhage.
</p>

<p>From other studies it seems probable that Gemfibrozil is causally related
to the occurrence of MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS (see WARNINGS), and to ABNORMAL
LIVER FUNCTION TESTS and HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES (see PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>Reports of viral and bacterial infections (common cold, cough, urinary
tract infections) were more common in gemfibrozil treated patients in other
controlled clinical trials of 805 patients. Additional adverse reactions
that have been reported for gemfibrozil are listed below by system. These
are categorized according to whether a causal relationship to treatment
with Gemfibrozil is probable or not established: </p>

<h1 align=center>Calcium Channel Blockers </h1>

<h3>The Calcium Channel Blockers (examples: nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem)
inhibit the flow of calcium into the cardiac (heart) and smooth muscle
cells. This action accounts for their effects of lowering blood pressure,
relieving angina (chest pain) and stabilizing certain abnormal heart rhythyms.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Lovastatin, is a cholesterol lowering agent isolated from a strain of
Aspergillus Terreus. After oral ingestion, lovastatin, which is an inactive
lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding beta-hydroxyacid form. This
is a principal metabolite and an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA
to mevalonate, which is an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis
of cholesterol. </p>

<p>Lovastatin is (1S-(1alpha(R),3alpha,7beta,8beta(2S,4S),8abeta))-1,2,3,
7,8 8a-hexahydro-3,7-dimethyl-8-(2-(tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6- oxo-2H-pyran-2-
yl)ethyl)-1-naphthalenyl 2-methylbutanoate. The empirical formula of lovastatin
is C24H36O5 and its molecular weight is 404.55. Its structural formula
is: </p>

<p>Lovastatin is a white, nonhygroscopic crystalline powder that is insoluble
in water and sparingly soluble in ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile.
</p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The involvement of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in atherogenesis
has been well-documented in clinical and pathological studies, as well
as in many animal experiments. </p>

<p>Epidemiological studies have established that high LDL (low-density
lipoprotein) cholesterol and low HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol
are both risk factors for coronary heart disease. The Lipid Research Clinics
Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT), coordinated by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) studied men aged 35-59 with total cholesterol
levels 265 mg/dL (6.8 mmol/L) or greater, LDL cholesterol values 175 mg/dL
(4.5 mmol/L) or greater and triglyceride levels not more than 300 mg/dL
(3.4 mmol/ L). This seven-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
demonstrated that lowering LDL cholesterol with diet and cholestyramine
decreased the combined rate of coronary heart disease death plus non-fatal
myocardial infarction. </p>

<p>Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL cholesterol
concentrations. The effect of lovastatin-induced changes in lipoprotein
levels, including reduction of serum cholesterol, on cardiovascular morbidity
or mortality has not been established. </p>

<p>LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized predominantly by the high
affinity LDL receptor. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of Lovastatin
may involve both reduction of VLDL cholesterol concentration, and induction
of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism
of LDL cholesterol. Apolipoprotein B also falls substantially during treatment
with Lovastatin. Since each LDL particle contains one molecule of apolipoprotein
B, and since little apolipoprotein B is found in other lipoproteins, this
strongly suggests that Lovastatin does not merely cause cholesterol to
be lost from LDL, but also reduces the concentration of circulating LDL
particles. In addition, Lovastatin can produce increases of variable magnitude
in HDL cholesterol, and modestly reduces VLDL cholesterol and plasma triglycerides
(see Tables I-IV under Clinical Studies). The effects of Lovastatin on
Lp(a), fibrinogen, and certain other independent biochemical risk markers
for coronary heart disease are unknown. </p>

<p>Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme
which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion
of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for
cholesterol. </p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics </p>

<p>Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed In Vivo to the corresponding
beta-hydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of
HMG-CoA reductase is the basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies
of the beta- hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following
base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma
following administration of lovastatin. </p>

<p>Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled lovastatin in man, 10% of the
dose was excreted in urine and 83% in feces. The latter represents absorbed
drug equivalents excreted in bile, as well as any unabsorbed drug. Plasma
concentrations of total radioactivity (lovastatin plus 14C-metabolites)
peaked at 2 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 24 hours
postdose. Absorption of lovastatin, estimated relative to an intravenous
reference dose, in each of four animal species tested, averaged about 30%
of an oral dose. In animal studies, after oral dosing, lovastatin had high
selectivity for the liver, where it achieved substantially higher concentrations
than in non-target tissues. Lovastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction
in the liver, its primary site of action, with subsequent excretion of
drug equivalents in the bile. As a consequence of extensive hepatic extraction
of lovastatin, the availability of drug to the general circulation is low
and variable. In a single dose study in four hypercholesterolemic patients,
it was estimated that less than 5% of an oral dose of lovastatin reaches
the general circulation as active inhibitors. Following administration
of lovastatin tablets the coefficient of variation, based on between-subject
variability, was approximately 40% for the area under the curve (AUC) of
total inhibitory activity in the general circulation. </p>

<p>Both lovastatin and its beta-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound
(&gt;95%) to human plasma proteins. Animal studies demonstrated that lovastatin
crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers. </p>

<p>The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the beta-hydroxyacid
of lovastatin, its 6'-hydroxy derivative, and two additional metabolites.
Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained
within 2 to 4 hours of dose administration. While the recommended therapeutic
dose range is 20 to 80 mg/day, linearity of inhibitory activity in the
general circulation was established by a single dose study employing lovastatin
tablet dosages from 60 to as high as 120 mg. With a once-a-day dosing regimen,
plasma concentrations of total inhibitors over a dosing interval achieved
a steady state between the second and third days of therapy and were about
1.5 times those following a single dose. When lovastatin was given under
fasting conditions, plasma concentrations of total inhibitors were on average
about two thirds those found when lovastatin was administered immediately
after a standard test meal. </p>

<p>In a study of patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance
10 30 mL/min), the plasma concentrations of total inhibitors after a single
dose of lovastatin were approximately two-fold higher than those in healthy
volunteers. </p>

<p>Clinical Studies </p>

<p>Lovastatin has been shown to be highly effective in reducing total and
LDL cholesterol in heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of primary
hypercholesterolemia and in mixed hyperlipidemia. A marked response was
seen within 2 weeks, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within
4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy.
Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same
dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly
at night. </p>

<p>In multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with familial or non-familial
hypercholesterolemia, Lovastatin, administered in doses ranging from 20
mg q.p.m. to 40 mg b.i.d., was compared to placebo. Lovastatin consistently
and significantly decreased total plasma cholesterol (TOTAL-C), LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol (TOTAL-C/HDL-C) ratio and LDL
cholesterol/HDL cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio. In addition, Lovastatin
produced increases of variable magnitude in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and
modestly decreased VLDL cholesterol (VLDL-C) and plasma triglycerides (TRIG.)
(see Tables I and IV for dose response results). </p>

<p>Lovastatin was studied in controlled trials in hypercholesterolemic
patients with well-controlled non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with
normal renal function. The effect of Lovastatin on lipids and lipoproteins
and the safety profile of Lovastatin were similar to that demonstrated
in studies in nondiabetics. Lovastatin had no clinically important effect
on glycemic control or on the dose requirement of oral hypoglycemic agents.
</p>

<p>Expanded Clinical Evaluation Of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study </p>

<p>Lovastatin was compared to placebo in 8,245 patients with hypercholesterolemia
(total cholesterol 240-300 mg/dL (6.2 mmol/L-7.6 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol
&gt;160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L)) in the randomized, double-blind, parallel,
48-week EXCEL study. All changes in the lipid measurements (Table IV) in
Lovastatin treated patients were dose-related and significantly different
from placebo (p &lt;/=0.001). These results were sustained throughout the
study. </p>

<p>Atherosclerosis </p>

<p>In the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS), the effect
of therapy with lovastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by
coronary angiography in hyperlipidemic patients. In this randomized, double-blind,
controlled clinical trial, patients were treated with diet and either lovastatin
80 mg daily or placebo. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline and at two
years by computerized quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). No statistically
significant difference between lovastatin and placebo was seen for the
primary endpoint (mean change per patient in percentage diameter stenosis
of all lesions), or for most secondary QCA endpoints. Visual assessment
by angiographers who formed a consensus opinion of overall angiographic
change (Global Change Score) was also a secondary endpoint. By this endpoint,
significant slowing of disease was seen, with regression in 23% of patients
treated with lovastatin compared to 11% of placebo patients. </p>

<p>In the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), either lovastatin
or niacin in combination with a bile acid sequestrant for 2.5 years in
hyperlipidemic subjects significantly reduced the frequency of progression
and increased the frequency of regression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions
by QCA compared to diet and, in some cases, low-dose resin. </p>

<p>Eye </p>

<p>There was a high prevalence of baseline lenticular opacities in the
patient population included in the early clinical trials with lovastatin.
During these trials the appearance of new opacities was noted in both the
lovastatin and placebo groups. There was no clinically significant change
in visual acuity in the patients who had new opacities reported nor was
any patient, including those with opacities noted at baseline, discontinued
from therapy because of a decrease in visual acuity. </p>

<p>A three-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in hypercholesterolemic
patients to assess the effect of lovastatin on the human lens demonstrated
that there were no clinically or statistically significant differences
between the lovastatin and placebo groups in the incidence, type or progression
of lenticular opacities. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple
risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased
risk for artherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia.
Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated
total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia
(Types IIa and IIb1), when the response to diet restricted in saturated
fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has
been inadequate. </p>

<p>Prior to initiating therapy with lovastatin, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia
(e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism nephrotic syndrome,
dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism)
should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure TOTAL-C, HDL-C,
and triglycerides (TG). For patients with TG less than 400 mg/dL (&lt;4.5
mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation: </p>

<pre>LDL-C = Total cholesterol - (0.2 X (triglycerides) +HDL-C) </pre>

<p>For TG levels &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less
accurate and LDL C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation.
In hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated
TOTAL-C. In such cases, Lovastatin is not indicated. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Active liver disease
or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases (see WARNINGS).
</p>

<p>Pregnancy And Lactation. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the
discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little
impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia.
Moreoever, cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis
pathway are essential components for fetal development, including synthesis
of steroids and cell membranes. Because of the ability of inhibitors of
HMG-CoA reductase such as Lovastatin to decrease the synthesis of cholesterol
and possibly other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, Lovastatin
may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Therefore,
lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. LOVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED
TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY
TO CONCEIVE. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, lovastatin
should be discontinued and the patient should be apprised of the potential
hazard to the fetus. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Liver Dysfunction </p>

<p>MARKED PERSISTENT INCREASES (TO MORE THAN 3 TIMES THE UPPER LIMIT OF
NORMAL) IN SERUM TRANSAMINASES OCCURRED IN 1.9% OF ADULT PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED
LOVASTATIN FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR IN EARLY CLINICAL TRIALS (SEE ADVERSE
REACTIONS). When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients,
the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The
increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with
lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs
or symptoms. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity. In the EXCEL study
(see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies), the incidence of
marked persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1%
for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day
in patients on lovastatin. However, in post- marketing experience with
Lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages
(see ADVERSE REACTIONS). </p>

<p>IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT LIVER FUNCTION TESTS BE PERFORMED DURING THERAPY
WITH LOVASTATIN. SERUM TRANSAMINASES, INCLUDING ALT (SGPT), SHOULD BE MONITORED
BEFORE TREATMENT BEGINS, EVERY 6 WEEKS DURING THE FIRST 3 MONTHS, EVERY
8 WEEKS DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRST YEAR, AND PERIODICALLY THEREAFTER
(E.G., AT APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTH INTERVALS). Special attention should be
paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in
these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed
more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression,
particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and
are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. Liver biopsy should be
considered if elevations are persistent beyond the discontinuation of the
drug. </p>

<p>The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial
quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active
liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications
to the use of lovastatin. </p>

<p>As with other lipid-lowering agents, moderate (less than three times
the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been
reported following therapy with Lovastatin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). These
changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with Lovastatin, were
often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption
of treatment was not required. </p>

<p>Skeletal Muscle </p>

<p>RHABDOMYOLYSIS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOVASTATIN THERAPY ALONE, WHEN
COMBINED WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY INCLUDING CYCLOSPORINE IN CARDIAC
TRANSPLANT PATIENTS, AND WHEN COMBINED IN NON-TRANSPLANT PATIENTS WITH
EITHER GEMFIBROZIL OR LIPID-LOWERING DOSES (&gt;/=1 G/DAY) OF NICOTINIC
ACID. SOME OF THE AFFECTED PATIENTS HAD PRE-EXISTING RENAL INSUFFICIENCY,
USUALLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LONG STANDING DIABETES. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
FROM RHABDOMYOLYSIS HAS BEEN SEEN MORE COMMONLY WITH THE LOVASTATIN-GEMFIBROZIL
COMBINATION, AND HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN TRANSPLANT PATIENTS RECEIVING
LOVASTATIN PLUS CYCLOSPORINE. </p>

<p>Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in
seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin.
Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should
be carefully monitored. </p>

<p>FULMINANT RHABDOMYOLYSIS HAS BEEN SEEN AS EARLY AS THREE WEEKS AFTER
INITIATION OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH GEMFIBROZIL AND LOVASTATIN, BUT MAY
BE SEEN AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS. FOR THESE REASONS, IT IS FELT THAT, IN MOST
SUBJECTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE,
THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH LOVASTATIN AND GEMFIBROZIL
DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF SEVERE MYOPATHY, RHABDOMYOLYSIS, AND ACUTE
RENAL FAILURE. WHILE IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS INTERACTION OCCURS WITH
FIBRATES OTHER THAN GEMFIBROZIL, MYOPATHY AND RHABDOMYOLYSIS HAVE OCCASIONALLY
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF OTHER FIBRATES ALONE, INCLUDING CLOFIBRATE.
THEREFORE, THE COMBINED USE OF LOVASTATIN WITH OTHER FIBRATES SHOULD GENERALLY
BE AVOIDED. </p>

<p>PHYSICIANS CONTEMPLATING COMBINED THERAPY WITH LOVASTATIN AND LIPID-LOWERING
DOSES OF NICOTINIC ACID OR WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS SHOULD CAREFULLY
WEIGH THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS AND SHOULD CAREFULLY MONITOR PATIENTS
FOR ANY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MUSCLE PAIN, TENDERNESS, OR WEAKNESS, PARTICULARLY
DURING THE INITIAL MONTHS OF THERAPY AND DURING ANY PERIODS OF UPWARD DOSAGE
TITRATION OF EITHER DRUG. PERIODIC CPK DETERMINATIONS MAY BE CONSIDERED
IN SUCH SITUATIONS, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH MONITORING WILL
PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF SEVERE MYOPATHY. THE MONITORING OF LOVASTATIN
DRUG AND METABOLITE LEVELS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN TRANSPLANT PATIENTS WHO
ARE TREATED WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVES AND LOVASTATIN. </p>

<p>LOVASTATIN THERAPY SHOULD BE TEMPORARILY WITHHELD OR DISCONTINUED IN
ANY PATIENT WITH AN ACUTE, SERIOUS CONDITION SUGGESTIVE OF A MYOPATHY OR
HAVING A RISK FACTOR PREDISPOSING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENAL FAILURE SECONDARY
TO RHABDOMYOLYSIS, INCLUDING: SEVERE ACUTE INFECTION, HYPOTENSION, MAJOR
SURGERY, TRAUMA, SEVERE METABOLIC, ENDOCRINE AND ELECTROLYTE DISORDERS,
AND UNCONTROLLED SEIZURES. </p>

<p>Myalgia has been associated with lovastatin therapy. Transient, mildly
elevated creatine phosphokinase levels are commonly seen in lovastatin-treated
patients. However, in early clinical trials, approximately 0.5% of patients
developed a myopathy, i.e., myalgia or muscle weakness associated with
markedly elevated CPK levels. In the EXCEL study (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies), five (0.1%) patients taking lovastatin
alone (one at 40 mg q.p.m., and four at 40 mg b.i.d.) developed myopathy
(muscle symptoms and CPK levels &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal).
Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle
tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should
be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness,
particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Lovastatin therapy should
be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed
or suspected. </p>

<p>Most of the patients who have developed myopathy (including rhabdomyolysis)
while taking lovastatin were receiving concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive
drugs, gemfibrozil or lipid-lowering doses of nicotinic acid. In clinical
trials, about 30 percent of patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy
including cyclosporine developed myopathy; the corresponding percentages
for gemfibrozil and niacin were approximately 5 percent and 2 percent respectively.
</p>

<p>In six patients with cardiac transplants taking immunosuppressive therapy
including cyclosporine concomitantly with lovastatin 20 mg/day, the average
plasma level of active metabolites derived from lovastatin was elevated
to approximately four times the expected levels. Because of an apparent
relationship between increased plasma levels of active metabolites derived
from lovastatin and myopathy, the daily dosage in patients taking immunosuppressants
should not exceed 20 mg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Even at this
dosage, the benefits and risks of using lovastatin in patients taking immunosuppressants
should be carefully considered. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General </p>

<p>Before instituting therapy with Lovastatin, an attempt should be made
to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, weight
reduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems
(see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). </p>

<p>Lovastatin may elevate creatine phosphokinase and transaminase levels
(see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). This should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of chest pain in a patient on therapy with lovastatin.
</p>

<p>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia </p>

<p>Lovastatin is less effective in patients with the rare homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia, possibly because these patients have no functional
LDL receptors. Lovastatin appears to be more likely to raise serum transaminases
(see ADVERSE REACTIONS) in these homozygous patients. </p>

<p>Information For Patients </p>

<p>Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain,
tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.
</p>

<p>Drug Interactions </p>

<p>Immunosuppressive Drugs, Gemfibrozil, Niacin (Nicotinic Acid), Erythromycin:
See WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle. </p>

<p>Coumarin Anticoagulants: In a small clinical trial in which lovastatin
was administered to warfarin treated patients, no effect on prothrombin
time was detected. However, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been
found to produce a less than two seconds increase in prothrombin time in
healthy volunteers receiving low doses of warfarin. Also, bleeding and/or
increased prothrombin time have been reported in a few patients taking
coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly with lovastatin. It is recommended
that in patients taking anticoagulants, prothrombin time be determined
before starting lovastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to
insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once
a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be
monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin
anticoagulants. If the dose of lovastatin is changed, the same procedure
should be repeated. Lovastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding
or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.
</p>

<p>Antipyrine: Because lovastatin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics
of antipyrine or its metabolites, interactions of other drugs metabolized
via the same cytochrome isozymes are not expected. </p>

<p>Propranolol: In normal volunteers, there was no clinically significant
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration
of single doses of lovastatin and propranolol. </p>

<p>Digoxin: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, concomitant administration
of lovastatin and digoxin resulted in no effect on digoxin plasma concentrations.
Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: In pharmacokinetic studies of Lovastatin in hypercholesterolemic
non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, there was no drug interaction
with glipizide or with chlorpropamide (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Clinical Studies). </p>

<p>Other Concomitant Therapy: Although specific interaction studies were
not performed, in clinical studies, lovastatin was used concomitantly with
beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and nonsteroidal anti
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without evidence of clinically significant
adverse interactions. </p>

<p>Endocrine Function </p>

<p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and
as such might theoretically blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production.
Results of clinical trials with drugs in this class have been inconsistent
with regard to drug effects on basal and reserve steroid levels. However,
clinical studies have shown that lovastatin does not reduce basal plasma
cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve, and does not reduce basal
plasma testosterone concentration. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
has been shown to reduce the plasma testosterone response to HCG. In the
same study, the mean testosterone response to HCG was slightly but not
significantly reduced after treatment with lovastatin 40 mg daily for 16
weeks in 21 men. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility
have not been studied in adequate numbers of male patients. The effects,
if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.
Patients treated with lovastatin who develop clinical evidence of endocrine
dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should also be exercised
if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower cholesterol
levels is administered to patients also receiving other drugs (e.g., ketoconazole,
spironolactone, cimetidine) that may decrease the levels or activity of
endogenous steroid hormones. </p>

<p>CNS Toxicity </p>

<p>Lovastatin produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration
of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent
fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug
levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking
the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity).
Vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal ganglion cell
chromatolysis were also seen in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day,
a dose which resulted in a mean plasma drug level (Cmax) similar to that
seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose. </p>

<p>CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhage and edema,
mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, perivascular fibrin
deposits and necrosis of small vessels, were seen in dogs treated with
lovastatin at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day, a dose which produced plasma drug
levels (Cmax) which were about 30 times higher than the mean values in
humans taking 80 mg/day. </p>

<p>Similar optic nerve and CNS vascular lesions have been observed with
other drugs of this class. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility </p>

<p>In a 21-month carcinogenic study in mice, there was a statistically
significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and
adenomas in both males and females at 500 mg/kg/day. This dose produced
a total plasma drug exposure 3 to 4 times that of humans given the highest
recommended dose of lovastatin (drug exposure was measured as total HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitory activity in extracted plasma). Tumor increases were
not seen at 20 and 100 mg/ kg/day, doses that produced drug exposures of
0.3 to 2 times that of humans at the 80 mg/day dose. A statistically significant
increase in pulmonary adenomas was seen in female mice at approximately
4 times the human drug exposure. (Although mice were given 300 times the
human dose (HD) on a mg/kg body weight basis, plasma levels of total inhibitory
activity were only 4 times higher in mice than in humans given 80 mg of
Lovastatin.) </p>

<p>There was an increase in incidence of papilloma in the non-glandular
mucosa of the stomach of mice beginning at exposures of 1 to 2 times that
of humans. The glandular mucosa was not affected. The human stomach contains
only glandular mucosa. </p>

<p>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, there was a positive dose
response relationship for hepatocellular carcinogenicity in males at drug
exposures between 2-7 times that of human exposure at 80 mg/day (doses
in rats were 5, 30 and 180 mg/kg/day). </p>

<p>A chemically similar drug in this class was administered to mice for
72 weeks at 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg body weight, which resulted in mean
serum drug levels approximately 3, 15, and 33 times higher than the mean
human serum drug concentration (as total inhibitory activity) after a 40
mg oral dose. Liver carcinomas were significantly increased in high dose
females and mid- and high- dose males, with a maximum incidence of 90 percent
in males. The incidence of adenomas of the liver was significantly increased
in mid- and high-dose females. Drug treatment also significantly increased
the incidence of lung adenomas in mid- and high-dose males and females.
Adenomas of the Harderian gland (a gland of the eye of rodents) were significantly
higher in high dose mice than in controls. </p>

<p>No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in a microbial mutagen test
using mutant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium with or without rat or mouse
liver metabolic activation. In addition, no evidence of damage to genetic
material was noted in an In Vitro alkaline elution assay using rat or mouse
hepatocytes, a V- 79 mammalian cell forward mutation study, an In Vitro
chromosome aberration study in CHO cells, or an In Vivo chromosomal aberration
assay in mouse bone marrow. </p>

<p>Drug-related testicular atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis, spermatocytic
degener77ation and giant cell formation were seen in dogs starting at 20
mg/kg/day. Similar findings were seen with another drug in this class.
No drug- related effects on fertility were found in studies with lovastatin
in rats. However, in studies with a similar drug in this class, there was
decreased fertility in male rats treated for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body
weight, although this effect was not observed in a subsequent fertility
study when this same dose was administered for 11 weeks (the entire cycle
of spermatogenesis, including epididymal maturation). In rats treated with
this same reductase inhibitor at 180 mg/kg/day, seminiferous tubule degeneration
(necrosis and loss of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed. No microscopic
changes were observed in the testes from rats of either study. The clinical
significance of these findings is unclear. </p>

<p>Pregnancy </p>

<p>Pregnancy Category X </p>

<p>See CONTRAINDICATIONS. </p>

<p>Safety in pregnant women has not been established. Lovastatin has been
shown to produce skeletal malformations at plasma levels 40 times the human
exposure (for mouse fetus) and 80 times the human exposure (for rat fetus)
based on mg/M(square) surface area (doses were 800 mg/kg/day). No drug-induced
changes were seen in either species at multiples of 8 times (rat) or 4
times (mouse) based on surface area. No evidence of malformations was noted
in rabbits at exposures up to 3 times the human exposure (dose of 15 mg/kg/day,
highest tolerated dose). Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been
received following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
There has been one report of severe congenital bony deformity, tracheo-esophageal
fistula, and anal atresia (VATER association) in a baby born to a woman
who took lovastatin with dextroamphetamine sulfate during the first trimester
of pregnancy. Lovastatin should be administered to women of child-bearing
potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have
been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while
taking Lovastatin, it should be discontinued and the patient advised again
as to the potential hazards to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers </p>

<p>It is not known whether lovastatin is excreted in human milk. Because
a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human breast
milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
infants, women taking Lovastatin should not nurse their infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
</p>

<p>Pediatric Use </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents have not been established.
Because children and adolescents are not likely to benefit from cholesterol
lowering for at least a decade and because experience with this drug is
limited (no studies in subjects below the age of 20 years), treatment of
children with lovastatin is not recommended at this time. </p>

insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once
a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be
monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin
anticoagulants. If the dose of lovastatin is changed, the same procedure
should be repeated. Lovastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding
or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.
</p>

<p>Antipyrine: Because lovastatin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics
of antipyrine or its metabolites, interactions of other drugs metabolized
via the same cytochrome isozymes are not expected. </p>

<p>Propranolol: In normal volunteers, there was no clinically significant
pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration
of single doses of lovastatin and propranolol. </p>

<p>Digoxin: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, concomitant administration
of lovastatin and digoxin resulted in no effect on digoxin plasma concentrations.
</p>

<p>Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: In pharmacokinetic studies of Lovastatin in
hypercholesterolemic non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, there was
no drug interaction with glipizide or with chlorpropamide (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). </p>

<p>Other Concomitant Therapy: Although specific interaction studies were
not performed, in clinical studies, lovastatin was used concomitantly with
beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and nonsteroidal anti
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without evidence of clinically significant
adverse interactions. </p>

<p>Endocrine Function </p>

<p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and
as such might theoretically blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production.
Results of clinical trials with drugs in this class have been inconsistent
with regard to drug effects on basal and reserve steroid levels. However,
clinical studies have shown that lovastatin does not reduce basal plasma
cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve, and does not reduce basal
plasma testosterone concentration. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
has been shown to reduce the plasma testosterone response to HCG. In the
same study, the mean testosterone response to HCG was slightly but not
significantly reduced after treatment with lovastatin 40 mg daily for 16
weeks in 21 men. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility
have not been studied in adequate numbers of male patients. The effects,
if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.
Patients treated with lovastatin who develop clinical evidence of endocrine
dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should also be exercised
if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower cholesterol
levels is administered to patients also receiving other drugs (e.g., ketoconazole,
spironolactone, cimetidine) that may decrease the levels or activity of
endogenous steroid hormones. </p>

<p>CNS Toxicity </p>

<p>Lovastatin produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration
of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent
fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug
levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking
the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity).
Vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal ganglion cell
chromatolysis were also seen in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day,
a dose which resulted in a mean plasma drug level (Cmax) similar to that
seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose. </p>

<p>CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhage and edema,
mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, perivascular fibrin
deposits and necrosis of small vessels, were seen in dogs treated with
lovastatin at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day, a dose which produced plasma drug
levels (Cmax) which were about 30 times higher than the mean values in
humans taking 80 mg/day. </p>

<p>Similar optic nerve and CNS vascular lesions have been observed with
other drugs of this class. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Lovastatin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have
been mild and transient. Less than 1% of patients were discontinued from
controlled clinical studies of up to 14 weeks due to adverse experiences
attributable to Lovastatin. About 3% of patients were discontinued from
extensions of these studies due to adverse experiences attributable to
Lovastatin; about half of these patients were discontinued due to increases
in serum transaminases. The median duration of therapy in these extensions
was 5.2 years. </p>

<p>In the EXCEL study (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies),
4.6% of the patients treated up to 48 weeks were discontinued due to clinical
or laboratory adverse experiences which were rated by the investigator
as possibly probably or definitely related to therapy with Lovastatin.
The value for the placebo group was 2.5%. </p>

levels of at least twice the normal value on one or more occasions. The
corresponding values for the control agents were cholestyramine, 9 percent

of CPK. Large increases in CPK have sometimes been reported (see WARNINGS,
Skeletal Muscle). </p>

<p>Other clinical adverse experiences reported as possibly, probably or
definitely drug-related in 0.5 to 1.0 percent of patients in any drug-related
group are listed below. In all these cases the incidence on drug and placebo
was not statistically different. Body As A Whole: chest pain; Gastrointestinal:
acid regurgitation, dry mouth, vomiting; Musculoskeletal: leg pain, shoulder
pain, arthralgia; Nervous System/Psychiatric: insomnia, paresthesia; Skin:
alopecia, pruritus; Special Senses: eye irritation. </p>

<p>Concomitant Therapy </p>

<p>In controlled clinical studies in which lovastatin was administered
concomitantly with cholestyramine, no adverse reactions peculiar to this
concomitant treatment were observed. The adverse reactions that occurred
were limited to those reported previously with lovastatin or cholestyramine.
Other lipid-lowering agents were not administered concomitantly with lovastatin
during controlled clinical studies. Preliminary data suggests that the
addition of either probucol or gemfibrozil to therapy with lovastatin is
not associated with greater reduction in LDL cholesterol than that achieved
with lovastatin alone. In uncontrolled clinical studies, most of the patients
who have developed myopathy were receiving concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive
drugs, gemfibrozil or niacin (nicotinic acid) (see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle).
</p>

<p>The following effects have been reported with drugs in this class. Not
all the effects listed below have necessarily been associated with lovastatin
therapy. </p>

<p>Skeletal: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias. </p>

<p>Neurological: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration
of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor,
vertigo, memory loss, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve
palsy, anxiety, insomnia, depression. </p>

<p>Hypersensitivity Reactions: An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has
been reported rarely which has included one or more of the following features:
anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia
rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic
anemia positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia,
urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise,
dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson
syndrome. </p>

<p>Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, hepatitis, including chronic active
hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver; and rarely, cirrhosis,
fulminant hepatic necrosis, and hepatoma; anorexia, vomiting. </p>

<p>Skin: alopecia, pruritus. A variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules,
discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails)
has been reported. </p>

<p>Reproductive: gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction. </p>

<p>Eye: progression of cataracts (lens opacities), ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory
Abnormalities: elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin;
thyroid function abnormalities. </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>After oral administration of Lovastatin to mice the median lethal dose
observed was &gt;15 g/M(square). </p>

<p>Five healthy human volunteers have received up to 200 mg of lovastatin
as a single dose without clinically significant adverse experiences. A
few cases of accidental overdosage have been reported; no patients had
any specific symptoms and all patients recovered without sequelae. The
maximum dose taken was 5-6 g. </p>

<p>Until further experience is obtained, no specific treatment of overdosage
with Lovastatin can be recommended. </p>

<p>The dialyzability of lovastatin and its metabolites in man is not known
at present. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet
before receiving Lovastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment
with Lovastatin (see NCEP Treatment Guidelines for details on dietary therapy).
Lovastatin should be given with meals. </p>

<p>The recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day given with the evening
meal. The recommended dosing range is 20-80 mg/day in single or divided
doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg/day. Adjustments of dosage
should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. Doses should be individualized
according to the patient's response (see Tables I to IV under ACTIONS/CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies for dose response results). </p>

<p>In patients taking immunosuppressive drugs concomitantly with lovastatin
(see WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle), therapy should begin with 10 mg of Lovastatin
and should not exceed 20 mg/day. </p>

<p>Cholesterol levels should be monitored periodically and consideration
should be given to reducing the dosage of Lovastatin if cholesterol levels
fall below the targeted range. </p>

<p>Concomitant Therapy </p>

<p>Preliminary evidence suggests that the cholesterol-lowering effects
of lovastatin and the bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, are additive.
</p>

<p>Dosage In Patients With Renal Insufficiency </p>

<p>In patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;30
mL/min), dosage increases above 20 mg/day should be carefully considered
and, if deemed necessary, implemented cautiously (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
and WARNINGS, Skeletal Muscle). </p>

PHARMACODYNAMICS:  
<p>





 





A. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia(BPH) 
<p>





 





The symptoms associated with BPH are related to bladder outlet obstruction,





which is comprised of two underlying components: a static component and a





dynamic component. The static component is a consequence of an increase in





prostate size. Over time, the prostate will continue to enlarge. However,





clinical studies have demonstrated that the size of the prostate does not





correlate with the severity of BPH symptoms or the degree of urinary





obstruction.(REF. 1) The dynamic component is a function of an increase in





smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to constriction of 





the bladder outlet. Smooth muscle tone is mediated by sympathetic nervous





stimulation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate,





prostatic capsule and bladder neck. The reduction in symptoms and improvement





in urine flow rates following administration of terazosin is related to





relaxation of smooth muscle produced by blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in





the bladder neck and prostate. Because there are relatively few alpha-1





adrenoceptors in the bladder body, terazosin is able to reduce the bladder





outlet obstruction without affecting bladder contractility.  





 
<p>





Terazosin has been extensively studied in 1222 men with symptomatic BPH. In





three placebo-controlled studies, symptom evaluation and uroflowmetric





measurements were performed approximately 24 hours following dosing. Symptoms





were systematically quantified using the Boyarsky Index. The questionnaire





evaluated both obstructive (hesitancy, intermittency, terminal dribbling,





impairment of size and force of stream, sensation of incomplete bladder





emptying) and irritative (nocturia, daytime frequency, urgency, dysuria)





symptoms by rating each of the 9 symptoms from 0-3, for a total score of 27





points. Results from these studies indicated that terazosin statistically





significantly improved symptoms and peak urine flow rates over placebo as





follows:

In all three studies, both symptom scores and peak urine flow rates showed





statistically significant improvement from baseline in patients treated with





Terazosin from week 2 (or the first clinic visit) and throughout the study





duration.  
<p>





 





Analysis of the effect of Terazosin on individual urinary symptoms demonstrated





that compared to placebo, Terazosin significantly improved the symptoms of





hesitancy, intermittency, impairment in size and force of urinary stream,





sensation of incomplete emptying, terminal dribbling, daytime frequency and





nocturia.  



<p>


 





Global assessments of overall urinary function and symptoms were also performed 





by investigators who were blinded to patient treatment assignment. In studies 1 





and 3, patients treated with Terazosin had a significantly (p&lt; or =0.001) greater





overall improvement compared to placebo treated patients.  



<p>


 





In a short term study (Study 1), patients were randomized to either 2, 5 or 10





mg of Terazosin or placebo. Patients randomized to the 10 mg group achieved a





statistically significant response in both symptoms and peak flow rate compared 





to placebo.  





 
<p>





In a long-term, open-label, non-placebo controlled clinical trial, 181 men were 





followed for 2 years and 58 of these men were followed for 30 months. The

throughout the study duration:

In this long-term trial, both symptom scores and peak urinary flow rates showed 





statistically significant improvement suggesting a relaxation of smooth muscle





cells.

Although blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors also lowers blood pressure in





hypertensive patients with increased peripheral vascular resistance, terazosin





treatment of normotensive men with BPH did not result in a clinically

<p>


B. Hypertension 





 
<p>





In animals, terazosin causes a decrease in blood pressure by decreasing total





peripheral vascular resistance. The vasodilatory hypotensive action of





terazosin appears to be produced mainly by blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors.





Terazosin decreases blood pressure gradually within 15 minutes following oral





administration.  





 
<p>





Patients in clinical trials of terazosin were administered once daily (the





great majority) and twice daily regimens with total doses usually in the range





of 5-20 mg/day, and had mild (about 77%, diastolic pressure 95-105 mmHg) or





moderate (23%, diastolic pressure 105-115 mmHg) hypertension. Because terazosin 





like all alpha antagonists, can cause unusually large falls in blood pressure





after the first dose or first few doses, the initial dose was 1 mg in virtually 





all trials, with subsequent titration to a specified fixed dose or titration to 





some specified blood pressure end point (usually a supine diastolic pressure of 





90 mmHg).  



<p>


 





Blood pressure responses were measured at the end of the dosing interval





(usually 24 hours) and effects were shown to persist throughout the interval,





with the usual supine responses 5-10 mmHg systolic and 3.5-8 mmHg diastolic





greater than placebo. The responses in the standing position tended to be





somewhat larger, by 1-3 mmHg, although this was not true in all studies. The





magnitude of the blood pressure responses was similar to prazosin and less than 





hydrochlorothiazide (in a single study of hypertensive patients). In





measurements 24 hours after dosing, heart rate was unchanged.  





 
<p>





Limited measurements of peak response (2-3 hours after dosing) during chronic





terazosin administration indicate that it is greater than about twice the





trough (24 hour) response, suggesting some attenuation of response at 24 hours, 





presumably due to a fall in blood terazosin concentrations at the end of the





dose interval. This explanation is not established with certainty, however, and 





is not consistent with the similarity of blood pressure response to once daily





and twice daily dosing and with the absence of an observed dose-response





relationship over a range of 5-20 mg, i.e., if blood concentrations had fallen





to the point of providing less than full effect at 24 hours, a shorter dosing





interval or larger dose should have led to increased response.  





 



<p>


Further dose response and dose duration studies are being carried out. Blood





pressure should be measured at the end of the dose interval; if response is not 





satisfactory, patients may be tried on a larger dose or twice daily dosing





regimen. The latter should also be considered if possibly blood pressure





related side effects, such as dizziness, palpitations, or orthostatic





complaints, are seen within a few hours after dosing.  





 
<p>





The greater blood pressure effect associated with peak plasma concentrations





(first few hours after dosing) appears somewhat more position-dependent





(greater in the erect position) than the effect of terazosin at 24 hours and in 





the erect position there is also a 6-10 beat per minute increase in heart rate





in the first few hours after dosing. During the first 3 hours after dosing





12.5% of patients had a systolic pressure fall of 30 mmHg or more from supine





to standing, or standing systolic pressure below 90 mmHg with a fall of at





least 20 mmHg, compared to 4% of a placebo group.  





 
<p>





There was a tendency for patients to gain weight during terazosin therapy. In





placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, male and female patients receiving





terazosin gained a mean of 1.7 and 2.2 pounds respectively, compared to losses





of 0.2 and 1.2 pounds respectively in the placebo group. Both differences were





statistically significant.  





 
<p>





During controlled clinical trials, patients receiving terazosin monotherapy had 





a small but statistically significant decrease (a 3% fall) compared to placebo





in total cholesterol and the combined low-density and very-low-density





lipoprotein fractions. No significant changes were observed in high-density





lipoprotein fraction and triglycerides compared to placebo.  



<p>


 





Analysis of clinical laboratory data following administration of terazosin





suggested the possibility of hemodilution based on decreases in hematocrit,





hemoglobin, white blood cells, total protein and albumin. Decreases in





hematocrit and total protein have been observed with alpha-blockade and are





attributed to hemodilution.  
<p>





 





PHARMACOKINETICS:  
<p>





 





Relative to solution, terazosin hydrocholoride administered as Terazosin tablets





is essentially completely absorbed in man. Food had little or no effect on the





extent of absorption but food delayed the time to peak concentration by about 1 





hour. Terazosin has been shown to undergo minimal hepatic first-pass metabolism 





and nearly all of the circulating dose is in the form of parent drug. The





plasma levels peak about one hour after dosing, and then decline with a half





life of approximately 12 hours. In a study that evaluated the effect of age on





terazosin pharmacokinetics, the mean plasma half-lives were 14.0 and 11.4 hours 





for the age group &gt;/=70 years and the age group of 20-39 years, respectively.





After oral administration the plasma clearance was decreased by 31.7% in





patients 70 years of age or older compared to that in patients 20-39 years of





age.  





 



<p>


The drug is highly bound to plasma proteins and binding is constant over the





clinically observed concentration range. Approximately 10% of an orally





administered dose is excreted as parent drug in the urine and approximately 20% 





is excreted in the feces. The remainder is eliminated as metabolites. Impaired





renal function had no significant effect on the elimination of terazosin, and





dosage adjustment of terazosin to compensate for the drug removal during





hemodialysis (approximately 10%) does not appear to be necessary. Overall,





approximately 40% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and





approximately 60% in the feces. The disposition of the compound in animals is





qualitatively similar to that in man.  



<p>


 





<a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE 





</b> 
<p>





Terazosin  is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic





benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There is a rapid response, with





approximately 70% of patients experiencing an increase in urinary flow and





improvement in symptoms of BPH when treated with Terazosin. The long-term effects





of Terazosin on the incidence of surgery, acute urinary obstruction or other





complications of BPH are yet to be determined.  





 
<p>





Terazosin tablets are also indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Terazosin





tablets can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents





such as diuretics or beta-adrenergic blocking agents.  





 



<p>


<a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS 





</b> 
<p>





Terazosin tablets are contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to





terazosin hydrochloride.  
<p>





 





<a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS 





</b> 



<p>


SYNCOPE AND &quot;FIRST-DOSE&quot; EFFECT:  





 
<p>





TERAZOSIN TABLETS, LIKE OTHER ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING AGENTS, CAN CAUSE MARKED





LOWERING OF BLOOD PRESSURE, ESPECIALLY POSTURAL HYPOTENSION, AND SYNCOPE IN





ASSOCIATION WITH THE FIRST DOSE OR FIRST FEW DAYS OF THERAPY. A SIMILAR EFFECT





CAN BE ANTICIPATED IF THERAPY IS INTERRUPTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THEN





RESTARTED. SYNCOPE HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED WITH OTHER ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING





AGENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH RAPID DOSAGE INCREASES OR THE INTRODUCTION OF





ANOTHER ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG. SYNCOPE IS BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO AN EXCESSIVE





POSTURAL HYPOTENSIVE EFFECT, ALTHOUGH OCCASIONALLY THE SYNCOPAL EPISODE HAS





BEEN PRECEDED BY A BOUT OF SEVERE SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA WITH HEART RATES 





OF 120-160 BEATS PER MINUTE. ADDITIONALLY, THE POSSIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION





OF HEMO- DILUTION TO THE SYMPTOMS OF POSTURAL HYPOTENSION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. 





 





TO DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SYNCOPE OR EXCESSIVE HYPOTENSION, TREATMENT





SHOULD ALWAYS BE INITIATED WITH A 1 MG DOSE OF TERAZOSIN TABLETS, GIVEN AT





BEDTIME. THE 2 MG, 5 MG AND 10 MG TABLETS ARE NOT INDICATED AS INITIAL THERAPY. 





DOSAGE SHOULD THEN BE INCREASED SLOWLY, ACCORDING TO RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE





DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION SECTION AND ADDITIONAL ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS SHOULD 





BE ADDED WITH CAUTION. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE CAUTIONED TO AVOID SITUATIONS,





SUCH AS DRIVING OR HAZARDOUS TASKS, WHERE INJURY COULD RESULT SHOULD SYNCOPE





OCCUR DURING INITIATION OF THERAPY.  





 
<p>





In early investigational studies, where increasing single doses up to 7.5





were given at 3 day intervals, tolerance to the first dose phenomenon did not





necessarily develop and the &quot;first-dose&quot; effect could be observed at all doses. 





Syncopal episodes occurred in 3 of the 14 subjects given Terazosin tablets at





doses of 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg, which are higher than the recommended initial dose; 





in addition, severe orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure falling to 50/0





mmHg) was seen in two others and dizziness, tachycardia, and lightheadedness





occurred in most subjects. These adverse effects all occurred within 90 minutes 





of dosing.  
<p>





 





In three placebo-controlled BPH studies 1, 2, and 3 (see ACTIONS/CLINICAL





PHARMACOLOGY), the incidence of postural hypotension in the terazosin treated





patients was 5.1%, 5.2%, and 3.7% respectively.  





 
<p>





In multiple dose clinical trials involving nearly 2000 hypertensive patients





treated with Terazosin tablets, syncope was reported in about 1% of patients. 





Syncope was not necessarily associated only with the first dose.  





 
<p>





IF SYNCOPE OCCURS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE PLACED IN A RECUMBENT POSITION AND





TREATED SUPPORTIVELY AS NECESSARY. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTHOSTATIC





EFFECT OF TERAZOSIN TABLETS IS GREATER, EVEN IN CHRONIC USE, SHORTLY AFTER DOSING. 



<p>


THE RISK OF THE EVENTS IS GREATEST DURING THE INITIAL SEVEN DAYS OF TREATMENT,





BUT CONTINUES AT ALL TIME INTERVALS.  





 
<p>





<a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS 





</b> 



<p>


General:  





 
<p>





PROSTATIC CANCER 





 
<p>





Carcinoma of the prostate and BPH cause many of the same symptoms. These two





diseases frequently co-exist. Therefore, patients thought to have BPH should be 





examined prior to starting Terazosin therapy to rule out the presence of carcinoma 





of the prostate.  



<p>


 





ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION 





 
<p>





While syncope is the most severe orthostatic effect of Terazosin tablets (see





Warnings), other symptoms of lowered blood pressure, such as dizziness,





lightheadedness and palpitations, were more common and occurred in some 28% of





patients in clinical trials of hypertension. In BPH clinical trials, 21% of the 





patients experienced one or more of the following: dizziness, hypotension,





postural hypotension, syncope, and vertigo. Patients with occupations in which





such events represent potential problems should be treated with particular





caution.  



<p>


 





Information For Patients (See Patient Package Insert):  





 
<p>





Patients should be made aware of the possibility of syncopal and orthostatic





symptoms, especially at the initiation of therapy, and to avoid driving or





hazardous tasks for 12 hours after the first dose, after a dosage increase and





after interruption of therapy when treatment is resumed. They should be





cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur





during initiation of Terazosin therapy. They should also be advised of the need to 





sit or lie down when symptoms of lowered blood pressure occur, although these





symptoms are not always orthostatic, and to be careful when rising from a





sitting or lying position. If dizziness, lightheadedness, or palpitations are





bothersome they should be reported to the physician, so that dose adjustment





can be considered.  



<p>


 





Patients should also be told that drowsiness or somnolence can occur with





Terazosin tablets, requiring caution in people who must drive or operate heavy





machinery.  





 
<p>





Laboratory Tests:  





 
<p>





Small but statistically significant decreases in hematocrit, hemoglobin, white





blood cells, total protein and albumin were observed in controlled clinical





trials. These laboratory findings suggested the possibility of hemodilution. 





Treatment with Terazosin for up to 24 months had no significant effect on prostate 





specific antigen (PSA) levels.  





 
<p>





Drug Interactions:  



<p>


 





In controlled trials, Terazosin tablets have been added to diuretics, and several





beta-adrenergic blockers; no unexpected interactions were observed. Terazosin





tablets have also been used in patients on a variety of concomitant therapies;





while these were not formal interaction studies, no interactions were observed. 





Terazosin tablets have been used concomitantly in at least 50 patients on the





following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g.,





acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g. 





erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole); 3)





anticholinergic/sympathomimetics (e.g., phenylephrine hydrochloride,





phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); 4) antigout





(e.g., allopurinol); 5) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 6)





cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide,





propranolol); 7) corticosteroids; 8) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids);





9) hypoglycemics; 10) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam).  





 
<p>





Use With Other Drugs:  



<p>


 





In a study (n=24) where terazosin and verapamil were administered concomitantly 





terazosin's mean AUC0-24 increased 11% after the first verapamil dose and





after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment it increased by 24% with associated





increases in Cmax (25%) and Cmin (32%) means. Terazosin mean Tmax decreased





from 1.3 hours to 0.8 hours after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment. Statistically 





significant differences were not found in the verapamil level with and without





terazosin. In a study (n=6) where terazosin and captopril were administered





concomitantly, plasma disposition of captopril was not influenced by





concomitant administration of terazosin and terazosin maximum plasma





concentrations increased linearly with dose at steady-state after





administration of terazosin plus captopril (see Dosage and Administration).  





 
<p>





Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility:  





 
<p>





Terazosin was devoid of mutagenic potential when evaluated In Vivo and In Vitro





(the Ames test, In Vivo cytogenetics, the dominant lethal test in mice, In Vivo 





Chinese hamster chromosome aberration test and V79 forward mutation assay).  





 
<p>





Terazosin, administered in the feed to rats at doses of 8, 40, and 250 mg/kg/day





for two years, was associated with a statistically significant increase in





benign adrenal medullary tumors of male rats exposed to the 250 mg/kg dose.





This dose is 695 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/55 kg





patient.  Female rats were unaffected. Terazosin was not oncogenic in mice when





administered in feed for 2 years at a maximum tolerated dose of 32 mg/kg/day.





                            



<p>


The absence of mutagenicity in a battery of tests, of tumorigenicity of any





cell type in the mouse carcinogenicity assay, of increased total tumor





incidence in either species, and of proliferative adrenal lesions in female





rats, suggests a male rat species-specific event. Numerous other diverse





pharmaceutical and chemical compounds have also been associated with benign





adrenal medullary tumors in male rats without supporting evidence for





carcinogenicity in man.  
<p>





 





The effect of Terazosin on fertility was assessed in a standard





fertility/reproductive performance study in which male and female rats were





administered oral doses of 8, 30 and 120 mg/kg/day. Four of 20 male rats given





30 mg/kg and five of 19 male rats given 120 mg/kg failed to sire a litter. 





Testicular weights and morphology were unaffected by treatment. Vaginal smears





at 30 and 120 mg/kg/day, however, appeared to contain less sperm than smears





from control matings and good correlation was reported between sperm count and





subsequent pregnancy.  
<p>





 





Oral administration of Terazosin for one or two years elicited a statistically





significant increase in the incidence of testicular atrophy in rats exposed to





40 and 250 mg/kg/day, but not in rats exposed to 8 mg/kg/day (&gt;20 times the





maximum recommended human dose). Testicular atrophy was also observed in dogs





dosed with 300 mg/kg/day (&gt;800 times the maximum recommended human dose) for





three months but not after one year when dosed with 20 mg/kg/day. This lesion





has also been seen with Minipress, another (marketed) selective-alpha-1





blocking agent.  
<p>





 





Pregnancy:  





 
<p>





Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C. Terazosin was not teratogenic in either 





rats or rabbits when administered at oral doses up to 1330 and 165 times,





respectively, the maximum recommended human dose. Fetal resorptions occurred in 





rats dosed with 480 mg/kg/day, approximately 1330 times the maximum recommended 





human dose. Increased fetal resorptions, decreased fetal weight and an





increased number of supernumerary ribs were observed in offspring of rabbits





dosed with 165 times the maximum recommended human dose. These findings (in





both species) were most likely secondary to maternal toxicity. There are no





adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women and the safety of





terazosin in pregnancy has not been established. Terazosin is not recommended





during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to





the mother and fetus.  





 
<p>





Nonteratogenic effects: In a peri- and post-natal development study in rats,





significantly more pups died in the group dosed with 120 mg/kg/day (&gt;300 times





the maximum recommended human dose) than in the control group during the three- 





week postpartum period.  





 
<p>





Nursing Mothers:  





 



<p>


It is not known whether terazosin is excreted in breast milk. Because many





drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when Terazosin





tablets are administered to a nursing woman.

In a study (n=24) where terazosin and verapamil were administered concomitantly 





terazosin's mean AUC0-24 increased 11% after the first verapamil dose and





after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment it increased by 24% with associated





increases in Cmax (25%) and Cmin (32%) means. Terazosin mean Tmax decreased





from 1.3 hours to 0.8 hours after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment. Statistically 





significant differences were not found in the verapamil level with and without





terazosin. In a study (n=6) where terazosin and captopril were administered





concomitantly, plasma disposition of captopril was not influenced by





concomitant administration of terazosin and terazosin maximum plasma





concentrations increased linearly with dose at steady-state after





administration of terazosin plus captopril (see Dosage and Administration).

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA 





 
<p>





The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from





clinical trials conducted worldwide. All adverse events reported during these





trials were recorded as adverse reactions. The incidence rates presented below





are based on combined data from six placebo-controlled trials involving once-a- 





day administration of terazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg. Table 1





summarizes those adverse events reported for patients in these trials when the





incidence rate in the terazosin group was at least 1% and was greater than that 





for the placebo group, or where the reaction is of clinical interest. Asthenia, 





postural hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, nasal congestion/rhinitis, and





impotence were the only events that were significantly (p &lt; or =0.05) more common





in patients receiving terazosin than in patients receiving placebo. The





incidence of urinary tract infection was significantly lower in the patients





receiving terazosin than in patients receiving placebo. An analysis of the





incidence rate of hypotensive adverse events (see PRECAUTIONS) adjusted for the 





length of drug treatment has shown that the risk of the events is greatest





during the initial seven days of treatment, but continues at all time





intervals.

Additional adverse events have been reported, but these are, in general, not





distinguishable from symptoms that might have occurred in the absence of





exposure to terazosin. The safety profile of patients treated in the long-term





open-label study was similar to that observed in the controlled studies.

The adverse events were usually transient and mild or moderate in intensity,





but sometimes were serious enough to interrupt treatment. In the placebo





controlled clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to adverse





events were not statistically different between the placebo and terazosin





groups. The adverse events that were bothersome, as judged by their being





reported as reasons for discontinuation of therapy by at least 0.5% of the





terazosin group and being reported more often than in the placebo group, are





shown in Table 2.

The prevalence of adverse reactions has been ascertained from clinical trials





conducted primarily in the United States. All adverse experiences (events)





reported during these trials were recorded as adverse reactions. The prevalence 





rates presented below are based on combined data from fourteen placebo-





controlled trials involving once-a-day administration of terazosin, as





monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, at doses





ranging from 1 to 40 mg. Table 3 summarizes those adverse experiences reported





for patients in these trials where the prevalence rate in the terazosin group





was at least 5%, where the prevalence rate for the terazosin group was at least 





2% and was greater than the prevalence rate for the placebo group, or where the 





reaction is of particular interest. Asthenia, blurred vision, dizziness, nasal





congestion, nausea, peripheral edema, palpitations and somnolence were the only 





symptoms that were significantly (p &lt;0.05) more common in patients receiving





terazosin than in patients receiving placebo. Similar adverse reaction rates





were observed in placebo-controlled monotherapy trials.

short- or long-term clinical trials or have been reported during marketing





experience: Body As A Whole: chest pain, facial edema, fever, abdominal pain,





neck pain, shoulder pain; Cardiovascular System: arrhythmia, vasodilation;





Digestive System: constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence,





vomiting; Metabolic/Nutritional Disorders: gout; Musculoskeletal System: 





arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia; Nervous System: anxiety,





insomnia; Respiratory System: bronchitis, cold symptoms, epistaxis, flu





symptoms, increased cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis; Skin And Appendages: pruritus 





rash, sweating; Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, tinnitus;





Urogenital System: urinary frequency, urinary incontinence primarily reported





in postmenopausal women, urinary tract infection.  



<p>








Post-marketing experience indicates that in rare instances patients may develop 





allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, following administration of Terazosin





tablets.  



<p>


 





The adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity but sometimes





were serious enough to interrupt treatment. The adverse reactions that were





most bothersome, as judged by their being reported as reasons for





discontinuation of therapy by at least 0.5% of the terazosin group and being





reported more often than in the placebo group, are shown in Table 4. <p>

<a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE 





</b> 
<p>





Should overdosage of Terazosin lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular





system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization





of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine





position.  If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with





volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used and renal





function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate





that Terazosin is highly protein bound; therefore, dialysis may not be of benefit. 



<p>


 





<a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 











</b><p>


If Terazosin administration is discontinued for several days, therapy should be





reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen.  





 <p>






BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA:  



<p>


 





INITIAL DOSE:  





 <p>






1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not 





be exceeded as an initial dose. Patients should be closely followed during





initial administration in order to minimize the risk of severe hypotensive





response.  





 <p>






SUBSEQUENT DOSES:  



<p>


 





The dose should be increased in a stepwise fashion to 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg once 





daily to achieve the desired improvement of symptoms and/or flow rates. Doses





of 10 mg once daily are generally required for the clinical response. Therefore 





treatment with 10 mg for a minimum of 4-6 weeks may be required to assess





whether a beneficial response has been achieved. Some patients may not achieve





a clinical response despite appropriate titration. Although some additional





patients responded at a 20 mg daily dose, there was an insufficient number of





patients studied to draw definitive conclusions about this dose. There are





insufficient data to support the use of higher doses for those patients who





show inadequate or no response to 20 mg daily.  





 
<p>





USE WITH OTHER DRUGS:  





 
<p>





Caution should be observed when Terazosin tablets are administered concomitantly





with other antihypertensive agents, especially the calcium channel blocker





verapamil, to avoid the possibility of developing significant hypotension. When 





using Terazosin tablets and other antihypertensive agents concomitantly, dosage





reduction and retitration of either agent may be necessary (see Precautions). 





 
<p>





HYPERTENSION:  


<p>



 





The dose of Terazosin and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted





according to the patient's individual blood pressure response. The following is 





a guide to its administration:  





 <p>






INITIAL DOSE:  


<p>



 





1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not 





be exceeded. This initial dosing regimen should be strictly observed to





minimize the potential for severe hypotensive effects.  





 <p>






SUBSEQUENT DOSES:  


<p>



 





The dose may be slowly increased to achieve the desired blood pressure





response.  The usual recommended dose range is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a 





day; however, some patients may benefit from doses as high as 20 mg per day.





Doses over 20 mg do not appear to provide further blood pressure effect and





doses over 40 mg have not been studied. Blood pressure should be monitored at





the end of the dosing interval to be sure control is maintained throughout the





interval. It may also be helpful to measure blood pressure 2-3 hours after





dosing to see if the maximum and minimum responses are similar, and to evaluate 





symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations which can result from excessive





hypotensive response.  If response is substantially diminished at 24 hours an





increased dose or use of a twice daily regimen can be considered. IF TERAZOSIN





ADMINISTRATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS OR LONGER, THERAPY SHOULD BE





REINSTITUTED USING THE INITIAL DOSING REGIMEN. In clinical trials, except for





the initial dose, the dose was given in the morning.

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Avoid Pregnancy </p>

<p><b>CONTRAINDICATION AND WARNING: Isotretinoin must not be used by females
who are pregnant or who may become pregnant while undergoing treatment.
Although not every fetus exposed to Isotretinoin has resulted in a deformed
child, there is an extremely high risk that a deformed infant can result
if pregnancy occurs while taking Isotretinoin in any amount even for short
periods. Potentially any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected.
Presently, there is no accurate means of determining after Isotretinoin
exposure which fetus has been affected and which fetus has not been affected.
Isotretinoin is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless
the PATIENT MEETS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: </b></p>

<p><b>- has severe disfiguring nodular acne that is recalcitrant to standard
therapies (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE section for definition)</b></p>

<p><b> - is reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions </b></p>

<p><b>- is capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures
</b></p>

<p><b>- has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of taking
Isotretinoin during pregnancy and the exposing a fetus to the drug </b></p>

<p><b>- has received both oral and written warnings of the risk of possible
contraception failure and of the need to use two reliable forms of contraception
simultaneously, unless abstinence is the chosen method, or the patient
has undergone a hysterectomy and has acknowledged in writing her understanding
of these warnings and of the need for using dual contraceptive methods
</b></p>

<p><b>- has had a negative serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at
least 50 mIU/ml within one week prior to beginning therapy </b></p>

<p><b>- will begin therapy only on the second or third day of the next
normal menstrual period </b></p>

<p><b>It is recommended that a prescription for Isotretinoin should not
be issued by the physician until a report of a negative pregnancy test
has been obtained and the patient has begun her menstrual period. It is
also recommended that pregnancy testing and contraception counseling be
repeated on a monthly basis. To encourage compliance with this recommendation,
the physician should prescribe no more than a 1 month supply of the drug.
Major human fetal abnormalities related to Isotretinoin administration
have been documented: CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities,
cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit);
skull abnormality; external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna,
small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including
microphthalmia); cardiovascular abnormalities; facial dysmorphia; thymus
gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases death
has occurred with certain of the abnormalities previously noted. Cases
of IQ scores less than 85 with or without obvious CNS abnormalities have
also been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
In addition, premature births have been reported. </b></p>

<p><b>Effective contraception must be used for at least 1 month before
beginning Isotretinoin therapy, during therapy and for 1 month following
discontinuation of therapy even where there has been a history of infertility,
unless due to hysterectomy. It is recommended that two reliable forms of
contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method.
If pregnancy does occur during treatment, the physician and patient should
discuss the desirability of continuing the pregnancy. Isotretinoin should
be prescribed only by physicians who have special competence in the diagnosis
and treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne, are experienced in the
use of systemic retinoids and understand the risk of teratogenicity if
Isotretinoin is used during pregnancy. </b></p>

<p>Isotretinoin , is a retinoid which inhibits sebaceous gland function
and keratinization. Chemically, isotretinoin is 13-cis-retinoic acid and
is related to both retinoic acid and retinol (vitamin A). It is a yellow-orange
to orange crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 300.44. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</p>

<p>The exact mechanism of action of Isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne:
Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with
a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary
and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Isotretinoin,
and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous
gland differentiation.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetic
profile of isotretinoin is predictable and can be described using linear
pharmacokinetic theory. </p>

<p>After oral administration of 80 mg (two 40-mg capsules), peak blood
concentrations ranged from 167 to 459 ng/ml (mean 256 ng/ml) and mean time
to peak was 3.2 hours in normal volunteers, while in acne patients peak
concentrations ranged from 98 to 535 ng/ml (mean 262 ng/ml) with a mean
time to peak of 2.9 hours. The drug is 99.9% bound in human plasma almost
exclusively to albumin. The terminal elimination half-life of isotretinoin
ranged from 10 to 20 hours in volunteers and patients. Following an 80-mg
liquid suspension oral dose of 14C-isotretinoin, 14C-activity in blood
declined with a half-life of 90 hours. Relatively equal amounts of radioactivity
were recovered in the urine and feces with 65% to 83% of the dose recovered.
The major identified metabolite in blood is 4-oxo-isotretinoin. The mean
elimination half-life of this metabolite is 25 hours (range 17-50 hours).
Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinoin were also observed. After two 40-mg capsules
of isotretinoin, maximum concentrations of the metabolite of 87 to 399
ng/ml occurred at 6 to 20 hours. The blood concentration of the major metabolite
generally exceeded that of isotretinoin after 6 hours. </p>

<p>When taken with food or milk, the oral absorption of isotretinoin is
increased. </p>

<p>The mean &amp;177 SD minimum steady-state blood concentration of isotretinoin
was 160 &amp;177 19 ng/ml in ten patients receiving 40-mg b.i.d. doses.
After single and multiple doses, the mean ratio of areas under the blood
concentration:time curves of 4-oxo-isotretinoin to isotretinoin was 3 to
3.5. </p>

<p>Tissue Distribution in Animals: Tissue distribution of 14C-isotretinoin
in rats after oral dosing revealed high concentrations of radioactivity
in many tissues after 15 minutes, with a maximum in 1 hour, and declining
to nondetectable levels by 24 hours in most tissues. After 7 days, however,
low levels of radioactivity were detected in the liver, ureter, adrenal,
ovary and lacrimal gland. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Severe recalcitrant nodular acne: Isotretinoin is indicated for the
treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory
lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative
or hemorrhagic. &quot;Severe,&quot; by definition,2 means &quot;many&quot;
as opposed to &quot;few or several&quot; nodules. Because of significant
adverse effects associated with its use, Isotretinoin should be reserved
for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional
therapy, including systemic antibiotics. </p>

<p>A single course of therapy has been shown to result in complete and
prolonged remission of disease in many patients.1,3,4&nbsp;If a second
course of therapy is needed, it should not to be initiated until at least
8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown
that patients may continue to improve while off Isotretinoin.</p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b> CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Pregnancy: Category X. See boxed CONTRAINDICATION AND WARNING. </p>

<p>Isotretinoin should not be given to patients who are sensitive to parabens,
which are used as preservatives in the gelatin capsule. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>Pseudotumor cerebri: Isotretinoin use has been associated with a number
of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension). Early
signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache,
nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms
should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told
to discontinue Isotretinoin immediately and be referred to a neurologist
for further diagnosis and care. </p>

<p>Decreased Night Vision: A number of cases of decreased night vision
have occurred during Isotretinoin therapy. Because the onset in some patients
was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned
to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Visual problems
should be carefully monitored. </p>

<p>Corneal Opacities: Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving
Isotretinoin for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were
used in patients with disorders of keratinization. All Isotretinoin patients
experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue the drug and have an
ophthalmological examination. The corneal opacities that have been observed
in patients treated with Isotretinoin have either completely resolved or
were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug.
See ADVERSE REACTIONS. </p>

<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Isotretinoin has been temporally associated
with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients
without a prior history of intestinal disorders. Patients experiencing
abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue Isotretinoin
immediately. </p>

<p>Lipids: Blood lipid determinations should be performed before Isotretinoin
is given and then at intervals until the lipid response to Isotretinoin
is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. See PRECAUTIONS. </p>

<p>Approximately 25% of patients receiving Isotretinoin experienced an
elevation in plasma triglycerides. Approximately 15% developed a decrease
in high density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol
levels. These effects on triglycerides, HDL and cholesterol were reversible
upon cessation of Isotretinoin therapy. </p>

<p>Patients with increased tendency to develop hypertriglyceridemia include
those with diabetes mellitus, obesity, increased alcohol intake and familial
history. </p>

<p>The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia are not well
understood, but may increase the patient's risk status. In addition, elevation
of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dl has been associated with
acute pancreatitis. Therefore, every attempt should be made to control
significant triglyceride elevation. Some patients have been able to reverse
triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat
and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing Isotretinoin.5 An obese
male patient with Darier's disease developed elevated triglycerides and
subsequent eruptive xanthomas.&nbsp;&nbsp;6 </p>

<p>Hyperostosis: In clinical trials of disorders of keratinization with
a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day, a high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis
was noted. Two children showed x-ray findings suggestive of premature closure
of the epiphysis. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in 6 of
8 patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization.7 Minimal
skeletal hyperostosis has also been observed by x-rays in prospective studies
of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended
doses. </p>

<p>Hepatotoxicity: Several cases of clinical hepatitis have been noted
which are considered to be possibly or probably related to Isotretinoin
therapy. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have
been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical
trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration
of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is
suspected during treatment with Isotretinoin, the drug should be discontinued
and the etiology further investigated. </p>

<p>Animal Studies: In rats given 32 or 8 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin for
18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and
inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and
mesenteric arteries and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa
were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and
myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary
arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of
treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>In dogs given isotretinoin chronically at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day,
corneal ulcers and corneal opacities were encountered at a higher incidence
than in control dogs. In general, these ocular changes tended to revert
toward normal when treatment with isotretinoin was stopped, but did not
completely clear during the observation period. </p>

<p>In rats given isotretinoin at a dosage of 32 mg/kg/day for approximately
15 weeks, long bone fracture has been observed. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>Information for Patients: Women of childbearing potential should be
instructed that they must not be pregnant when Isotretinoin therapy is
initiated, and that they should use effective contraception while taking
Isotretinoin and for 1 month after Isotretinoin has been stopped. They
should also sign a consent form prior to beginning Isotretinoin therapy.
See boxed CONTRAINDICATION AND WARNING. Because of the relationship of
Isotretinoin to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin
supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. </p>

<p>Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation of acne has
been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Patients should
be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses
during and after therapy. </p>

<p>It is recommended that patients not donate blood during therapy and
for at least 1 month following discontinuance of the drug. Laboratory Tests:
The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 1 patient in 4 on Isotretinoin
therapy. Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under
fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol at least 36 hours should
elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these
tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response
to Isotretinoin is established. Since elevations of liver enzymes have
been observed during clinical trials, pretreatment and follow-up liver
function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until
the response to Isotretinoin has been established. </p>

<p>Certain patients receiving Isotretinoin have experienced problems in
the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have
been diagnosed during Isotretinoin therapy, although no causal relationship
has been established. Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity
while on Isotretinoin therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however,
the clinical significance is unknown. </p>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: In Fischer 344
rats given isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day for greater than
18 months, there was an increased incidence of pheochromocytoma. The incidence
of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage.
The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in
the Fischer 344 rat makes it a poor model for study of this tumor, since
the increase in adrenal medullary proliferative lesions following chronic
treatment with relatively high dosages of isotretinoin may be an accentuation
of a genetic predisposition in the Fischer 344 rat, and its relevance to
the human population is not clear. In addition, a decreased incidence of
liver adenomas, liver angiomas and leukemia was noted at the dose levels
of 8 and 32 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>The Ames test was conducted in two laboratories. The results of the
tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a
weakly-positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium
TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose-response
effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other
tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse
micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay
in human-derived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were
all negative. </p>

<p>No adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate,
gestation or parturition were observed at dose levels of 2, 8 or 32 mg/kg/day
in male and female rats. </p>

<p>In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with isotretinoin
for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day. In general,
there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis
but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance
were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies in 66 human males, 30
of whom were patients with nodular acne, no significant changes were noted
in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of
50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving Isotretinoin therapy for nodular
acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count,
total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. </p>

<p>Pregnancy: Category X. See boxed CONTRAINDICATION AND WARNING. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human
milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should
not receive Isotretinoin. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Clinical: Many of the side effects and adverse reactions seen or expected
in patients receiving Isotretinoin are similar to those described in patients
taking high doses of vitamin A. The percentages of adverse reactions listed
below reflect the total experience in Isotretinoin studies, including investigational
studies of disorders of keratinization, with the exception of those pertaining
to dry skin and mucous membranes. These latter reflect the experience only
in patients with nodular acne because reactions relating to dryness are
more commonly recognized as adverse reactions in this disease. Included
in this category are dry skin, skin fragility, pruritus, epistaxis, dry
nose and dry mouth, which may be seen in up to 80% of nodular acne patients.
</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reaction to Isotretinoin is cheilitis, which
occurs in over 90% of patients. A less frequent reaction was conjunctivitis
(about 2 patients in 5). </p>

<p>Skeletal hyperostosis has been observed on x-rays of patients treated
with Isotretinoin. See WARNINGS. Other types of bone abnormalities have
also been reported; however, no causal relationship has been established.
Approximately 16% of patients treated with Isotretinoin developed musculoskeletal
symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these were
mild to moderate and have occasionally required discontinuation of drug.
Less frequently, transient pain in the chest has also been reported. These
symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of Isotretinoin
but in rare cases have persisted. Less than 1 patient in 10 experienced
rash (including erythema, seborrhea and eczema); thinning of hair, which
in rare cases has persisted. Approximately 1 patient in 20 experienced
peeling of palms and soles, skin infections, nonspecific urogenital findings,
nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, headache and increased
susceptibility to sunburn. </p>

<p>Isotretinoin has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor
cerebri, some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. See WARNINGS.
</p>

<p>The following CNS reactions have been reported and may bear no relationship
to therapy-seizures, emotional instability, dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness,
malaise, weakness, insomnia, lethargy and paresthesias. </p>

<p>Depression has been reported in some patients on Isotretinoin therapy.
In some of these patients, this has subsided with discontinuation of therapy
and recurred with reinstitution of therapy. The following reactions have
been reported in less than 1% of patients and may bear no relationship
to therapy--changes in skin pigment (hypo- and hyperpigmentation), flushing,
urticaria, bruising, disseminated herpes simplex, edema, hair problems
(other than thinning), hirsutism, respiratory infections, weight loss,
erythema nodosum, paronychia, nail dystrophy, bleeding and inflammation
of the gums, abnormal menses, optic neuritis, photophobia, eye lid inflammation,
arthritis, anemia, palpitation, tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, sweating,
tinnitus and voice alteration. </p>

<p>A few isolated reports of vasculitis, including Wegener's granulomatosis,
have been received, but no causal relationship to Isotretinoin therapy
has been established. </p>

<p>In Isotretinoin studies to date, of 72 patients who had normal pretreatment
ophthalmological examinations, 5 developed corneal opacities while on Isotretinoin
(all 5 patients had a disorder of keratinization). Corneal opacities have
also been reported in nodular acne patients treated with Isotretinoin.
See WARNINGS. Dry eyes and decrease in night vision have been reported
and in rare instances have persisted. See WARNINGS. Cataracts and visual
disturbances have also been reported. Isotretinoin has been temporally
associated with inflammatory bowel disease. See WARNINGS. </p>

<p>As may be seen with healing nodular acne lesions, an occasional exaggerated
healing response, manifested by exuberant granulation tissue with crusting,
has been reported in patients receiving therapy with Isotretinoin. Pyogenic
granuloma has also been diagnosed in a number of cases. </p>

<p>Laboratory: Isotretinoin therapy induces change in serum lipids in a
significant number of treated subjects. Approximately 25% of patients had
elevation of plasma triglycerides. Five out of 135 patients treated for
nodular acne and 32 out of 298 total subjects treated for all diagnoses
showed an elevation of triglycerides above 500 mg percent. About 16% of
patients showed a mild to moderate decrease in serum high density lipoprotein
(HDL) levels while receiving treatment with Isotretinoin and about 7% of
patients experienced minimal elevations of serum cholesterol during treatment.
Abnormalities of serum triglycerides, HDL and cholesterol were reversible
upon cessation of Isotretinoin therapy. Approximately 40% of patients receiving
Isotretinoin developed elevated sedimentation rates, often from elevated
baseline values. From 1 in 10 to 1 in 5 patients showed decreases in red
blood cell parameters and white blood cell counts, elevated platelet counts,
white cells in the urine, increased alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, GGTP
or LDH. See WARNINGS: </p>

<p>Hepatotoxicity. Less than 1 in 10 patients showed proteinuria, microscopic
or gross hematuria, elevated fasting blood sugar, elevated CPK, hyperuricemia
or thrombocytopenia. </p>

<p>Dose Relationship and Duration: Cheilitis and hypertriglyceridemia are
usually dose-related. </p>

<p>Most adverse reactions were reversible when therapy was discontinued;
however, some have persisted after cessation of therapy. (See WARNINGS
and ADVERSE REACTIONS.) </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>The oral LD50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mg/kg in rats and
mice and is approximately 1960 mg/kg in rabbits. Overdose has been associated
with transient headache, vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal
pain, headache, dizziness and ataxia. All symptoms quickly resolved without
apparent residual effects. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>The recommended dosage range for Isotretinoin is 0.5 to 2 mg/kg given
in 2 divided doses daily for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1,
0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day,7 it was found that all doses provided initial clearing
of disease but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower
dose(s). </p>

<p>It is recommended that for most patients the initial dose of Isotretinoin
be 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day. Patients whose disease is very severe or is primarily
manifest on the body may require up to the maximum recommended dose, 2
mg/kg/day. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response
of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects- -some of
which may be dose-related. </p>

<p>If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to
completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After
a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent
or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated.
Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy.
</p>

<p>Isotretinoin should be administered with food. </p>

<p>PATIENT INFORMATION/CONSENT: </p>

<p>Isotretinoin must not be used by females who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant while undergoing treatment. </p>

<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WARNING: </p>

<p>Isotretinoin can cause severe birth defects if it is taken when a woman
is pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that you will have a severely
deformed baby if: </p>

<p>you are pregnant when you start taking Isotretinoin, </p>

<p>you become pregnant while you are taking Isotretinoin, </p>

<p>you do not wait at least 1 month after you stop taking Isotretinoin
before becoming pregnant. </p>

<p>It is recommended that you and your doctor schedule an appointment every
month to repeat the pregnancy test and check your body's response to Isotretinoin.
For your health and well-being, be sure to keep your appointments as scheduled.
</p>

<p>THE CONSENT: </p>

<p>My treatment with Isotretinoin has been personally explained to me by
my doctor. </p>

<p>The following points of information, among others, have been specifically
discussed and made clear: </p>

<p>1. I, (Patient's Name) understand that Isotretinoin is a very powerful
medicine used to treat severe nodular acne that did not get better with
other treatments including oral antibiotics. </p>

<p>2. I understand that I must not take Isotretinoin if I am or may become
pregnant during treatment. </p>

<p>3. I understand that severe birth defects have occurred in babies of
women who took Isotretinoin during pregnancy. I have been warned by my
doctor that there is an extremely high risk of severe damage to my unborn
baby if I am or become pregnant while taking Isotretinoin. </p>

<p>4. I have been told by my doctor that effective birth control (contraception)
must be used for at least 1 month before starting Isotretinoin, all during
Isotretinoin therapy and for at least 1 month after Isotretinoin treatment
has stopped. My doctor has recommended that I either abstain from sexual
intercourse or use two reliable kinds of birth control at the same time.
I have also been told that any method of birth control can fail. I must
use two forms of reliable birth control simultaneously even if I think
I cannot become pregnant, unless I abstain from sexual intercourse or have
had a hysterectomy. </p>

<p>5. I know that I must have a blood or urine test that shows I am not
pregnant within two weeks before starting Isotretinoin, and I understand
that I must wait until the second or third day of my next normal menstrual
period before starting Isotretinoin. </p>

<p>6. My doctor has told me that I can participate in the &quot;Patient
Referral&quot; program for an initial free pregnancy test and birth control
counseling session by a consulting physician. </p>

<p>7. I also know that I must immediately stop taking Isotretinoin if I
become pregnant while taking the drug and immediately contact my doctor
to discuss the desirability of continuing the pregnancy. I also know that
I must immediately contact my doctor if I become pregnant during the month
after stopping Isotretinoin. </p>

<p>8. I have carefully read the Isotretinoin patient brochure, &quot;Important
information concerning your treatment with Isotretinoin,&quot;given to
me by my doctor. I understand all of its contents and have talked over
any questions I have with my doctor. </p>

<p>9. I am not now pregnant, nor do I plan to become pregnant for at least
30 days after I have completely finished taking Isotretinoin. </p>

<p>10. My doctor has told me that I can participate in a survey concerning
Isotretinoin use in women by completing an additional form. </p>

<p>I now authorize my doctor to begin my treatment with Isotretinoin. </p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Record of patient's name, address, phone number, and signature) I have
fully explained to the patient the nature and purpose of the treatment
described above and the risks to women of childbearing potential. I have
asked the patient if she has any questions regarding her treatment with
Isotretinoin and have answered those questions to the best of my ability.

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<pre>Each tablet of Oxycodone &amp; ASA contains:  
Oxycodone hydrochloride :  4.50 mg* 
WARNING:  May be habit forming
Oxycodone terephthalate :  0.38 mg**
WARNING:  May be habit forming
Aspirin, USP :  325 mg
* 4.50 mg oxycodone HCl is equivalent to 4.0338 mg of oxycodone.
** 0.38 mg oxycodone terephthalate is equivalent to 0.3008 mg of oxycodone.
The oxycodone component is 14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone, a white odorless
crystalline powder which is derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine.</pre>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>The principal ingredient, oxycodone, is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic
with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most
prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs composed
of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value of the oxycodone
in Oxycodone &amp; ASA are analgesia and sedation. </p>

<p>Oxycodone is similar to codeine and methadone in that it retains at
least one- half of its analgesic activity when administered orally. Oxycodone
&amp; ASA also contains the non-narcotic antipyretic-analgesic, aspirin.
</p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>For the relief of moderate to moderately severe pain. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to oxycodone or aspirin. </p>

<p><a name="WARNINGS"></a><b>WARNINGS </b></p>

<p>DRUG DEPENDENCE: Oxycodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine
type and, therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence,
physical dependence and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration
of Oxycodone &amp; ASA, and it should be prescribed and administered with
the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other oral narcotic-containing
medications. Like other narcotic-containing medications, Oxycodone &amp;
ASA is subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. </p>

<p>USAGE IN AMBULATORY PATIENTS: Oxycodone may impair the mental and/or
physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous
tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient using Oxycodone
&amp; ASA should be cautioned accordingly. </p>

<p>INTERACTION WITH OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS: Patients
receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines,
other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including
alcohol) concomitantly with Oxycodone &amp; ASA may exhibit an additive
CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of
one or both agents should be reduced. </p>

<p>USAGE IN PREGNANCY: Safe use in pregnancy has not been established relative
to possible adverse effects on fetal development. Therefore, Oxycodone
&amp; ASA should not be used in pregnant women unless, in the judgment
of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.
</p>

<p>USAGE IN CHILDREN: Oxycodone &amp; ASA should not be administered to
children. Consider Half Strength tablets for children. </p>

<p>REYE SYNDROME is a rare but serious disease which can follow flu or
chicken pox in children and teenagers. While the cause of Reye Syndrome
is unknown, some reports claim aspirin (or salicylates) may increase the
risk of developing this disease. </p>

<p>Salicylates should be used with caution in the presence of peptic ulcer
or coagulation abnormalities. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>HEAD INJURY AND INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE: The respiratory depressant
effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid
pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other
intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.
Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the
clinical course of patients with head injuries. </p>

<p>ACUTE ABDOMINAL CONDITIONS: The administration of Oxycodone &amp; ASA
or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients
with acute abdominal conditions. </p>

<p>SPECIAL RISK PATIENTS: Oxycodone &amp; ASA should be given with caution
to certain patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and those with
severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's
disease, and prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The CNS depressant effects of Oxycodone &amp; ASA may be additive with
that of other CNS depressants. (See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p>Aspirin may enhance the effect of anticoagulants and inhibit the uricosuric
effects of uricosuric agents. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness,
dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more
prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients, and some of these
adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions include euphoria, dysphoria, constipation and
pruritus. </p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: </p>

<p>Oxycodone &amp; ASA tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance.
Oxycodone can produce drug dependence and has the potential for being abused.
(See WARNINGS.) </p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Serious overdose with Oxycodone &amp; ASA is characterized
by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal
volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing
to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and
sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory
collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. The ingestion of very large
amounts of Oxycodone &amp; ASA may, in addition, result in acute salicylate
intoxication. </p>

<p>TREATMENT: Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment
of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and
the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The narcotic antagonist
naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against respiratory depression
which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to narcotics including
oxycodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should
be administered (usual initial adult dose: 0.4 mg-2 mg) preferably by the
intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation.
</p>

<p>Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist,
the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses
of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate
respiration. </p>

<p>Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other supportive measures
should be employed as indicated. </p>

<p>Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and
the response of the patient. It may occasionally be necessary to exceed
the usual dosage recommended below in cases of more severe pain or in those
patients who have become tolerant to the analgesic effect of narcotics.
Oxycodone &amp; ASA is given orally. The usual adult dose is one tablet
every 6 hours as needed for pain. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Lansoprazole (supplied as delayed-release capsules) is a substituted
benzimidazole, 2-(((3-methyl- 4-(2,2,2-trifluroethoxy)-2- pyridyl)methyl)sulfiny
l) benzimidazole, a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Its
empirical formula is C16H14F3N3O2S with a molecular weight of 369.37. </p>

<p>Lansoprazole is a white to brownish-white odorless, crystalline powder
which melts with decomposition at approximately 166 deg C. Lansoprazole
is freely soluble in dimethylformamide; soluble in methanol; sparingly
soluble in ethanol; slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, dichloromethane
and acetonitrile; very slightly soluble in ether; and practically insoluble
in hexane and water. Lansoprazole is stable when exposed to light for up
to two months. The compound degrades in aqueous solution, the rate of degradation
increasing with decreasing pH. At 25 deg C the t1/2 is approximately 0.5
hour at pH 5.0 and approximately 18 hours at pH 7.0. </p>

<p>Lansoprazole is supplied in delayed-release capsules for oral administration.
The delayed-release capsules contain the active ingredient, lansoprazole,
in the form of enteric-coated granules and are available in two dosage
strengths; 15 mg and 30 mg of lansoprazole per capsule. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM </p>

<p>Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules contain an enteric-coated granule
formulation lansoprazole. Absorption of lansoprazole begins only after
the granules leave the stomach. Absorption is rapid, with mean peak plasma
levels of lansoprazole occurring after approximately 1.7 hours. Peak plasma
concentrations of lansoprazole (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration
curve (AUC) of lansoprazole are approximately proportional in doses from
15 mg to 60 mg after single-oral administration. Lansoprazole does not
accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered by multiple dosing. </p>

<p>ABSORPTION </p>

<p>The absorption of lansoprazole is rapid, with mean Cmax occurring approximately
1.7 hours after oral dosing, and relatively complete with absolute bioavailability
over 80%. In healthy subjects, the mean (+/- SD) plasma half- life was
1.5 (+/- 1.0) hours. Both Cmax and AUC are diminished by about 50% if the
drug is given 30 minutes after food as opposed to the fasting condition.
There is no significant food effect if the drug is given before meals.
</p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p>Lansoprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding
is constant over the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 mcgm/mL. </p>

<p>METABOLISM </p>

<p>Lansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver. Two metabolites
have been identified in measurable quantities in plasma (the hydroxylated
sulfinyl and sulfone derivatives of lansoprazole). These metabolites have
very little or no antisecretory activity. Lansoprazole is thought to be
transformed into two active species which inhibit acid secretion by (H+,
K+)- ATPase within the parietal cell canaliculus, but are not present in
the system circulation. The plasma elimination half-life of lansoprazole
does not reflect its duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion.
Thus, the plasma elimination half-life is less than two hours while the
acid inhibitory effect lasts more than 24 hours. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION </p>

<p>Following single-dose oral administration of lansoprazole, virtually
no unchanged lansoprazole was excreted in the urine. In one study, after
a single oral dose of 14C-lansoprazole, approximately one-third of the
administered radiation was excreted in the urine and two- thirds was recovered
in the feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the metabolites
of lansoprazole. </p>

<p>SPECIAL POPULATIONS </p>

<p>GERIATRIC </p>

<p>The clearance of lansoprazole is decreased in the elderly, with elimination
half-life increased approximately 50% to 100%. Because the mean half- life
in the elderly remains between 1.9 to 2.9 hours, repeated once daily dosing
does not result in accumulation of lansoprazole. Peak plasma levels were
not increased in the elderly. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC </p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole has not been investigated in patients
&lt;18 years of age. </p>

<p>GENDER </p>

<p>In a study comparing 12 male and six female human subjects, no gender
differences were found in pharmacokinetics and intragastric pH results
(also see Use in Women). </p>

<p>RENAL INSUFFICIENCY </p>

<p>In patients with severe renal insufficiency, plasma protein binding
decreased by 1.0%-1.5% after administration of 60 mg of lansoprazole. Patients
with renal insufficiency had a shortened elimination half-life and decreased
total AUC (free and bound). AUC for free lansoprazole in plasma, however,
was not related to the degree of renal impairment, and Cmax and Tmax were
not different from subjects with healthy kidneys. </p>

<p>HEPATIC INSUFFICIENCY </p>

<p>In patients with various degrees of chronic hepatic disease, the mean
plasma half-life of the drug was prolonged from 1.5 hours to 3.2-7.2 hours.
An increase in mean AUC of up to 500% was observed at steady state in hepatically-impaired
patients compared to healthy subjects. Dose reduction in patients with
severe hepatic disease should be considered. </p>

<p>PHARMACODYNAMICS </p>

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION </p>

<p>Lansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted
benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H2-receptor
antagonist properties, but that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific
inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface
of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as
the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, lansoprazole has been
characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final
step of acid production. This effect is dose- related and leads to inhibition
of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the
stimulus. </p>

<p>ANTISECRETORY ACTIVITY </p>

<p>After oral administration, lansoprazole was shown to significantly decrease
the basal acid output and significantly increase the mean gastric pH and
percent of time the gastric pH was &gt;3 and &gt;4. Lansoprazole also significantly
reduced meal- stimulated gastric acid output and secretion volume, as well
as pentagastrin- stimulated acid output. In patients with hypersecretion
of acid, lansoprazole significantly reduced basal and pentagastrin-stimulated
gastric acid secretion. Lansoprazole inhibited the normal increases in
secretion volume, acidity and acid output induced by insulin. </p>

<p>In a crossover study comparing lansoprazole 15 and 30 mg with omeprazole
20 mg for five days, the following effects on intragastric pH were noted:

*  (p&lt;0.05) versus baseline, lansoprazole 15 mg and omeprazole 20 mg.
+  (p&lt;0.05) versus baseline only.</pre>

<p>After the initial dose in this study, increased gastric pH was seen
within 1-2 hours with lansoprazole 30 mg, 2-3 hours with lansoprazole 15
mg, and 3-4 hours with omeprazole 20 mg. After multiple daily dosing, increased
gastric pH was seen within the first hour postdosing with lansoprazole
30 mg and within 1-2 hours postdosing with lansoprazole 15 mg and omeprazole
20 mg. The inhibition of gastric acid secretion as measured by intragastric
pH returns gradually to normal over two to four days after multiple doses.
There is no indication of rebound gastric acidity. </p>

<p>ENTEROCHROMAFFIN-LIKE (ECL) CELL EFFECTS </p>

<p>During lifetime exposure of rats with up to 150 mg/kg/day of lansoprazole
dosed seven days per week, marked hypergastrinemia was observed followed
by ECL cell proliferation and formation of carcinoid tumors, especially
in female rats (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Fertility).
</p>

<p>Gastric biopsy specimens from the body of the stomach from approximately
150 patients treated continuously with lansoprazole for at least one year
have not shown evidence of ECL cell effects similar to those seen in rat
studies. Longer term data are needed to rule out the possibility of an
increased risk of the development of gastric tumors in patients receiving
long-term therapy with lansoprazole. </p>

<p>OTHER GASTRIC EFFECTS IN HUMANS </p>

<p>Lansoprazole did not significantly affect mucosal blood flow in the
fundus of the stomach. Due to the normal, physiologic effect caused by
the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, a decrease of about 17% in blood
flow in the antrum, pylorus and duodenal bulb was seen. Lansoprazole significantly
slowed the gastric emptying of digestible solids. Lansoprazole increased
serum pepsinogen levels and decreased pepsin activity under basal conditions
and in response to meal stimulation or insulin injection. As with other
agents that elevate intragastric pH, increases in gastric pH were associated
with increases in nitrate-reducing bacteria and elevation of nitrite concentration
in gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcer. No significant increase
in nitrosamine concentrations was observed. </p>

<p>SERUM GASTRIN EFFECTS </p>

<p>In over 2100 patients, median fasting serum gastrin levels increased
50% to 100% from baseline, but remained within normal range after treatment
with lansoprazole given orally in doses of 15 mg to 60 mg. These elevations
reached a plateau within two months of therapy and returned to pretreatment
levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy. </p>

<p>ENDOCRINE EFFECTS </p>

<p>Human studies for up to eight weeks have not detected any clinically
significant effects on the endocrine system. Hormones studied include testosterone,
luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), prolactin,
cortisol, estradiol, insulin, aldosterone, parathormone, glucagon, thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and somatotropic
hormone (STH). Lansoprazole in oral doses of 15 to 60 mg for up to one
year, had no clinically significant effect on sexual function. In addition,
lansoprazole in oral doses of 15 to 60 mg for two to eight weeks had no
clinically significant effect on thyroid function. </p>

<p>In 24-month carcinogenicity studies in Sprague- Dawley rats with daily
dosages up to 150 mg/kg, proliferative changes in the Leydig cells of the
testes, including benign neoplasm, were increased compared to control rates.
</p>

<p>OTHER EFFECTS </p>

<p>No systemic effects of lansoprazole on the central nervous system, lymphoid,
hematopoietic, renal hepatic, cardiovascular or respiratory systems have
been found in humans. No visual toxicity was observed among 56 patients
who had extensive baseline eye evaluations, were treated with up to 180
mg/day of lansoprazole and were observed for up to 58 months. Other rat-specific
findings after lifetime exposure included focal pancreatic atrophy, diffuse
lymphoid hyperplasia in the thymus, and spontaneous retinal atrophy. </p>

<p>CLINICAL STUDIES </p>

<p>DUODENAL ULCER </p>

<p>In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo- controlled, dose-response
(15, 30, and 60 mg of Lansoprazole once daily) study of 284 patients with
endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed
after two and four weeks was significantly higher with all doses of Lansoprazole
than with placebo. There was no evidence of a greater or earlier response
with the two higher doses compared with Lansoprazole 15 mg. Based on this
study and the second study described below, the recommended dose of Lansoprazole
in duodenal ulcer is 15 mg per day.</p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   (p&lt; or =0.001) versus placebo.</pre>

<p>Lansoprazole 15 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in
relieving day and nighttime abdominal pain and in decreasing the amount
of antacid taken per day. </p>

<p>In a second U.S. multicenter study, also double- blind, placebo-, dose-
comparison (15 and 30 mg of Lansoprazole once daily), and including a comparison
with ranitidine, in 280 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal
ulcer, the percentage of patients healed after four weeks was significantly
higher with both doses of Lansoprazole than with placebo. There was no
evidence of a greater or earlier response with the higher dose of Lansoprazole.
Although the 15 mg dose of Lansoprazole was superior to ranitidine at 4
weeks, the lack of significant difference at 2 weeks and the absence of
a difference between 30 mg of Lansoprazole and ranitidine leaves the comparative
effectiveness of the two agents undetermined. </p>

<p>Although all doses were effective, the earlier healing in the higher

<p>In addition, patients treated with Lansoprazole reported less day and

taking ranitidine 150 mg bid. </p>

<p>Although this study demonstrates effectiveness of Lansoprazole in healing
erosive esophagitis, it does not represent an adequate comparison with
ranitidine because the recommended ranitidine dose for esophagitis is 150

of Lansoprazole was compared with ranitidine 150 mg bid in 151 patients
with erosive reflux esophagitis that was poorly responsive to a minimum
of 12 weeks of treatment with at least one H2-receptor antagonist given
at the dose indicated for symptom relief or greater, namely cimetidine
800 mg/day, ranitidine 300 mg/day, famotidine 40 mg/day or nizatidine 300
mg/day. Lansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg bid
in healing reflux esophagitis and the percentage of patients with healing
were as follows. This study does not constitute a comparison of the effectiveness
of histamine H2-receptor antagonists with Lansoprazole as all patients
had demonstrated unresponsiveness to the histamine H2- receptor antagonist
mode of treatment. It does indicate, however, that Lansoprazole may be
useful in patients failing on a histamine H2-receptor antagonist.</p>

<p>PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS INCLUDING ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME
</p>

<p>In open studies of 57 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions,
such as Zollinger- Ellison (ZE) syndrome with or without multiple endocrine
adenomas, Lansoprazole significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and
controlled associated symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia and pain. Doses ranging
from 15 mg every other day to 180 mg per day maintained basal acid secretion
below 10 mEq/hr in patients without prior gastric surgery, and below 5
mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric surgery. </p>

<p>Initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need, and adjustments
were necessary with time in some patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
Lansoprazole was well tolerated at these high dose levels for prolonged
periods (greater than four years in some patients). In most ZE patients,
serum gastrin levels were not modified by Lansoprazole. However, in some
patients serum gastrin increased to levels greater than those present prior
to initiation of lansoprazole therapy. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>SHORT-TERM TREATMENT OF ACTIVE DUODENAL ULCER </p>

<p>Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules are indicated for short-term treatment
(up to 4 weeks) for healing and symptom relief of active duodenal ulcer.
</p>

<p>Lansoprazole SHOULD NOT BE USED AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR TREATMENT
OF PATIENTS WITH DUODENAL ULCER DISEASE. </p>

<p>SHORT-TERM TREATMENT OF EROSIVE ESOPHAGITIS </p>

<p>Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules are indicated for short-term treatment
(up to 8 weeks) for healing and symptom relief of all grades of erosive
esophagitis. For patients who do not heal with Lansoprazole for 8 weeks
(5-10%) it may be helpful to give an additional 8 weeks of treatment. </p>

<p>If there is a recurrence of erosive esophagitis an additional 8 week

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules are contraindicated in patients
with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>GENERAL </p>

<p>Symptomatic response to therapy with lansoprazole does not preclude
the presence of gastric malignancy. </p>

<p>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS </p>

<p>Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules should be taken before eating.
Patients should be cautioned that Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules
should not be opened, chewed or crushed. Capsules should be swallowed whole.
</p>

<p>DRUG INTERACTIONS </p>

<p>Lansoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically
through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes. Studies have shown that lansoprazole
does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized
by the cytochrome P450 system, such as warfarin, antipyrine, indomethacin,
ibuprofen, phenytoin, propranolol, prednisone, or diazepam in healthy subjects.
These compounds are metabolized through various cytochrome P450 isozymes
including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. When lansoprazole
was administered concomitantly with theophylline (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor
increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen. Because of the
small magnitude and the direction of the effect on theophylline clearance,
this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical concern. Nonetheless, individual
patients may require additional titration of their theophylline dosage
when lansoprazole is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective
blood levels. </p>

<p>Coadministration of lansoprazole with sucralfate delayed absorption
and reduced lansoprazole bioavailability by approximately 30%. Therefore,
lansoprazole should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sucralfate. In
clinical trials, antacids were administered concomitantly with Lansoprazole
Delayed-Release Capsules; this did not interfere with its effect. </p>

<p>Lansoprazole causes a profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric
acid secretion; therefore, it is theoretically possible that lansoprazole
may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important
determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters,
iron salts, digoxin). </p>

<p>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, AND FERTILITY </p>

<p>In two 24-month carcinogenicity studies, Sprague- Dawley rats were treated
orally with doses of 5 to 150 mg/kg/day, about 1 to 40 times the exposure
on a body surface (mg/M(squared)) basis, of a 50 kg person of average height
(1.46 M(squared) body surface area) given the recommended human dose of
30 mg/day (22.2 mg/M(squared)). Lansoprazole produced dose- related gastric
enterochromaffin like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and ECL cell carcinoids in
both male and female rats. It also increased the incidence of intestinal
metaplasia of the gastric epithelium in both sexes. In male rats, lansoprazole
produced a dose-related increase of testicular interstitial cell adenomas.
The incidence of these adenomas in rats receiving doses of 15 to 150 mg/kg/day
(4 to 40 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) exceeded
the low background incidence (range = 1.4 to 10%) for this strain of rat.
Testicular interstitial cell adenoma also occurred in 1 of 30 rats treated
with 50 mg/kg/day (13 times the recommended human dose based on body surface
area) in a 1-year toxicity study. </p>

<p>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, CD-1 mice were treated orally with
doses of 15 to 600 mg/kg/day, 2 to 80 times the recommended human dose
based on body surface area. Lansoprazole produced a dose related increased
incidence of gastric ECL cell hyperplasia. It also produced an increased
incidence of liver tumors (hepatocellular adenoma plus carcinoma). The
tumor incidences in male mice treated with 300 and 600 mg/kg/day (40 to
80 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and female
mice treated with 150 to 600 mg/kg/day (20 to 80 times the recommended
human dose based on body surface area) exceeded the ranges of background
incidences in historical controls for this strain of mice. Lansoprazole
treatment produced adenoma of rete testis in male mice receiving 75 to
600 mg/kg/day (10 to 80 times the recommended human dose based on body
surface area). </p>

<p>Lansoprazole was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Ex Vivo hepatocyte
unscheduled DNA synthetics (UDS) test, the In Vivo mouse micronucleus test
or the rat bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration test. It was positive
in In Vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assays. </p>

<p>Lansoprazole at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended
human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility
and reproductive performance of male and female rats. </p>

<p>PREGNANCY </p>

<p>TERATOGENIC EFFECTS. PREGNANCY CATEGORY B </p>

<p>Teratology studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses
up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended human dose based on body
surface area) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (16
times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed
no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lansoprazole.
</p>

<p>There are, however, no adequate or well- controlled studies in pregnant
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
needed. </p>

<p>NURSING MOTHERS </p>

<p>Lansoprazole or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats. It
is not known whether lansoprazole is excreted in human milk. Because many
drugs are excreted in human milk, because of the potential for serious
adverse reactions in nursing infants from lansoprazole, and because of
the potential for tumorigenicity shown for lansoprazole in rat carcinogenicity
studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to
the mother. </p>

<p>PEDIATRIC USE </p>

<p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. </p>

<p>USE IN WOMEN </p>

<p>Over 800 women were treated with lansoprazole. Ulcer healing rates in
females are similar to those in males. The incidence rates of adverse events
are also similar to those seen in males. </p>

<p>USE IN ELDERLY PATIENTS </p>

<p>Ulcer healing rates in elderly patients are similar to those in a younger
age group. The incidence rates of adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities
are also similar to those seen in younger patients. The initial dosing
regimen need not be altered for elderly patients, but subsequent doses
higher than 30 mg per day should not be administered unless additional
gastric acid suppression is necessary. </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Worldwide, over 6100 patients have been treated with lansoprazole in
Phase II- III clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of
treatment. In general, lansoprazole treatment has been well tolerated in
both short-term and long- term trials. </p>

<p>INCIDENCE IN CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>The following adverse events were reported by the treating physician
to have a possible or probable relationship to drug in 1% or more of Lansoprazole-

(5-10%) it may be helpful to give an additional 8 weeks of treatment. (See
INDICATIONS AND USAGE). </p>

<p>If there is a recurrence of erosive esophagitis, an additional 8 weeks
course of Lansoprazole may be considered. </p>

<p>PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS INCLUDING ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME
</p>

<p>The dosage of Lansoprazole in patients with pathologic hypersecretory
conditions varies with the individual patient. The recommended adult oral
starting dose is 60 mg once a day. Doses should be adjusted to individual
patient needs and should continue for as long as clinically indicated.
Dosages up to 90 mg bid have been administered. Daily dosages of greater
than 120 mg should be administered in divided doses. Some patients with
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated continuously with Lansoprazole
for more than four years. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients
with renal insufficiency or the elderly. For patients with severe liver
disease, dosage adjustment should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><b>DESCRIPTION </b></p>

<p>Propoxyphene is an odorless, white crystalline powder with a bitter
taste. It is freely soluble in water. Chemically, it is (2S, 3R)-(+)-4-(Dimethylamino)-3-methyl-
1,2-diphenyl-2-butanol propionate (ester) hydrochloride. Its molecular
weight is 375.94. </p>

<p>Each capsule of Propoxyphene compound (65) contains 65 mg (172.9 mumol)
propoxyphene hydrochloride, 389 mg (2,159 mumol) aspirin, and 32.4 mg (166.8
mumol) caffeine. </p>

<p><a name="ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"></a><b>ACTIONS/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
</b></p>

<p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Propoxyphene is a centrally acting narcotic analgesic agent. Equimolar
doses of propoxyphene hydrochloride or napsylate provide similar plasma
concentrations. Following administration of 65, 130, or 195 mg of propoxyphene
hydrochloride, the bioavailability of propoxyphene is equivalent to that
of 100, 200, or 300 mg respectively of propoxyphene napsylate. Peak plasma
concentrations of propoxyphene are reached in 2 to 2 1/2 hours. After a
65-mg oral dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride, peak plasma levels of 0.05
to 0.1 mcgm/mL are achieved. </p>

<p>Repeated doses of propoxyphene at 6-hour intervals lead to increasing
plasma concentrations, with a plateau after the ninth dose at 48 hours.
Propoxyphene is metabolized in the liver to yield norpropoxyphene. Propoxyphene
has a half-life of 6 to 12 hours, whereas that of norpropoxyphene is 30
to 36 hours. </p>

<p>Norpropoxyphene has substantially less central- nervous-system-depressant
effect than propoxyphene but a greater local anesthetic effect, which is
similar to that of amitriptyline and antiarrhythmic agents, such as lidocaine
and quinidine. </p>

<p>In animal studies in which propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene were continuously
infused in large amounts, intracardiac conduction time (PR and QRS intervals)
was prolonged. Any intracardiac conduction delay attributable to high concentrations
of norpropoxyphene may be of relatively long duration. </p>

<p>ACTIONS </p>

<p>Propoxyphene is a mild narcotic analgesic structurally related to methadone.
The potency of propoxyphene hydrochloride is from two-thirds to equal that
of codeine. </p>

<p>The combination of propoxyphene with a mixture of aspirin and caffeine
produces greater analgesia than that produced by either propoxyphene or
aspirin and caffeine administered alone. </p>

<p><a name="INDICATIONS AND USAGE"></a><b>INDICATIONS AND USAGE </b></p>

<p>Propoxyphene (propoxyphene hydrochloride) is indicated for the relief
of mild to moderate pain. </p>

<p><a name="CONTRAINDICATIONS"></a><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS </b></p>

<p>Hypersensitivity to propoxyphene, aspirin, or caffeine. </p>

<p>Drug Dependence--Propoxyphene, when taken in higher-than-recommended
doses over long periods of time, can produce drug dependence characterized
by psychic dependence and, less frequently, physical dependence and tolerance.
Propoxyphene will only partially suppress the withdrawal syndrome in individuals
physically dependent on morphine or other narcotics. The abuse liability
of propoxyphene is qualitatively similar to that of codeine although quantitatively
less, and propoxyphene should be prescribed with the same degree of caution
appropriate to the use of codeine. </p>

<p>Usage In Ambulatory Patients--Propoxyphene may impair the mental and/or
physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous
tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should
be cautioned accordingly. </p>

<p>Warning--Reye Syndrome is a rare but serious disease which can follow
flu or chicken pox in children and teenagers. Although the cause of Reye
Syndrome is unknown, some reports claim aspirin (or salicylates) may increase
the risk of developing this disease. </p>

<p><a name="PRECAUTIONS"></a><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></p>

<p>General--Salicylates should be used with extreme caution in the presence
of peptic ulcer or coagulation abnormalities. </p>

<p>Propoxyphene should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic
or renal impairment since higher serum concentrations or delayed elimination
may occur. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions--The CNS-depressant effect of propoxyphene is additive
with that of other CNS depressants, including alcohol. </p>

<p>Salicylates may enhance the effect of anticoagulants and inhibit the
uricosuric effect of uricosuric agents. </p>

<p>As is the case with medicinal agents, propoxyphene may slow the metabolism
of a concomitantly administered drug. Should this occur, the higher serum
concentrations of that drug may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse
effects of that drug. Such occurrences have been reported when propoxyphene
was administered to patients on antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or warfarin-like
drugs. Severe neurologic signs, including coma, have occurred with concurrent
use of carbamazepine. </p>

<p>Usage In Pregnancy--Safe use in pregnancy has not been established relative
to possible adverse effects on fetal development. Instances of withdrawal
symptoms in the neonate have been reported following usage during pregnancy.
Therefore, propoxyphene should not be used in pregnant women unless, in
the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible
hazards. Aspirin does not appear to have teratogenic effects. However,
prolonged pregnancy and labor with increased bleeding before and after
delivery, decreased birth weight, and increased rate of stillbirth were
reported with high blood salicylate levels. Because of possible adverse
effects on the neonate and the potential for increased maternal blood loss,
aspirin should be avoided during the last 3 months of pregnancy. </p>

<p>Usage In Nursing Mothers--Low levels of propoxyphene have been detected
in human milk. In postpartum studies involving nursing mothers who were
given propoxyphene, no adverse effects were noted in infants receiving
mother's milk. </p>

<p>Usage In Children--Propoxyphene is not recommended for use in children,
because documented clinical experience has been insufficient to establish
safety and a suitable dosage regimen in the pediatric age group. </p>

<p>Usage In The Elderly--The rate of propoxyphene metabolism may be reduced
in some patients. Increased dosing interval should be considered. </p>

<p><a name="DRUG INTERACTIONS"></a><b>DRUG INTERACTIONS </b></p>

<p>Drug Interactions--The CNS-depressant effect of propoxyphene is additive
with that of other CNS depressants, including alcohol. </p>

<p>Salicylates may enhance the effect of anticoagulants and inhibit the
uricosuric effect of uricosuric agents. </p>

use of carbamazepine. (See Also PRECAUTIONS &amp; WARNINGS Sections.) </p>

<p><a name="ADVERSE REACTIONS"></a><b>ADVERSE REACTIONS </b></p>

<p>In a survey conducted in hospitalized patients, less than 1% of patients
taking propoxyphene hydrochloride at recommended doses experienced side
effects. The most frequently reported were dizziness, sedation, nausea,
and vomiting. Some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the
patient lies down. </p>

<p>Other adverse reactions include constipation, abdominal pain, skin rashes,
lightheadedness, headache, weakness, euphoria, dysphoria, hallucinations,
and minor visual disturbances. </p>

<p>Propoxyphene therapy has been associated with abnormal liver function
tests and, more rarely, with instances of reversible jaundice (including
cholestatic jaundice). </p>

<p>Renal papillary necrosis may result from chronic aspirin use, particularly
when the dosage is greater than recommended and when combined with acetaminophen.
Subacute painful myopathy has occurred following chronic propoxyphene overdosage.
</p>

<p><a name="OVERDOSAGE"></a><b>OVERDOSAGE </b></p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF OVERDOSAGE </p>

<p>In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your regional Poison Control
Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of
overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information
regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than do package
inserts. </p>

<p>Initial consideration should be given to the management of the CNS effects
of propoxyphene overdosage. Resuscitative measures should be initiated
promptly. Symptoms Of Propoxyphene Overdosage--The manifestations of acute
overdosage with propoxyphene are those of narcotic overdosage. The patient
is usually somnolent but may be stuporous or comatose and convulsing. Respiratory
depression is characteristic. The ventilatory rate and/or tidal volume
is decreased, which results in cyanosis and hypoxia. Pupils, initially
pinpoint, may become dilated as hypoxia increases. Cheyne-Stokes respiration
and apnea may occur. Blood pressure and heart rate are usually normal initially,
but blood pressure falls and cardiac performance deteriorates, which ultimately
results in pulmonary edema and circulatory collapse, unless the respiratory
depression is corrected and adequate ventilation is restored promptly.
Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction delay may be present. A combined respiratory-metabolic
acidosis occurs owing to retained CO2 (hypercapnia) and to lactic acid
formed during anaerobic glycolysis. Acidosis may be severe if large amounts
of salicylates have also been ingested. Death may occur. </p>

<p>Treatment Of Propoxyphene Overdosage--Attention should be directed first
to establishing a patent airway and to restoring ventilation. Mechanically
assisted ventilation, with or without oxygen, may be required, and positive
pressure respiration may be desirable if pulmonary edema is present. The
narcotic antagonist naloxone will markedly reduce the degree of respiratory
depression, and 0.4 to 2 mg should be administered promptly, preferably
intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction with improvement
in respiratory functions is not obtained, naloxone should be repeated at
2- to 3-minute intervals. The duration of action of the antagonist may
be brief. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone have been
administered, the diagnosis of propoxyphene toxicity should be questioned.
Naloxone may also be administered by continuous intravenous infusion. </p>

<p>Treatment Of Propoxyphene Overdosage In Children- -The usual initial
dose of naloxone in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given intravenously.
If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement,
a subsequent increased dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered.
If an IV route of administration is not available, naloxone may be administered
IM or subcutaneously in divided doses. If necessary, naloxone can be diluted
with Sterile Water for Injection. </p>

<p>Blood gases, pH, and electrolytes should be monitored in order that
acidosis and any electrolyte disturbance present may be corrected promptly.
Acidosis, hypoxia, and generalized CNS depression predispose to the development
of cardiac arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest may
occur and necessitate the full complement of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) measures. Respiratory acidosis rapidly subsides as ventilation is
restored and hypercapnia eliminated, but lactic acidosis may require intravenous
bicarbonate for prompt correction. </p>

<p>Electrocardiographic monitoring is essential. Prompt correction of hypoxia,
acidosis, and electrolyte disturbance (when present) will help prevent
these cardiac complications and will increase the effectiveness of agents
administered to restore normal cardiac function. </p>

<p>In addition to the use of a narcotic antagonist, the patient may require
careful titration with an anticonvulsant to control convulsions. Analeptic
drugs (for example, caffeine or amphetamine) should not be used because
of their tendency to precipitate convulsions. </p>

<p>General supportive measures, in addition to oxygen, include, when necessary,
intravenous fluids, vasopressor-inotropic compounds, and, when infection
is likely, anti-infective agents. Gastric lavage may be useful and activated
charcoal can adsorb a significant amount of ingested propoxyphene. Dialysis
is of little value in poisoning due to propoxyphene. Efforts should be
made to determine whether other agents, such as alcohol, barbiturates,
tranquilizers, or other CNS depressants, were also ingested, since these
increase CNS depression as well as cause specific toxic effects. </p>

<p>Symptoms Of Salicylate Overdosage--Such symptoms include central nausea
and vomiting, tinnitus and deafness, vertigo and headaches, mental dullness
and confusion, diaphoresis, rapid pulse, and increased respiration and
respiratory alkalosis. </p>

<p>Treatment Of Salicylate Overdosage--When Propoxyphene Compound-65 has
been ingested, the clinical picture may be complicated by salicylism. </p>

<p>The treatment of acute salicylate intoxication includes minimizing drug
absorption, promoting elimination through the kidneys, and correcting metabolic
derangements affecting body temperature, hydration, acid-base balance,
and electrolyte balance. The technique to be employed for eliminating salicylate
from the bloodstream depends on the degree of drug intoxication. If the
patient is seen within 4 hours of ingestion, the stomach should be emptied
by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage as soon as possible. The nomogram
of Done is a useful prognostic guide in which the expected severity of
salicylate intoxication is based on serum salicylate levels and the time
interval between ingestion and taking the blood sample. </p>

<p>Exchange transfusion is most feasible for a small infant. Intermittent
peritoneal dialysis is useful for cases of moderate severity in adults.
Intravenous fluids alkalinized by the addition of sodium bicarbonate or
potassium citrate are helpful. Hemodialysis with the artificial kidney
is the most effective means of removing salicylate and is indicated for
the very severe cases of salicylate intoxication. </p>

<p><a name="DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION"></a><b>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</b></p>

<p>These products are given orally. The usual dosage of Propoxyphene is
65 mg (1 capsule) every 4 hours as needed for pain. </p>

<p>The usual dosage of Propoxyphene Compound-65 is 1 capsule (65 mg propoxyphene
hydrochloride, 389 mg aspirin, and 32.4 mg caffeine) every 4 hours as needed
for pain. </p>

<p>The maximum recommended dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride is 390 mg/day.
Consideration should be given to a reduced total daily dosage in patients
with hepatic or renal impairment. </p>
