<TITLE>PETS - THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD NUTRITION</TITLE>

 <P></P>    

<CENTER><B>PETS - THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD NUTRITION</B> </CENTER><BR>

By: Debra and Daniel Paige<BR>
 <P></P>






<P>
	Nutrition is the foundation of health and healing for all living creatures. Two legged,  four legged, finned, feathered and furred a good diet rich in essential nutrients has an enormous impact on how long we live and the quality of our lives.</P>
<P>	As humans, we make choices about what, when and how often to eat. Animals, on the other hand, are totally dependent upon us their human companions and care givers to make choices for them.</P>
<P>	 Unfortunately, for decades we have been led to believe that commercial foods which meet the dietary requirements set by AAFCO (Association of
 American Feed Control Officials) are sufficient. Furthermore, we have been told by pet food manufacturers that the foods they sell are "complete," "wholesome," "all natural," and "preferred by dogs/cats more than any other major brand." This may sound impressive but it still doesn't tell us what's really in all that dog and cat food that fuels the $11 billion a year pet food industry.</P>
<P>	The Food and Drug Administration has no ingredient standards for
 pet foods. This means that substandard food and wastes the so called 4D sources of dead, diseased, disabled and dying animals are used in pet foods. In addition, food rejected by the FDA for human consumption (rancid fats, moldy grain, spoiled meats, cancerous growths) is also processed into animal food. Chemical additives, many of which have been banned from human foods, are used in pet products to increase shelf life, keep food moist and flexible, provide a "red meat" color, and provide sweetness. Furthermore, chemical and environmental contaminants abound in pet foods because the bones of cattle  even healthy cows contain high levels of lead from gasoline pollution caused by cars.</P>
<P>	In short, most commercial pet foods consist of low cost, low quality, 100% processed, difficult  to digest ingredients which leave pets undernourished and expose them to all sorts of hazards. It is no wonder that "mystery" ailments and degenerative diseases such as cancers, digestive disorders, bone joint problems, and skin/hair maladies once found only in older animals are now appearing. with great frequency in younger animals.</P>
<P>	Though it may seem a daunting task to try to feed your companion animals a nutrient rich diet given the quality of commercial pet foods, it isn't difficult once you learn the basics of healthful eating and come up with a routine for meal preparation. Since few of us have the time to prepare fresh meals from scratch each day (even for ourselves!), here are some suggestions for creating healthful meals for your companions:</P>
<P>	1. Find a high quality, all natural, preservative free dry dog/cat food to use as a foundation for a fresh foods diet. Depending upon your pet's individual needs, this may serve as the carbohydrate and/or protein source, provided that it is complete and balanced. Though "all natural" has become the buzz word in the pet food industry lately, there are still very few commercial foods that really are all natural. Read the label carefully and stay away from foods containing byproducts, fat, tallow, gluten, BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, sucrose, beet pulp, soybeans, wheat, corn and white rice.</P>
<P>	2. Add plenty of fresh or lightly cooked vegetables to your companion's dish. Buy organically grown produce whenever possible but definitely avoid produce that has been irradiated, waxed, dyed or sprayed. Some raw favorites include finely chopped carrots, zucchini, parsley, and alfalfa sprouts; vegetables which should be lightly cooked are broccoli, green beans, peas, squash, yams and corn. And don't forget to try fruit for a snack fresh unsprayed apples, berries, bananas and peaches, and dried apricots, raisins and dates are nutritious treats.
<P>	3. Add a source of protein. Organic turkey, lamb, chicken or beef, farm raised fish, or dairy products such as cottage cheese or eggs, are good for both dogs and cats. According to your pet's requirements, add a protein source every day if you are not using a dry dog/cat food which contains adequate protein, or every other day if you are using a dry dog/cat food
with adequate protein.</P>
<P>	4. Provide variety. How would you like to eat the same thing every day? Once you get the hang of it, it is easy a mix and match menus. On Monday, use the dry food as a base, add fresh vegetables and a nutritional supplement; the next day cook a grain such as amaranth, barley, brown rice or millet in place of the dry food, and add fresh vegetables, organic meat and a nutritional supplement. On Wednesday, use dry food, vegetables, cottage cheese and a nutritional supplement. The key is to keep your companion's meals balanced, nutritious and filled with fresh "live" foods vegetables, grains, meats) instead of Processed "dead" foods with no nutritional value.</P>
<P>	5. Use a nutritional supplement on a daily basis. Just like humans, animals have special needs and, no matter what you feed them, there will always be some nutrients lacking. Add human grade, preservative free nutritional supplement such as Animal SuperFood to your companion's food o ensure that she's getting the nutritional support she needs to stay healthy.</P>
<P>	6. Stick to pure sources. Whenever possible, use organic meats, vegetables and fruits. Buy bottled or distilled water, or get a water purifier; over 2,000 toxic chemicals have been found in our country's water supply. always provide your companion with plenty of fresh water daily.</P>
<P>	One last word . . . if you are considering a more healthful, natural diet for your pet, remember to make the transition gradual so his system can adapt to the change with a minimum amount of upset. Don't be surprised if, at first, your dog or cat looks perplexed at the new food or refuses to eat it. Both dogs and cats rely heavily on the smell and "mouth feel" of food - something new and healthful without all those preservatives, sugars, chemicals and salts is bound to take them by surprise. That is why a gradual transition is the best way to introduce this new natural diet.</P>

<P></P>
<P>
This year seems to be just flying by!  I know it is only the
beginning of July, but since we have to work so far in advance,
we are already working on the September/October issue, and also
in the process of planning our November/December "Holiday" issue. 
It's often difficult to remember and to enjoy the summer when our
thoughts are so far ahead.</P>
<P>
I must thank Marty Scott Gray from Laguna Beach for his truly
awesome art work featured on the cover of this issue.  Mary has
contributed to Awareness in the past, however I really think this
is my all-time favorite.</P>
<P>
This issue is really jammed with a tremendous variety of
articles, which include several new writers and also introduce
some new regular columns.  Jenny T. Liu, who has written for us
in the past, will now be contributing a bi-monthly column on Feng
Shui.  And "Uplifting Films", film reviews from husband-wife team
of Diana Oestreich and Elliot Landy, will be a regular
addition.<P/>
<P>
I continue to receive avalanches of incredibly well-written and
interesting articles; I only wish they could all be included. 
However, as our advertising base grows, we will be able to
publish more pages, and include many more of these wonderful
contributions from our Awareness readers.</P>
<P>
Even though it is a few months away, we are already accepting
editorial copy, books and CD's for review, and advertising for
the Nov/Dec "Holiday" issue which will again feature "Angels". 
This was an extremely popular issue last year, so don't miss out! 
for deadlines, call Awareness.</P>
<P>
Awareness Magazine can now be found on the Internet.  Check us
out at http://www.awarenessmag.com.

<TITLE>INSECT COOK IS NO KOOK</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>INSECT COOK IS NO KOOK</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: JOEL BEERS</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>Yes, Ron Taylor eats insects.  Yes, he cooks them, sautes
them, fries them and has written a book featuring dozens of
insect recipes.  But Ron Taylor is not some weirdo who pours
termites into his Captain Crunch or spikes his oatmeal with
maggots.  He's far more concerned with the role insects can play
in the battle against global hunger than he is in barbecuing
beetles.
</P>
<P>
"When I started talking about this, the only thing the press
wanted to do was focus on the recipes," said Taylor, who will
bring his educational and culinary interest to the 1996 Orange
county fair.  I thought well, if this is what they want, let's do
a cookbook.  It still helps the process of desensitization. 
Desensitization is something that is necessary before acceptance
and tolerance can occur.</P>

<P>
Taylor has written two books on insects: "Butterflies in My
Stomach," which was a detailed look into the role insects play
and could play in human nutrition; and an insect cookbook,
"Entertaining with Insects," listing dozens of insect recipes.

</P>
<P>
Most of the attention has centered around his unique recipes,
such as honey bee souffle, but there is a far deeper purpose to
Taylor's mission.  <B> He's been claiming for more than 20 years
that if certain types of insects could be mass-reared, their
proteins could be extracted and added to the diets of people in
undeveloped nations.</B>
</P>
<P>
The idea is unpalatable to most of our sensibilities.  But the
fact remains that many insects are not only edible, they are at
least as healthy and nutritious as the beef, pork, chicken and
seafood we routinely eat.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, nobody was talking about the subject . . . but
now, partly as a result of my books, and my appearances and talks
there are a lot more people getting interested and involved."</P>

<P>
Taylor isn't interested in insects because he hopes to someday
open a national chain of beetle-burger or worm-waffle
restaurants.  He has the interests of the public health at heart. 
His resume supports that.  He has worked as a Laboratory Director
for the Los Angeles County Coroner, established health clinics in
four California cities, and is currently the program manager of
Orange County's HIV programs.  His interest in battling the
growing problem of global famine is an extension of his personal
work.</P>
<P>
Insects are eaten in poorer countries, but is a practice that is
looked down upon by the ruling elite of those nations.  "Although
the world's major religions have dietary guidelines that approve
eating insects, it is looked on in our times as uncivilized,"
Taylor said.  But that disdain could be resulting in the loss of
thousands of lives, because insects are an incredible source of
the most necessary ingredient to the human diet: protein. 
Protein is in abundant supply in advanced nations.  We find it in
beef, chicken, pork, milk and cheese.  But in poor,
underdeveloped nations, those foods are scarce or too costly.  By
adding insect protein to available food, a key step could be
taken in the battle against famine.</P>
<P>
"Protein deficiency is the single leading cause of starvation. 
The picture of starving children with swollen bellies is a
symptom of protein deficiency.  They don't get enough protein in
their diet for muscle to develop properly," Taylor said.</P>
<P>
While the vast majority of the approximately one million
identified insect species have not been tested for their
nutritional value, those that have are high in protein or fat,
including termites, grasshoppers and meal-worms.  A very
realistic goal is to mass-rear termites on huge farms, feeding
them wood shavings and other paper waste and them extracting the
protein from the animals, which could then be "added to native
foodstuffs, such as tortillas, breads and beverages that could
have the label 'fortified with animal protein,'" Taylor said.</P>
<P>
This will not happen overnight, Taylor admits.  And it will not
happen until people in the United States and other nations begin
looking at insects in a different light that the one usually shed
upon them: as pests and six-legged creepy-crawlers that have no
benefit to humans.

<TITLE>KILLING OF OUR WATERS</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>THE KILLING OF OUR WATERS</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: SHARON TETRAULT</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>     It costs money to be near water in Southern California. Almost invariably, the most
expensive homes are those on the beach, on a harbor or alongside a lake.</P>
<P>     Within condominium and commercial developments, the same principal usually applies.
The most desirable units are those that abut a lake or stream. Ironically, though, this scramble to be
nearer to the water usually ends at the lake's edge, Murky, chemical laden waters make many
manmade bodies
 of water something to be seen, not touched.  These mini environmental disasters, which may
number in the thousands in Orange County, are the focus of one environmentally conscious
company. Ecoquatics of Modjeska Canyon has built its business around cleaning up polluted lakes,
streams, ponds and fountains. Its unique niche is the restoration and maintenance of water systems
by biological, nonchemical means.</P>
<P>     A typical job involves the reahabilitation of a decorative lake or pond in a commercial
development or condominium project. Almost always, the water is so heavily polluted that visibility
has been reduced to  just a few inches. And, invariably, the culprit is a maintenance company that
has dumped enormous amounts of chemicals into the water in an attempt to purify it.</P>
<P>     "It's a vicious cycle," says Shelly Solomon, a biologist and landscape architect who
cofounded Ecoquatics in 1994 with her partner, David Cowling, an aquatic mechanical systems
specialist. "Chemicals are being created at great cost to the environment and then shipped to
Orange County. We then dump the chemicals into our waters in a futile effort to clean them,
 but in fact we create even more polllution.  Unfortunately, most people don't even know that the
job can be done biologically."</P>
<P>     The widespread use of Chemicals within the water maintenance industry is common. Most
companies rely heavily on algaecides high in copper sulfate and chlorine to clean waters.
Ecoquatics by contrast, uses aquatic plants and aquatic life to do the same job organically.
Typically, Ecoquatics arrives on the scene when the water is in such dismal concition that it has
become an eyesore rather than an aesthetic centerpiece.   </P>
<P>     At "The Lakes at Carmel del Mar" in San Diego, the condominium complex's five lakes
resembled cesspools. "They looked like pea soup with a thick slab of mozzarella on the top," said
Theresa Walker, a resident at Carmel who successfully petitioned the association to hire
Ecoquatics.</P>
<P>     By far, the most troublesome chemical that Ecoquatics confronts is copper sulfate. This
over the counter chemical is widely used and highly toxic. Maintenance companies use it liberally
to kill algae and bacteria. Its destruction, however, isn't limited to just the lake where it is used.
Even if a manmade lake has no direct access to a natural waterway the chemicals often seep
through its concrete bottom and make their way into the surrounding soil and eventually into the
water table. In marinas, copperbased paint is applied to boats to prevent barnacles from growing
on the hulls. When the paint flakes or is scraped off, the copper settles in the sediment at the
harbor bottom and poses a serious threat to sea life.</P>
<P>     "It leaves our waters dead," says Solomon. The greater destruction, however, occurs at
chemical production sites. At Iron Mountain near Redding, CA, the mining of copper and other
metals has created the largest toxic waste site in the West. Although mining has long since ended,
hundreds of pounds of copper and zinc still pour into the Sacramento River daily. It is estimated
that Iron Mountain accounts for 25 percent of all the copper and zinc surface water pollution.</P>
<P>     Just how widespread the use of copper sulfate is in Orange County is not known.
"Generally, privately owned lakes are not monitored so we wouldn't regulate their use of copper or
chlorine," says Kurt Berchtold, Assistant Executive Officer with the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board. Berchtold says that although permits are required before manmade lakes
can be drained, few are requested.</P>
<P>      So where is the contaminated water being discharged? "more than likely it goes down a
storm drain, enters a flood control channel and then makes its way out to the ocean," says
Berchtold. Periodic testing is done on flood control water, but it usually takes two weeks to get the
results, by which time the polluted water is long gone.  And in any event, testing is primarily done
to characterize, not stop, pollutants going into the ocean.</P>
<P>     Draining contaminated water is a last resort for Ecoquatics. At one project, in an exclusive
community in Newport Beach, there was no other alternative, however. The community's two
lakes had such concentrations of copper sulfate that Ecoquatics initially declined the project
because of health concerns. Cleaning the sludge would be a Herculean task, yet dumping it
elsewhere would cause environmental damage of a different sort. Ecoquatics proposed draining of
the water and cleaning the sludge with plant life, a costly and time consuming task.</P>
<P>     Wearing protective gloves, Solomon and Cowling carefully drained the rust colored waters.
They then washed down the sides of the lakes with fresh water and refilled them. Afterwards,
hundreds of aquatic plants were introduced into the lake in an effort to counteract the high
chemical content. Within weeks, though, the copper residue in the sludge had killed off most of 
the plants.</P>
<P>     Even today, after 18 months of treatment, dead plants still float to the surface. The sturdier
plants that have survived are slowly removing immeasurable amounts of copper from the sludge.
Water clarity is now at three feet, up from four inches before. "That's pretty good considering the
state of the water when we started," says Cowling.<P>
<P>    An ecosystem is also starting to take root in the cleaner waters. Dragon fly, larvae, and
swimming bugs have reappeared, along with birds. "I  saw a giant blue heron on one end of the
lake and an egret at the other end on my last visit there," says Cowling, who has begun stocking
the lake with fish. He speculates that the ducks stayed away in the past because the copper may
have been painful for them and the lake was devoid of any food source. "Now there's a reason for
the birds to come here."</P>
<P>     One of the company's biggest projects was restoring the 1.6 million gallon lake at
Lakeshore Towers in Irvine. Before Ecoquatics was hired in 1994, a maintenance company was
pouring 800 pounds of chemicals a week into the nine foot waters to control the algae. Ducks had
long stopped dropping by and whether any of the stocked fish remained could not be determined
through the murky waters. On a good day, visibility might reach four inches.</P>
<P>     For months, Solomon and Cowling labored almost daily on the project. ''We would get
surges of clarity and then the waters would go cloudy again," says Solomon. The problem, they
would soon discover, was fertilizer runoff from the surrounding greenbelts, which was creating
large algae blooms. At about the six month point, with management becoming antsy and Solomon
frustrated, the waters suddenly cleared.</P>
<P>     "Our lake was so bad that if you stuck your thumb underwater you couldn't see it," says
Diane Scott, senior property manager for Lakeshore Towers. "We wanted clear water, but we also
wanted to stop the overuse of chemicals because we Knew they were destructive to the
environment."</P>
<P>     The impetus for change usually comes from one ecologically minded individual. At Avian
Court in Irvine, for example, the owner of the office complex became fed up with the artificial
smell and color of the decorative stream. "We referred to it as the Tidy Blue stream" says Roger
Doebke, who hired Ecoquatics shortly after buying the building two years ago. "The chemicals
gave it a Tidy Blue color and a very unpleasant odor. Since going biological, our waters are
cleaner than ever before."</P>
<P>       Solomon came up with the idea for Ecoquatics three years ago. At the time, she was
working as a wetland and wildlife specialist for her other business, Land and Sea Landscape
Architects. Most of all her clients were developers who were trying to comply with strict state and
federal regulations. When the building industry slowed because of the recession, the destruction of
habitats also declined. Although Solomon was thankful for the reduced development, it also meant
less work for her. In searching for new business opportunities, it occurred to Solomon that her
work with natural wetlands could be expanded into an urban context. She recruited Cowling for
his expertise in building and repairing pumps and other aquatic mechanisms.
Ecoquatics' current clientele suits Solomon better. "It was very difficult to work for developers.
They were hiring me out of necessity. I'm now working with homeowners and office management
companies who are genuinely interested in cleaning up the environment. It's very refreshing to
receive praise and support from my clients."</P>

MIND BODY MAGIC<BR>
BY SUSAN K. STEVENSON, DCH (C)<BR>
<P>

"Modern" science is now acknowledging what has been known for centuries that health and
wellness are intrinsically related to thoughts and emotions. That mysterious power of mind/body
connection is seen in documented demonstrations of instantaneous healings; in the amazing
abilities for voluntary control of "involuntary" bodily functions by the yogis of the east; in
westerners who have experienced various primitive arts" such as firewalking, and more.</P>
<P>     This "magic" of mind/body communication is now recognized in quantum medicine due
largely to the recent discoveries of neurotransmitters. Deepak Chopra, MD, has said "You can use
the quantum perspective to see your body as a silent flow of intelligence, a constant bubbling up of
impulses that create, control, and become your physical body. The secret of life at this level is that
every- thing in your body can be changed with the flick of an intention." He writes eloquently in
his book "Quantum Healing" about the existence and activity of these masterful
bio-communicators which essentially convert mental and emotional messages into chemical activity
and reactions within the body-mind.</P>
<P>     Prior to identifying neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, it was thought that all activity was
electrical-cal in nature impulses jumping across synapses at lightning speed to carry information to
various parts of the body. Because of the discovery of neurotransmitters (which form the "on-line"
communication network between every cell in the physical body), and the exciting, ongoing
research into the roles of these master communicators, we have entered a time in history when
science can now measure and identify this powerful activity which was previously recognized only
in philosophical, religious or mythical realms.</P>
<P>  "MindBody Magic" where will it take us? Like the hundredth monkey, the more of us who
become aware of the pure possibility, this pure potential, and then allow ourselves to participate in
the process, the more we will advance as a people and as a planet.</P>
<P>     As a clinical hypnotherapist, I have been privileged to witness the "magic" not only in my
own life, but also with so many of my clients. Cynthia (age 39) used the mind/Body techniques to
grow taller; many clients have reproportioned their bodies (increased bustline measurements and/or
successfully reduced weight and reshaped); pain becomes manageable or eliminated completely,
the relaxed imagery used in hypnotherapy can be extremely effective in boosting the immune
system, easing pre or post-operative stress or discomfort which in turn can accelerate the healing
process. Relieving stress and creating a new perspective is not only life enhancing, it can be life
changing!</P>
<P>  Oliver Wendell Holmes said, "The greatest thing in this life is not so much where we are at
any one given moment . . . but the direction in which we are moving." Here is a simple exercise to
practice which will allow you to focus your energy by simply breathing in a relaxing, de-stressing
way (realize there are many ways to breathe, and many "systems" of breathing   this is one of the
simplest):
<UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>   1. Sit or lie quietly and bring your attention to your breathing. Observe
how
you are breathing at that moment - quickly? moderately? or slowly?   is the breath shallow (upper
chest only)? mid-range (dia- phragm)? or even deeper (in the belly)?
    <LI> 2. Focus your attention at a point just below your navel and imagine that, as you inhale,
the
breath begins to fill your belly from this point and then moves up. This is actually the way babies
breathe.
   <LI>  3. As you focus on this relaxed breathing, imagine a feeling of relaxation beginning at
your
scalp and moving into every muscle of your body. It may be helpful to imagine sunlight, or a warm
shower, or a wave of relaxing energy or healing light  whatever is most meaningful and relaxing to
you.
    <LI> 4. Stay in this relaxed state as long as you wish. You can increase your relaxation by
envisioning your favorite relaxing place   at the beach, by a tree or stream, anywhere safe, secure
and comfortable.
<LI>5. It is in this focused, relaxed state that you can bring to mind affirmations, healing imagery,
or
goals if you wish (see them as already achieved and how good you feel at the fulfillment of the
desire). or, simply enjoy the comfort and pleasure of relaxing this way.
<LI>6. When you're ready, bring your awareness back to the present place, the present time,
feeling
more refreshed than when you began.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P>This simple restful-alertness exercise gives rise to alpha-wave patterns that some call
meditation, hypnosis daydreaming, or altered-state. Whatever you call it, it connects with the
quantum level where the wonderful mind/body communication takes place in relaxed harmony.
You can experience the reality of Dr. Chopra's words for yourself, When the mind is peaceful,
inner energies wake up and work miracles for us   without any conscious effort on our part."
Why not begin now to refresh and renew yourself with the amazing power of your own mind/body
connection?  As you become more focused and aligned, you find your energies are no longer
dispersed or dissipated like the light of a flashlight which spreads out and becomes weaker; instead,
your energies are more like a laser beam, focused and sharp, a straight and constant light moving
in the direction of your choice toward health, happiness and peace of mind.</P>
<P>  Using your relaxed, focused energies in this way can bring wonderful and seemingly
magical benefits for children and adults in areas such as learning, body image, sports proficiency,
habit change, wellness, sleep- ing patterns, and on and on! Your power of focus and intention can
be reawakened at any time to dissolve obsolete programming and create new miracles in your life.
Do it today  do it for yourself do it for life!</P>
<P>  "Our cells are constantly eaves-dropping on our thoughts and being changed by them,"
DR. Chopra tells us. Doesn't it just make sense that learning to gently focus mind/body energies
for health, healing, happiness, vitality and well-being is perhaps the most necessary enhancement
we can add to our modern lifestyles. The rewards are there for the reaping. Ex- perience the
"magic" for yourself.</P>

<TITLE>WHO, WHAT AND WHY</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>WHO, WHAT AND WHY</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: MICHAEL RHODES.</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>


Hey gang, my name is Michael Rhodes, and I am the Director of Operations for this grand magazine you are reading. I just fin-ished packing up all the May/June magazines that needed to get out to all of our great advertisers, subscribers and distribution points. As I was doing this, I thought it was time to sit down and tell all you loyal and new-found readers about this here magazine.</P>
<P>     The Awareness Magazine first hit the streets in the winter of 1993. It was the dream of Darby Davis, owner and editor, to have a publication that would focus on the positive aspects of life instead of all the negativity. The magazine was to focus on holistic and alternative health issues as well as environmental is-sues. Her idea was to let people know that there are other forms of treatment out there besides drugs and surgery. This pertains to animals as well as people. The hard part would be to keep this magazine mainstream so that everyone could benefit from the information.</P>
<P>    When the magazine started more than three years ago, there was a full-time staff of ten. Over the years there have been a lot of changes. We have moved our office three times, and we've gone from a staff of ten to a hardworking staff of three, including Darby. With all the changes, we have stayed true to the dream and the magazine has grown better with each issue.</P>
<P>    Our staff now includes Robert Ross, the wizard of advertising sales in San Diego county. His mission is to put  together an entire section for his area. This means editorial and reviews, as well as advertising, and anything else he can come up with. It's a big job, but Robert is the man to do it.</P>
<P>     My job as Director of Operations is to make sure we have as many advertisers as we need to publish each issue. You see, we have no financial backing, we are completely advertiser sup- ported. So if you wondered why our size sometimes changes from issue to issue, it is all dependent on the amount of advertising Robert and I sell each issue. The more advertising we sell, the more editorial we can put in and the more pages we can have. I am also responsible for the day to day running of the magazine, making sure all reviews, editorial and advertising are in by the deadline date, all distribution points have enough magazines, and so on.</P>
<P>    Then there is Darby Davis, our ever loving leader. She is the one who makes it all happen. Darby, and Darby alone, puts the magazine together . . . making sure all the advertising fits
and most importantly, it all makes sense. But most of all, she has to deal with my endless "Is it too late for another . . ." or "Is it possible to. . ." without strangling me, even though she threatens me on a regular daily basis. It is not unusual for Darby to work until eight or nine o'clock and put in full days on Saturdays and Sundays. This magazine is truly a mission of love and caring be- cause she sure doesn't make any money from it.</P>
<P>     We are the staff, but we are not the magazine. Awareness Magazine would not be around if it were not for all
the loyal supporters  and friends. To name a few mainstays, Sandy Perkins, who not only advertises but also does all of our book reviews, Christopher Thornhill, our seven-year-old "kid reporter", Chuck Diliberto, our music reviewer, and Paula Moss, our video reviewer. And then there is Kay Walburger, our P.R. person who also writes Self Esteem Sampler, and of course all the other writers and artists who donate their time, energy and work to the magazine, as well as the advertisers who support the magazine with their ads. There are way too many to list, so we say one big THANKS to all of you.</P>
    <P> Now, you may be wondering what you can do as a reader to help our cause. Believe it or not, there are many things you CAN do. First off, starting a few issues ago,- we began getting letters from readers telling us how much they love the magazine and how it has helped them in their life. You may not think this means a whole lot, but it does. It tells us people care about what we are doing. Many times, Darby and I have sat back and asked, "Why do we even bother?" Then we get one of your letters, and it answers our questions because it <I>does </I>matter.</P>
<P>	You can also help support us by buying a subscription to the magazine. It is only $18 a year to have Awareness delivered to your doorstep. It's not much, but every little bit helps, and if a lot of people start buying subscriptions, it will help to keep the size of the magazine the same or even larger. You can even give a gift subscription to a friend or family member anywhere in the country.</P>
<P>     You can also help us by finding new distribution locations. If you know of a location where we should be, please give me a call with the name and phone number so that I can contact them. Remember, the more people who become Aware of us, the better our chances of growing.</P>
<P>     The best way to help is, of course, to advertise with us if you have your own company, or if you work for a company that would fit into our magazine. If you have an event or class, advertise it through us. Everything helps.</P>
<P>     So yes, you can help in many ways and you <I>can make a difference.</I> It's as easy as telling a friend to read the Awareness Magazine. We welcome editorial contributions and suggestions.</P>
<P>
<I><B>Remember . . . It all begins<BR>
with  AWARENESS!</I></B><BR>

<TITLE>TRAINING THE BIG CATS</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>TRAINING THE BIG CATS</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY:DIANE GUERRERO</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>
Rarely in public do I like to talk about what I do for a living.
it is not that I am
not interested in talking about it, since I love my career. It is
just that people want me to go on and on
because they are fascinated with what I do. I find it boring to
talk about myself and never have the
opportunity to find out about other people and their lives, but I
do like teaching others about the
animals I have worked with.
When I started my career in the late 1970's, my focus was on
education and conservation. By accident,
I was whisked away from the marine mammal world into the
terrestrial (land) animal field. I started
by enrolling in a course and apprenticing with some of the
biggest names in Hollywood trainers.
Basically I began as a glorified pooper scooper. This is a
traditional role for new people in the field
since it is a good way of getting to know the animals, their
behavior, and letting them get used to
you.</P>
<P>     Many of my first experiences were watching other trainers
training. Then I got to assist by
being what is called l a "backup". Essentially the backup trainer
is the person who handles crowd
control, alerts the trainer to possible problems or obstacles and
assists them should there be any
trouble. They handle everything else but the animal! This can be
a very interesting and demanding
position. It is also a very important one since it allows the
trainer to completely focus on the animal.
Most accidents happen due to trainer error, so it is important to
assist them in being able to have that
focus.</P>
<P>     Learning how to work big cats starts with learning how to
"read" animal behavior. You
essentially have to become one with the animal to understand how
they think, react and feel. Captive
wild or exotic animals are highly evolved creatures. They have
all the evolutionary advantages due to
the survival of the fittest" heritage and lack of domestication
by man. No matter how tame a wild
animal appears, the fact is that they are still wild animals and
react that way.
Reading behavior means anticipating what the animal will do
before they do it. Sometimes, when you
see an accident, the trainer has failed to do this successfully.
Good trainers will see or sense a problem
BEFORE it becomes one or before the animal decides to do anything
dangerous. When they fail to do
that, someone gets hurt.</P>
<P>     Each species is different and there are different ways of
approaching  them. Also, the
individuals within any group vary too. Just as with humans, each
individual has certain approaches or
techniques that they will be more responsive to. With the big
cats you deal with a couple of basic
differences and species characteristics.</P>
<P>
<B>JAGUARS AND LEOPARDS</B><BR>
     Jaguars and leopards have attitudes that can best be
described as being compared to our domestic
felines. They are independent and solitary in nature and have
quick reactions. During a scene in the
filming of the television series "Daktari" a leopard was supposed
to be jumping over the actor. In the
scene that was filmed, the leopard bit the actor numerous times
while jumping. It was so fast that it
went undetected by the crew until the scene was done. Interesting
enough it was good footage and
remained in the series</P>
<P>
     These cats react on a dime.  They are quick to take action
and are very tactile responsive.  They can
get excited by scents and physical touch which means that they
can get so turned on they become
dangerous. Most cats bite or scratch when aroused, so figure in a
size difference and go from there
with your imagination! These animals take your breath away with
their beauty and grace. They can
also take you or leave you depending on their mood! Fast and
intense is how I would describe
them.</P>
<P>
<B>TIGERS AND COUGARS </B><BR>
     Tigers and cougars are some of my favorite animals to work
with. They are very responsive and
pretty stable creatures in comparison to some of the other big
cats. They could be categorized as more
like our domestic canine friends in how they react and approach
things.  Tigers have a greeting called
A "chuff". When they like you they will make this sound to greet
you. It is like blowing puffs of air
out of your mouth in a quick short sequence. Each tiger has their
own version of this. They will often
accompany this with a head thrust towards you similar to a
gesture where you would point your nose
at something. If they really like you and have something to say,
it may be followed by a drawn out
tiger sized "meow" and rubbing.</P>
<P>     Most tigers I have worked with have a great sense of
humor and playfulness. They get this
twinkle in their eyes and have a great time bounding around after
the "joke" is played. One of my
favorite cubs used to "hide" behind a small fence post like she
was going to ambush me. It was pretty
silly since the post only covered the tip of her nose and in
between her eyes! This was playing out
some of her hunting instincts which was a natural behaviors but
one has to be regulated and controlled
so that when the tiger grows up they do it on command or only in
controlled circumstances.</P>
<P>     One of the biggest challenges in working with the big
cats is to remember what things need to
be controlled. For instance, it was considered cute by others
when "Sheba" was a cub and she would
mouth you in play. This was not acceptable behavior! She was
taught to rub instead. As a cub a "hug"
with her paw pulling you into her was sweet. However, these
behaviors when she becomes a 500
pound tigress are less than desirable! Everything done in cubhood
has to be carefully directed so some
trainer down the road doesn't have a problem with the things the
animal was allowed to do as a cub but
are not longer appropriate.</P>
<P>     Cougars or mountain lions are very similar to tigers in
attitude. They have a whistle greeting
that they make when they are young. They also have a rumbling
like purr. This type of vocalization
vibrates through your whole body! If you have ever wondered how
they got the Mercury Cougar to
snarl so wonderfully, I'll tell you!  It was not a snarl most of
the time. "Flehming" is a behavior where
a large cat will wrinkle up their nose and analyze a scent.
Often, all that was needed was some sort of
scent or perfume to get that reaction. The rest was done by
dubbing in the sound. Very rarely did they
use a real snarl</P>
<P>     Lions are one of the only truly social animals. The
difference between the males and the
females is greater than that of any other big cats. I would say
that they are the most emotional of all
cats in that the males have pretty instant mood swings. They are
pretty laid back but when they aren't,
you had better watch out! Lionesses can be worked in groups
pretty easily due to their social nature.
They are great hunters and have a very strong cooperative
bond.</P>
<P>     Working the big cats is dangerous when you work with food
because of the intense food drive
and "fight or flight" response. Food is the key to survival and
they will fight over it. Often the cats will
be utterly aggressive at feeding time while calm at others. One
of the tricks of the trade is not to feed
on a completely predictable schedule to avoid having a problem
with that type of aggression.</P>
<P>      These animals are also great at nonverbal communication.
Once, we were working a group of
lionesses loose in an arena. T hey were being trained to run to
different buzzers, which is called "A to
B work", and is used in getting some scenes you see in
commercials or television or movies. The food
is placed on the buzzer location and the tone calls the lion/ess
to it. I was elected to give out the supply
of meat and work the buzzers behind the protection of an electric
hot wire.
Things were going well and we were finishing up when one of the
lionesses, "Arusha" came up to me.
She looked at me, looked down at the hot wire, and looked back at
me. I knew in a heartbeat that the
wire was not "on". When she went off with her trainer I touched
the wire . . . it was cold.  One of the
electrical connections had slipped off the connector during our
training.  She knew it, I knew it and
thank goodness she told me! With a male lion, I probably would
have been in grave jeopardy despite
having taken the precautions before we started.</P>
<P>
<B>TRUST, RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING ARE THE KEYS</B><BR>
     Training or owning wild animals is not something I would
recommend.
Many animals are not cared for properly by people who think it
would be fun to own one.  In my 18
years in this type of work, it has broken my heart to see animals
being abandoned, having severe
illness or mistreatment because of a lack of understanding or
concern for them as the beautiful wild
creatures they are. They are not good pets, and I do not own any
myself. If you would like to help
them, work at conservation and education with a zoo, private
facility or captive collection.</P>
<P><I>     Since 1978 Diana Guerrero has achieved international
recognition for her work with both
wild and domesticated animals. Trained in Europe and the United
States, she graduated from three of
only four recognized wild animal training programs in the world.
Her experience encompasses
working for private animal and educational facilities, zoos,
movies and television, an oceanarium and
a marine aquarium. Most recently Guerrero has achieved national
recognition for her work on
"Animal Disaster Preparedness ".  She currently writes several
columns for the print media, and the
lnternet, provides seminars and phone consultations. Working with
some of the most endangered
species in the world, she is known for her unique training
methods using trust, respect and
understanding as a foundation.</I></P>

<TITLE>WE CAN STOP FLUORIDATION IN CALIFORNIA</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>WE CAN AND WILL STOP FLUORIDATION IN
CALIFORNIA</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: JOHN YIAMOUYIANNIS, Ph.D.</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>
<B>Fluoride, by itself, is a greater threat to drinking water
safety than all other water contaminants combined.</B>
But knowing how harmful fluoride is - and doing something about
it - are two separate issue.</P>
<P>
Late last year, the California State Legislature passed a
mandatory fluoridation law.  <B> If not stopped, this law would
fluoridate the water supplies of another 25,000,000 people in
California in addition to the 5,000,000 Californians already
being fluoridated.</B>  Earlier this year, we submitted a ballot
measure, which would ban fluoridation statewide, to the
California Attorney General's office for him to provide an
unbiased title and summary as required by law before we can
circulate it.</P>
<P>On April 2, 1996, the California Attorney General's office, in
an apparent attempt to stop us from getting the fluoridation
issue on the ballot, came back with a summary containing a false
and baseless estimate that claimed that stopping fluoridation
would eventually cost the state "$15 million annually" and
perhaps cost local governments millions more.  In providing the
ballot summary, the Attorney General is required by law to give a
true and impartial statement of the purposes of the measure in
such language that the ballot summary is neither an argument, nor
likely to create prejudice, for or against the proposed measure. 
If the estimate had a factual basis, the Attorney general would
have the right to make such a statement.  But there <B>was</B>
and <B>is no factual basis for the estimate</B>.</P>
<P>
Before it was written, we supplied the person (Daniel Kim) who
prepared the three-page fiscal report upon which the title and
summary was based, the following information along with copies of
the original articles with regard to the ineffectiveness of
fluoridation in reducing dental costs or tooth decay:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"In its most recent review of the fluoridation issue,
the American Chemical society, through it news magazine,
'Chemical and Engineering News' states: ' . . . when the actual
costs of dental care delivered in similar cities is compared,
residents of fluoridated cities seem to reap no economic benefit
from fluoridation.'  'All the recent large-scale studies on
fluoridation and tooth decay show that fluoridation does not
reduce decay in permanent teeth: (1) in the largest U.S. study on
fluoridation and tooth decay, dental records of over 39,000
school children showed that the number of decayed, missing and
filled permanent teeth (DMFT) per child was virtually the same in
fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas; (2) statistics from about
60,000 12 to 13 year old children showed that fluoridation had no
significant effect on the decay rate of permanent teeth; and (3)
'survey results in British Colombia with only 11 percent of the
population using fluoridated water show lower average DMFT (tooth
decay) rates than provinces with 40-70 percent of the population
drinking fluoridated water."</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, all the studies on fluoridation and tooth decay
performed on 5,000 or more students over the last thirty years
taken together show that fluoridation doesn't reduce tooth damage
in the form of dental fluorosis.</P>
<P>
Mr. Kim claimed in his analysis: "We are not aware of any
scientific evidence that the existing concentration of
fluoridated water increase the incidence of cancer in humans." 
However, before he even wrote the report, we supplied him with
copies of the original studies showing that the concentrations of
fluoride used to fluoridate public drinking waters are linked to
cancer, along with laboratories' studies showing that fluoride
causes cancer, including all the references supporting the
statements made in the following summary, which was also supplied
to him:
<BLOCKQUOTE>" . . . Dr. Dean Burk and I conducted a series of
studies showing that fluoridation was linked to approximately
10,000 or more cancer deaths per year.  In 1977, full-scale
hearings by the subcommittee on intergovernmental relations (of
the U.S. Congress) confirmed they could no longer assure the
American public that fluoridation doesn't cause cancer and
ordered the USPHS to conduct laboratory studies to determine
whether fluoride caused cancer.  The USPHS contracted Battelle
Research Institute to do the study.  In the meantime, two other
lab studies showed that fluoride <B> did</B> cause cancer.</P>
<P>When the results from Battelle finally came out, they showed
that fluoride was linked to a rare form of liver cancer, oral
tumors and bone cancer.  Since that time, the National Cancer
Institute, the New Jersey Department of Health, and the Safe
Water Foundation all found that the incidence of osteosarcoma, a
type of bone cancer, was substantially higher in young men
exposed to fluoridated water as compared to those who were not. 
The Safe Water Foundation also confirmed higher oral cancer rates
in humans."</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
We are in the process of taking the Attorney General, Secretary
of State, as well as other relevant parties to court (1)to get
them to remove all the claims from the summary that our ballot
measure, if passed, would result in an increase in dental costs;
(2) to require them to correct their analysis (which will appear
in the voter's pamphlet); and (3) to have the court order the
proposed statute be placed on the November 1996 ballot due to the
delay that the attorney General has caused in the petitioner's
efforts in, and thus preventing him from getting this issue on
the November 1996 ballot.</P>

<P>
<B>If we don't stop this, the rest of the United States will be
fluoridated within the next three to four years.  As, or more
important, if crooked politicians find they can get away with
putting this highly poisonous chemical into our water, the list
and scope of future legislative and bureaucratic abuses will be
without limit.</B>

<CENTER><H3>HAWAIIAN HUNA: MODERN APPLICATIONS OF
AN ANCIENT WISDOM</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: TAD AND ARDIE JAMES.</B><BR>
<P></P>        
  <P>         
                        
The Ho' omaka (initiate) had been laid out on a long solid block of lava rock. All around the lava
rock were kukai nut oil lamps that provided light for the five Kahuna to do their work. As the
initiate lay there, the Kahuna massaged him for what seemed like days. As they worked, their
chants reverberated into the night:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Kau ka halia, i ka manuawa,<BR>
He hiamue kou. Ho ala ana oe, o oe,<BR>
a O halua lani o hua ka lei<BR>
He me manu e, e knai nei . . . "<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     As the initiation continued, the images came flooding back. He remembered a time long ago.
He remembered!</P>
<P>     The days of The Order of lo had come to an end. The soldiers of Pa'ao had arrived, and
were hunting everyone of the old order and burning their temples. In  this time, as he remembered,
was a young Kahuna, and as he hid, he sensed his doom. Even though the soldiers of Pa'ao were
all around, he managed to survive through the night.  As the sun rose, the Pohaku O Kane (the
stone images of the Creator of the universe) had laid themselves down. None were broken or
damaged.  And as he remembered, the sadness came flooding back, then the tears. The perfect
time, that idyllic time of love, peace and happiness was over.</P>
<P>     The Ho 'omaka awoke to the face of the kindly old Kahuna smiling down on him. She
said, "Welcome back." He said, "We weren't the first. I remembered when we were here before. 
It was a time when we all lived in harmony. " "Yes, in the ancient times it was so.  Those times are
gone now, but they will return," she said. "Why did it end?" he asked. "Everything moves in
cycles.  The time of balance was over long ago. We are now in a time of imbalance, a time of
extremes.  But the balanced times will return. It is predicted.  They will return."</P>
<P>
<B>HUNA - AN ANCIENT SCIENCE</B><BR>
     Huna is as old as 35,000 years, and is the original art and science of healing and spiritual
development of the Hawaiian people. All that remains of the ancient continent are the mountain
peaks that now form Hawaii.  It is believed that the continent disappeared long after the original
teachings of the peoples of the earth were codified and were spread out all over the world. For a
long time prior to 750 A.D., there flourished a system of personal development, healing, and
spiritual discipline that was known by "everyone." The information was so prominent that it wasn't
organized or formally taught, and just formed the background of "how it was" in the world.</P>
<P>
<B>HO'OMANA</B><BR>
In Hawaii, this teaching was originally called Ho'omana, "to make Mana or life force energy." The
people who practiced these teachings and techniques of empowerment knew that all power and all
life force emanated from the One, the source of all -  all life - all energy - which in Hawaii was
called 'lo'.   The purpose of the original teaching was, and is to learn the ways to increase life force
energy.
 </P> 
<P>
<B>TEACHINGS HIDDEN</B><BR>
    Around the world today only remnants of this system survive. A wave began to sweep around
the planet several thousands of years B.C., in an attempt to destroy the balanced systems  - to
destroy and eradicate the original teachings.  In Hawaii, the original teachings were hidden in the
chants and Hula of the Ancient Ones. During this period, they went underground and have waited,
hidden, for a long, long time.</P>
<P>  
 <B>REEMERGENCE</B><BR>
     Change began in 1979 with me passing of the Native American Religious Freedoms Act. 
It wasn't until 1989 that we believe the final law against the practice of the ancient ways was
repealed.   But it was predicted that this would  happen. Today, the entire planet is experiencing a
revival of the old teachings,  where once again we will experience the  return of the balanced
systems of teachings.</P>
<P>
<B>ESSENCE OF THE TEACHINGS </B><BR>
     Any teaching or training in esoteric studies should increase positive character traits in the
student. Above all, it should bring increasing balance of body, mind and spirit. The result of any
esoteric study should then bring into balance physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspects
to produce the stability that comes from having symmetry and harmony in life. Huna offers 
several teachings and techniques to assist and guide the initiate.</P>
<P>    Throughout the world, the ancient  teachings agree any Kahuna, Shamanistic or magical
discipline requires  that the Kahuna be able to enter an altered state rapidely at will.  In Hawaiian,
the word Na means "quiet, calm, centered."  This ability is necessary, but it is just the first
step.</P>
  <P>
     The Kahuna lived in a state of active meditation called Hakalau. One meaning of Hakalau is "to
stare at, as in meditation, and to allow to spread out."  This is a real eye opened Try it.
<UL> 
<LI>1. Ho'ohaka: Pick a spot on the wall just above eye level. 
 <LI>2. Kutu: "To let go.  As you stare at this spot, just let your mind go loose and focus all of
your attention on that spot.
 <LI>3. Lao: "To spread out." Notice that within a matter of moments, your vision begins to
spread out and you see more in the peripheral than you do in the central part of your vision.
 <LI>4. Hakalau: Now, pay attention to the peripheral. Pay more affection to the peripheral than
to the central part of your vision.
<LI> 5. Ho'okohi: Stay in this state for as long as you can. Notice how it feels and the ecstatic
feelings that begin to come to you as you deepen the state. (If you are a student of Yoga, you may
notice some similarity.)
</UL></P>
<P>     Hakalau is the means in the Hawaiian system for entering a rapid trance state at will.  In
our Huna Intersive Trainings, we suggest to the Haumana (students) that they use this technique
inside and outside of class, all the time, until it becomes automatic. This is the state you can be in
as you go from place to place, in all of your activities. And as you do it more and more, you will
also find that it is impossible to hold a negative state in consciousness when you are in peripheral
vision.</P>
<P>
    <B>ANCIENT WISDOM -  MODERN APPLICATIONS</B><BR>
   Learning the ways of the ancient ones holds much promise for healing, harmony and happiness
in modern times. Huna offers several methods to clear and heal intrapersonally and interpersonally. 
It offers ways to renew, maintain and direct "Mana" or life force energy. Huna also offers
guidance to connect with and live your purpose, your magnificence, and the elemental forces of
nature while living in harmony with the environment and other living things.  We encourage your
continued curiosity, study and discovery of all the richness that this ancient wisdom offers.
Techniques for modern application are available today for easy integration into everyday life. We
invite you to be a part of this healing resurgence that is sweeping the planet.</P>

     "Imagine a future world in which medicine was oriented
     toward healing rather than disease, where doctors
     believed in the natural healing capacity of human
     beings and emphasized preventions above treatment."<BR>
                                     Spontaneous Healing, by
     Andrew Weil, M.D.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>

     In November of 1995 I visited The American Metabolic
Institute- an alternative health clinic in Tijuana, Mexico.  I
was there to write a story for Awareness magazine.  On my tour of
the facility, I met a man whose wife had been diagnosed with a
stage III B cancer. (see Jan/Feb'96 issue of Awareness Magazine-
"Alternatives in Healing- Dr. Rubio").  She was beginning a
five-week stay at the clinic.  We talked briefly and I learned
that his wife had a large tumor in the pericardia (the lining of
the heart) and that the cancer had also spread to other parts of
her body.  In Texas, along with the radiation, she was given
chemo-therapy which was taking its toll on her immune system and
as a result creating other health problems.  After trying
conventional medicine in the U.S., she was told that her chances
of survival were 20 percent for a two year period.  The couple
made a decision.  They decided to fight this deadly disease using
alternative treatments, and eventually they ended up with Dr.
Rubio at the American Metabolic Institute in Tijuana, Mexico.</P>
<P>     As an investigative journalist, I went to the American
Metabolic Institute to gather information on alternative health
clinics in Mexico and present this to the public.  And, as a
writer for Awareness magazine, I wanted the article to be about
health and well-being issues, written in a positive tone. 
Initially after meeting this couple, I thought it would be a
great story, about cancer and alternative healing methods.  But I
must admit, after reflecting on this woman's prognosis, my
internal radar started bleeping pretty loud, saying  "Perhaps in
this case, I should back off the story."  Stage III B cancer? . .
. a 20 percent chance of surviving for two years? . . . maybe
this was one article that shouldn't be written.  But I decided to
write the story anyway.</P>
<P>     In mid April (1996), I made a follow up call to the same
person I had talked with in November of 1995, at the American
Metabolic Institute.  I had many questions.  First and foremost,
I wanted to know about his wife's cancer.  Did the treatment
given at the American Metabolic Institute work?  The voice on the
other end of the line was happy to announce that the cancer was
in remission and her tumor, in the pericardia, was all but gone. 
He went on to explain that his wife was gaining weight and
beginning to exercise.  When I asked the question "Are you glad
you crossed the border and went to AMI?  The answer was a
resounding "yes!"  "And did you return to your original doctor in
Texas?"   Apparently after her stay at the clinic in Tijuana, she
returned to her oncologist in Texas.  He no longer wanted to do
radiation treatment, and basically didn't want to discuss her
treatment at AMI.  The physician's only comments to the patient
were brief but succinct, he said "Medically you're well."  End of
discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>LINGERING QUESTIONS</B><BR>
     Hearing stories of miraculous recoveries are one thing. 
Actually talking to those that have had the experiences are
another.  And then there's the lingering questions, like why are
thousands and thousands of people being forced to cross the
borders into Mexico and other countries to seek help?  And why
are our bookstores filled with books that say "Cancer-you can
win!", but our hospitals are filled with doctors that say
"cancer?  "We're not sure," "The statistics aren't good," or
"We're sorry." </P>
   <P> Many people leave the country, seeking alternative
therapies 
when they've been told that "there's little that can be done." 
They've heard stories of miraculous recoveries (like the case of
Norman Cousins, or the person I interviewed) and they know in
their heart, that somewhere there's a solution to their problem. 
Their own physicians say "You're probably not going to get
better," and the patient finally says "nonsense! "I'm going to
fight this thing, and I want a doctor who will help me."</P>
<P>    Once a person makes the decision to fight, his or her
choices
in the U. S. are very limited.  In the case of cancer, it's
surgery, radiation or chemo-therapy.  </P>
<P>
<B>ENTER THE LEGAL SYSTEM</B><BR>
     Imagine you're a doctor.  Imagine you've spent the first
thirty or so years of your life getting ready to be a doctor.  A
patient comes to you who's dying of cancer.  The medical
establishment says there are three medical treatments available,
and with all of them the patient is probably going to die anyway. 
Do you break the rules, try things that are being tried in other
countries, push the envelope and risk being sued and ending
you're career?  Or do you play it safe, play by the book and live
to practice another day?  There in lies the dilemma.</P>
<P>
<B>TURNING TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS</B><BR>
     We know that our medical system is not set up to break the
rules.  It's based on arduous studies.  Do such and such and
statistically this will probably occur.  The focus is on the
disease and not the cause.  And I don't think anyone would argue
with the fact that pharmaceutical companies have an enormous
investment in the concept of attacking the problem, using of
course, pharmaceuticals.  And we know that our culture has
evolved to the point where the fear of a lawsuit dictates medical
procedures.  </P>
<P>     We have, in the U.S. one of the medical best systems in
the
world when it comes to managing trauma, diagnosing complex
medical problems, utilizing immunizations, reconstructive surgery
and correcting hormonal deficiencies.  What we don't do well is
curing most degenerative diseases, curing cancer and curing most
forms of autoimmune diseases.  In these area, alternative
medicine has taken the lead.  Unfortunately, most of the work has
to be done outside of the U.S.</P>
<P>
<B>SO WHERE DO WE GO FORM HERE?</B><BR>
     We can all take an active role in creating the necessary
change in our medical establishment by:<BR><UL>
<LI>     -encouraging our insurance companies to allow for
greater
reimbursement latitude when it comes to<I> "experimental
treatments"</I><BR>
  <LI>   -encouraging our congressional representatives to
examine
the issue of legal reform.  Physicians need greater freedom to
try any and all methods of treatment, without the fear of legal
repercussions
<LI>     -continuing to believe that we can as a society, allow
for
any and all forms of therapies.  Neither should be viewed as a
threat to the other.<BR>
</UL>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>     -And we can all imagine . . . "imagine a
future world in
which medicine was oriented toward healing rather than disease,
where doctors believed in the natural healing capacity of human
beings and emphasized preventions above treatments" </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><I>NOT HAVING CHILDREN - COMING TO GRIPS</H3></I><BR>
BY: ROBERT ROSS<BR>
<P></P>


<P>
    NOT HAVING CHILDREN<BR>
Coming To Grips<BR>


     If you're a parent, there are few things in life more important then your children.  So strong is the
bond between parent and child that most parents would agree that if they were in some horrifying
event, and a life needed to be sacrificed, they would, without question, volunteer themselves to save
the lives of their children.</P>
<P>    I never really thought about having children until after getting married and settling into the
house that I currently live in.  Up to that point, my life was a series of adventures, from social activist
to small business owner.  After getting married, I knew it was time . . . it was now or never.  </P>
<P>    Both my wife and I married late in life, so there was little time to let nature take its course and
"see what happens."  After trying various methods in an attempt to conceive children, as a last effort
we tried embryo transplants from donor eggs.  This was an arduous procedure which involved tests,
physical exams, a great deal of money, injecting my wife daily with a hypodermic needle and a lot of
reflecting as to whether or not it was the right thing to do.  Finally after months of preparation (both
physical and emotional), the embryos were implanted, and a few days later we were told that it
worked.  One of the five embryos had taken hold.  We were soon to be parents and were both excited
and anxious at the same time.  </P>
<P>     Well, the embryo wasn't happy in its new home, and a few weeks later, after a bout of pain on
my wife's part and a trip to the doctor, we were told there was a miscarriage.  The disappointment was
almost too much too bear.  We had come a long way up to that point and decided to try it one more
time.  The process repeated itself almost
exactly  . . .   injections, pills, the placement of the embryos, the anticipation when hearing that it had
taken hold.  And again . . . a week or so later, the physical pain, the trip to the doctor and the
disappointment.</P>
<P>     For weeks after, or I guess it was more like months . . . well, to be honest, ever since the event,
we've never really talked about what it meant for each of us.  It was too disheartening, too sad for both
of us.  Not a lot could be said, it just didn't work.</P>
<p>
<B>COMING TO GRIPS</B>
     So, what's it like not having children?  Some would say it's great, liberating.  Others, like myself,
have this gap that we're reminded of daily.  It wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for a couple of issues
(which I realize are all selfish on my part).  When people meet you for the first time, and they have
children, at some point they usually want to compare children stories, so they ask, "Do you have
children?"  I still can't live with the fact that I don't,  so I find myself lying more often then not  "Yea,"
I say.  If they pursue it with "How many?"  I usually say two, a boy and a girl, and quickly change the
topic of discussion.  At one level, I'm happy with my answer . . . a boy and a girl, I like the image.   At
another level, I'm reminded of the disappointment and sadness that I feel.</P>
<P>     Another area that I find odd is the fact that photographs no longer have any meaning to me.  In
the back of my mind there was the thought that photos of me, my life and my adventures would be
handed down to my children.  Without children, photographs have lost their significance.  I know
where I've been, and I see myself in the mirror every day, that seems to be enough.</P>
<P>     Lastly, concerning not having children, I think about old age, nursing homes and health
problems.  Whose going to take care of all the problems associated with old age?  If you have children,
it's comforting knowing that hopefully, your children will be returning the favor and taking care of you
when you're near the end.  Without children, I don't know . . . it's  a lonely image, will the State make
all the final decisions?</P>
<P>     I don't think I'll ever really accept the fact that I don't have children.  There will always be a
part of me that says "hey, how come?"  Especially when I'm walking on the beach and I see the
excitement in a two year old's eyes as the waves crash on the shoreline.  I think . . . "Hey, how
come?"</P>

<TITLE> AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. MICHAEL MAMAS</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>AN INTERVIEW WITH DR.MICHAEL MAMAS</H3></CENTER> 
<CENTER>THE SCHOOL FOR ENLIGHTENMENT AND HEALING</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>Interview conducted by Robert Ross</CENTER><BR>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In the face of every human being, in every wisp of cloud, and in every mud puddle we sidestep is an opportunity to perceive profound and beautiful truths."
       Consciousness Unfolding by: Dr. Michael Mamas</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

     
<P>     Living in California has its advantages, there are the obvious benefits like Yosemite, great restaurants and magnificent sunsets, and then there are the not so obvious advantages like . . . schools.  In San Diego alone, there are easily a hundred schools, from high schools to hang gliding schools and from computer schools to  . . . schools for enlightenment.  One need only scan the yellow pages and if you can dream it, someone has created a school for it.</P>
<P>     One such school is the School for Enlightenment and Healing.  The school was created by Dr. Michael Mamas, a former veterinarian, as a progressive training program for the development of hands-on-healing. </P>

<P>The following are some excerpts from an interview with Dr. Michael Mamas, conducted  in San Diego, California.</P>

	<B>Interviewer:</B>   So you're a healer? What does that mean?<BR>
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>   The word healer has connotations that might be misleading.  My passion is to assist people in self actualizing.  You could use words like self enlightenment, self realization, or freeing yourself from conditioning.  The point is, we're all so incredible as human beings.  But what happens is, that our parents, teachers, our society, all condition us to look outside ourselves for the answers . . . and that's not normal.  Innately, the human body has all the answers to what it needs for survival , for enlightenment within.  Self actualization is the process of helping people connect with that inner being.<BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  As a child of the sixties, I think I've just about been through every "get better, get enlightened" training or seminar.  How are you different from some of those personal growth vehicles developed in the sixties and seventies?<BR>
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>  Most of those different modalities are valuable.  When I'm asked to distinguish between what we do and some of the other modalities, I'm put in a bit of a double bind, because it's not about putting them down and saying we're better, but as I talk about what we do, it may sound like it.  The concept of self improvement often says when you conform to a model, then your O.K..  For example, when you're in college, your model may be Tom Cruise, so you try to conform yourself to that model.  Sooner or later that stops working for you so look for a new model, then that stops working for you and you move on to a new model.  That's the fundamental basis to western knowledge.  Western knowledge is about external objects.  In the eastern Vedic tradition, the emphasis is the opposite.  The kingdom of heaven exists inside you.<BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  O.K., you've sold me.  Here's my check.  Now what can I expect to get out of your school if I enroll?<BR>
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>  Destroyed.  I tell my students that my purpose is to destroy them.  What I mean by that is that my purpose is to destroy the overlay with which they have identified. <BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  What are my friends and family going to see, when I complete your school, a destroyed person?
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>  They are going to see a person coming out with the superficial aspect of their being lessened, and the depth of their being, the truth of who they really are, enlivened. <BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  So are you saying that my family may see me being  "more neurotic,"  being more of who I really am?
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>  Here is where the fail safe is.  We've all heard the concept "we are one," from the Bible and other sources.  The most fundamental level of existence is that we are one.  We are enlightened to the degree that we soften our identity with the western model of life.  The western model is where all the pain is.  It's our identity with that model, which creates many of the problems in our lives.
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  How does this all translate into the word "healing?" 
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B> There are many levels to your being.  If you work on one aspect it transfers to a deeper level of our being.  We can work on the physical level and it will carry over into the transcendental level.  We (the school) use the word healing in the broadest sense of the word.
<B> 	Interviewer:</B>  Will I come out of your school with a set of "healing" parlor tricks?
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B>  I think a lot of what's done in the name of spiritual healing, hands on healing are parlor tricks.  I find it frustrating, a little depressing.  You see a lot of "flash" associated with the word healing.  If a person waves their hands around and flutters their eye lids, people say "wow", that was a great healing.  At the school we're talking about a profound level of spiritual maturity.  We're talking about being real, being grounded.  Enlightenment is real, it's accessible, it profound, it's wonderful.<BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  What type of techniques do you teach?
<B>	Dr. Michael Mamas:</B>  My method is not to teach people to be Michael Mamas clones.  The typical healing school says, we'll teach you these skills and these techniques, when you have that model down, you're a healer.   I teach healing techniques as a means of assisting the students to access themselves.  I tell my students that my fulfillment will be in their rejection of me, of their going beyond me.  <BR>
<B>	Interviewer:</B>  Is there a way you can give a thumb nail sketch of what you do, so the average person can understand? 
<B>	Dr. Mamas:</B> The school is about becoming a more fulfilled person, more in touch with their true nature, their own gifts, their own uniqueness, and at the same time, their own universality.  We teach people to access the kingdom of Heaven from within, then manifest it outward.  The fact that they will be excellent hands on healers by the time they graduate is not nearly as significant as the evolution they will personally experience.<BR>

<TITLE>RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: PAUL GOEBEL</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>I have a story to tell. Actually, it is a collection of a lot of little stories, or it can be seen more accurately as an ongoing story. I don't know if this is what you are looking for, but I thought you might be interested. To some it may appear ordinary, but to me it is extraordinary.</P>
<P>I am a messenger for a law firm in downtown San Diego. My job requires that I deliver and pick up documents, letters, and whatnot to and from various offices all over downtown and throughout the San Diego area. I also file papers in the local court buildings located on Broadway Ave., the heart of downtown where a lot of action takes place. As a result, I often find myself strolling down this street, walking amongst men and women in suits, average Joe citizens, and the many homeless people on the streets asking for change.</P>
<P>I realize that in a big city such as San Diego, the homeless vagrants are accepted as commonplace and things have a way of continuing as business as usual.  People just seem to get used to strangers asking them for change on every block, and people have learned to keep walking by without even a shrug of a shoulder.  I am not saying people are cold. Often I see donations of change. On the contrary, it is hard for a person to know what to do. It is difficult for me. When you don't have much money yourself, it is hard to give to every person you see. And when you decide you can spare the change, it appears as simply a random act of kindness. Why does this homeless person get this now when I said "no" to seven others this morning? It can be quite a dilemma.</P>
<P>For me it is a particular dilemma because of my view of society. I have just graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz last spring and spent my four years there studying society problems and paradoxes. I view what I see downtown as a phenomenon. I walk through the biggest law firms in town, listen to lawyers in elevators; see the fancy cars, the fancy restaurants, and the Italian suits. But, I also see hunger and poverty at the same time. I hear myself thinking, one lunch between executives is worth fifty hamburgers for those on the streets. The gap between the two worlds, I guess, can be startling.</P>
<P>	When I am able, I lend a hand. And it is usually the common people who do lend a hand to those struggling on the streets. On my way out of a bank, I stopped by McDonalds to buy a cheeseburger because I saw a hungry man on the street. I gave it to him and realized that by doing so, it did not hurt me one bit. Maybe somewhere down the line I would pass up that soda pop or bag of cookies. One time, I did not have change, but I had a pack of gum, so I gave the homeless man a piece of gum. I have taken my extra clothes to the office, so when I go downtown I can take some with me and distribute them to those in need.</P>
<P>But this is not why I am writing to you. Sometimes you witness one small event and it makes such a big impact on you. It has the tendency to have you rethink things all over again. This happened to me one day, downtown on Broadway Ave. After a while you begin to recognize the homeless people on the streets. They are there every day, usually in the same place. There was one man in particular that I remember.  He is a short man, with one leg, who hobbles around on crutches shaking a cup for change. I happened to be walking by him at the moment when a man put a dollar bill in his cup. It was ironic because although he only received a dollar (which to some people is nothing at all), the look on his face made it look like he just won the lottery or found a jackpot of gold. The excitement that radiated in his face brought him to the point of praying to God, thanking him for such fortune. Doesn't that make you wonder about the value of money in our society? To one person a dollar can mean food for the day or four hours where they won't have to think about hunger pain, but to others thirty dollars can represent a lunch for two people at a nice restaurant.</P>
<P><I><B>EDITOR'S NOTE: Thank you for sharing your experience with us, Paul. You are right, we as individuals can not help everyone, but if each and every one of us performed one random act of kindness on a daily basis, just think how we could change the World!</B></I></P>

<B>REFLECTIONS OF HOPE</B><BR>
Joyce Handler<BR>
<P>
Healing Art<BR>
Joyce Handler's "Reflections of Hope" is the equivalent of a comforting backrub. In a stream of sonic
synthesizers, that ebb and flow, Ms. Handler gears her music in the art of releasing pentup frustrations
and anxiety. The music caresses your soul, revealing her gift of healing, masterfully expressed in her
compositions.
Joyce Handler has a knack for arranging thematic melodies. She creates a fertile ground where
imagination and hope give rise to new possibilities of freedom. A freedom borne of compassion and
nurturing, new perspectives and introspections. The feelings of joy and triumph permeated her
music.</P>
<P>     Overall, the music was well played. Ms. Handler presented a well defined musical sense of
direction. Her melodic timing conveyed the message and spirit of her compositions. I sat back and let
the music move me. I felt myself floating, drifting along peacefully. Her music has become an
extension  of the wisdom she has gained as a clinical psychologist. "Reflections of Hope" is Joyce
Handler's offering to a wounded world. A true, natural form of healing music that cajoles us back to
our senses, nudging us to grow and be alive.

<B>VOCE</B><BR>
Phil Harrington<BR>
Liberty Bloom Music<BR>
     To understand the significance of Phil Harrington's new release, "Voce," some background
information needs to be given. Harrington found his inner voice while participating in a workshop
entitled "Transformational Ritual." He began to teach the technique of releasing your inner voice. The
term "Voce" (Italian for voice) was coined by an associate and eventually stuck.</P>
<P>  Harrington's technique allows the voice to become an instrument. It is a mixture of
syncopations and phrasings. He sings in a speaking voice, sometimes actually crooning at other times
chanting. The music is quirky and catchy, closely resembling a modern pop/funk style.</P>
<P>  The messages in Harrington's lyrics bespeak of a man struggling in the realm of self
actualization. The trials and tribulations, explorations and realizations that guide the seekers/ finder
are blended together into a contemporaneous portrait of a man sharing his insights and truths. The
potential of Phil Harrington's vocal style lies within the realms of personal expression and the sharing
of beliefs. The confluence of our audio voice with the reverberation of our soul's voice sets into motion
the ability to articulate intimate truths. Within these truths, Harrington shares his vision, his pain, his
dream and aspirations.</P>
<P>  The title track "Voce" features Harrington and eight others releasing
their inner voices. The release brings into focus a depth of emotion that is transcendent and
inspirational.  The feeling was reminiscent of the psychedelic experiences, a shifting focus combined
with spontaneous movement rotating freely to form an amorphous sound that took on a life of its own.
Very interesting indeed.</P>

<B>SISTER DRUNKS</B> <BR>
Dadawa<BR>
 Sire Records CO.<BR>
"Sister Drum" represents the cutting edge in today's music. Dadawa (Zhu Zheqin) and He Xuntian
have combined their talents to produce a musical stream of consciousness.  Xuntian's composing and
arranging skills presented a rare listen to avant garde Chinese/Tibetan music.   Dadawa's cathartic
vocal stylings revealed a sensuous woman searching for meaning in the spiritualism of Tibetan
culture.
Dadawa is to China what Alanis Morrisette is to Canada and the USA. The trepidation of today's
youth is proffered in angst and emotion. These raw feelings allow Dadawa to bridge the cultural and
lingual gaps.  She has a strong voice that flows with grace and control. There is a kindness and
gentility that intimately reverberates your heart strings. Behind the music, behind the Lyrics, awaits
real emotion, feelings and sensitivities to the world around us.</P>
<P>  There is a fascinating realization about Dadawa'a and Xuntians's project. The perspectives and
reasons that are explored by today's Generation X'ers are not far removed from the messages of "Sister
Drum." We are all searching for answers and meanings, in this synchronicity lies the spontaneity of
life. This is a real message for the world.</P>

<B>THE BEAUTY OF THE SLEEPING FOREST</B><BR>
Sid Tepper<BR>
Inner Worlds Music<BR>
     Sid Tepper is a story teller. Each instrument, flutes, whistles, acoustic guitar, oboe, harp and
keyboards revealed the voice of experience and feelings that words alone can not describe. Each song
divulged its own mood and setting, evoking a range of emotions from melancholy to unbridled bliss. 
</P>
<P>  Tepper's music speaks to you. If you listen you will hear the words in the melody. The
instruments are vessels of soul, the musical dialogue bespeaks of the majestic and transcendent. One
moment you are soaring through the clouds from the eagles' eye, the mountains, valleys and streams
pass by. The next moment you are walking through the forest, surrounded by enchantment and
mystery. Sid Tepper's ability to musically express actual events in his life is truly a gift. In the song,
"Sunday Afternoon Affair," the moment was tender and definitely from a male point of view.</P>
<P>  Tepper is an inspired artist, when the muse is upon him he creates. The music was never
forced, pouring freely, sometimes cascading, sometimes spiraling, other times droplets bursting, then
flowing effortlessly, seamlessly. The multicultured influences added a flair of individuality to the
music. It was not unusual to hear a classical cadence with a folky/canticle feel. This was a subtle form
of fusion music combining traditional contemporary and cultural influences making "The Beauty of
the Sleeping Forest" an adventure in good listening.</P>

<B>UNDENIABLY YOURS</B><BR>
 Shakeh<BR>
Press Pak Public Relations<BR>
     Listening to Shakeh Herbekian' "Undeniably Yours" is an intimate experience. Shakeh is a
woman with no qualms about baring her soul. In opening her heart to all who will listen, she reveals
poignant revelations about her troubled relationship. She explores her feelings showing all sides of the
human condition, taking blame when necessary, realizing her strengths and weaknesses.</P>
<P>  The music was catchy and contemporary. Mostly romantic ballads that had the proper guitar
hooks and strong backup vocals that could fit this music within more than one radio format. Shakeh's
vocals were smooth yet emotional. She reminded me of Carly Simon or a very laid back Pat
Benatar.</P>
<P>  "Undeniably Yours" is a story of true love through the eyes of a hopeless romantic. Shakeh
shows that true love, unrequited or otherwise, discloses who we really are. What separates Shakeh
from other artists performing the same topical songs is her sincerity. Her loyalty and devotion
portrayed a grounded woman whose demeanor and charm makes her attractive and irresistible. She is
not relating her experiences just to sell her CD.  Shakeh meant every word she sang. In doing so, her
position and feelings about love had no sexual barrier, we're all in this situation together.</P>

Blvd., Suite 109-250, West Hollywood, CA 90046.</P>

<B> THE MYSTIC HARP</B> </BR>
Derek Bell<BR>
 Music in the Celtic Tradition<BR>
 By J. Donald Walters<BR>
 Clarity Sound and Light<BR>
     If you are at all familiar with traditional  Irish music, the group "The Chieftains" should come
to mind immediately. Derek Bell, harpist for"The Chieftains" since 1972, applies his
multiinstrumental talents to this collection of Celtic traditional songs. J. Donald Walters, an arranger
and composer of varied cultural music, showed his penchant for capturing the meaning, truth and
intuitive soul of traditional music by writing the songs.</P>
<P>  Derek Bell's propensity for expression is explored through the Celtic harp, concert harp, oboe
and English horn. Bell brings the sensitivity of true Irish heart to the music. The music is lilting and
poignant, signifying the pain, survival and triumph that prevails throughout Ireland's history. Bell's
interpretations also bring to life the visual imagery of Ireland. The music floats and drifts over hill and
around craggy cliffs, harkening to the beauty and mystery of the  Emerald Isle.</P>
<P>  "The Mystic Harp" is a definitive collection of songs. The heart of Ireland has a commonality
to all who will listen.  Bell and Walters should be applauded for revealing the tenderness of the Irish
spirit, a spirit that has endured through many troubled times.</P>

<B>HOW YOU SEE IT, HOW YOU DON'T</B> <BR>
By David B. Bolen, II<BR>
     World renowned David Bolen continues to share his insights with us in his latest book, "How
You See It, How You Don't." Fresh on the heels of "The Essence of Living," Bolen takes us further
along the road to personal development, spirituality, and self actualization.</P>
<P>  In his work with people throughout the world, David has found a common denominator
keeping people from creating the life they want. The essential factor is belief. This is compounded
when our beliefs are conflicting. The result of this conflict is self sabotage. Bolen states that the most
difficult challenge in life is letting go of our attachments to those things that often bring us discomfort
or pain. He goes on to say that it is our individual responsibility to exploit the power of our intellect to
produce the emotional results we want.</P>
<P>  Once we have learned which of our beliefs work for us and which make our life more difficult,
we have the opportunity to fulfill our life's purpose. When we acknowledge our own possibilities, our
lives will become enriched. Our rewards come when we focus on the beliefs that help us.</P>
<P>  The journey Bolen invites us on is attainable. The road does not have to be difficult and
lengthy. Somewhere in your life a miracle waits patiently for your next belief!"</P>

<B>MONEY AND SPIRIT </B><BR>
By Frederick S. Brown<BR>
     When it comes to money, could you use a new perspective? Are your finances part of what is
out of balance in your life? If you can answer yes, then you will find some unique solutions in "Money
and Spirit."</P>
<P>  Fred Brown has a strong background in finance. He was following in his father's footsteps on
the road to Wall Street. When his father died as a result of the lifestyle of a stockbroker, Fred's
perspective on money quickly changed. He studied the writings of Edgar Cayce, which lead him on a
spiritual quest that gave him a whole new direction in perceiving money.</P>
<P>  "Money and Spirit" is Fred's approach to making the money and spirit connection.  He believes
the most effective way to change people's negative attitudes is to have them examine their fears and
finances in light of their higher purposes. In a step by step guide, he gives details on every aspect of
finances in a person's life from management, savings, spending, insurance, taxes, etc. He does this
through explanation, case examples and directed exercises. "Money and Spirit" is a resource and
workbook. The end result is for you to be the one in control of your financial situation.</P>

<B>CALL AN ANGEL</B><BR>
Angelic Self Help<BR>
By E.A. Terry<BR>
     Former pharmacist and executive advertiser, E.A. Terry, has had a very special call literally.
Her years of spirituality and meditation led her to a state of consciousness that put her in contact with
angels. Although there has been a multitude of reports of angel incidents and phenomena, Terry's is
unique.</P>
<P>  Many people have called out help. The angels have called back. In fact 72 of them have
appeared to the author. In "Call An Angel" we are introduced to each of them. We are given their
names, functions and even beautiful art work showing how each looks.</P>
<P>  Terry tells us that the angels do hear our silent cries. And they are able to respond. We are told
how to contact them and how to know when they have intervened or answered. She tells us of the gifts
and the messages to humanity that each of the 72 angels has for us.</P>
<P>  I found myself fascinated and drawn in as I read of each angel. I could almost feel a wisp of
angel wings caress my cheek as I lightly ran my finger over the lovely illustrations.  This book seems
to have a magic power of its own.</P>
<P>  If you would like to call a friend who will care and help, you now have a direct line. Call an
angel.</P>

<B>INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COOK</B> <BR>
A Zen Master's Lessons: in Living A Life that Matters<BR>
By Bernard Glassman & Rick Fields<BR>
     Bernard Glassman is one of the most noted figures in American Buddhism. He is the founder
of Greyston Foundation. The people involved with this foundation have the common mission of
transforming their community by empowering individuals to lead lives of self sufficiency. His wisdom
works.</P>
<P>  "Instructions to the Cook" caught me off guard. I expected the other world, spiritual
dimension, and the heck with material life kind of book. What I received was a down to earth, bottom
line, and  feet on the ground hope and encouragement for myself and for society.</P>               
<P>  Glassman writes in metaphor style. He utilizes the steps and attitudes embraced by Zen cooks.
Like a good cook, we learn to make a wonderful meal out of our lives by using the raw materials we
have on hand. This takes us from change in attitude all the way to founding and operating major
business endeavors.</P>
<P>  The concept of creating businesses that employ and train the currently unemployed and
homeless is an undisputed desire of most people. The jobs elevate the community. The people elevate
their own opinions of their self worth. Everyone wins. If the book just presented a hypothetical
circumstance, we could easily write it off as idealistic.</P>
<P>  True to his character, Glassman has written these concepts after the fact. Greyston Bakery is a
3.5 million dollar industry providing employment for more than 200 impoverished people. Greyston
family Inn provides housing, child care and career and drug counseling to homeless families. 
Greyston Health Services is an AIDS hospice scheduled to open in 1997.</P>
<P>  I am encouraged. Social action has a manual. It is called "Instructions to the Cook."</P>

<B>OVER 5O LOOKING 30!</B><BR>
The Secrets of Staying Young<BR>
By Nina Anderson and Howard Peiper<BR>
Illustrated by Richard Vail<BR>
     We of the Boomer Generation are turning 50! I don't like to think about it. So I have spent the
last five years reading up on how to stay healthy. Naturally when "Over 50 Looking 30" arrived, the
title got my immediate attention. Then one particular sentence jumped out at me. <I>Passing time
does not mean you have to be old.</I><P>
<P>  To effectively reach the boomers, a concept has to get our attention, make  sense and most
importantly, be doable. The authors have met all the requirements. We are hit with the simple
knowledge that our own choices are responsible for what is building us up or tearing us down. The
good news is - we have a choice!</P>
<P>  Your own needs may be as simple as needing a few mineral supplements, or as great as
needing an entire lifestyle  change. Wherever you are on the health and aging continuum, you will find
answers in this book.  Put into practice, we need never fear "50" again .</P>

 <B>MY SOUL PURPOSE </B><BR>
 Living, teaming and Healing<BR>
 By Heidi von Beltz<BR>
with Peter Copeland<BR>
     Heidi von Beltz, at age 25, was a person that men and women admired - confident, successful,
intelligent, healthy, fit and beautiful. She was a stunt double for Farrah Fawcett filming the movie,
Cannonball Run. A stunt gone wrong (caused by negli- gence on the part of the studio) changed her
life forever. The force of the impact drove her arm into her neck shattering two vertebrae. Her head
flopped heavily onto her back. She felt her entire body shut down, then lost consciousness.</P>
<P>  "My Soul Purpose" is not a story of tragedy. It is a witty, profound and humorous look into the
life of someone who has and continues to make life work. Heidi is a whole person in every sense of the
word.  She name drops, gossips, struggles, laughs and cries through the pages. We are along for the
ride. Heidi is in the driver's seat.</P>
<P>  After I read the book, I saw Heidi being interviewed on the AT channel. I was pleased to see
that the strong person portrayed in the book is real. Her presence on camera is something that cannot
be ignored. She speaks with conviction and empathy. Her current cause is to bring awareness of the
treatment for spinal injury recovery. The medical profession would have had her believe that life was
over. They told her she had nothing to look forward to except death. With the support of her family,
friends and health practitioners, she proved the medical profession wrong. She firmly believes others
can also progress. You can't argue with living proof!</P>
<P>  If you would like the inspiration to overcome anything in your life, especially those things that
seen hopeless and impossible, read "My Soul Purpose." If someone out there reading this is a movie
producer, my suggestion would be to take a break from the sensationalistic trash that we don't need to

<B>MOMENT BY MOMENT HAPPINESS</B><BR>
Your Guide to A Clear Mind - Optimum Energy -<BR>
A Deep Sense of Inner WellBeing<BR>
 By Roger Wendorf <BR>
<P>  When I flipped through this Ups of "Moment by Moment," I knew ahead of time that the sight
of the few words per page was purposefully written. It is a writing style that only works when the
content is worthy of the technique. "Moment by Moment" is worthy.</P>
<P>  Roger Wendorf is an educated, successful person. His success did not hinder his pursuit of a
lifelong dream to seek a path of "inner happiness".  An 81/2 by 11 black and white photo of Roger was
included in the public relations packet sent to me. This is a common practice, which I appreciate.  In
Roger's case, if it were the only item in the packet, it would have been enough. I saw a human being
with intensity and commitment etched in every cell of his face. His being resonates with the power and
majesty of the natural surroundings behind him. You can read this picture. It is no wonder that when
you read his book, you can hear his words.</p>
<p>  It is hard to pick out a small portion to quote. His writing penetrates your mind, heart soul.
Here is a small example:            <BLOCKQUOTE>
"A little worry<BR>
some depression<BR>
and before you know it<BR> 
you've let your<BR> 
greatest treasure <BR>
pass by <BR>
The moments of your life. "<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Today most medical, health and spiritual professionals are encouraging people to practice daily
meditation. "Moment by Moment" offers a guide to a 20 minute meditation that is a pearl of great
price. It is a meditation that incorporates mind, body, spirit into a process of release and change. It
does more than quiet your mind and relax your body. It effects a t profound change in the core of your
being.,<P>
<P>  Roger Wendorf is working on a second book, as well as a lecture tour. Watch for him I know I
am going to.</P>
<P>  Published by Heaven on Earth Publishing, this book is available for $12.95 by writing to P.O.

 <B>THE QUEST</B><BR>
 Discovering Your Human Potential<BR>
REVIEW BY: SANDY GOSTEL PERKINS<BR>
          
	Six of today's leading thinkers share their key insights into the deeper issues of our lives - health, spiritual well being  inner space, the ultimate journey. Dr. Deepak Chopra, David Whyte, Thomas Moore, Dr. Bernie Siegel, Stephen R. Covey and Marianne Williamson are brought together for the first time in the video
''The Quest. "  The purpose of this gathering is to address the issue of how to become all that we truly are.</P>
<P>	To achieve all life holds for us, we must relinquish the illusions and blocks that are bred into us. However, we fear change. Rapid change leads to unpredictability. This unpredictability  leads to a lack of control and outlets. Lack of outlets leads to anxiety. For the most part, ego is confused with self esteem. We fail to experience that part of ourselves that is immune to criticism.</P>
<P>	To date the behavioral sciences have lacked the element of the spiritual experience. We are all longing for understanding of soul. Institutions and organizations cannot fill our needs. We want our lives back. We want it back in a greater way.</P>
<P>	We can change. We can change our attitude towards life. We have choice. If we focus outwardly and desire to give, we will have happiness. If we are here in order to get something, we will never get enough. How we see our life will affect our response to life. Our view of reality is shaped by our deep motivations and desires.</P>
<P>	Every aspect of our being is interrelated. All that we do is reflected in all that we are. If we want to gain our life, we must lose who we think we are.</P>
<P>	"The Quest" brings a wonderful sampling of the teachings and understanding of people who have shown many the way. It answers many questions. It gives us an intimate glimpse of these very special people.</P>
<P>	'The Quest" is available at your local bookstore.</P>

<B>AFFIRMATIONS FOR LIVING BEYOND CANCER</B><BR>
Bernie S. Siegel, M.D.<BR>
REVIEW BY: PAULA MOSS<BR>
	This 30 minute video has a short introduction and genuine heart felt "pep talk" by Bernie Siegel. The video backdrop of scenery is a journey of natural settings. Beautifully photographed hills, valleys, canyons, streams and forest scenes that meld into one another. Gliding through mountain hilltops; valleys, streams and forests with incredibly tall trees and old thick growth.</P>
<P>	The accompanying affirmations are gently guided; encouraging you to tap into your inner self and the body's natural healing, regenerative powers. The valuable messages of love, peace, health and happiness prompt you to "live the healing journey within."</P>
<P>	This is one of the best affirmation videos I have run across. The affirmations are simple and direct, focused on healing. The project itself is well done. The length is workable enough to do daily if need be, especially if the introduction is eliminated in subsequent viewings.</P>
<P>	If one couples these affirmations with a belief in God and attempts to channel God's healing and love, this may end up being a powerful tool for those in need of relief from suffering.</P>
	<P>"Affirmations for Living Beyond Cancer" is available at your local</P>

<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>TIPS ON KEEPING MIND AND BODY YOUNG</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: JESSE ANSON DAWN</B><BR>
<P></P>


<P>
<I>Researcher-author Jesse Anson Dawn, 52, speaks out from the pages of his  widely-selling
book, <B> "Never Old: The Ultimate Success Story"</B> about a most stiring subject: how and
why we age.</I><BR>
</P>
<P>
<B>Presently answering the Question: "Why is communication so important a factor in how and
why we age?"</B></P>

<P>
Dear Reader,<BR>
Aaah, communication, communication, communication, that's what it's really all about, isn't  it.
And why else does a newborn-babe invariably begin life with an unignorable wail? Hence,
expanding our communication seems to be our original and most natural quest. But why, as we
fulfill this inborn urge of sharing our thoughts, is there so often a ponderous blockage, this
increasingly pervasive treadmill which wants to keep our minds and mouths shut, convincing us
that asking questions is the habit of someone "strange" or "unsportsmanlike" or "out of line?"</P>
<P>  Convincing us that voicing our opinion is a symptom of someone - intent on "rocking the
boat" or "making waves" convincing us to watch rather than read convincing us to stay strictly to
the shy and retiring "good old" shallow side. Or maybe convincing us that having our say might
label us as a "Smart Alec" or a "wiseguy" or a "busybody", as if what we really "should" be is
dumb as shoe leather (which may be the main reason they're giving Hillary Clinton such a hard
time, because she's "supposed" to be old and dumb, a voiceless manikin-type like Nancy Reagan or
Pat Nixon but for heavensakes certainly not a "smarty pants"). Good gosh, a creatively youthful
and thinking First Lady, whoever heard of such a thing?!</P>
    <P> But should we let the destructive vs. creative game cause us to give up the good ground
we've gained by allowing our thinking to rejuvenate?  Should we fall prey to the [Net-worthink]
program-ploy that makes us afraid to walk out the door into the "Battleground" where ohmygolly
there are "butchers" and "maniacs" still on the loose?!</P>
    <P> "Spare the Earth, stay home, don't travel," said Morley Safer on the "60 Minutes" show
whereby even this informative and well-meaning program can't help but be a part and parcel of the
[non-reading illiteracy] disease, making us more conditioned to sitting home gaping at an endless
array of junk products parading across a screen, afraid even to go outside where we'd be beyond
the grip of TubeView product-push.</P>
<P>  Communication with others? With ourselves? Personal rejuvenation? So many are finding
it an ordeal, something like trying to dance or make love at a sports event. Okay, sure, avid
"competitors" are fun to watch,</P>
<P>     Free and open communication? Nowadays even the medical profession has changed the
standard term "germs" to a more politically suggestive "free radicals", as if even our body is
supposed to join the neo-conservative "Revolution" to remove freedom (i.e. "weirdness") both
from the medical profession and society at large, hence the Eternally Established Medical
Profession can again stamp out any liberation allowed by freely "radical" alternative thinking. 
After all, any
kind of "free radical" just might become too adept at communicating the truth to the [herd] of
endlessly Patient "patients" being rustled into hospitals by the millions daily  rustled into paying
$100,000+ for chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant or a surgical bypass.</P>
<P>    Hell, nowadays cancer "curing" has become such a billion-dollar racket that NBC News
announced that even the notoriously mafioso Gambino brothers (Carlo Gambino, etc.) have
opened up a chemotherapy bone marrow transplant clinic in New York! Hmm, maybe Carlo is
thinking: "Yo, $100,000 a customer. Hey, that makes even Caesar's Palace seem like a popsicle
stand." And does it ever.</P>
<P>  But of course the only way we can transcend being hustled by the Medi- Racket syndicate
is by deepening our communication with our body, learning what mind power can really do, and
learning to implicitly KNOW and TRUST what our mind can do to renew the body. Knowing my
mind and trusting in its powers of inner-communication is surely what has been keeping me young
and healthy all these 52 years. And it's the same growing belief in mind power that will keep me
exploring the journey of self-renewal.</P>
    <P> So until my next Never "Old" column, when we'll get further into this, happy journeys of
YOUthfulness, dear reader, and as ever (and ever) happy rejuvenating!*</P>

<TITLE>THE ARTISTS WAY </TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ARTIST WAY IS THE SELF-ESTEEMING WAY</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: KAY WALBURGER</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>
   	Artist's are an enigma, a paradox and a great mystery to themselves and everyone else. The urge to be an artist, if truth be told, is in everyone, yet, few find the courage to pursue this dream! Why?</P>
	   <P> We all start out our lives as artists. Remember when you were very young? They gave you coloring crayons, water colors and tempera paints to draw and paint pictures to delight your own eyes and proudly display. Can you recall having modeling clay or play dough with which you created wonderful objects that brought raves from family, friends and teachers? Reminisce the happy times spent singing little songs, dancing and acting out plays or imagined adventures. Oh, yes, remember the drum you made from an old can and a wooden spoon Everyone applauded your ingenuity, imagination and your rhythm. Recall all the colorful costumes made for your Halloween or acting adventures not to mention the myriad of glittered and spangled tutus and tights for your dance recitals.</P>
<P>	   At that time the world seemed to support all your artistic and creative expressions and you personally felt great to receive this attention and acceptance. Can you see the day that it all began to change? Suddenly you were criticized for making blue or green horses or people!  How about when you were reminded that life was real and hard and you must prepare for serious work as a 
doctor, lawyer, accountant, computer programmer, etc. ? Fun and games were over, you were told. You could make a hobby of these pursuits, "But," you must make a living "the old-fashioned hard way! " Maybe you should even look for a big corporation that offered you a lifetime of security.</P>
<P>	  Here is where the artist's wounds began. The fear of failure, the shame of self indulgence, and the lack of responsibility for hard work were presented to you loud and clear by loving and well- meaning family, friends, community and society.</P>
<P>	  Something was wrong - there were so many mixed messages. Example -  look at the TV and movie stars, Las Vegas performers, recording artists, professional musicians, athletes, models, and artists of every kind who were idolized and imitated while making enormous amounts of money. They often received standing ovations for their self-expressions from the very people who told you to get real! What's  going on here?</P>
<P>	 Artistic confusion set in and bewildered the young heart broken artists who crawled off to the closets of their
minds to hide from this cruel, cruel world of contradictions. Too many of us stayed in these closets hiding from ourselves and from the harsh critics who abound everywhere, starving our artist's souls and spirits which longed to  t o be set free to express  their precious selves. </P>      
<P>   	At long last, we have a champion in  Julia Cameron, author of "Artist's Way".  Julia's years of work with blocked, burned-out or in-hiding artists has been written into a compassionate book which is both a text and  workbook that helps lost artists recover their ability to creatively express their unique, one-of-a-kind self!</P>
<P>	 Thirty thousand people a month are reading "Artist's Way."  Teachers, coaches, facilitators and therapists are forming small and nurturing groups, to share this recovery process! They succeed in celebrating every "baby" -  step to wholeness. </P>
<P>	C. Shell of Laguna Beach, and E Shaleen Sterling of Irvine, CA, are two such facilitators who each hold their own 12 week classes in which I personally have participated as I processed my own recovering artist's way. I recommend them each to anyone who is searching for the return or recovery of their artist soul, personally I feel it's a  distinct advantage to have the different perspectives they each bring.</P>
<P>	  Shaleen Sterling was my first experience with "Artist's Way" and I would have told you I was really excited and ready for this adventure. Now, of coursed I recognize my resistance. Oddly enough, this is part of the process and Shaleen, with ever- so-gentle words, kindness and acceptance, assisted me through my own resistance. Shaleen Sterling  not only looks like I
Queen of the Fairies, she is every inch a magical Fairy God Mother with her hand-crafted magical wand of enlightenment.</P>
<P>	  The moment I entered the room, the stage was set with lightly scented candles, glowing, mystical works of art around the walls and sacred artistic still life arrangements to inspire us. she greeted each of us with twinkling eyes and a loving smile that put our fears to rest. We had each been coached to arrive with a candle and a flower that represented some part of our spirit. We took turns lighting our candle and proclaiming ourselves as we shared our flower's essence and how it represented us to the others!</P>
<P>	Shaleen is playful and light-hearted and keeps spirits up even when uncovering great sadness or grief from childhood or adult artist wounds. Perhaps the single most precious attribute about her is her uncanny 'intuition' and the compassionate way she knows what you're feeling and how to guide you through it.</P>
<P>	  The group included dancers, craft and fine artists, a Native American Healing Woman, a corporate drop-out, a video artist and myself, a writers storyteller. It often amazed us that as we shared our individual "break-downs" or "breakthroughs," it seemed that everyone was helped with that part of life's answers, also. We quickly grew into a loving family. We looked joyfully forward to our playtime. We laughed, cried, giggled, and "acted" together which freed our fragile inner child artist.  This group was zestfully led by Shaleen into all sorts of spontaneous, imaginative and outrageous adventures. One day we dressed in white face and costumes and "mimed" for the people in an outdoor mall to their pure delight. Artists love artists and we became an artist family with lifetime friendships formed . To know Shaleen Sterling as an adventurer, to take her many workshops or the 12 week Artist's Way classes is a glorious odyssey into your Artist's Soul!</P>
<P>	  C. Shell was my next Artist's Way facilitator and brought me to a new exciting dimension on my artist's path. I belong to the "Writer's Edge" and we wanted to make more progress with our writing careers. I mentioned doing Artist's Way workshop. C. Shell was referred to us. We formed a class immediately. This was a writer's group with one musician that gave it an unique focus. This group was more serious as we were intent on breaking through our writer's blocks.</P>
<P>	   C. (Carol) Shell sometimes looks like your sister and sometimes looks like an Angel Of Compassion sent to guide you through your "quiet desperation" and "the dark night of your soul."</P>
<P>	    She is a woman with gentle eyes that shine out from her softly radiant face and match her soft spoken voice. I felt safe immediately and felt I could confide in her completely.</P>
<P>	  This class was filled with ambitious and driven writers who are their own worst critics. They demand perfection
Selves that is so unreasonable, it's no wonder they feel blocked or overwhelmed. Three years of conducting art expression workshops using the "Artist's Way" had prepared C. Shell for our pain.</P>
<P>	   "Compassion" is the greatest lesson C. Shell taught us! We learned from her modeling how to pamper ourselves, accept and, yes, even enjoy "downtime." Wow! That was tough on all of us! We formed a compassionate community as defined by C. Shell, "Community" is a place to show up in the world where diversity is celebrated - a place where we all recognize that our commonness is what makes it safe and appealing.  It's our diversity that makes it fun, challenging and exhilarating to be part of that process."</P>
<P>	    C . Shell respectfully guided us to learn how to balance artistic freedom and spontaneity with discipline in ways that unblocked us and soon our creative writings began to flow naturally from our hearts full of beauty and love.</P>
<P>	  My personal challenge for which I will always be grateful that C. Shell taught me how to grieve my lost artist's life, time and works. At first, this seemed too sad and negative, yet, gently she showed me that there is a time and place to grieve and it's part of wholeness. Now, I feel complete as I honor my total self.</P>
<P>	  Many others join me in giving thanks for Julia Cameron and gifted and talented facilitators like Shaleen Sterling and C. Shell who lovingly created a self esteeming path to the compassionate community of artists.</P>

<TITLE>UPLIFING FILMS</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>UPLIFTING FILMS</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: DIANE OESTREICH AND ELLIOT LANDY</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>


 <B>UPLIFTING FILMS</B> is a spiritual,  but nonreligious evaluation, of both main stream and
independent films. It can be thought of as a guide to mind nutrition for film viewers. We recommend
movies that have a positive vision of life, leave you feeling good and contain little or no gratuitous
violence, exploitative sex or other types of negative imagery. We talk about films that delight, inspire,
educate and enlighten. We are primarly for postive films, not against negative ones. Our reviews come
from the heart as well as the intellect, our criteria are compassion and love.
     The concept that films affect people's psyches and behavior should be as self evident as the
knowledge that food effects one's health. More and more people today are very concerned with their
quality of life. They go to great lengths to make their food, water, and environment as poison free as
possible. Medical studies have shown that watching a negative film impairs the immune system, while
a positive one enhances it. Watching one of our recommended uplifting films is like having a
nourishing meal for the spirit!</P>
<P>  We look for positive role models, important messages, humor, positive women's or children's
points of view. Political films are included but we warn viewers if there is disturbing content.
Occasionally we find an action adventure film that we recommend. We are not advocates of
censorship, for example we have no objection to loving sexuality on screen, but we do note its presence
out of respect for those who want to avoid it. We hope that by supporting positive films, more will be
made and their prominence in the fabric of society expanded.</P>
     
<CENTER>THE FOLLOWING FILMS</CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>ARE AVAILABLE ON VIDEO</CENTER><BR>
<P>  
<B>ALICE</B><BR>
     (1990)Directed by Woody Allen, with Mia Farrow, Alec Baldwin, Blythe Danner, Judy
Davis, William Hurt, Julie Kavner, Keye Luke,Joe Mantegna, Bernadette Peters, Clybill Shepherd;
James Toback, Gwen Verdon.</P>
<P>  Mia Farrow stars in Woody Allen's film about a rich housewife who is no longer content to
shop til you drop and gets involved with Chinese mysticism and herbs. Through this she discovers
romance, spirituality and it changes her life in a positive way. Totally charming as well as spiritually
illuminating, this is one of Allen's best films, very funny but not wacky.</P>
<P>
  <B>BABE</B><BR>
(1995) Directed by Chris Noonan, with James Cromwell, Magda Szubanski<BR>.
This is a rare an unusual film, equally charming and enjoyable for both adults and children, it contains
many positive things in a really delightful way. It personifies innocence in the form of a young pig,
who is the heroine of the film. This is not an animated film; the cinematography is of real places and
real animals. Animatronics are used to simulate animal action scenes. But you don't notice it at all. It
all looks real.</P>
<P>  Animals talk lovingly and intelligently to one another. Kids can get a good sense of being
connected to animals from this film. If you want to persuade your child to be a vegetarian, this film
will help.</P>
<P>  The film shows that love and communication are more powerful in getting what you want than
violence and intimidation, that you should believe in your ideas, even if no one else does, and has lots
of other positive messages for kids and adults alike.</P>
<P>  Unlike most other contemporary children's films which emphasize fear, violence and fighting
as central plot devices, this is a truly gentle film. The entire experience is soothing. The soundtrack is
mellow and the voices loving, even those of the "mean" animals. Often in a children's film we are
taken aback by the harsh and shrill sounds of the musical score, but not here. Enjoy this with your
kids. It will enchant you. We feel it was one of the top films of '95, and the 'Best Film' Academy
Award for which it was nominated (but did not win) would have been justified.</P>
     <P>
<B>BEYOND RANGOON</B><BR>
     (1995)Directed by John Boorman, with Patricia Arquette, Frances Dormand, Spalding
Grey.</P>
<P>  Beyond Rangoon is amazing on several levels. Taken simply as an action adventure film with
a wonderful woman heroine, superbly acted by Patricia Arquette, it keeps you on the edge of your seat
with suspense as well as admiration for this woman. A riveting political story based on dictatorship,
oppression and horror in present day Burma, this film communicates the realitiesthe feelingof events
we read lightly about in news reports which speak of dictators and third world oppression. After seeing
this film, many will never read such a news account as lightly again.</P>
<P>  This is a film that should be seen by every studenthigh school age and above, so we will all
understand how important it is to vote for politicians who say "NO" to these types of illegal
governments, rather than playing along with them for whatever political favors we might seem to be
getting. A truly inspiring film.</P>
<P>  As a film which makes an important political statement, it does contain violence, pain and
bloody (on the verge of gore) scenes, so if you can't tolerate this type of material on screen, it is not for
you. We managed to get through these parts because the message was one of hope, love and truth.</P>
<P>  Even if uninterested in politics, you will be captivated by this visually beautiful, philosophical
story of the courage of a young woman doctor who overcomes her own grief and helps an older
professor to survive. The mentor/student relationship between the two characters is totally wonderful
as they help each other to heal.</P>
<P>  Beyond Rangoon is as good as the Academy Award winning film 'The Killing Fields" which
highlights the atrocities of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge.</P>
     <P>
<B> IMPROMPTU</B><BR>
     (1990)Directed by James Lapine, with Judy Davis, Hugh Grant, Mandy Patinken,
Bernadette Peters.</P>
<P>  Historical drama with comedy, romance and classical music. Highly inspirational for women
who dare to be different. A film about George Sand, an extremely independent woman writer of the
nineteenth century who does not let the mediocrity, pettiness and hypocrisy of ordinary life stop her
from being a sincere, loving, creative, intelligent, unique and strong spirited woman.</P>
<P>  Part of this film is about the romance between Frederick Chopin and George Sands, who often
wore stylish men's clothes and took a male nom de plume in order to be published. Nineteenth century
England is the setting for this more than a love story. Also gives us an accurate portrait of the
vicissitudes of an artist's life.</P>

<P>
<B>MURIEL'S WEDDING </B><BR>
     (1995)Directed by Paul Hogan, with Toni Collette.<BR>
     Another good film from Australia. A young woman, trying not to be as dysfunctional as her
other family members, dreams constantly of marriage and being a desirable woman. A very funny and
unique approach that displays many hypocrisies in people and society that might lead a young woman
to feelings of inadequacy. There is sadness, suicide, illness, death and pathos in this film, but it is not
the main focus. This film is about coming of age, finding yourself and keeping your integrity in the
process. Holding out for true love and friendship, taking care of your responsibilities and being true to
yourself are the treasures of this film.</P>

<TITLE>FENG SHUI AND LOVE</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>FENG SHUI AND LOVE</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: Jenny T. Liu, MA</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>Alicia is a sophisticated, attractive and eligible woman. 
One would never guess that she is still single and in her mid-
thirties.  She enjoys her career, makes a good income, drives a
nice car and lives comfortably.  However, she has no luck in
romance and is lonely without a partner in life.  Her
relationships never last very long.  She has tried very hard to
find a husband without any result.  At the end of her rope, she
wonders if her house's feng shui has anything to do with it.  She
asks me if feng shui affects love and if there are houses that
create loneliness.
</P>
<P>
A house's feng shui can influence its resident's love
relationships.  However, the effects vary in different houses. 
Nonetheless, there are some general characteristics that create
single or lonely people such as life long bachelors and
bachelorettes or widows and widowers.
</P>
<P>
Houses that sit on a slope where the left hand and right hand
sides are not even causes an imbalance of masculine (yang) and
feminine (yin) energies respectively.  When the masculine side is
lower, these energies tend to descend or have nothing to contain
it.  This balances the energies in favor of the feminine side or
the female of the house.  The results of the residents are
stronger females who are dominant and weaker males who find it
hard to excel here.  Vice-versa.  Similarly, living in a house
located on a hill top, in a basin, at the end of an alley, or in
a high-rise, all lack yin and yang energies.  This makes for
short relationships and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
Also, depending on what year you are born, your house or bedroom
may "sit" in a certain direction that places you in a frequency
that causes difficulty attracting the opposite sex and getting
married.  For example, if you are born in the year of the ox and
your house or bedroom "sits" in the "ying" direction (between 52
to 67 degrees of north); or if you are a dragon and your house or
bedroom "sits" in the "si" direction (between 142 to 157 degrees
north); or if you are a sheep and your house or bedroom "sits" in
the "shen" direction (between 232 to 247 degrees north), being in
these frequencies may be causing you difficulty in finding a
mate.
</P>
<P>
We must look at a person's birth chart.  Sometimes, it is their
own frequencies that are not compatible with the opposite sex so
that it is hard for them to have relationships.  The Chinese
birth chart or "ba zi" (literally translates to mean eight
numbers) is a statistical record calculated from the eight
numbers from the day, month year and time of your birth.  It is
similar to an astrological chart that tells you what position the
stars and planets are in at your specific time of birth and how
their energies affect your life cycle.  The information is highly
accurate for those who know how to read it.  However, the effect
it has on you is minimal because it is still only one of the 30
factors that influence your life.  It may be your personality,
your background, your culture, your career, your attitude or your
health that makes it hard for you in finding a partner.  So, it
is important for us to look at as many factors as possible in
both the person and their environment. 
</P>
<P>
Usually a person settles down in a place where they feel most
comfortable and secure, where the house's energies or chi is
similar to their own.  Very often, it is the person, who by
nature have difficulty with relationships that live in a house
where the feng shui creates loneliness or singularity.  Also,
most of us do not realize that the house can affect our love life
and we do not select our houses according to feng shui.
</P>
<P>
Alicias's birth chart indicates that her connection with men is
weak.  Although men do pursue her, it is usually very
superficial.  She is innately a strong-minded and independent
person.  Because of this nature, it is not surprising that she
finds herself most comfortable in a house that sits on a hillside
where the left side is lower than the right side, where male
energies are weak.  She also sleeps in a direction that aligns
her with frequencies that are very positive for career.  Thus,
her energies are focused and stronger for her career than her
love life.</P>
<P>
Consequently, being beautiful and wealthy do not always guarantee
that one will have love in their life and easily find a spouse.  
Sometimes, successful relationships also depend on how well you
understand the type of energies you possess and how the energies
of your environment affect you.  Then, you can realize how to
best adjust yourself or you feng shui to create frequencies that
are conducive to love.</P>
<P>
<I>Feng Shui is passed down from generation to generation.  As
daughter and disciple of Master Liu Chi Jen, Jenny has grown up
being exposed to feng shui at a very young age.  Working
alongside her father and learning from Chinese texts, she has
first-hand experience in feng shui.  Together they have more than
twenty years of experience in consulting.  Jenny has a BA degree
in Environmental Design from UC Berkeley and a MA in Architecture
from UCLA.  Having done her master's thesis on feng shui, she is
currently writing a book on the subject to promote this natural
way of living for the benefit of mankind.</I></P>

<CENTER><H3>THE SUMMER OF OUR LIVES</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: LYNN SEISER</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>

<B>THE SUMMER OF OUR LIVES</B><BR>
     Summer time is the warmest season of the year. It's the season that follows spring and comes
before fall. It is often used to denote the best times of our life. It is the time of youth and
productivity.</P>
<P>  Summer has many meanings for different people. It begins with the summer solstice on June
21st or 22nd. This is the time that the sun's ecliptic is furthest north from the equator. In a practical
way, it begins with Memorial Day (the last Monday in May) in memory of the members of the armed
forces. It ends with Labor Day (the first Monday in September) which is a day to remember labor. In
the middle is the Fourth of July, or Independence Day, the anniversary of the adoption of the
Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Summer traditionally is the time of vacation from work
and from school. It is a time we look forward to all year.   </P>
<P>  Counseling is a means to add more independence to your life. Many people come to
counseling because they are afraid of independence. Many have never had a safe dependent
relationship by which to gain  strength and faith in themselves to  allow healthy independence.  Before
one can become inwardly dependent, there is a time of outward dependence. This was supposed to
happen  in our childhood.  For many people this was not their experience. They developed a fear of
being dependent on someone. They become independent as a fear reaction to being too close and
trusting. They may appear strong and independent, but really they are afraid to be close and trusting.
True independence is not a reaction out of fear. True independence is the natural growth and evolution
which is a part of healthy development. Healthy independence is ourselves. The large "I" usually
stands for our ego which separates us from each other. By adding the little "I" to "UN",  we produce
the prefix "UNI", meaning one. Summer can be a time to unify, to unite, to see the Universal.  We can
urge ourselves and each other to add the little "I" to all the 'UN" to understand and uplift each
other</P>
<P>  M is doubled in the word summer There are two of them. Summer can be a time where man
can see beyond the mind and manifest the real magic of independence and interdependence. It can be a
time of manipulation of the many. That would make it a time of mourning and pain. It can also be a
time of maturity when we finally get the message that to maximize what we have and who we are, we
all need to be active and participating members. Summer begins and ends with memories. It starts with
the memories of those in the military who fought for our freedom. It ends with the memory of labor,
the work that we all must do each day to make this world a better place. It is this marriage of the many
that makes summer a time of medicine and magic.</P>
<P>  E means to educate and to empathize. Too often summer is a time of ego and evil. It can be a
time of emergencies brought on by excess. It can also be a time of engaging and establishing a deeper
emotional connection with others and with the earth. It is our choice if summer is a time of epitaphs or
ecstasy. To be efficient and effective we must emphasize the efforts put forth to enhance the esteem of
the entire planet, and everything that exists here.</P>
<P>  R is a time to reflect and remember.  It can, and often is, a time of rage, racism, and rebellion.
We tend to get rejected, then repeat the mistake by retaliating. This reactionary behavior only
regresses and restricts us further. It is a time to remember to respond to others as we want them to
respond to us. If we do not want to be attacked, we must stop our reactions to attack.  If we want to
reclaim our relationship with others we must first become responsible and respectful ourselves. The
universe will respond to us through what we radiate as our worth. If being unafraid to see the
interdependency that we all share. By allowing others to be dependent on them,
 people see they need and are connected to others. This allows them to be dependent on others through
a healthy interdependency. This is the relationship we all share on this journey. We are connected and
need each other in many different ways: we each have our part to play.</p>
<p>  A technique many clients enjoy is to produce an acronym using the letters from a word. Take
the word Summer". It is a way of defining what summer means. Take each letter of the word summer
and separate them into s-u-m-m-e-r. Now give each letter a of new meaning with words that also start
with that letter.  Each person can make up their own words.     </p>
<p>"S" is a time to start sharing ourself. It could be a time of stinginess, shame and scarcity.  One step
towards healing is to begin to share with others who we are and what we have done with our lives.
This brings out the secrets we are ashamed of and allows them to be sorted out in the sunlight instead
of the darkness of silence. While it is a time of solitude, it must also be balanced with our need to
socialize with significant others in our lives. Many people only see the separation in what makes us
different from each other. Others will see the shared qualities, we have not only with our own species,
but with everything.  We are not alone, except in our way  of thinking about it. Summer can be a time
of beginning to safely share the journey with others in the sunlight.</P>
<P>  "U" stands for you. You can decide how to live your life. Our history may be an explanation
for who we are, but it is not an excuse to stay unconscious. Look at all the words that start with the
prefix "UN". Unavailable, unapproachable, uncertain, unfaithful, unknown, and unnatural are just a
few. The prefix "UN" is another way of saying "not".  Summer can be a time of getting rid of the "UN"
in our lives. This would make summer a time to be available, approachable, certain, faithful, known
and natural. The little "I" is sometimes used to denote a higher aspect of your rage at yourself, the
universe will respond with more of the same. If what you want in your life is to relax, then remember
to treat yourself with respect, and be ready to receive the reality that is reciprocated from that belief.
Remember to honor those who have helped us evolve to this point. Also remember that someday,
someone will look back on today. Will they rejoice in the part you decided to play this summer?</P>
<P>  Summer is the warmest season of the year. The term "the summer of our lives' means these are
supposed to be the good days. I hope yours is. Thank you for listening, for the opportunity to be of
service, and for sharing the journey.</P>

<CENTER><H3>PARENTING FROM THE HEART</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: LINDA GARRETT</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>
<B>       The Home  -    As A Sanctuary</B><BR>
     A vital part of child development is the healthy cultivation of the senses. At birth, as a child emerges from the dark, warm, quiet environment of the womb, care must be taken to protect the still sensitive child from over stimulation of the developing sensory mechanism. The goal is to allow the child to unfold gradually, naturally, when they are ready, avoiding unnecessary shocks to their still delicate system.</P>
<P>     When sensory stimulation is too great, an automatic shutdown response may develop as a protection from that which is too much for the child to process and integrate. If this protective response occurs too much, it becomes the usual response to outside stimulation, and a child can gradually become closed to life, and his ability to perceive accurately is diminished. As parents we must act as a filtering system for children until they are able to do this for themselves.  It is important to stress here the gradually unfolding nature of the sensory mechanism, and the need to protect young children. An appropriately  stimulating environment for an infant is much different than for an eight year old.</P>
<P><B>Goodness, Truth and Beauty</B><BR>
     Attention must be paid not only to the intensity, but also to the quality of the child's environment. As anyone who has looked into the eyes of a newborn baby knows, already within each child at birth is the seed of what he may someday become. By surrounding a child with that which is good, true and beautiful, we encourager  this seed to sprout and blossom according to plan.</P>
<P>    Goodness, truth and beauty are to  a child, what light, water and nutrients are to a plant vital to their health and well being. Likewise, when children are deprived of these things, they are sure to wither, become misshapen, bear no fruit and eventually die. As we strive to live these qualities of goodness, truth and beauty,  and bring them into our child's world, they have a tremendous positive impact.</P>
<P>     Much of our ability to accurately perceive, and intelligently respond to sensory input has been lost in this time of distorted images and over stimulation. In a world that is filled with fast paced, colorful, electronic impressions, time is rarely taken to examine, and accept or reject that which is entering and influencing our lives and the lives of our children. We can begin to change this process by asking these kinds of questions: "Is your child surrounded by that which is beautiful and pleasing to the senses? Are they greeted by that which is harsh and overbearing, or by that which is soothing and harmonious? Is your home, or your child's classroom, warm, comfortable and orderly? What effects do these early impressions have on the child's developing perspective on life?"</P>
<P>     During the first seven years, the emphasis is on creating beauty in the home, because this is the place where young children spend most of their time. In most homes, the environment is created by, and geared to the needs and desires of the parents in the household. Often, adjustments need to be made in order to provide surroundings that truly nurture the young child. Areas that are particularly important to examine are light, sound and color. These are most pleasing when they are soft, beautiful and harmonious, and thus, help a child to develop an inner sense of beauty and harmony.</P>

<TITLE>BUGS ARE ANIMALS TOO!</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>BUGS ARE ANIMALS TOO!</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY: SUSAN VAN VORHIS KEY, Ph.D., ENTOMOLOSIST</B><BR>
<P></P>
<P>
      When you think of animals, don't you usually think of   cuddly kittens, darling puppies or wild animals such as lions, tigers or chimpanzees? These are all familiar types of vertebrate animals, those furry creatures with backbones  relatives of human beings.</P>
<P>     But the vast majority of animals on this planet, a whopping 95% of them, are not vertebrates and most of these animals are much smaller than the smallest kitten. Seventy five percent of them are, in fact, even smaller than the egg of a chicken. These creatures are mostly the invertebrates spineless animals (without a backbone) Scientists have divided invertebrates into several groups including the sponges, the flatworm and the mollusks such as clams, squids, oysters and snails, to name a few.</P>
<P>     A major group of invertebrates is the group called Arthropoda. Arthropods have exoskeleton instead of bones hard protective segmented "skin" which supports and protects their bodies, and paired, jointed appendages (antennae, mouthparts, legs).</P>
<P>     The group Arthropoda is composed of five major types of arthropods: the centipedes, the millipedes, the crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, and the kid's favorites pillbugs or rolly pollies), the arachnids (spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites, etc.), and finally, the most diverse group of invertebrates, the insects (Class Insecta).</P>
<P>     Although we en joy using the word "bug" to mean insects or creepy crawly creatures in general, only a certain type of insect the order Hemiptera (a type of insect with sucking mouthparts and certain kinds of wings and antennae) can be accurately called a "true bug."</P>
<P>     Today, there are about one million species of insects that have been identified and given scientific names.  Some scientists estimate that there may be as many as 20 million more we have yet to discover!</P>
<P>     Arthropods live almost everywhere you can imagine.  The ocean is home
to many types of invertebrates tide pools are good places to delight yourself with graceful sea anemones, spiny sea urchins, and any number of fascinating creatures. From tropical rain forests where thousands of insects can be found on one tree, to the deserts of the world where rocks and plants hide the abundant teeming life, insects are among the most important creatures on earth.</P>
<P>     Your own backyard is probably crawling with dozens of invertebrate  species, many of them very important in the ecosystem creatures quietly doing their jobs unnoticed, or at least unwelcome and unappreciated.  Earthworms stir and aerate the soil, recycling the nutrients there, so that new plants can grow and flourish. Cockroaches may be nature's most primitive recyclers. Most of the world's roaches live in tropical areas, eating and recycling tons of decaying vegetation. Ants are responsible for a tremendous service to the planet.  Carcasses of dead animals, including millions of dead insects are subject to the ant's incessant efforts to feed their brood. Without these wonderful creatures and the help of fungus and bacteria, working around the clock to feed themselves and their progeny  as my friend, Art, says, "We'd be walking knee deep in dinosaurs!"</P>
<P>     Insects, their arthropod relatives and other invertebrates are major food sources for birds, fish, and many other small vertebrate animals. Ultimately invertebrates make life as we know it possible.</P>
<P>     Imagine a world without insects if you can. You might think you would be happier if insects weren't there to bug you. Most of us would agree that
picnics and trips to the river or lake would be more comfortable without ants, flies, yellow jackets; mosquitoes and midges. Our dogs and cats would, without question, be more comfortable without the pesty flea constantly using their bodies as racetracks and snack bars. </P>
<P>     In the larger picture of life, however, the overall value of insects to human beings is inestimable and extensive. Their contributions range from indirect ones such as the production of fruit by plants that require the help of bees and other pollinators, to the direct pleasure and fascination  we can experience in looking at a beautiful butterfly or watching ants carrying loads that seem impossibly heavy as they follow their pheromone trails back to their nest.</P>
<P>      To understand the intricate connections that bind all creatures together both in apparent and in less obvious ways, is a way to enjoy and honor all life. People are animals and bugs are animals, too!  We have much to learn from and appreciate about our spineless, multilegged friends. So find a class or a book or take a nature hike and learn something new about nature's fascinating and multilegged creatures.<P>

<P>	Steve has given his life to inform and educate kids to care for their Mother - Mother Earth that is. He does this through his unique style and MAGIC. He has traveled worldwide performing magic and talking about ecology and the environment. His magic acts have as their center -  trash. Even his clothes sport the wonderful treasures, of the dumpster! And he has brought this wonderful information to the printed page.</P>
<P>        Through his manual Chris has learned many of the magic tricks that Steve uses. Chris is able to understand most of the instructions (the book is written for older children). By using illustrations, good humor and wit, kids learn intricate magical tricks. They also learn about recycling and ecology.</P>
<P>     What more could Chris ask for in a role model? He is hooked. Steve's book hasn't left Chris' side for quite a while. He is practicing each magic act to its perfection. (Perfection by 7 year old standards!) His props are easily found in recycling bins, junk drawers, and at home, especially in his bedroom!</P>
<P>	Steve helps to build the self confidence of these impressionable kids by sharing this very special talent with them. They now have a fun way of sharing their knowledge and respect of our planet. They also have a new guru. A tall man with long blonde hair who wears an old top hat and tails with his torn jeans and junkyard treasures pinned to any place that is pinable!</P>
<P>	Contact Steve to have him perform for your school district or local fairs and events. Do it for your kids and do it for our planet. Hopefully Steve will be out in Southern California again soon. Chris, his biggest fan, wants to meet him.</P>
<P>	To order "The Magic of Ecology"or for more information, call Steve at (310) 692-1193, or write to: The Trash Factory, 975 Old Dirt Road, Spruce Pine, Alabama 35585</P>

 DRAGONHEART<BR>
Starring Dennis Quaid and Sean Connery<BR>
	We drove up to Chris' house to pick him up for the show. Not only was this a movie he really wanted to see, it was to be his first movie review.</P>
<P>	He was out on the sidewalk - pacing back and forth. He was dressed in a "Dragonheart" t-shirt and shorts. As I pulled up, he ran to the car, waving a piece of cardboard. "Look Grandma, I have the knight's oath."</P>
<P>	The review in Chris' own words:<BR>
	This movie is about the last dragon. Draco is really cool. He is a good dragon that tries to help people. Most people were afraid because dragons are so big and breathe fire. The king was mean and told lies. When the king was dying, Draco gave him half of his own heart so he would live. Draco thought the king would then be good. But he wasn't good. He killed people and didn't care about anyone. I wouldn't want to live back then, even though I like dragons. I like living now because of the King of the Bible.</P>
<P>	This movie helps you to see, not to judge people, before you get to know them. I don't know if there were dragons for real. Maybe they are real if you believe hard enough.</P>

<TITLE>IT'S FLEA AND TICK SEASON AGAIN</TITLE>
<P></P>
<CENTER><H3>IT'S FLEA AND TICK SEASON AGAIN</H3></CENTER><BR>
<B>BY:Mora Blackmarsh</B><BR>
<P></P>

<P>
Tired of your cat or dog scratching constantly?  Don't want to use a flea powder from the pet store that warns you to wear gloves when you apply it to your pet or that says to keep away from their nose and mouth?  Your question, what can I do that is safe?</P>
<P>
There are many natural herbal flea repellents.  With herbs the risks of harm to your animals are minimal.  For animals with sensitive skin the risks are much lower with natural repellents of creating  a sensitive skin reaction (and in some cases your only options).  They are also the best answer if you have children, especially who love to cuddle with Fluffy or Spot.</P>
<P>
There are both powders and oil based repellents.  Some of the strongest repellents against fleas, lice, ticks, chiggers, mosquitos, gnats and flies (for both humans and pets) are citronella, eucalyptus, pennyroyal, rosemary, rue and wormwood.  <B>Note:</B> Most cats do not like the herb rue.  Some milder herbal repellents are basil, bay, lavender, peppermint, sage and lavender, peppermint , sage and thyme.  (Yes, you will have Fluffy or Spot smelling like an Italian main course with this blend.)</P>
<P>
If you use repellents on your animals, this will help to break the flea and tick's life cycle.  Remember to do your pet's beds and anywhere else that might be a problem.  Repeat every 7-10 days, for six weeks to get the adults larva and eggs.  The essential oils are pure oil from the plant.  The stronger ones should never be applied directly to the animal's skin undiluted.  Dilute them with water, alcohol, a natural oil base, etc.  If your pet has skin problems or any open sores, use a powder blend instead of oils.</P>
<P>
When using powdered herbs, you can blend diatomaceous earth with it to increase the effects.  Diatomaceous earth is a natural product and safe for humans.  This is all non-toxic to the animals, children and adults.  After all, who wants to use a product from a pet store that says to wash your hands after contact with your pet, and what child would remember to wash their hands?</P>
<P>
Need more information?  We will be glad to help you in the store.  Remember to consult with your veterinarian before beginning any treatment program.  Test anything you buy or make in small quantities before applying liberally to yourself, animals or the furnishings</P>
<P>
<B>Liquid, powder and loose herbal flea products, created by Dr. Donna DeBonis, a local veterinarian, and Linda Shrode, herbalist, are available at DragonMarsh.  For more information, call Mora Blackmarsh at the DragonMarsh Apothecary (909) 276-1116.</P>

<TITLE>THE SHATKI BRACELET</TITLE>
	
<CENTER><H3>HEALTHY LIVING - BY ROBERT ROSS</H3></CENTER><BR>
<P></P>

<B>INVISIBLE FORCES</B>
     My brother in law, a government surveyor in Hawaii, uses a "dowser" to find buried water pipes.  "Running water and metal pipes  create an electric current that can be picked up by dowsing rods" he said while on a recent visit to San Diego.  I thought I'd put him to the test so we jerry rigged a metal coat hanger to act as a dowsing rod.    A few years back I had put in an additional sewage line from the house to the street.  At the time, it took me a week to find the spot where the sewage pipe from the street connected to the house line.   I had my brother- in-law walk in the general area of where I knew the underground pipe to be.  As he walked over the exact spot, the two wires he was holding crossed.</P>
<P>     The earth is a buzz with unseen electronic pulses, invisible forces.   Add to those natural electronic pulses, man made frequencies from radios, T.V.'s, computers, etc., and you've got an unseen electronic symphony.  And if you cold hear this  symphony, it's got to sound something like a composition by Stravinsky, with discordant sounds and loud clashes emanating from literally everywhere.</P>
<P><B>EMF's</B>
     Jeanne Gallick, President of Shakti Bracelet, had been environmentally ill for ten years, with most of her symptoms being similar to chronic fatigue syndrome.  After making many improvements in her diet and environment, she finally located a major source of her illness - the electromagnetic radiation that was coming from the AC wiring  and appliances in her home.  "My generation is the first to grow up completely surrounded from conception by electromagnetic fields or EMF's.  Because the current alternates, we are literally being constantly bombarded by invisible forces that switch their magnetic direction 120  times a second" according to Ms. Gallick.  After experimenting she eventually developed the Shakti Bracelet, which she believes allows the body to clarify or tune its own frequencies enough to overcome the static or stressful confusion from the AC current.
      The bracelet, made from copper, has had a dramatic effect on many, from the disappearance of chronic aches to having a sense of peace and well-being.  According to one testimonial letter from a woman suffering from lower back pain, shoulder pain and knee pain, after wearing the Shakti Bracelet, "my life is much, much happier!"</P>
<P>     The bracelet costs $39.00 and has a 60 day money back guarantee.  If you're concerned about EMF's, or have some health concerns that aren't being resolved,  you might want to check out the <B> Shakti Bracelet.  </B></P>

<P>
     What do mentors, coaches, teachers, advisors, counselors,
priests, and rabbis have in common?  A couple of things.  They're
professionals with specialized skills and they help people. 
Sometimes they help people through relationship problems, and
sometimes they serve as role models.  And if we want to learn a
particular skill, like playing the piano, we use their expertise
to help us improve.  After all, they've been down the road we're
on and they're willing to share their knowledge.</P>
<P>     Claude Diamond mentors in the area called "success." 
It's an elusive area.  We've all had experiences with the
opposite of success, and the accompanying feelings of low self
esteem.  But what about that experience called <B>success?</B> 
What if we wake up one morning and say "I want to be successful!" 
How do we find that road?  What are the landmarks?  And how do we
know when we've arrived? </p>
<P>     There isn't a successful person in life who hasn't had
the help of someone along the way.  Sometimes that help takes the
form of  a role model, and sometimes it's an actual "hands on"
mentor.  It's finding that help that often presents a challenge. 
Coincidence may connect us with someone who becomes our mentor,
or we may take a more proactive stance and go out and find that
person, that coach, mentor or instructor and pay for their
skills.  For Claude Diamond, the son of German immigrants living
in New Jersey, life connected him with someone who became his
"mentor," teaching him some methods for achieving success in real
estate.  After moving to California, Mr. Diamond set up shop in
San Diego, helping others achieve success in real estate.  It was
during this time that he discovered that many of his clients
wanted to know more about self esteem and goal setting.  This
eventually lead Mr. Diamond to expand his business, to include a
"Success Training and Coaching Program."</P>
<P>    Today, Claude Diamond heads the Diamond Consulting Group,
which has both a real estate component and a "Success Training
and Individual Coaching Program."  The coaching program helps
individuals and business owners become more successful.  In
either case, Mr. Diamond is able to provide the expertise of a
professional, or "mentor" as he likes to refer to himself, for an
extended period of time.</P>
<P>    Professional consultants aren't for everyone.  But if you
wake up one morning and say to yourself "Hey, I'm ready, I'd like
to be a success," it's worth talking to a consultant or coach
like Claude Diamond.   It just might be the catalyst to put your
business on the right road and help you achieve that elusive
thing called "success."</P>

<TITLE>CHILANGO'S RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>

CHILANGO'S MEXICO CITY GRILL <BR>
142 UNIVERSITY AVE.<BR>
SAN DIEGO CA., 92103<BR>
619-294-8646<BR>

REVIEWED BY ROBERT ROSS

<P>     "I was inspired to open Chilango's because of  my love of Mexico" says owner Jeremy Kravetz. 
So, two years ago, Jeremy along with the very talented chef Rafael Medina, turned this love of Mexico
into a reality.</P>
<P>     Open seven days a week (Monday-Thursday 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. - Friday and Saturday 9 a.m.
to 10 p.m.) Chilango's offers authentic regional cuisine from central and southern Mexico.  The menu
features breakfast (Friday through Sunday), lunch and dinner selections, for both the vegetarian and
non vegetarian diner.</P>
<P>     I dropped by Chilango's a little before the lunch hour, so I was able to get a table,  By noon the
placed was packed (it didn't take me long to figure out why the place was so popular).  Chilango's has
an order counter with tables both inside and out. </P>
   <P>  I started with tortillas and both the Green mole and regular mole sauce dip.  The green mole
sauce was made with cilantro, tomatillos, poblano chiles, roasted pumpkin seeds and spices. The mole
was medium hot, unique and flavorful.  According to the owner, the regular mole sauce is made with
over thirty ingredients from peanuts to chocolate.  I could have stopped right there and made that my
lunch, but I had a job to do.  Next I had the Caldo Xochitl soup which was a real treat.  Made with
chicken broth, chile poblano, tomatillos, spices, a slice of avocado, garbanzo beans, broiled chicken,
and a wedge of lime, this was a soup that left flavors lingering in my mouth long after I finished.  It's
worth the trip to Chilango's just for the soup.  I then tried the chicken tamale which was very
attractively presented, laying in a bed of corn husks and topped with sliced sauted chiles, poblano
strips and green mole sauce.  Just the right balance of flavors    </P>
<P>    It was no wonder that Chilango's has, in just two years, become an award winning restaurant. 
The prices are very reasonable, they offer a healthy dinning menu, and a cuisine that you will want to
tell others about.</P>
<P>    Jeremy Kravetz was inspired to open Chilango's because of his love of Mexico.  One trip to
Chilango's and you'll understand what that love is all about.</P>

SAN DIEGO CA., 92103<BR>

REVIEWED BY ROBERT ROSS<BR>

<P>     The sixties . . . the Beatles, free love, free speech, a search for meaning, back to the earth and
granola .  The dawning of the age of Aquarius.  The mores of the fifties were crumbling and no one
quite knew what the future held.  Some of us fought for social justice, some of us tuned in, turned on
and dropped out, and some searched for a better life in far off communes.  Eventually most who
"experienced" the philosophy of the sixties found their way back into the system, a little wiser and a
little more aware of themselves and the world around them.   According to Frank Russo, owner of the
Kung Food restaurant, the philosophy of the sixties began for him in the early seventies.  After a stint
with IBM, then nine years with in the fast food business, which gave him some invaluable restaurant
skills, he began his search for a more meaningful life.  It was during this period that he discovered
ARICA (a personal growth philosophy) as a path toward greater self awareness.  This eventually lead
to the idea of offering nutritious and tasty vegetarian food in a restaurant setting.</P>
    <P> And just where did the name (Kung Food) come from? The year was 1975, and Frank was
involved with Kung Fu, a martial arts discipline.  For Frank the discipline of Kung Fu was about the
use of energy.  It's not too difficult to tie this into food, after all, food is energy, energy for humans. 
Take this concept of energy, pure energy, natural energy, combine it with a dash of previously learned
restaurant skills and you have Kung Food.  Now, add a dollop of years, twenty to be exact, of
constantly changing and evolving recipes, a staff of sixty, and you have . . . , a San Diego institution. 
</P>
<P>    Open seven days a week (Monday-Thursday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. - Friday 11:30 a.m. to 10
p.m., Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sundays 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.), Kung Food offers an
international selection of vegetarian dishes that are delicious, healthy, and (if you're not already a
vegetarian), just could make a convert out of you.</P>
<P>    On our visit we sampled the Spinach Mushroom Lasagna (a favorite among the regulars),
which is made with mozzarella, ricotta, cheddar and Parmesan cheese. It's baked with spinach, fresh
mushrooms, spinach noodles and a homemade marinara  sauce. This was served with a marinated
vegetable salad.  We also sampled the Aphrodite Quesadilla, which  combined melted cheese, spinach,
mushrooms, sour cream and sunflower seeds rolled into a flour tortilla.  This came with a curried
potato salad (one of the best potato salads I've ever tasted!).  We followed this delicious lunch with
The Fruit Parfait Delight (made in their own bakery) , which was . . . a <I>delight!</I> <P>
<P>     Kung Food caters to a cross section of the community, from business people to college
students, has ample parking, a heated garden patio and a brunch menu for the weekends.  A beer and
wine menu is also available.  And if you have a little extra time and are looking for some unique and
magical gifts, drop into their gift shop, located right on the premises.</P>
<P>      Kung Food restaurant took the positive energy of the sixties, combined it with the  public's
desire for vegetarian cuisine that is exciting to the taste, and made it work for the nineties.  <I>Well
worth a visit!</I></P>

<TITLE> CARE INDIA RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
<P></P>
<BODY>
<H3>CAFE INDIA</H3><BR>
3760-5 SPORTS ARENA BLVD.<BR>
SAN DIEGO, CA. 92110<BR>
619-224-7500<BR>
RESTAURANT REVIEW BY <B>ROBERT ROSS</B><BR>


<P>     Is it possible to eat in a restaurant offering vegetarian cuisine (and a special "Healthy Dining
Menu") and walk out feeling like you've just spent the last hour or so in one of San Diego's finest
gourmet restaurants?  The answer is yes, (but, of course, you already knew that).  All one has to do is
to drop by the Cafe India, at 3760-5 Sports Arena Blvd.  Open seven days a week (from noon until 10
pm), the owners Shab and Meera Srivastava offer: authentic decor, Indian music played in the
background, lots of vegetarian entrees (Shakahari Bhojan), non-vegetarian entrees (Mansahari
Bhojan), a vegetarian buffet, thirteen different kinds of bread, appetizers, Indian tea, Indian beers, and
a wine menu (lest we not forget).  </P>
<P>     The day we dropped by for lunch, I selected the vegetarian lunch buffet which on that day
included curried potatoes, tofu and vegetables,  chick peas, lentils and rice, mild spiced rice, and a
delicious aromatically spiced red lentil soup.  A raita (cucumber in yogurt), a hot salsa and mixed
pickles were available as side dishes, and an option of chicken curry was available for $2.00 extra. 
My dining partner had the Chicken Saag, which is a chicken curry with fresh spinach, served over
white rice.  The restaurant allows the customer to choose the degree of spicy "heat" a dish will have,
from mild to extra hot to please the American palate.  A "medium hot" request resulted in a
moderately spiced dish, which was a perfect balance between spice and curry flavor.  We finished our
lunch with a savory, hot and spicy Indian tea.  The prices for lunch were very reasonable. </P>
<P>     There is a saying in India, "Namaste" which is the equivalent of the Hawaiian "Aloha",
signifying both hello and goodby.  It was evident after we left, there would be many more "Namastes"
at the Cafe India.</P>

<TITLE>SECOND NATURE RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>



<H3>SECOND NATURE VEGETARIAN CAFE</H3><BR>
4652 MISSION BLVD.<BR>
SAN DIEGO CA., 92109<BR>
272-7399<BR>
REVIEWED  BY: <B>ROBERT ROSS</B><BR>

<P>     I live in California because of the ocean.  I'm not a surfer or sun worshipper, there's just
something about the sound of the waves, the water and the sun drifting toward the horizon that evokes
a feeling that I get nowhere else.  At the beach, I've left the grind, and if I look toward the West, I'm in
awe, thoughts drift, ideas float by and dreams come to the surface.  I think dreamers live at the beach. 
And often times their dreams are expressed in a myriad of unique businesses that dot the coastal cities
of California.</P>
<P>     "Do what you love, the rest comes" is printed on the menu of the Second Nature vegetarian
cafe.  The owner John Saslow must have responded to his dream, because the restaurant, which has
been open for three years, embodies more then just food.  A quick glance at the menu and you're
suddenly enveloped in a philosophy which encompasses vegetarianism, healthy dining, holistic health,
animal rights, environmentalism, and as the menu states: "the higher values of respect, creativity,
generosity, faith, trust and love".  I think the manager Robert Hart summed things up when he stated ,
"it's a state of mind here".  </P>
<P>     State of mind?  Philosophy?  But how's the food?  Today, the San Diego Eater sampled the
"spring rolls and Asian salsa".  They were made with broccoli, beansprouts, green onions, carrots,
celery and napa cabbage, wrapped up and sauteed, served with Asian salsa on the side.  Light and
delicious, the spring rolls themselves are worth the trip to Second Nature.  Next, I sampled the
breakfast burrito, with beans.  It's made with garlic, cilantro, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, tofu, corn,
spices, crushed tortilla chips served with whole wheat tortillas.  The breakfast burrito is a favorite at
Second Nature.  It's no wonder, it was mildly spiced, and was very flavorful.  One soon forgets that the
food at Second Nature not only tastes good, but is healthy too.  Lastly, I sampled the Quesadilla,
which was wheat flour tortillas filled with carrots, mushrooms, sprouts, cashews and soy cheese served
with salsa and tofu sour cream.  Again, tasty, and with the salsa you could give it an extra zing if the
mood struck.  Of course, I had to have some fresh carrot juice, to complete the meal.</P>
<P>     Second Nature is casual beach dining, and if you're a people watcher, there's plenty of
opportunity with both inside and outside dining.  Located on Mission Blvd, Second Nature is open
Tuesday through Sunday from 8:30am to 9:30 p.m.  And if you love the ocean, you're only a few steps
away from the sound of the waves, the sun drifting toward the horizon, and maybe, just maybe you
might catch a glimpse of some dreams of your own.  </P>

<H3>DAILY'S RESTAURANT REVIEW</H3><BR>
REVIEWED BY:<B> ROBERT ROSS</B><BR>

<UL>
TWO LOCATIONS:<BR>
<LI>8915 TOWN CENTRE DRIVE, SAN DIEGO, CA,    453-1112<BR>
 <LI>3805 FIFTH AVENUE, HILLCREST, SAN DIEGO, CA,   295-0894<BR>
</UL>
    <P> Daily's restaurant is advertised as a "quick food restaurant that offers an innovative menu
design with cutting edge nutritional concepts, fresh and high flavor foods".   Translation: the food is
delicious, there's some interesting choices on the menu and best of all it's low fat, fresh and high in
nutrition.  But before I go any further, let me back track a bit.  In 1992, a cardiac surgeon named Pat
O. Daily saw a need for a fast food type of restaurant that served great tasting, low fat food.  The rest
is, as they say, history.</P>
<P>The menu at Daily's is divided into: Starters ( small salads, soups, chili) , Salads (Baja pasta
salad, Ceasar Salad, Thai Salad), Side dishes (Baked Potato, Rice, etc.), Entrees (Chicken, Cajun
Catfish, Pasta of the Day, just to mention a few items), Sandwiches  and Desserts.
On this visit, I decided on the Free Range Turkey Breast Pocket Sandwich with the Honey Mustard
sauce.  The sandwich came with a black bean and corn salad. Tasty and healthy!  My lunch partner
had the Thai Noodle Salad, tossed in a Peanut Citrus dressing. The salad was infused with flavorful
spicy ginger. A tasty and filling lunch that won't have you feeling sluggish the rest of the day.</P>
<P>     We ate at the Daily's next to the University Town Shopping center in a gourmet shopping area
known as The Renaissance Towne Centre.</P>
<P>     Orange county will see a Daily's opening soon in Laguna Hills, Tustin and Laguna Niguel.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW-RANCHO NOPAL</TITLE>

<H3><CENTER>SAN DIEGO HEALTHY LIVING</CENTER>
<CENTER>BY: ROBERT ROSS</CENTER></H3>

<B>RANCHO EL NOPAL RESTAURANT</B><BR> 
BAZAAR DEL MUNDO, OLD TOWN<BR>
2754 CALHOUN  STREET<BR>
SAN DIEGO CA., 92110<BR>
295-0584<BR>

     <P> There is one area in San Diego that I never tire of.  Whether it's an evening out with friends or a just a stroll by the unique shops and restaurants, I can always be assured of an enjoyable time at Bazaar Del Mundo in Old Town. One unique restaurant, and relatively new to the scene in old town, is Rancho El Nopal.</P>
<P>     Located in the heart of historic old town, Rancho El Nopal's decor and menu reflect the "days of the Dons" when San Diego was home to more than 30 ranchos. </p>
<P>     At Rancho El Nopal, visitors can relive the flavor of the ranch era through the restaurant's inspiring decor, including wrought iron, serape draped windows and vivid murals portraying the drama of the period.</P>
<P>     True to its identity, Rancho El Nopal features "nopales" menu selections, including "Nopalitios Fritos", which is deep fried cactus served with rancho dressing and salsa verde.  The name Rancho El Nopal reflects the years when California was part of Mexico, and since the "nopal" plant, or prickly pear cactus can be seen at the restaurant's entrance and is indigenous to Mexico,  it's a name that reflects the cuisine and culture of Mexico and early California.</P>
<P>    On our visit we sampled the Chile Con Pollo soup, made with beans, tomatoes, onions, garlic and green and red bell pepper.  The chicken is precooked separately from the ingredients and then combined to make a spicy and healthy dish.</P>
<P>    We then tried the Black Bean Burrito, which was black beans, sour cream tomatillo sauce wrapped in a thin tortilla (made without lard).  The dish included salad and rice. The dish was very flavorful.  We followed this with the Chicken Fahita Salad which was a real visual treat, presented in a flour tortilla shell.  Lastly we sample the Tostada de Pescado, made with cod, garlic, beans, olives, lettuce, cilantro, cabbage and tomatoes.  This dish is soon to be "tested" and added to the "Healthy Dining" menu.</P> 
     <P>  Open seven days a week , from 11a.m. to 9 p.m. (during the warmer months, hours are extended)  Rancho El Nopal offers both a Healthy dining menu, with an ample selection of low fat items, along with a superb range of traditional Mexican and Southwest specialities. </P>
<P>    Rancho El Nopal  has  a heated garden patio and lest we not forget, there is a selection of ten flavors of margaritas!   And if you have a little extra time and are looking for some unique gifts, browse through the unusual shops of Bazaar Del Mundo located only steps away.</P>

<H2><CENTER>REFLEXIONS COLUMN</CENTER></H2><BR>
<H3><CENTER>By Robert Ross</CENTER></H3><BR>
<P>





<H3><B>DO WE NEED A NEW FRONTIER?</B></H3> <BR>


 <P>    In a recent made for T.V. movie, "The Good Old Boys",
Tommy Lee Jones plays a cowboy named Hewey Calloway.  He's living
at the turn of the century when the West was taking on the
semblance of civilized behavior.  Automobiles were capturing our
imagination and it was evident that the cowboy was soon to be a
thing of the past.  Enter Hewey Calloway, he's a classic free
spirit who wears his heart on his sleeve.  He reminds us a side
of us that's been lost over the last century.  Our adventurous
spirit has, in many ways, gone the way of the cowboy, and we need
it back.</P>  
    <P> Buried within us all is a spirit that wants to have
settled the old West, wants to have discovered new mountain
ranges, new jungles, and lost continents.  There's a side that
wants to know what's over there, what's around the next bend. 
And in the past we were able to take that curiosity, that
primitive energy and channel it.  "Go west" was the call, and we
did.  </P>
<P>  On Sunday mornings, I, like millions of other Americans,
find comfort in the ritual of reading the Sunday morning
newspaper.  I start at the beginning of the paper and work my way
through, eventually coming to the Travel section.  And there, in
living color, on the front page, is the reason why I soon find
myself staring out the window, dreaming of a time when  . . .
well, the adventure was alive.  For example, on any given Sunday
one might find a picture of a tribesman from New Guinea standing
in front of his tour boat.  A glance at the opening paragraph,
and you'll see words like "wonderful" and "marvelous", "the
shopping was fantastic", "the accommodations were charming, with
a primitive motif" a "real find".  What was once primitive,
natural, untouched and undiscovered is now on every travel
agent's map.</P>
<P>     There was a time, as we saw in the movie "The Good Old
Boys" when each day challenged us, not only physically, but also  
emotionally.  The first settlers to come across plains took
enormous chances, no Auto Club maps, hotels, or charge cards.  
And there were seemingly endless frontiers for the adventurer to
explore.  Times have changed.  By the 1970's there were companies
set up specifically for adventures, with names like "Adventure
Tours".  One phone call and your adventure is set, VISA or
Mastercard?    </P>
<P>     We're approaching the end of a decade and the also the
end of the century.  The West has been conquered, and the
adventures are, by in large, prepackaged.  Space exploration has
fizzled out and been put on the back burner.  So the nation turns
to the O.J. trial, and the myriad of tabloid news shows in an
attempt to fill an inner longing.  But from time to time we see
characters like Hewey Calloway, and once again are reminded that
there's something missing, something that humans desperately
need.  A new frontier that captures our imagination, a frontier
that unleashes our adventurous spirit once again.</P>

<TITLE>REFLEXION'S COLUMN-SWIMMING</TITLE>

<CENTER><H2>Swimming Brings Us Closer To
Meaning</H2></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER><H3>By Robert Ross</CENTER></H3><BR>
<P>     Observing the afternoon lap swimmers, one would think
they were a part of an orchestrated effort by a coach sitting at
a computer screen somewhere in the locker room.  He gives each
lane an assignment.  Lane one,  two hundred meters with the kick
board, lane two, 400 hundred free style, lane three, 200 doing
the back stroke, and so it goes down the line.   When finished,
the swimmer exits the pool, replaced by another.  Our swimmers
appear to be from the same mold. </P>
<P>      Let's take a closer look . . . Bill lost his job a few
months back and swimming is his way of maintaining a positive
state of mind.  During the day he worries a lot, fighting off
discouragement and depression.  He knows that things will change
eventually, they <I>have</I> to change, his savings are
dwindling.  Back and forth he swims.  Slowly . . . slowly his
thoughts begin to shift from recounting the frustrations of the
day to how strong he feels as he pulls his way through the water.
</P> 
    <P> Kathy walks self consciously along the side of the pool,
looking for an empty lane.  A large towel is strategically draped
over her.  She's embarrassed about what's happened to her body. 
She's put on weight after giving birth and decided that it's time
to take it off.  A lane opens up and soon she blends in with the
others.  An observer walks by noticing only that her flip turn is
poetry to the eye.     </P>
<P>    In the pool, we're stripped of job titles and histories. 
We each enter the water coming from days that are as different as
the human experience can imagine.  We are bosses, employees,
fathers, mothers, husbands, retirees, and so on.  The shower
begins the transition from these job titles and responsibilities
to who we are.  From three-piece suits, doctor's greens and
police uniforms to a piece of cloth no bigger then a t-shirt.  We
could be swimming next to a Nobel prize winner and it wouldn't
matter.  In the pool, we're all just people.  People with ideas
and dreams and goals.  People who love swimming.   </P>

<B>If we look for meaning . . .</B><BR>    
    <P> Whatever the day held for us, we know that by the end of
the day's swim, if we plan it right, we'll leave with a sense of
peace and calm.  It's during those moments, perhaps during the
swim, or directly afterwards, that things seem to come into
perspective.  We  get closer to relevance and meaning.  The trees
are greener, the sky is bluer and everything looks a little
better after swimming.  Those problems that seemed significant
before entering the pool no longer occupy one's thoughts after
swimming.  They're not gone, but they've lost some of their
impact.</P>
    <P> If we design it right, we can get what we want from our
swimming, from camaraderie to time alone.  From a renewed
enthusiasm for life to a renewed reverence for the beauty around
us.</P>
    <P> And so we swim, each with our own purpose and our own
goals.  Each knowing, but not revealing, that swimming brings us
closer to meaning. </P>

<B>I LOOVEEE YOUUU . . .</B><BR>
<P>

     "I looveee youuu" . . . were the parting words that my older sister said to me over the phone.  She
stretched the words out and used a low and airy tone, to emphasize her point.  "Hum," I thought.  Now
what the heck I'm I suppose to do with that?  Here we are, a couple of middle-aged adults, who never
used the "L" word when growing up, now all of sudden it's "I looveee youuu" time?   </P>
<P>     I was  uncomfortable hearing this from my sister.  It must be guilt I thought to myself!  All
those Sunday nights, growing up, when she hogged the radio, not letting me listen to The Lone
Ranger, or The Whistler.  That was it, guilt!  But the reality is, what bothered me was, that in her
attempt to sound sincere, it sounded very insincere.  I know she was trying, but maybe that was the
problem.  The words were there, but the emotion was forced, unnatural, lacking genuineness.  Sure, all
humans love each other at some level, but it would be nice if it didn't have to be so . . .  well, you
know, so serious.  It would be nice if it was just natural, from the heart. </P>
<P> <B>    Just natural, from the heart.</B><BR>  So how do we tell people that we care deeply
about them when we've just gotten off the freeway, or returned from a trip to the super market or
gotten one of a dozen phone calls that week announcing that we qualify for a credit card from XYZ
company?  How do we switch from emotions that are often tangled and jangled to an emotion that's
really at the core of who we are?  Can we instantly call up that one feeling that might have us weeping
or dancing for joy if it were to be fully felt and expressed.  Oovah . . . the sixty-four-dollar question. 
</P>
<P><B>     No simple task.</B><BR>  So my sister tries and her younger brother thinks, what
younger brothers sometimes think.  Love?  Yuk!, "Why do ya wanna ruin the conversation with that
kind of talk?  Let's go play, enough of this love stuff!"</P>
<P>     What my sister's comment did do was get me thinking.  Growing up, "I love you"  wasn't
something that I heard a lot. In fact, I can't recall ever hearing it.   My parents were to busy doing what
they had to do, to take care of the five of us.  For me, looking back, that was love, expressed
unequivocally.  Yes, I guess it would have been nice to have the "I love yous" thrown about, so that
now, as an adult, these words would be a natural part of my vocabulary, but they weren't, hence my
present day discomfort.</P>
<P>     And then there's the question of appropriate responses.  What do I say, "dittos," or a "love ya
toooooo," or maybe  "oh gooosh?"    Nothing seems to feel right.  I'm just never comfortable when that
"L" word comes floating my way.  It's O.K. for others, and boy can the movies bring tears to my eyes
when they capture that moment.  But for me, for now, perhaps the "I loveee Youuu's" are better left for
older sisters to say . . . and younger brothers to contemplate.</P>

<TITLE>REFLEXION'S COLUMN-SHEEHAN</TITLE>
 <CENTER><H2>      A TRIBUTE TO DR. GEORGE SHEEHAN,
ATHLETE</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>BY: ROBERT ROSS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<I>"When we take to the roads, we place ourselves in a setting
that fosters our art - which is no less than the self we make and
the life we live"</I><BR>
                                                           
George Sheehan, M.D.<BR>                                          
    (1918-1993)<BR>
                                                            

  <P>    Dr. Sheehan was a great man.  And in this day and age,
great men are few and far between.  I had been a fan of his since
he started writing for Runner's World, and had always wanted to
"drop him a line" to let him know how much I looked forward to
his writings, but I never got around to it.  They say we regret
those things that we don't do in life, so I'm writing this
tribute perhaps five or ten years late, but better late then
never.</P> 
   <P>  I've been involved in fitness since the mid 1970's.  It
was around this time period that the fitness boom started.  For
me, the late sixties and early seventies had taken their toll on
my body, and by chance, in the mid 1970's, a friend had asked me
if I wanted to play racquetball.  Three days later my muscles
still ached, but my spirit had been awakened.  Movement, sweat,
strain, I had found what I needed, and at a much deeper level,
what I was looking for.  To feel alive, fully, to feel connected,
mind and body, and to have a path for a deeper awareness of self. 
Racquetball led to jogging, jogging to marathons, marathons to
triathlons.  Always there was a sense that I was moving closer to
something undefinable.  Something that I couldn't put into words.
</P><P>   I'm not exactly sure when I became aware of Dr.
Sheehan's writings, but at some point I noticed that there was a
man who loved running, and who wrote about it from his heart.  A
man  who used running to learn, to grow, and to examine life.  He
wanted to know more about himself, about existence, about
fitness, and about spiritual matters.  Up until that point in
time, sports and fitness were written about in terms of team
scores, million dollar contracts, Super Bowls and World Series. 
Sports commentators resembled drill sergeants in their
descriptive phrases of athletics, barking scores and delivering
sound bytes about the game.  But along with me, millions of
Americans were beginning what was later to be called the "fitness
boom".  We were, in fact, becoming athletes.  We were, awakening
to a desire from within.  A hunger that needed defining.  I knew
when I began to jog that I was gaining more then just a healthier
heart.  But what was it?  Why had running taken on such
significance in my life?  The sports pages of the local newspaper
never wrote about such things.  But Dr. Sheehan did.  He was able
to begin to clarify that desire to run.  He was able to define
fitness, (running or whatever) in a way that brought it beyond
the jumping jack mentality that we were all taught in school. 
And he re-reminded me of what I had known as a child, that
physical activity was good for the soul.  Running and fitness,
undefinable at times, brinking on the religious, was always much
more.  And he reminded us that we were all athletes in the
making.  Nine or ninety, it didn't matter.  We were all athletes.
</P>
   <P>  I have had very few heros in my life, Dr. Sheehan has
been one of them.  My only regret is that I didn't tell him that
when he was still with us. The world is a better place because of
him.  He will be missed.  And my hope for Dr. Sheehan . . . would
be that wherever his is, there are races yet to be run.  </P>

<TITLE>REFLEXION'S COLUMN-FIFTY</TITLE>

<CENTER><H2>TURNING 50 . . . (HAPPY BIRTHDAY???)</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>BY ROBERT ROSS</CENTER></H3>

 
  <P>   My wife, who hit the big "Five Oh" twelve months before
me described being 50 as "being invisible".  You know, you walk
into a  social gathering place like a lively bar or restaurant
and no one looks at you, no longing glances, none of those "hey,
you're kind of cute" looks.  Instead, you get an attentive
clerk/waiter/waitress who calls you sir/ma'am.  You've become in
many ways invisible to the general population, a population that
values youth.  After all, you're now 50, you've reached the gates
of what has been falsely dubbed "the golden years."  You may be
at the pinnacle, in terms of life experiences or career, but now,
there's a good possibility that you'll be referred to as "that
old guy/lady" by the younger generation.   At fifty it's easy to
get a sense that one is no longer a player.  The problem is, now
that I'm fifty, I don't feel that much different, my health is
about the same, and my thinking is, if anything, a little more
realistic.  So what's the deal here?  I'm still a person you
know!</P> 
   <P>  I'm just not quite ready for this golden years stuff. 
And if I were to believe all of those ads on T.V., I'd think that
getting older was all fun and games.  You've seen them, a grey
haired couple  dancing the night away on a cruise liner, or
finishing up a rigorous game on the tennis court (that's after
taking their senior citizen vitamins of course), or how about
that bike ride in the countryside?  Madison Avenue plays on our
innermost fears, the fear of aging.  "You're not getting older,
you're getting better"  is the mantra we hear.  Take a vitamin
and dance the night away!  We all want this image of aging  to be
true.  And yet, we know  that  there is no happy city, end of the
rainbow, or leisure world that one finally reaches.  As we age,
the challenges take on greater significance.  If anything, as one
moves on in life, one needs to develop more courage.  Courage to
face a world which continues to be filled with problems and the 
courage to face certain inevitabilities, like the myriad of
health problems that tend to come with aging.  It was the author
Etta Clark who titled a book "Growing Older Is Not For Sissies." 
No truer words were spoken. </P>
<P>      So is there any advantage to turning fifty?  Is there
any benefit to watching the years slip by faster and faster? 
There is one advantage, with age comes experience and knowledge,
and with that knowledge comes a certain confidence.  We have, at
fifty, "been there and done that".  We've seen good times and
bad,  we've felt many joys and many sorrows and we have a grasp
of what's possible and what's not.   But can I honestly say I'm
happy about turning fifty?   Probably not.  Oh . . . there is one
other advantage to turning fifty I've been told.  I will in the
weeks to come receive in the mail and invitation to join AARP
(American Association of Retired People).  And if I accept their
invitation, I will not only belong to the most powerful lobbying
organization in Washington, but I believe I'll also receive 10%
off on French fries at McDonalds.  It just doesn't get any
better!</P> 
   <P>  Reaching the half century mark has caused me to stop and
reflect.  The boomers are now turning fifty, we're at the gates
to the leisure world mentality, but for some reason I don't think
we're going to accept the Madison Avenue version.  I think for
many of us who have watched our health and kept in shape, fifty
will be a time to reflect, and then a time to recommit, recommit
to living a vigorous life,  recommit to living a life in which we
are needed and valued and recommit to using our experience and
knowledge to make the world we live in a better place. </P>
<P>     Even though at fifty, we begin to see the finish line, we
know in our 
hearts . . . there  are still lessons to be learned and dreams to
be dreamed. </P>

<TITLE>REFLEXIONS COLUMN-ATHLETE</TITLE>




<CENTER><H2>THE ULTIMATE ATHLETE</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>BY ROBERT ROSS</CENTER></H3>

<P>     "I saw at least eight fights break out the last time I
went" said a friend.  "We're number one!", the eighteen year old
yelled from his car, while waving a bottle of tequila in the air. 
"Hey, who 'ya bettin' on in the next game?" one patron asked
another at a local tavern between gulps of beer.</P>
<P>     Call it being a sports fan, sports buff or sports
fanatic, it boils down to watching others participate in physical
activity.  And at times,  it also resembles a cross between a
casino in Las Vegas and a bar room brawl.  We watch, we yell,
they play.  We encourage and sometimes idolize others who are
involved in multi million dollar contracts, shoe endorsements,
drug problems, PR firms, lawyers, Super Bowls and World Series. 
When we're not watching "the game", we watch the local
sportscasters barking out scores on T.V., all to find out who's
number one, who's better, who's the greatest, who's the ultimate
athlete?</P>
<P>     It was George Leonard who, in the late 1970's, wrote a
book entitled <U>The Ultimate Athlete</U>.  Each sport was
analyzed, each athlete was examined.  Was it the swimmer?  Images
of Mark Spitz come to mind, using all of the muscle groups of the
body, lungs and heart working to their maximum efficiency.  Or
was it the baseball player, displaying a certain finesse on the
field?  How about the mountain climber, risking his or her life,
or the weight lifter, the runner, the football player?  </P>
<P>    The ultimate athlete . . . was there something that set
this person aside?  What could we learn from such a person?  
Well, in short, the ultimate athletes are you and I.  These may
be somewhat confusing words to the couch potato, but let's take a
look.</P>
   <P>  Close your eyes for a moment and think back . . . that
warm summer day at the pool, you were seven or eight years old,
and you could hardly control yourself as you headed toward the
water.  "Walk, walk" the life guard yells out, you slow down
momentarily, only to resume your dash toward the pool's edge. 
Once in the water, your body and soul knew exactly what to do. 
Play!  Have fun, swim, splash and pretend you're a fish.  One
minute you were in an argument, the next minute you retaliated
gleefully with a cannonball.  And how you looked in awe at those
who ventured into the deep end.  Of course we all grew up, and
learned that this is not appropriate behavior for adults.  Or is
it?  You see at eight, you were exhibiting all of the signs of
being the ultimate athlete.   </P>
<B><I>SIGNS . . .</I> </B><BR>
<P>     Paraphrasing from George Leonard's book,  The ultimate
athlete:
<UL><LI> Combines mind body and spirit (isn't that what play is
all about)
<LI> Accepts pain and joy equally (that's part of any game)
<LI> Explores the mind's relationship to the body (remember how
you had to talk                       yourself into diving off
the diving board the first time?)
<LI> Surpasses limitations (you eventually did make it into the
deep end, didn't                          you?)
<LI> Serves as a role model (someone had to teach the young kids
the                                    cannonball!)</UL>
<P>          So it looks like eight year olds should be the gurus
of the nineties, after all, they've found the key to happiness
(play) and in the process have become true athletes.  No million
dollar contracts, no drug problems, just true athletes.  </P>
<P>      We'll never be able to go back to those days, but
perhaps we can learn from those eight year olds.  You see, inside
us all, is a kid that wants to come out and play.  Our bodies
yearn to run and jump and dance and swim.  We just need to give
it an excuse . . . a sport, a hobby or a certain exercise.  But 
instead, many of us  grow up and turn our attention to others
that play, and make them our heros.  We watch, we yell, <I>we</I>
pay, they play.</P>
<P>     But there's still time, there's always time, to look
within and recognize  . . ., recognize the part that wants to
join in, and run and jump and dance and celebrate who we are,
athletes, the ultimate athletes.      </P>

<TITLE>REFLEXIONS COLUMN-A NATION</TITLE>
<CENTER><H2>A NATION IN SEARCH OF A VISION</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>BY ROBERT ROSS</H3></CENTER>
<P></P>


<B>1969</B><BR>
<P>"One small step for man, one large step for mankind" were
the words spoken by Neil Armstrong, on July 20, 1969.  America
had just landed (for the first time) on the moon.  At the time, I
was driving on Nordoff St., in the San Fernando Valley.  I had to
pull over to side of the road because of the overwhelming sense
of awe.  Chills ran up and down my spine.  A president had said,
"we are going to the moon" and we did.</P>
<P>    Since the sixties, the country has had a half dozen
recessions, a few wars, the assassinations of President Kennedy,
Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, the arrival of the VCR,
microwave oven and the household computer.   It's been a time of
turbulence and change, to say the least.  </P>

<B>1996</B><BR>
   <P>  As we move toward the November election, one can't help
but notice that there is an unmistakable discord in the air. 
Something is churning in the American spirit.  There is the
obvious tug of war going on between Republicans and Democrats. 
But there's something else going on too.  It's an undeniable
disillusionment with the ways things are going on in Washington.
We see nightly news broadcasts of drug and crime problems in our
streets, and say to ourselves that things have to change.   Some
twenty million people a week turn to a particular radio talk show
host to get information that doesn't seem to be forthcoming from
the mainstream media or from the White House.  And  millions of
Americans across the nation turn to  third party candidates
rather then staying with the choices offered by the two party
system.</P>    
   <P>  It's been almost thirty years since we did the
unthinkable, land a man on the moon.  This was one of our last
great dreams together as a nation.  It's as though we've been
marking time since then.  Almost thirty years later and we can't
even reach a consensus on balancing the budget, let alone where
our next adventure will take us. </P>
<P>      As a nation, we know that  something isn't right.  We
just can't figure out where to go from here.  We arm ourselves
with facts, call into talk shows, tune into the Internet,
complain about the lack of leadership, and get ready . . .  get
ready and then wait.  While we wait, we hope . . . hope that a
leader will emerge, a leader with a vision and the strength to
see that vision through.</P>
<P>    The politicians are lining up to offer their visions for
our nation.  The only question is, is it a great vision?  Will
this vision send chills up and down our collective spines if it's
accomplished?  Will it be an exciting journey on the way, <I>a
daring adventure?</I>  Will it unify us with a common purpose? 
If not, our collective voice should say "step out of the way, and
make room for someone else",  because it's time we do something
great.  It's time we take <I><B>"one large step for mankind"</B></I>
once again.  History is waiting . . . waiting to write another
chapter  .  .  .  what that chapter is titled, is up to us.</P>

<B><H3>WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISE . . . SLOW DOWN!</H3></B><BR>
BY: ROBERT ROSS<BR>
<P></P>


<P></P>
<B>   <I>         Feelin' Groovy . . .<BR>
                 "Slow down you move too fast, you've got to make the morning last"*  </I></B><BR>
<P>                                    

     Some of us are lucky.  We were born slow and we'll always be that way.  No arguments, that's
just the way it is. </P>
<P>     And what happens if you combine slowness with a love of fitness?  You just might have
the makings of a "slow athelete".  We slow people look at exercise and fitness differently from
those who were born to be fast.  We rarely advertise who we are, and receive no trophies or
accolades.  We just love to exercise, and aren't too concerned about how fast or how slow we do
it. </P>
<P>     And just what distinguishes a slow athelete?  Here are some signs:<BR>
    -Slow atheletes try to avoid wearing a watch during exercise.  After all, one of the beauties of
any fitness activity is leaving the world of everyday meetings and time schedules behind.<BR>
    -Slow atheletes judge their activity not by the amount of laps, their times or their speed, but
rather on the experience itself.  You might hear terms describing their workouts like:  "fantastic,
relaxing, sensual, peaceful, spiritual and wonderful."  The less verbal in our community may be
heard to sum it up with "cool!"     <BR>
    -When slow atheletes look at those pace clocks that are always located near the lap lanes at the
pool, they have the urge to tell the life guard that they must be broken.   After all, the second hand
keeps sweeping around, but the clock never tells the correct time of day! <BR>
     -Slow atheletes go about their day feeling a bit smug.  Sure, they may be under pressure,
meeting deadlines, confronting corporate presidents or politicians, but hey, they know at the end of
the day, they're going, not to another meeting, but for a rejuvenating swim/run/bike/walk or game
of racquetball.   <BR>
      -Slow atheletes will sometimes do things that appear to be unusual for  serious exercies buffs. 
For example, slow swimmers might swim under water as though they were dolphins, or perhaps
lay on their backs perfectly still, just feeling the buoyancy of the water.  Slow joggers may pass a
beautifully landscaped garden and stop for an extended period of time to enjoy its splendor.<BR>
<P>      And lastly, slow atheletes are a content group of people with no driving need to improve
their time or technique.  They exercise because they love what it does for them.  They exercise for
the sake of exercising.   </P>
    <P> So, if you find yourself in the middle of a workout one day and you have this urge to
emulate a dolphin, lay on your back, or gaze at a country garden, you might be ready to join us. 
But be forewarned, you'll receive no ribbons, or hold any age group records.  You'll just have the
satisfaction of knowing that exercise brings a lasting enjoyment to your life that far exceeds any
fleeting awards or recognition.</P>
         <B>   Slow down, you move too fast  .  .  .  </B>

   <P>  We're all aware of the mission of the Star Ship Enterprise: "To go where no one has gone
before, to seek out new life, to explore new worlds" . . . that's pretty clear.  But for most of us, the
word mission conjures up images of extraordinary human beings, doing exceptional things, people
who have a vision, who know where they're going, and what they want to achieve.  It's as though
they have a predetermined destiny.  Thoughts of mother Teresa, Christopher Columbus, or
Thomas Edison come to mind.   Certainly there's no relationship between those remarkable people
and the rest of us.  Or is there?  Do we all have missions . . . undiscovered, untapped, waiting to
be revealed?</P>
   <P>  In the best selling book <U>"Embraced By The Light"</U> the author Betty Eadie dies
while undergoing an operation.  She leaves her body and connects with what can only be
described as angels in heaven.  The experience of dying and going to heaven envelopes her in a
peace that she has never felt before.  When the angels tell her the time has come to return to her
body, she's understandably reluctant.  She doesn't want to come back to her earthly life.  But she's
told that she has a mission on earth that needs to be accomplished before she can return to heaven.
The author begs to have her mission revealed, but the angels tell her that if it is revealed, once she's
back in her earthly body she'll immediately attempt to accomplish her mission so that she can again
return to heaven, thus abandoning those who love and need her on earth.<P>

<I><B><H4>MISSIONS</H4></B></I><BR>

<P>  "Your mission Mr. Phelps, should you decide to accept it
is . . ."  (from the hit T.V. series Mission Impossible).  Like Mr. Phelps from the T.V. series, or
Betty Eadie (<U>Embraced By The Light</U>), we all have missions in life, undiscovered, and
untapped.  The question is how do we go about identifying it?   And how do we know that we're
on the right track to accomplishing it?</P>
<P>Abraham Maslow, one of the more widely quoted psychologists of this century determined
that we have a hierarchy of needs. This hierarchy is often depicted as a pyramid with the first or
basic needs at the bottom.  Once each need is met, the individual is in a position to begin satisfying
needs higher on the hierarchy.  For example, our first need to be met is food and shelter, basic
survival needs.  One can't even contemplate designing a fulfilling life until this need is met.  Next
we need a sense of safety and security, then belongingness, self esteem, and finally, only after
we've taken care of those lower needs are we in a position to embrace self actualization.</P>
<P>     We have, for the first time in history, reached a point where we, in the western world, can
focus on more then just survival.  There's an economic and social safety net set up where, with a
little hard work we can manage.  And with a little more hard work and some creativity we can have
a pretty good life, having satisfied our survival, safety, belongingness and self esteem needs.  This
leaves us with the luxury of being able to focus on concepts like "mission".</P>
<P><H4><I><B>Mission . . .</B></I></H4> turning to the dictionary, we see that this word is
defined as: "an assignment to or work in a field of missionary enterprise", "a body of persons sent
to perform a service or carry on an activity", "to send on or entrust with a mission".  The definition
implies that there is someone or something directing the mission.  Yet we can also view ourselves
as the creators of our own mission.  Some people believe our mission or purpose has in many
ways been predetermined, designed into our the fabric of our being, waiting to be uncovered.  On
the other hand, others believe we creat our own destiny.  Whether Mother Teresa responded to an
inner voice, or heard a message from God, she nonetheless determined that her life would take a
certain course.  She had all of the choices the world has to offer, from furniture manufacturing to
clerking at Vons.  But somewhere in her fabric was the desire to work with those in need.  Her
temperament, personality, goals and needs were all consistent with her perceived mission.  
Christopher Columbus responded to an inner voice.  He too, could have been a farmer, carpenter,
or priest.  But somewhere inside was a driving force to which he responded.  They both did
something that was and (is) meaningful to them and made a contribution.  As a result the world
was changed.</P>

<H4><B><I>MEANINGFUL WORK AND MAKING A CONTRIBUTION.</H4></I></B>  

<P>        The highest tribute one could pay us at the end of our adventure here on earth would be
to say that our lives were meaningful and we made a contribution.  Certainly any mission that we
would undertake would involve these words.   These are words that feel right to our inner selves. 
Words that we would like to have spoken about us.  Meaningfulness and making a contribution,
these are two sides of a triangle, but we need a third, the base.  We need something that ties it all
together.  That "something" is our unique gifts.  Those attributes that we were born with and that
only we possess.</P>
<P>     This third and probably the most important element is to identify our uniqueness, our
fabric.  Who we are?  What are those characteristics that distinguish us from all others.  Once
we've identified who we are, only then can we clearly hear that voice from within.</P>
<P>     By identifying and using our unique talents, skills and abilities, doing something that's
meaningful to us, and making a contribution to bettering the world, then our lives become
significant.  That's the framework of our mission.     </P>
<P>     But just how do we go about identifying our unique skills, and abilities?  How do we know
that we're on the path towards finding our mission?</P>

about identifying our uniqueness.</I></BLOCKQUOTE></B><BR>

<TITLE>FINDING OUR MISSION IN LIFE-PART 2</TITLE>


<CENTER><H3>AN UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO CAREER
PLANNING</H3></CENTER>

PART 2: FINDING OUR MISSION<BR>

part 2 of a 3 part series<BR>

<P><I>This article is the second in a three part series.  The first article was an overview of the
concept of finding our mission in life.  Part two will focus on the methods used to recognize our
uniqueness and begin defining our mission in life.  Part three will focus on the nuts and bolts of
how finding our mission relates to Career Planning.</P></I>





<B><BLOCKQUOTE><I>     "All people have stars, but they are not the same things for
different people.  For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides.  For others they are no more
than little lights in the sky.  For others, who are scholars, they are problems.  But all these stars are
silent.  You - you alone - will have the stars as no one else has them"<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
           <CENTER>  From: <U>"The Little Prince"</U> by: Antoine De Saint-
Exupery</I></CENTER></B>


    <P> And so it is, when we talk of uncovering our mission in life.  You - you alone - will have a
mission as no one else.</P>
<P>     In Part One of this series we discussed the concept of "mission".  Do we all have missions .
. . undiscovered, untapped, waiting to be revealed?  And if we do, how do we go about  
discovering what our mission is? </P>
<P>     In order for individuals to focus on the concept of mission, it's essential that they take care
of some basic needs in their lives first.  Abraham Maslow, one of the more widely quoted
psychologists of this century determined that we have a hierarchy of needs.  This hierarchy is often
depicted as a pyramid with the first or basic needs at the bottom.  Once each need is met, the
individual is in a position to begin satisfying other needs on the hierarchy.  For example, once
survival needs of food and shelter are satisfied, then an individual can resolve issues around safety
and security, then belongingness, and self esteem. And finally, only after we've taken care of those
basic needs, are we in a position to contemplate our life's mission.  </P>
    <P> Like the triangle used in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the road to uncovering our mission
can also be looked at as a triangle.  Previously, we identified the two sides of our mission triangle
as being: "meaningfulness", and  "making a contribution".   To connect with and fulfill our mission
in life, our work must be meaningful to us and we must have a sense that we're making a
contribution.  The base of the triangle, something that ties it all together, is the utilization of our
unique gifts; those attributes with which we were born and that only we possess.</P>

<H4><I><B>WHO ARE YOU?</H4></I></B>   

  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>  "And a man said, Speak to us of Self Knowledge.  And he answered,
saying:  Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.  But your ears thirst for
the sound of your heart's knowledge"<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
                   <CENTER>              <U>The Prophet</U> by: Kahlil
Bibran</I></CENTER><BR>

<P>       We were all born with unique gifts, talents, natural skills, abilities, and ways of viewing
the world.  But for many, in the process of growing up, we shelved these gifts in order to "get a
job", pay the bills, and in general live a socially acceptable life. </P>
<P>     For some, that longing to hear the sound of our heart's knowledge continues . . . and in our
quiet moments we ask:  "Who am I?"  "What is my purpose in life?"  "Why am I here?"</P>
<P>     Who am I? . . . questions philosophers have been grappling with since the beginning of
recorded history.  The ears thirsting for the heart's knowledge.  There is an answer, not as
elaborate as you may have thought.  You have a name, you have beliefs, a history, a temperament,
dreams and desires.  You have talents, and skills you may not be unaware of.  Your search for
who you are is a process of uncovering and unearthing what you (at some level) may already
know.  And it's a process of organizing this information so that it's useful.   </P>

<H4><I><B>WHERE DO WE BEGIN?</H4></I></B><BR>
     Where do we begin?  How do we go about clearly defining who we are in terms that we, and
those around us understand?  How do define ourselves in a way that will translate into work that is
meaningful and makes a contribution?  We begin by recognizing an inner need, a feeling of
incompleteness, a desire to know more about ourselves, our temperament, our talents and natural
skills.  As the process unfolds, we read, we talk to career counselors, take aptitude tests, career
evaluation tests, personality tests, and we listen closely to the answers.  Some of the answers won't
fit, won't feel right.  But if we persist, eventually  we'll begin hearing ourselves saying more and
more "yea, that's it, that me!"   The picture will become clearer and clearer.  Who you are will
emerge in a way that you understand and can verbalize.  You'll be able to define your strengths,
your temperament, your style of working, your skills, and abilities.  You'll prioritize this
information so that it's pertinent to you right now.  And you'll find out that your dreams are worthy
dreams.  It may take some doing to arrange your life so that you're utilizing who you are to its
highest and best use, but in the end it'll be worth it.  In the end you will clearly understand the
meaning of the word mission. Your mission.<BR>

<H4><I><B>METHODS</H4></I></B><BR>
     When selecting career counselors, you have essentially two choices.  One may cost as much as
$5000, the other is free or almost free.  Most community colleges have career counselors available. 
They offer not only an opportunity to talk to someone about options available, career planning
classes, job search classes, but also the opportunity to take a number of career evaluation tests. 
<P>    There are a myriad of good tests available, with names like COPES, COPS, CAPS, Myers
Briggs, STRONG, etc., all designed to confirm what you may already know about yourself, and in
some cases to shed some light on this puzzle called you.  Some of these tests reveal your
personality type, (Myers Briggs), some compare your overall personality type with those that work
in various career fields (STRONG) to see where you'll most likely find others who think like you. 
All these tests will be food for thought. </P>
<P>     There is one book on the market that is considered the Bible of career planning books,
<U>What Color Is Your Parachute?,</U> by Richard Nelson Bolles.  This is considered by most
in the field of career planning to be the best approach, hands down.  Along with <U>What Color
Is Your Parachute?</U>, Mr. Bolles has created a supplemental workbook titled <U>How to
Create a Picture of Your Ideal Job or Next Career.</U>  In this workbook, you'll have and
opportunity to look back over your life, identifying those times when you felt successful and had
achieved something.  The achievement could have been as ordinary as assembling a model airplane
or as extraordinary as climbing Mt Everest.  In any event, it's your achievement, yours to be mined
for skills.  What natural skills were you using?  What did you enjoy doing most?  Eventually, after
analyzing seven achievements, using the workbook, a pattern will unfold, and you'll begin to see
how unique you are. You'll begin to see that you and you alone have skills that, given the
opportunity, you prefer to use.   </P>
<P>     Additionally in your search there is always room to include sources outside the
conventional path.  You can fill in the blanks here, but I'll get you started: astrologers, psychics, tea
leaf readers  .   .  . , if it works for you, then by all means.</P>
<P>      Let's jump ahead a bit here, and assume you've done your reading, taken tests, talked to a
counselor, dusted off some of your old dreams, uncovered some new ones, and had glimpses of
your mission. Now you're determined to do something meaningful, and make a contribution to the
world.  What's the next step?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>Part three of this series will focus on the nuts and bolts of how finding our
mission relates to work and career planning.</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>FINDING YOUR MISSION IN LIFE-PART THREE</TITLE>


<CENTER><H3>AN UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO CAREER
PLANNING</H3></CENTER><BR>

PART 3: FINDING OUR MISSION<BR>

part 3 of a 3 part series<BR>

<P><TT>This article is the last in a three part series.  The first article was an overview of the
concept of finding our mission in life.  Part two focused on the methods used to recognize our
uniqueness and begin defining our mission in life.  Part three will focus on the nuts and bolts of
how finding our mission relates to Career Planning.</TT></P>


         <BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>  "Work is love made visible" <BR>
                             From <U>The Prophet</U>, by: Kahlil
Gibran</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>


<P>     And so to work . . . to work with love . . . is the path we know, at some level of our being,
we must take.  It is on this path that we will find and embrace our mission in life.  </P>
<P>     In Part One of this series we discussed the concept of "mission".  Do we all have missions .
. . undiscovered, untapped, waiting to be revealed?  And if we do, how do we go about  
discovering what our mission is?  </P>
<P>     Before it's possible to focus on finding our mission in life, we need to take care of our
survival needs first (food, clothing, shelter, safety needs, and self esteem needs).  It's only after
we've taken care of these basic needs that we are in a position to, as the noted psychologist
Abraham Maslow stated, "self actualize", or fully become who we were intended to be.</P>
<P>     A triangle demonstrates the elements needed to uncover our mission.  The sides of the
triangle are "meaningfulness" and "making a contribution".  For us to be on the right path in life
we must have the sense that our lives are meaningful and that we're a making contribution. 
Finally, there's the base of the triangle.  The part that ties it all together.  Utilizing our unique gifts
and abilities is the element that ties it all together.</P> 
<P>      In part two of this series we talked about the need to first recognize an inner hunger, a
feeling of incompleteness, a desire to know more about ourselves, our temperament, our talents
and natural skills.  Once that need is recognized, we then begin our search.  A number of
resources are available in the quest to identify our unique skills and abilities.  The community
colleges are invaluable resources for career testing and career counseling.  The book <U>What
Color Is Your Parachute?</U> and its companion book <U>How To Create A Picture Of Your
Ideal Job Or Next Career</U> by Richard Nelson Bolles is highly recommended.   Additionally,
there is always room to include sources outside the conventional path . . . astrologers, psychics, tea
leaf readers . . . if it works for you, then by all means.</P>
<P>     We ended part two in this series with an assumption.  We assumed that you'd done your
reading, taken tests, talked to a career counselor, dusted off some old dreams, uncovered some
new ones and perhaps had glimpses of your mission in life.  What now?</P>
<P>
<B><H4>THE NUTS AND BOLTS . . . PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</H4></B>
     <B><I>PRIORITIZE, PRIORITIZE, PRIORITIZE.</I></B>  The information you will
accumulate during your reading, career testing and  counseling will at times seem overwhelming. 
Defining your skills, values, self management skills, philosophy, salary needs, temperament etc.,
will have little meaning unless you can put them in some sort of order of importance.  Is a high
salary more important then using your favorite skills?  How significant is it to work on your own or
do you need to be a part of a team?  Do you enjoy working indoors or outdoors, or a combination
of the two?</P>

     <H4><B><I>SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND . . .</H4></I></B>
<P>     Once you've clearly defined and prioritized what you're looking for, it's now time to go out
and talk to people who are using the skills that you think you might want to use.  Notice that I said
"talk".  This is not an interview, in the traditional sense, but rather an opportunity for you to take a
look, ask some questions, get a "sense of", and see if this is right for you.  This form of
investigation is known as "informational interviewing."  It can be both intimidating and exciting. 
After all, you're going out in the world to places where you think it might be fascinating to work,
and talking to people who might be doing something you'd love to do, that's the exciting side.  The
intimidating side is, of course, interacting with people.  You might be surprised here, people who
love what they're doing usually love talking about their passion.  So, with a little practice, even the
shyest of people should find this activity to be quite rewarding.  To further illustrate this concept of
informational interviewing, let's say you're currently employed, and the job is so-so.  You can
make it work, but you know you're capable of much more.  And you had dreams as a child.  But
through the years the dreams were shelved and . . . you got on with your life.  But you can't seem
to shake that gnawing feeling that says you have more to give.  On day, you say to yourself, I want
my dreams back.  Along with the career testing, the counseling, the self reflection, it now becomes
apparent that it's time to talk to those people who are doing the things you've always wanted to do. 
You start networking, using the phone, or just dropping by those places that have always
fascinated you.  You find a person who's in that challenging position.  You ask for twenty minutes
of their time, and ask questions like "How did you get into this business?"  "What do you like
best?", "What do you like least?"  "Do you know anyone else I can talk to that shares your
enthusiasm for this kind of work?"  A thank you note, and it's on to the next person.  </P>
<P>     Eventually, you begin focusing.  Focusing on job titles.  Focusing on possibilities.  Self
employment? Maybe.  Big organizations?  Maybe.  Helping people?  Maybe.  Painting, writing,
inventing?  Maybe, maybe, maybe.  It's all up to you. There is only one you on this planet.  You
are as unique as your fingerprint.  And you have a mission in life.  It can be said that your first
mission is to find what you love doing.  Once you identify what you'd love to do, you may begin to
notice that words like  "meaningfulness", and "making a contribution" will take on new meaning
and perhaps fall into place.  And of course you'll be putting your unique brand on what you do,
using your unique skills and abilities.  </P>

<P>     It's doing what you love doing that will put you on the path to finding your ultimate mission
in life.  </P>
<P>     There may come a day when you say a resounding "YES", this is my mission.  Or . . . your
life may be, like it is for many of us, a process of always approaching that mission, of continually
moving in that direction, of growing and refining.  A process.  And during that process you will
have the joys and sorrows of self discovery and uncertainty.  But you'll also have those days when
you can say with certainty "I'm using my gifts, my life is meaningful, and I know that I'm making a
contribution".</P>
<B><I><P>Meaningful . . . making a contribution . . .  using your unique skills and abilities . . . 
and your work will be . . ."love made visible"  You will be on the road to finding your mission in
life.</I></B></P>

<TITLE>THE CELESTIAL BAR BOOK REVIEW</TITLE>

<H3>THE CELESTIAL BAR</H3><BR>
A Spiritual Journey<BR>
by Tom Youngholm<BR>
Delacorte Press<BR>
ISBN: 0-385-31548-1<BR>
BOOK REVIEW by <B>ROBERT ROSS<BR>

    <P> "Throughout most of my life, during the challenging and even the happier times, I felt that something was missing.  I didn't know what it was, just that I didn't have it" says Tom Youngholm the author of <U>The Celestial Bar</U>.</P>
    <P> A few years ago, Tom Youngholm was meditating.  In his words, "it was a very deep meditation".  He felt a hand gently rocking him and he made contact with what he calls his spirit guides.  "For thirty minutes I went somewhere, and when I came out of that meditation I knew things I hadn't known before.  I could explain reincarnation, spirit guides and angels".   With a little prodding from his "guides",  <U>The Celestial Bar</U> was written.</P>
   <P> In the book, Mr. Youngholm's alter ego, Johnathan "Digger" Taylor is a forty something would be composer whose life has been a series of failures and broken relationships.  He's stalked by a ongoing nightmare that affects his dreaming and waking state.   Digger is searching for something that will not only lessen the sense of foreboding that he has in life but will also bring him a realization of balance and completeness.  He finally gets the break in life that he's been looking for, an opportunity to compose a music score for a major motion picture.  He's invited to an audition, arriving early and exhausted, he takes a nap in the studio's dressing room.  Soon, in his dreams Digger Taylor is again being pursued by the foreboding force which has been stalking him for years.  In his attempt to escape the force he enters a fictional bar (as in drinking establishment) called the Celestial Bar.  In this cosmic tavern, "Digger" meets some very unusual people; Ahmay, a Shoshone medium who acts as his spiritual guide, Paula, who he recognizes as the love of his life and soulmate, and Ramda, an interactive computer who adds new meaning to term "virtual reality".  All of these characters  assist him in putting his life back on track and discovering PEIS - physical, emotional intellectual and spiritual balance.  Five minutes before Digger's audition is to begin, he's awakened by the stage manager.   Of course, he's not the same person who went to sleep an hour earlier.  Digger auditions of course, and . . . well, it's worth reading the book just to read about the experience of the audition.</P>
<P>     <U>The Celestial Bar</U> is in many ways similar to <U>The Celestine Prophecy</U> in that it mixes storytelling with truth in a way that entertains, yet has us thinking.  The book is an enjoyable read, and reminds us of that search for balance that needs our constant attention.</P>

<I>Published by Delacorte Press, this book is available at your local bookstore</I>

ALTERNATIVES IN HEALING<BR>
The American Metabolic Institute<BR>
by Robert Ross<BR>     



<H4><I>DR. RUBIO</H4></I>

<P>     "Cancer is getting more aggressive these days" says Dr.
Rubio, Medical Director of the American Metabolic Institute, in
Tijuana, Mexico.  He continues on, drawing an analogy of the
evolution of the almost indestructible fly.  "You used to be able
to kill them with DDT, but not any more, now they've evolved, it
doesn't even affect them."</P>
<P>     As with the evolution of the fly, the last decade has
brought on a host of new resistant virus and bacteria which have
made the fight against cancer all more challenging.  And when it
comes to treating cancer, the battle lines have been drawn
between conventional medicine and alternative medicine.  </P>
<P>     With conventional cancer treatments one relies on
statistics.  An individual has a level two cancer, is given a
treatment, and the likelihood of recovery is given to you as a
percentage.  End of discussion.  In general, the treatments rely
on radiation, chemotherapy or surgery. </P>
<P>     However, with everything in life, there are alternatives. 
Dr. Norman Cousins was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis,
which meant that his spine was disintegrating.  He tried
conventional medicine where he was told that his chances for
recovery were almost nonexistent.  Eventually he opted for an
alternative.  His alternative involved locking himself in a hotel
room and watching comedies for three days, and, as the story
goes, through positive emotions he was eventually able to
mobilize his body's own natural healing resources.  He spent the
next twenty years of his life writing and talking about
alternatives.</P>

<H4><I>ALTERNATIVES</I></H4> 
<P>    The American Metabolic Institute in Tijuana, Mexico is one
such place that offers a unique blend of alternative health care
combined with conventional treatments.  Located in a suburb of
Tijuana called La Mesa, the well maintained two story structure
has the facilities and space to treat twelve patients.</P>
<P>     The day I arrived for a tour of the facility I saw a
large Winnebago type van parked in front.  A couple from Texas
had recently arrived.  The husband was living in the van while
his wife was beginning a six week cancer treatment program.  I
talked with him briefly,  "In Texas my wife tried the
conventional methods.  It really wasn't working, they were
destroying her immune system with chemotherapy, and it was
causing complications in other parts of her body.  She had a
level three B cancer, which meant that there was a twenty percent
possibility that she'd survive for two years".  This seemed to be
a common theme among those at the Institute.  They had tried the
conventional route and it didn't work.</P>

<H4><I>CHOICES</H4></I>
   <P>  You're given a twenty percent chance of living for two
years.  What do you do?  Conventional medicine says, "we did what
we could, sorry".  Luckily when someone told the same thing to
Dr. Cousins, he didn't listen.  So, you ask around.  Check the
health publications, make some calls, and begin to hear stories
of recoveries, some miraculous.  People that had been written off
by conventional medicine were now living healthy normal lives.
</P>
    <P> During my brief visit to the American Metabolic Institute
I heard such stories.  There was the six year old that had been
diagnosed with leukemia.  He was told that there was nothing that
could be done.  Yet, he recently completed his treatment at the
Metabolic Institute, cancer in remission.  There was the man 
with prostate cancer, his PSA reading was 484 when he began Dr.
Rubio's treatment.  He now maintains a  PSA of below 1.  The
stories go on.</P>

<H4><I>METHODS</H4></I>
   <P>  To assist patients with their health challenges the
American Metabolic Institute, in conjunction with Saint Joseph
Hospital, offers just about every known holistic approach,
coupled with conventional methods when needed.  Some of the
holistic approaches include Chelation therapy, Lymphatic
congestion therapy, Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Massage, Oxygen
therapies, Immuno therapy, Colon therapy, Rife frequency
generator technology, Cranial electrostimulation, Reflexology,
Colonics, Colemas and Enemas, Mineral and Herbal baths, Shark
cartilage treatments, Sauna, Clay, Private and Group therapy,
Nutritional counseling, Writing programs, and Positive thought
therapy.  Dr. Rubio is keenly aware that patients respond
differently to treatments,  so he monitors them closely.  If 
finds that something doesn't appear to be working, he tries
something else.  </P>
 
<H4><I>THE DRIVE HOME</H4></I>
   <P>  With my interview and tour complete, I faced the usual
border wait and freeway traffic on the drive home.  This was fine
because it gave me the opportunity to reflect on my experience. 
Having recently gone to my local HMO for a physical myself, I was
keenly aware of the direction conventional medicine was heading. 
At my HMO I waited in lobbies, stood in lines, went to door A, B
and C. I watched videos in which I was told that taking vitamin C
was too arduous, and instead, if I had a cold I would be better
off with one of their recommended drugs.  I was herded through, I
was a number, "next, next, next" was the mantra.</P>
<P>     The American Metabolic Institute offers an alternative,
an alternative worth checking into.     </P>

<TITLE>THE AWARENESS CENTER FOR THE HEALING ARTS </TITLE>
<H3>THE AWARENESS CENTER FOR THE HEALING ARTS</H3><BR>
2180 GARNET, #1-I<BR>
SAN DIEGO CA., 92109<BR>
272-2008<BR>

   <P>  About ten years ago, Stephen Cimmarrusti offered to exchange some landscaping services for a therapeutic massage.  So, he did some landscaping, and in return, his life changed.  From that moment on he was hooked.  According to Mr. Cimmarrusti "there was something about massage that intrigued me, everywhere I went after that I was drawn to information about healing and bodywork".</P>
<P>     Today, Mr. Cimmarrusti is the owner/director of The Awareness Center for Healing Arts, in San Diego.  And just what goes on at this center?  A lot!  For starters how about Panchakarma therapies, Accupunture, Chiropractics, massage, meditation classes, ear candling, yoga classes, Shiatsu, Resonance Balancing and weekly seminars. <P>
<P>     Mr. Cimmarrusti was trained at The Center For Mind Body Medicine, where he specialized in Panchakarma therapies.  Panchakarma therapies fall under the umbrella of Ayurvedic healing practices which have been used in India for the past five thousand years.  Panchakarma therapy was originally offered only to the royalty of India, and I was soon to find out why.</P>
<P>     It's difficult to grasp what Ayurvedic and Panchakarma therapies are all about without experiencing them (somebody's got to do it . . .), so I had a sampling  which included Abhyanga massage and the Shirodhara.  Abhyanga massage is a brisk oil friction massage, working herbalized sesame oil through the pores of the skin, deep into the channels of elimination.  Two therapist worked on me for approximately one half hour.  This was followed by a hot towel treatment, further opening the pores of the skin and driving the oil even deeper into the system.  Next, I was given the Shirodhara treatment, which was a steady stream of warmed sesame oil flowing over the forehead to access the hypothalamus that directs the automatic responses of the body.  This treatment appeared to last about forty five minutes, but I have to admit, at that point I was so relaxed that time became irrelevant.   </P>

<P>     After my session, I returned to Mr. Cimmarrusti's office (in a much more relaxed state) to ask him  about his thoughts on healing .  "What we're essentially doing here  is trying to bring the body to a point where it can begin to heal itself".   Mr. Cimmarrusti went on to discuss the various healing practices, both eastern and western that are available through the center.</P>
    <P> On my drive home, I thought about all that I had experienced.  We all know at some level, that the body is capable of healing many of the maladies that afflict us in modern society, but many of us in the nineties prefer the quick fix (just give me a pill doc, I'm in a hurry!). Perhaps centers like The Awareness Center For Healing Arts will move us a step closer to experiencing our our bodies, once again, as willing participants in the healing process.</P>

<P>
<P>     Gene Egidio is a healer.  He deals in that area
of life that can only be described as magical.  He
touches people and their lives change.  And he has the
credentials to prove it.  His credentials are all over
the walls of his comfortable Encinitas office . .  .
photos.  He has photos of children, photos of old
people, photos of families, of couples, of those that
were once sick and are now healed.   Hundreds of
photos.</P>  
    <P> It's hard to understand what it must feel like
to have a doctor say to you, "we've done the best we
can, that's all modern medicine has to offer.  There's
no hope that things will get better".   Perhaps those
very words drive people to seek out hope, to seek out
alternatives, to seek out healers.  </P>
<P>     The day I arrived at Mr. Edigio's office for an
interview and "healing" experience, the lobby was
filled with such people.  People who had heard through
friends, the grapevine or the media, that Gene Egidio
heals.  The lobby itself, painted in soft pastels, is
in stark contrast to the harshness of the outside
world, where cars and concrete rule.  Once inside, the
fragrance of incense wafts through the air, while
relaxing music is heard in the background.  </P>
<P>      After registering and a few moments of
"centering,"  I and the rest of the people in the lobby
were escorted off to various alcoves in adjoining rooms
where soft lighting and individual cots were awaiting. 
This was to be a healing of eight or ten of us, each in
our own area of the building, each with our own
requests of Mr. Edigio.</P>
<P>     Soon Mr. Edigio entered my area and sat next to
the bed, his greeting was reassuring,  "How are you my
friend, anything bothering you? . . . physical . . .
emotional . . . spiritual?"   I explained I had the
usual aches and pains, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
I did mention that I was angry with someone over a
specific matter.  He began the healing process by
placing his hands above my body, raised two inches or
so, in the forehead and belly area.  It was explained
to me earlier that the energy from Gene's hands enters
the client's body and moves to areas of disease and
discomfort.  A person could come in with a request to
heal a sore elbow and end up being healed in other
areas of the body also.  Gene spent about five minutes
or so and then he was off to another room and another
client.  I was in a comfortable environment, just
laying there, listening to the soft music.  After about
twenty minutes, Mr. Edigio was back.  Again, hands
above the body, this time I could feel a great deal of
warmth emanating from his palms.  As soon as he
arrived, he was gone again to another room.  The third
time back, I was aware of his labored breathing. 
Whatever he was doing, it sounded like he was working
hard, and then he was off again.  The 
next and last time he came in, he sat down and we
talked.  He had remembered my comments about being
angry and gave me a suggestion for dealing with it.  I
also received an "energized" crystal from him.</P>
<P>     Later, as I waited in the lobby to talk with
him further, I chatted with a mother who had brought
her son in to be healed.  He was suffering from asthma. 
She told me about her sister's friend whose breast
cancer was so severe that her doctors had said that
there was nothing they could do.  The sister's friend
had seen Mr. Edigio on a T.V. show and made an
appointment.  After being healed, the cancer has
completely disappeared and as a result, the lady I was
talking with said "I used to be a skeptic, not
anymore!"</P>
<P>    Mr. Edigio came out to the lobby and we talked a
bit more.  He called his abilities a "gift" and said he
first noticed them when he was around five years old. 
A friend of his had cut his thumb severely with a
knife, Gene responded by wrapping his hand around the
cut.  By doing so, the cut had essentially dissipated
to the point of insignificance.</P>
<P>    Although I had no real "diseases" to speak of at
the time of my visit, no way of testing Mr. Edigio's
healing powers, I did read dozens of testimonials,
including ones from Elisabeth Kubler Ross and Margaux
Hemingway praising Mr. Edigio's work.  I also saw an
office filled with people who had an unmistakable look
of excitement and hope in their eyes.</P>
<P>    Science will never be able to adequately answer
the questions about spontaneous remissions, about
healing, about those events that are described as
"miracles."  But as long as there are people, there
will be those with special gifts, those that are called
healers, those that do the impossible.  There are many
that think that Gene Edigio is one of those special
people.</P>
<P>     If you'd like more information, call the
Breakthru Institute of Awareness at  619-436-0220 for
both the Encinitas and Santa Monica offices.</P>

<TITLE>INTERVIEW WITH TOM YOUNGHOLM</TITLE>










<H3>AN INTERVIEW WITH:</H3><BR>

<H3>TOM YOUNGHOLM</H3> <BR>
AUTHOR OF<BR>
 <U>"THE CELESTIAL BAR"</U>, A Spiritual Journey<BR>
Interview conducted by <B>ROBERT ROSS</B><BR>

<P></P>
<B><I>DREAMS DO COME TRUE</B></I><BR>
    <P> So you're sitting there feeling like something is missing in life, (gosh, that's unusual) and you
do a meditation exercise to get a bit more relaxed, more centered.  Only this time, the mediation
session goes, well, a little deeper, and suddenly there's a hand on your shoulder rocking you from side
to side, and you feel a presence, yet, you're the only one in the room.  </P>
   <P>  Whatever happened during that meditation session, Tom Youngholm author of <U>"The
Celestial Bar"</U>, will never be the same.  A few years later this first time author is involved in
another startling experience, it's called a bidding war.  A dozen New York publishing houses are
bidding on his first novel, "<U>The Celestial Bar"</U>.  The bid is rumored to be at $400,000.  Add
that to the twenty or so foreign countries that have snatched up the rights, and the talk of a movie and
you have . . . I believe it's 
called . . . a dream come true.</P>
<P>    In the book, (<U>The Celestial Bar</U>) Mr. Youngholm's alter ego, Jonathan "Digger"
Taylor is a forty something would be composer whose life has been a series of failures and broken
relationships.  He's stalked by a ongoing nightmare that affects his dreaming and waking state.  
Digger is searching for something that will not only lessen the sense of foreboding that he has in life
but will also bring him a realization of balance and fulfillment.  He finally gets the break in life that
he's been looking for, an opportunity to compose a music score for a major motion picture.  He's
invited to a piano audition, arriving early and exhausted, he takes a nap in the studio's dressing room. 
Soon, in his dreams Digger Taylor is again being pursued by the foreboding force which has been
stalking him for years.  In his attempt to escape the force he enters a fictional bar (as in drinking
establishment) called the Celestial Bar.  In this cosmic tavern, "Digger" meets some very unusual
people; Ahmay, a Shoshone medium who acts as his spiritual guide, Paula, who he recognizes as the
love of his life and soulmate, and Ramda, an interactive computer who adds new meaning to term
"virtual reality".  All of these characters  assist him in putting his life back on track and discovering
PEIS - physical, emotional intellectual and spiritual balance.  Five minutes before Digger's audition is
to begin, he's awakened by the stage manager.   Of course, he's not the same person who went to sleep
an hour earlier.  Digger auditions of course, and . . . well, it's worth reading the book just to read about
the experience of the audition.</P>
<P><B>The following interview took place at the home of Tom Youngholm:</B></P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B>  How about a brief background of Tom Youngholm<BR></P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> I've always felt that something was missing in life.  I grew up in
Chicago, worked for the Sheriff's office, Youth Services department as a family therapist but didn't
find my life meaningful.  I got burnt out.  I was in a relationship and got a divorce.  That wasn't it
either.  One weekend in Chicago I was nearly killed twice, and decided it was time to leave.  The
following Monday I turned in my resignation.  I moved to Florida and opened a floating restaurant. 
The restaurant was for a time, successful, but eventually sank during a storm.  That wasn't it either. 
The feeling that something was missing in my life was still there.  I had always wanted to move to San
Diego, so I eventually worked my way across the country, ending in San Diego where I was employed
as a waiter and a training consultant for a large corporation.  At that point I was  feeling stressed out
and started researching stress management.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> What kind of books and techniques did you follow?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> Yoga, meditation, relaxation techniques, and  breathing exercises.  My
friends from back east thought I was turning into a <I><B>real Californian.</B></I>  One day
during a meditation exercise I went very deep inside.  I started feeling a hand gently rocking me from
side to side and felt a presence.  I remember coming out of it a half hour later and screaming the word
"No!".</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> Was there a special meditation you were doing?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> I was focusing on my breathing in the area of my heart.  During the
meditation, I went somewhere, I have no idea where I went, but when I came out of the meditation I
knew  things that I hadn't known before.  I could explain reincarnation, spirit guides and angels.  The
book, <U>The Celestial Bar</U>, is a fictional account of where I went.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> Did you actually go some place or did you just uncover what was already
within?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> I believe we all have access to this information, we all know the
answers, we all have a "celestial bar" within.  The book is a reminder of that place. </P>     
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> What motivated you to write <U>The Celestial Bar</U>?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> There were several factors.  The guides that I made contact with
during the meditation, eventually encouraged me to write the book.  I don't like to write, in fact the
thought of writing is painful.  I started teaching the principles of what I had learned during this
meditation, but that gnawing feeling was still there that I had to put this information in a book.  The
story was building within me.  I had to give birth to it.  I started writing the book in December of
1993.  I gave myself one year.  In October of 1994 it came off the press.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B>  Why should someone read <U>The Celestial Bar?</U></P>
<B><P>Mr. Youngholm:</B>  I believe there are more and more people opening up to spirituality. 
This book provides a different perspective.  It's fun when the information is presented as a story.  It's
both left brain and right brain.  We need to get this information in many different formats.  It's a piece
of the puzzle.  Eventually when you get enough pieces of the puzzle you have what psychologist call
the "ahah" experience.  "Ahah", now I get it.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> What's the message of the book?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> There's a place within that we can go, a "celestial bar" to find answers,
and to find balance in the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual areas of our lives.</P>
<B><P>Interviewer:</B> The book implies that you, and all of us have spirit guides.  Do we?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B>  Yes, definitely.  We all have at least two.</P>
<B><P>Interviewer:</B> How do we access them?</P>
<B><P>Mr. Youngholm:</B> You have to be quiet, you have to trust that they are there.  You have
to pay attention to how they respond.  Usually they respond very quietly, very subtly.  You have to
trust that they're going to talk to you.  It might be in a feeling, rather then visually or in words.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> That sounds like we can interpret anything as a spirit guide.  Is there
anyway that we can know for sure that we've contacted a spirit guide?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B>  There's no logical way that we can know.  Skeptics look for logic, and
believe me, I was a skeptic.  There's many different ways we know things, intuitively, or divine
knowing.  Can we prove love logically?  There's no way we can prove love logically, and yet it is the
most important thing in life.</P>
<B><P>Interviewer:</B> Are guides a metaphor for knowledge that we have within or are they
separate entities?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm: </B> Here again, we have a paradox.  Both.  Ultimately we are all one, and
our guides are a reflection of who we are, and yet we can also see them as separate entities.  We chose
our guides to learn.  We're all looking for balance.  Our guides are with us to help us learn to find this
balance.</P>
<B><P>Interviewer:</B>  In general, what are your guides saying to you now in your life</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B>  Forgive, love, trust, let go, follow your heart.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> Do you actually hear these words?</P>
<P><B>Mr. Youngholm:</B> Sometimes in words, sometimes in intuition, or an emotion that comes
in and out rapidly.</P>
<P><B>Interviewer:</B> I guess the area of "spirit guides" is always going to be somewhat of
mystery, unless one has an actual experience to make it real.</P>
<B><P>Mr. Youngholm:</B> Yes, this is true.  It was for me.  I was a complete skeptic.  I didn't
believe in any of this metaphysical stuff, until I had that experience.  </P>

<B><I>Follow your heart, seek balance . . .</B></I><BR>
<P><B>Interviewer: </B>The interview winds down, and we chat.  As I'm driving home, thoughts of
the Wizard of Oz float through my mind. Did Dorothy find her Celestial Bar?  Follow your heart and
seek balance, follow your heart and seek balance, click your heels three times,  I want to go home, I
want to go home.  
Dorothy . . ., what were you trying to tell us? </P>

<CENTER>     <B><I>    George Sheehan, M.D.</I></B></CENTER>


<P>     Mantras, prayers, another reality - these are terms reminiscent of the 60's and one generation's attempt to seek and connect with higher states of consciousness.</P>
<P>     I've always been jealous of those that can conform to churches, to organizations and to corporations.  These institutions all have their levels of achievement, with mentors, guides and rules.  I'll admit that life with all of its uncertainties, needs structure.  But for those of us who are seekers, these institutions often are like a drug, waiting to seize our adventurous spirit.  Waiting on the sidelines, waiting for us to yell out loud, I give up, show me your Bible, your company, your structure, your church, I'm ready.    </P>
<P>   It's an irony that those very institutions that seekers avoid, have much to teach about other realities.  The Native American church openly seeks altered states with the use of peyote, eastern religions use mantras to alter their consciousness, and western religions use prayer to connect with higher levels of spirituality.</P>
<P>     Terms like altered states, mantras, other realities remind us of that thin line that divides what we commonly refer to as reality, and those "other experiences".</P>
<P>      The trails leading out of the White Wolf campground in Yosemite National Park are typical of the trails that crisscross the Toulumne meadows at the upper elevations of the park. In the spring or fall months, given the high altitude and lack of easy accessibility, one can find a degree of solitude that can't be found in Yosemite Valley. It's possible to jog for miles without running across another person. And, if one is fortunate, it is also possible to, as the fitness guru George Sheehan describes, to enter "another realty" .</P>
<P>We arrived at White Wolf campground around noon and after setting up camp, it was time to go for a run.  The early afternoon sun was soon to be hidden behind some of the magnificent granite peaks that surround the meadows.  Jogging off on a well maintained trail, off into a forest, green with majestic pine trees, it was easy to lose a sense of time, and as it turned out, it was easy to cross the boundaries between the everyday world to which I was accustomed and the not so everyday world of the forest.</P>
<P>   All my life I've wanted to be more.  As a child growing up in the 1950's I wanted more knowledge of how the world works.  In the 60's and 70's I wanted more freedom to explore who I was, to let go, to examine different beliefs and different cultures.  And in the 80's and 90's I've wanted to be  more physically fit, full of energy, able to work and play without taking notice.  Underlying my enthusiasm for fitness was an awareness that somewhere, somehow through fitness I would connect with a much deeper part of myself.  In fitness there were answers to some of life's questions.  With the right combination of exercises, enough sweat, the right frame of mind, the answers to some of these mysteries would be laid forth . . . perhaps on a long run, alone in a forest, in a meditative state, I would hear answers whispered from the trees, from the mountains, and from the streams. </P>
<P>	I've been involved in fitness since 1974. The late sixties and early seventies had taken their toll on my body, and by chance, in the mid 1970's a friend had asked me if I wanted to play racquetball.  Three days later my muscles still ached, but my spirit had been awakened.  Movement, sweat, strain, I had found what I needed, and at a much deeper level, what I was looking for.  To feel alive, fully.  To feel connected, mind and body, and to have a path for a deeper awareness of self.  Racquetball led to jogging, jogging to marathons, marathons to triathlons.  Always, there was a sense that I was moving closer to hearing the whisper, somewhere in a forest alone on a wooded trail.</P>
<P>	As I began my run out of White Wolf campground, I was aware of the usual warm up aches and pains. Start slow and wait for the first sweat to crack, wait for my body to feel that fluidity that normally comes in twenty five or thirty minutes of running.  Wait for my body to first accept, then embrace the run.  The minutes glided by and soon without noticing, I was running with the ease of a deer.  I felt the boundless energy that comes when all body parts are operating in sync.  Minutes slid by, I recall only being aware of how light and full of energy I felt.  I was a part of the forest now, in rhythm with the trees, the squirrels and the deers.  We were all content doing what we were doing.  Occasionally I would cross a chipmunk, or a blue jay, they didn't seem overly startled, and if I stretched my imagination a bit, I'm sure they were thinking to themselves "oh, it's only runner".       On nature runs I have a tendency to daydream, to let go, to enjoy my thoughts to the fullest, after all, there are no cars to worry about, no signals to stop for.  I remember at one point feeling giddy, the next instant I felt a surge of energy.  I accelerated, feeling a sense of power that defies description.  All was well.  As I glanced at my watch, I realized that it was time to turn around. I had gone further then I had planned, but wasn't concerned. I was excited about how the run was going, and had visions of describing it to my wife who was back at the campground. </P>
<P>	The sun had just dropped behind the crest of one of the granite peaks that surround the upper meadows, and with that, the temperature  dropped a few degrees.  With forty minutes to go I decided to accelerate slightly.  I was running the same trail, but now with a slight chill in the air.  I had a sense of mission, returning to the campground before the temperature dropped to an uncomfortable level.  I continued what was, up until that point, the perfect run.  </P>
<P>	I'm not sure when I became aware of a something moving behind me, just out of sight, over my right shoulder.  I do recall that one moment I was running with speed and grace, the next moment my body was covered with goose bumps.  At first I shrugged it off, attributing it to the sounds that are ever pervasive in the forest.  The goose bumps that now covered my body were a sign of the dropping temperature, and not an indication that I had sensed something unusual.  I continued running not wanting to be distracted.  If I focused my attention over my right shoulder, or took a quick glance there was nothing.  Yet, if I just ran not taking notice, I couldn't help being aware that something or someone was moving closer, now perhaps twenty to thirty feet to the right and behind me.  I could hear, or better yet feel something moving and breathing, almost as if there were an echo of my own running sounds.  Again, I took a fast glance to the right, nothing, then back to the business of running.  </P>
<P>     There has always been a side to me that was prone to the mystical, to eastern thought, to out of the ordinary events.    Articles on the Tarahumara Indians of Northern Mexico running up to two hundred miles in a trance like state held more interest for me then the typical "how to" articles that one normally finds in fitness journals. </P>
<P>	As I continued my run back to the campground, the pattern repeated itself, relax, run, don't focus my attention, and the object would come closer.  Focus my attention, stop, or turn my head abruptly, and it was gone.  Within minutes I had the method down, and had determined that I was going to allow whatever it was to come as close as possible.  This took an enormous amount of self control, knowing that whatever it was that initially startled me had the potential to frighten the daylights out of me.	</P>
<P>	I have no way of knowing how much time I spent running with "it". I do know that most of the thirty five minutes that it took to get back to the campground, I spent in what could only be described as an altered state. I had absolutely no sense of time, or sense that I was running. I do recall hearing or feeling a voice, and I do recall feeling lighter then I have ever felt before, as though I was gliding along the winding trail.   The run had a dreamlike quality to it, and yet I was fully awake. </P>
<P>	As I entered the campground my wife had asked me the usual question "How was the run?" I mumbled "good", and went off to the bathroom to clean up. </P>
<P>	That night I lay in the sleeping bag asking myself  what happened?, What was that?  And for the following few days it was difficult to concentrate, I felt very light headed.  I had the impression that I was dreaming, and yet I was awake.</P>
<P>	Over the past year bits and pieces of the incident have surfaced to conscious thought, but the overall event is still somewhat of a mystery to me.  As best as I can recall, the thirty minutes I spent running in a dreamlike state, was a meeting of sorts, an introduction, and exchange of thoughts.  All done on a sensing or feeling level.  I don't recall talking out loud, and yet we had a conversation.   I don't recall the entity having a face, or body, yet he was there, running just inches behind me to my right. If I were to describe the entity I would have to say it  was almost as though my shadow had taken on a life of itself, and that I was running with it.  He seemed friendly and helpful, answering my questions as they came to me.  The voice can only be described as soft, a whisper of sorts, and male in nature.  I remember that although the sun had drifted behind the mountains there was sunlight everywhere.  The colors of the trees, the brush, and the sky were richer and deeper then I had ever seen before.  The sounds that I do recall hearing were that of my own breathing, very slow and with a noticeable inhale, then an exhale.  Even though the event had a dreamlike quality to it, it was as real as any waking state.</P>
<P>     I have, up until this point, not told a soul.  After all, if someone were to say "hey, I had a great run with a spirit", I think both you and I would be looking for the closest door.</P>
<P>	The fact remains though, that running, movement, and other forms of exercise have the potential to open up new channels of thought, and perception.  And as the devotees of eastern religion have known for centuries, rhythmic breathing is a form of meditation. </P>
<P>	Meditating, moving, rhythmic breathing, alone on a mountain trail and one has the ability to alter their consciousness and   cross through what Aldus Huxely describes as the "doors of perception".  I consider myself lucky, to perhaps, have opened one of those  "doors". </P>
<P>	As those that have taken a more traditional road in their  development have their priests, mentors, and C.E.O.'s, to talk with and resolve personal issues,  I too, now have a private place, where I can go, to work with my guide.  It's there in the forest, amongst the trees, along the river banks. </P>
<P>     I'm planning my next trip back to Yosemite.  And yes, to the same campground, to run the same trail, at the same time of day.  I have more questions, and hope, with the right combination of sweat, movement and rhythmic breathing to hear that whisper in the forest once again. </P>

<TITLE>SWIMMING, WATER AND MEANING</TITLE>







<CENTER><H3>  SWIMMING . . . WATER AND MEANING</CENTER></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>	"Water, thou haste no taste, no color, no odor; canst not be defined, art relished while ever mysterious.  Not necessary to life, but rather life itself, thou fillest us with a gratification that exceeds the delight of the senses"</B></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
                                                                                        <CENTER><B>Saint-Exupery</B></CENTER>

<P>	In a scene from the movie "Children of a Lesser God," William Hurt submerges himself in a swimming pool.  He wants to understand the world of his deaf girlfriend.  The camera is filming from beneath the surface of the water as viewers watch the actor drop into the darkness of the pool.  It appears to be night, yet a shaft of light from above illuminates him.  No orchestra plays, just silence.  From beneath the water we watch William Hurt as he slowly brings his hands up to his face.  He has a curious expression on his face.  Turning his hands . . . he feels the water . . . focusing not on sound but on a world without sound.  We watch as he slowly gazes in amazement at this new world.    The scene lasts for a few seconds but clearly something has been learned.</P>
<P>	In the scene, William Hurt experiences the world differently as his body  moves through a liquid environment.  His reality has been changed, and for a moment, he understands his girlfriend's world, where sound ceases.</P>
<P>	We spend the first nine months of our lives in water.  We live on a planet that is two thirds water. Our bodies are over ninety percent water, so it is only natural that the sight, the sound and the feel of water tugs gently at our inner selves,  and if we listen carefully, can offer glimpses of lessons to be learned. </P>
<P>	For those of us who spend time in the water (whether it be oceans or pools), the scene from the movie was a reminder of that special place, where senses are altered, and time slows to a trickle.</P>

<B>FREEWAYS</B><BR>
<P>	Freeways have a way of reminding us of how far we've  traveled down the evolutionary road.</P>
<P> 	Friday 4:30 p.m., it's hot, slightly smoggy. The week has been long.  There's tension in the air. It seems society has one goal in mind, to leave  work  as fast as possible.  After all, it's Friday, time to take off the suits, ties, restrictive clothes, time to relax.  As I enter the on ramp of the freeway, I begin to accelerate. Thirty-five miles per hour, I glance in the rear view mirror, forty, I flick on my blinker, a glance to the side mirror, forty-five, another quick glance, fifty, there's a car approaching in the slow lane of the freeway,  tension grips my body,  I speed up, I'm now on the freeway, cars are racing by me,  fifty-five, flip my blinker on again, another glance in the side mirror, another glance in the rear view mirror, sixty.  The process continues as I work my way over to a faster lane.</P>
<P>	 I can't help thinking about what our ancestors would say about freeways,  cars, and our "modern" way of life. But soon I will leave  the noise, the traffic, the frantic pace, and find refuge.</P>
<P>	Soon, very soon, I will connect with a link to the past, and will be moving, not encased in steel, but enveloped in a soft sensuous fluid called water.<P>

<B>WATER</B>
<P>There are few things in life that  can cleanse the soul of freeways, of meetings, of the everyday world as fast as water.  The pool I use is located at the beach.  It's a fairly large, indoor public pool, with about 30% devoted to lap lanes.  During the summer months when the ocean water is warm enough, I do my swimming in the ocean. But today, it's the pool. The procedure I follow is  predictable: shower, head for the pool with  goggles, swim cap, kick board, and pull-buoy (a device used to raise your legs  while  concentrating on upper body strokes). I enter the water slowly.  Time is required to adjust, to adapt, to become a part of the water. I begin my routine, twenty laps doing the breast stroke, twenty using the pull-buoy, twenty using the kickboard, and twenty doing the crawl stroke. By the end of my first twenty laps a rhythm has been established. The tensions of the day are leaving.  I'm  swimming free and fluid, gliding through what feels like a warm liquid oil.  My senses are heightened, muscles relaxed.  The transition has been made, from land dweller, to water dweller, from upright  to prone. For me, it is here that the swim begins. It is here that not only are the physical benefits taking hold, but something is happening at a deeper level.  Somewhere inside of me I know that I am becoming a more integrated, whole person.  I am swimming now for my spirit, and  soul in ways that can't be described.  My body and mind are  operating in harmony.</P>

<P>When I leave the pool today, the world will look different.  It'll appear to be a calmer and friendlier world. Swimming has that effect.  It always has, and always will.   </P>

<B>THE BODY</B>
<P> The first lap or two tell me how my day was.  If I'm shocked by the water temperature, it's usually a  sign I've had a tense day.  As I'm swimming I focus on the various muscles of my body. I've spent the day on and off my feet, and now, in the water,  my attention is drawn to this area.  There's a predictable rigidity in my ankles and the arches of my feet.  The laps and time in the water will turn these rigid muscles into relaxed muscles. </P>
<P>	The idea that water promotes  healing was a philosophy  embraced by the Egyptians and later ritualized by the Greeks and Romans.  So enamored were the Romans of bathing, that as they conquered Europe, they developed elaborated spas at sites known for their healing waters. Today, one can travel throughout Europe to places like Baden-Baden, Bath, Envian, and Wiesbaden knowing  that for centuries people have been drawn to these areas to "take the waters".</P>
<P>Swimming has been called the perfect sport. It exercises practically every muscle in the body. It is not a weight bearing activity. Naturally buoyed by the water, stress related injuries are reduced. Those who swim often have identifying characteristics: erect postures due to a strong musculature, a "V" shaped back again, due to the strengthening of the back and shoulder muscles, an overall trim and fit appearance, and a more relaxed walk resulting from the conditioning and relaxing effect of swimming.  Few sports can claim the overall benefits of swimming without the injuries that usually accompany many exercise programs.</P>


<B>THE MIND</B>
<P>	As I begin the laps, thoughts swirl through my mind, thoughts of the sleek beautiful woman swimming in the lane next to me, arms and legs moving in rhythm, thoughts about the people in my life, or a comment made by a fellow employee earlier in the day.  Thoughts, random flowing thoughts.   The swim continues, the thoughts slow to a trickle, and if there were any negative thoughts in the beginning of my swim, by midway they're usually gone.</P> 
<P> After twenty or so laps, the swim a becomes a mantra, a meditation, back and forth, back and forth, the water gurgling as I exhale, back and forth, back and forth.  Hypnotically, the bodies move, as though orchestrated by a conductor, back and forth, exhaling, inhaling, exhaling, inhaling. It is the rhythmic breathing, the forced exhaling that some attribute to the "high" one feels as a result of swimming.</P>
<P>Swimming (and pools of water) have a calming effect on the mind.  Architects and philosophers have known, since the earliest of civilizations, that water, spas and trickling fountains help to promote relaxation and reflection.  The Romans, as mentioned earlier,  developed the spa (thermea) to an art form, where the public gathered not only to bathe, but to socialize,  relax  and meditate, with separate areas for entertainment, food and massage.  Records indicate that ancient Rome itself had over 900 public baths and 13 Imperial baths. The Diocletian bathhouse covered some 32 acres, and could accommodate up to 6000 people.   </P>
<P>	Today not only is swimming used in physical therapy, but mental health experts are encouraging their clients to exercise regularly for the psychological benefits attributed to physical activity. Swimming is often the exercise of choice for those that are looking for an overall conditioning program.</P>


<B>THE AFTERGLOW</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>     "The voice of the sea speaks to the soul.  The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace"</BLOCKQUOTE></I></B>
                                                                         <CENTER> <B>   Kate Chopin</B></CENTER>

<P>From the pool, I walk back to my car, get a beach chair, and head to the water's edge. It's here, in the ocean, that scientists say life began on earth.  The idea is appealing. I've been in the water this past hour, I feel relaxed, the tensions of the day are gone. If my origins  are in the ocean, that's fine.  The idea is intriguing, a life in water. </P>
<P> As with my entry into the pool, it takes time to become part of the beach environment. Time to blend with  the rhythmic sound of the waves,  to connect with the lovers strolling on the beach, to join with the joggers, and the children playing in the surf. The swim has relaxed me, I have left the work world, the conferences, the freeways, I have left it all.  Within minutes now, the transition from swimmer to observer has been made.  I am here at the ocean, the sun is beginning to set, people seem content.  I try to reflect on my life, where it's been, where I'd like it to go, but I can't.  The swim has had a calming effect on my mind. The intellect has given way to a deeper place within.  Now I'm immersed in the rhythmic sound of the breaking waves  as they  hurl themselves toward the shore, only to roll back into the sea,  again, then again, then again, over and over.  I'm reminded of the repetition in the pool - the laps, back and forth, back and forth, over and over.  Since the beginning of time,  and long after I'm gone, these waves will try to reach  land, then roll back only to try again. </P>
<P>    I've traveled far today, through a world of people, and things and places, ending at the water's edge.   But near the close of the day it is time to seek solace, it is  time to rejuvenate, it is time to reflect. So I turn to swimming.  It is the water that gives the day immeasurable value.  Swimming offers the obvious health benefits from fitness to stress reduction, but there is so much more. There is that time after the swim is over,  that time when things, when people, when sights and sounds are richer.   That is the real value of swimming.  When William Hurt dropped into the water his realty had shifted and he looked  amazed.  This water, which fills the earth, this water that fills our bodies  holds many secrets and holds many answers.  Swimmers are closer to understanding this sense of awe and amazement. </P>
<P>  And now I have the good fortune to look out over the  water and reflect on the beauty of it all. The afterglow of the swim has made this beach, these waves, these sounds special. I have faced many challenges and frustrations during the day, yet now, after swimming, I am content.</P>
<P>The lessons to be learned from swimming depend on the individual, and one's willingness to view  water's mystery  with a certain wonder, to set aside some time to enjoy the aftereffects of swimming, and to give oneself permission to dream a little, and reflect a little.   </P>
<P> And if you find yourself at the beach one day and a swimmer is gazing out over the ocean, immersed in the sound of the crashing waves, you will know that this person has found that special place, and maybe, just maybe understands the writer Rachel Carson when she said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>"For all at last returns to the sea - to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever flowing stream of time, the beginning of the end"                                          </I></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>     Do you ever feel bored, stuck, trapped in an unchanging
regimen of mundane activities?  Do you long for something to
propel you into a new perspective on life, something fresh and
bright to rekindle that zest you've been missing?  Or perhaps
you're in the fast lane, too busy to smell the roses, looking for
an off  ramp.  The answer to your dilemma is close at hand, in
fact, it involves your hands . . .  your <I>Healing Hands.</I>
</P>
<P>     Started just a few short years ago, Healing Hands School
of Holistic Health currently has massage technician training
programs at Mira Costa Community College and Irvine Community
College, along with their ongoing training programs at their
Escondido and Laguna Hills locations.</P>
<P>    Gone are the days when massage meant only Swedish massage. 
Currently Healing Hands School offers a broad range of massage
and bodywork modalities including Swedish (or circulatory)
massage, Deep Tissue manipulation, Shiatsu, Reflexology and
Sports Massage.  Among the many specialized courses offered by
Healing Hands is Hypnotherapy  (a 150 hour Certification course),
Thai massage, Herbology, and Cranio-sacral therapy.   According
to Paula Curtiss, Co-Director of Healing Hands, "We also offer
several practicum classes where we work on specific areas of the
population.  For example, at the Drug and Alcohol recovery class,
students work at a local recovery facility where residents are in
the active stages of detoxification.  In the Enhancing the
Immunity class, students work with people who are HIV+ or have
AIDS.  And in the Cross Cultural Practicum, the students work at
a shelter for migrant farm workers. There is also a Geriatric
Practicum where students work with the elderly at convalescent
homes."</P>
<P>     Healing Hands School offers the most affordable 100 hour
massage training program in San Diego and Orange counties. 
Again, to quote Ms. Curtis, "We believe very strongly that
massage and bodywork should be accessible to everyone, that it
shouldn't be an exclusive experience for either the very wealthy
or those who believe in healing alternatives."</P>
<P>     Whether you're looking for a new zest in life or perhaps
a change in careers, Healing Hands School of Holistic Health just
might turn your hands into hands that <I>heal.</I> </P>

<H3>SHARK CARTILAGE</H3><BR>

<P></P>

SHARK CARTILAGE<BR> 
<P>
     Question?  What swims in the ocean, can strike terror in the
hearts of swimmers and bathers alike and also has been reported
to assist in the body's fight against diseases like cancer?  You
guessed it, sharks!  More specifically, shark cartilage.</P>
<P>     Touted by some, maligned by others, shark cartilage is
fast emerging as a remedy worth noting.  In 1992 Dr. William Lane
published a book entitled Sharks Don't Get Cancer,  subtitled
"How shark cartilage could save your life", in which his research
indicated that shark cartilage:
<UL><LI>  inhibits the formation of new blood vessels
(angiogenesis) that help to build                solid tumors   
<LI>  has an anti-mitotic (anti-growth) effect on tumors
themselves 
<LI>  is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, and found to be an
effective                             treatment for arthritis and
osteoarthritis
<LI>  improves wound/burn healing, because of a group of
compounds known as               mucopolysaccharides
    <LI> has been shown to be effective against
psoriasis</P>
</UL>
    <P>  Since the introduction of Dr. Lane's book and a
subsequent 60 minute T.V. segment on the subject, shark cartilage
has been, according to one health food store employee, "selling
out on a weekly basis".  </P>
<P>      Inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels has been
known for twenty years as an effective treatment for tumors, but
only a handful of alternative health practitioners are currently
using shark cartilage to treat patients with cancer.</P>
<P>     Dr. Rubio from the American Metabolic Institute has been
on the forefront of shark cartilage research, pioneering the use
of injectable shark cartilage.  Shark cartilage can also be taken
in capsule form, powder form and through retention enemas.</P>
<P>      For more information on the use of shark cartilage in
the treatment of cancer, please contact The American Metabolic
Institute at 1-800 388-1083, or visit AMI's <A

<H1>What is Minnesota Sea Grant?</H1>
</Center>
<HR>
The University of Minnesota Sea Grant College Program is a partnership between the University of Minnesota, federal government, industry, and the people of Minnesota. <p>

Minnesota Sea Grant is made up of researchers, extension educators, and communicators, who are discovering solutions to the problems of today and tomorrow, and helping the people of Minnesota make informed decisions about their communities and resources.<p>

Minnesota Sea Grant researchers pioneer work in new areas and train University students in the technologies needed to solve tomorrow's economic and resource problems.  Research funded by Minnesota Sea Grant must apply to real-world problems.  To do this Sea Grant funds an "outreach," program designed to bring the University's research expertise to the citizens of Minnesota and the nation. <p>

Minnesota Sea Grant, as a partner with the Minnesota Extension Service, works with trade groups, federal and state agencies, local governments, environmental groups, and individuals who need information about Lake Superior and Minnesota's other aquatic resources. Minnesota Sea Grant outreach staff hold conferences and workshops, produce publications and educational materials, and give advice to businesses, groups, and individuals to provide the Minnesota public with the best and most current information on our human and natural resources.  From this, Minnesota citizens can make the most informed decisions about our resource development and use.<p>

Minnesota is one of 29 states with a Sea Grant Program. Our Sea Grant Program competes for funding with these other programs, and we must match every two federal dollars we get with at least one state dollar. From these sources, Minnesota Sea Grant Program has built a budget of more than $1 million per year to help Minnesota, the Great Lakes Region and the United States face the challenge of creating healthy coastal regions that can be used and enjoyed for generations to come.<p>

<HR Size=5%>
<H3>FOCUS ON LAKE SUPERIOR</H3>
Minnesota Sea Grant is the only Sea Grant program in the nation which has Lake Superior as its sole focus. Lake Superior is one of America's most precious resources.  Minnesota Sea Grant promotes good stewardship and sustainable resource management of this one-of-a-kind resource.  Since its inception in 1974, Minnesota Sea Grant has been a leader in identifying and acting on many serious economic and environmental challenges facing Lake Superior.<p>

<H3>MINNESOTA SEA GRANT WORKS FOR YOU</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
Minnesota Sea Grant researchers are involved in assessing changes to Lake Superior's fish communities and providing insights into management strategies for maintaining our fisheries.  Minnesota Sea Grant has conducted workshops for charter boat captains to help them understand the Lake Superior ecosystem and enlist their help in maintaining the resources for themselves, their clients, and the people of Minnesota.<p>

<LI>
Minnesota Sea Grant researchers discovered that most of the dangerous contaminants in Lake Superior are not produced within the basin, but are carried there by air currents. These contaminants get into the Lake Superior food chain and are eventually taken up by fish.  We still need to make sure our Minnesota coastal industries are meeting environmental standards, but we must work to ensure national recognition and protection of Lake Superior's resources.  Through our extension educators we are continuing to provide information and expertise to other states about solutions to water quality problems.<p>

<LI>
Minnesota Sea Grant is a leader in dealing with exotic species. Lamprey still kill large numbers of lake trout in Lake Superior, and current control methods are expensive and inefficient. Minnesota Sea Grant researchers are developing new, non toxic methods of lamprey control. We had a monitoring program to watch for zebra mussels and an education program for the public and regional industries to help slow the spread of zebra mussels. After zebra mussels arrived, Sea Grant began operating the Exotic Species Information Center, providing up-to-date information on zebra mussels and other exotic species, along with educational materials on how to control them and reduce their spread.<p>

<LI>
An important part of a sustainable economic base in the Lake Superior basin is tourism.  Minnesota Sea Grant tourism experts work with local communities to develop an experience for the tourist that preserves the wild and scenic nature of this region that tourists expect to experience.<p>

<LI>
Sea Grant research in aquaculture and genetics is leading to better management of fish hatcheries to maintain and improve the region's fish species.  This also leads to improved growth of species in our developing aquaculture industry--in a region which still imports most of its food fish.  Sea Grant organizes and co-sponsors the annual Minnesota Aquaculture Conference which brings researchers, public agencies representatives, and fish farmers together each year to exchange information and build this vital new industry. <p>
</UL>

<H3>THE FUTURE</H3>
Minnesota Sea Grant will continue its unique blend of research, outreach and education on Lake Superior and Minnesota's other unique water resources.  Sea Grant research will focus on developing real solutions to the social and scientific challenges facing us now and in the future.  We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our human and natural resources for our children and future generations. <p>

	Among the most significant advancements in the field of aquaculture during recent decades is the development of techniques to induce reproduction in fish.  These techniques have allowed farmers to profitably breed and raise species that do not naturally reproduce in captivity, and to manipulate the timing of reproduction to suit production cycles.
<p>
	Some species will not readily breed in captivity due to environmental or culture conditions that are different from those found in nature, such as water temperature or substrate type.  These conditions may cause stress or may not provide the cues needed to complete the reproductive process.  
<p>
	Fish in captivity may not always reproduce at the most advantageous time, and alteration of the spawning cycle may be desirable.  This allows a farmer to: <p>
<OL>
<LI>obtain fish outside of the normal spawning season either to lengthen time for grow-out or to produce hybrids with other species; 

<LI>improve efficiency by getting fish to spawn on a predetermined date; and 

<LI>maximize survival by fertilizing and incubating eggs under hatchery conditions.   Where successful, techniques for altering the spawn
ing cycle of fish have become a valuable tool.
</OL>

<H3>Background:  Reproduction in Nature</H3>
	In fish, the reproductive process involves three basic steps:  <p>
<OL>
<LI>maturation - the development of the gametes (eggs and sperm) to a point where fertilization can occur; 

<LI>ovulation - the release of eggs from the ovary; and 

<LI>spawning - the deposition of eggs and sperm so that they can unite.
</OL>
	In fish, as with all higher animals, hormones play a critical role in the reproductive process.  Hormones are chemical messengers released into the blood by specific tissues, such as the pituitary gland.  The hormones travel through the bloodstream to other tissues, which respond in a variety of ways.  One response is to release another hormone, which elicits a response in yet another tissue.  The primary tissues involved in this hormonal cascade are the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads (Fig. 1).
<p>
	Fish have evolved to reproduce under environmental conditions that are favorable to the survival of the young.  Long before spawning, seasonal cues begin the process of
maturation.  In many fish, this can take up to a year.  When the gametes have matured, an environmental stimulus may signal the arrival of optimal conditions for the fry, triggering ovulation and spawning.  Examples of environmental stimuli are changes in photoperiod, temperature, rainfall, and food availability.  A variety of sensory receptors detect these cues, including the eye, pineal gland (an organ in the dorsal part of the forebrain that is sensitive to light), olfactory organs, taste buds, and thermoreceptors. 
<p>
	The hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain, is sensitive to signals from sensory receptors and releases hormones in response to environmental cues.  Principal among these hormones are gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRH), which travel from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.  The pituitary is responsible for a wide variety of functions, including growth and reproduction.  Certain cells of the pituitary receive GnRH and release gonadotropic hormones into the bloodstream.  The gonadotropic hormones travel to the gonads, which synthesize steroids responsible for final maturation of the gametes.
<p>
	Maturation of the egg is a long process that involves complex physiological and biochemical changes.  One important step, vitellogenesis, is a process in which
yolk proteins are produced in the liver, transported to the ovary, and stored in the egg, resulting in tremendous egg enlargement.  The yolk is important as a source of nutrition for the developing embryo.  
<p>
	Also critical are germinal vesicle migration and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD).  Before it migrates, the germinal vesicle, or nucleus, is located at the center of the egg in an arrested stage of development.  At this stage, the egg is physiologically and genetically incapable of being fertilized, even though it has the outward appearance of a fully mature egg.  When conditions are appropriate for final maturation, nuclear development resumes, and the germinal vesicle migrates to one side.  Finally, the walls of the germinal vesicle break down, releasing the chromosomes into the cell. 
<p>
	The maturity of eggs can be determined using biopsy techniques.  Eggs are removed from the ovaries, cleared with a prepared solution, and viewed under a microscope.  In mature eggs, the migration of the germinal vesicle to the side of the cell will be complete.
<p>
	After the egg has matured, a class of compounds called prostaglandins are synthesized.  These stimulate ovulation, which is the rupture of the follicle cells that hold the egg.  The egg is then released into the body cavity or ovarian lumen, where it may subsequently be released to the outside environment.   Following ovulation, the viability of the eggs can decrease rapidly.
<p>
	Fish with gametes that have not yet been released by the gonads are called "green."  The term "ripe" is used to describe fish with gametes that have been released from the ovary into the ovarian lumen.  Ripe fish can be stripped, green fish cannot.

<H3>Inducing Reproduction</H3>
	There are two main strategies used to induce reproduction.  The first is to provide an environment similar to that in which spawning occurs naturally.  Catfish, for example, like to spawn in enclosed spaces such as hollow logs.  A farmer can simulate this by putting milk cans in a pond.  The presence of vegetation and an increase in temperature will usually work for goldfish.  Changing the photoperiod in a hatchery can accelerate or delay maturation and ovulation in many salmon and trout species.  
<p>
	The second strategy is to inject the fish with one or more naturally occurring reproductive hormones or their synthetic analogs.  This is only effective in fish that are already in breeding condition and have mature eggs in which the germinal vesicle has migrated.  Often the two strategies are used sequentially: the first to manipulate maturation, then the second to induce ovulation.  
<p>
	Numerous hormones have been used to induce reproduction.  Two methods have emerged over the past few years that seem to offer the best chance for success at the least expense.  They are injection of a GnRH analog with dopamine antagonist, and injection of gonadotropin.

<H3>GnRH Analog with Dopamine Antagonist </H3>
	Leutinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) is the name of a mammalian hormone that has been employed successfully to induce the reproductive hormonal cascade.  In recent years, synthetic analogues of LHRH, referred to as LHRHa, have been developed that are far more effective.  Because they are purer and are not rapidly metabolized by fish, they remain active for longer periods.
<p>
Under natural conditions, there
is a feedback mechanism in the fish that limits the release of gonadotropin.  This mechanism uses a chemical called dopamine, which inhibits the action of LHRH.  When dopamine is present in the fish, even LHRHa will have only limited success.  A dopamine antagonist is often used to limit the effects of dopamine.  When LHRHa and a dopamine antagonist are used in conjunction, reproductive success dramatically increases.

<H3>Gonadotropin</H3>
	Two types of gonadotropin extracts have been used to induce ovulation in fish: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) and fish pituitary extract.  Pituitary extracts are made by removing the pituitary from a fish and extracting the hormones, which may then be injected into another fish.  Carp, catfish, salmon, and other fish have been used for this.  HCG offers three major advantages over the pituitary extract:  1) it is much less expensive, 2) it is more stable and thus has a longer shelf life, and 3) it comes in a purified form. 


<H3>Methods</H3>
	The details of inducing spawning differ from species to species.  They will also differ according to the goals and means of the farmer.  It must be emphasized that the following techniques do not apply to all situations.  Farmers should always thoroughly research the techniques that have been developed for their species of fish and select those that best fit the circumstances.

<H3>Broodstock </H3>
	Brooders should be fast growing, disease free, and sexually ripe.  There are several indicators of ripeness:
<p>
<b>Females  </B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The abdomen is rounded and soft.
<LI>The genital opening is swollen, protruding, and reddish.
<LI>The anus is often also swollen and reddish.
<LI>Secondary sexual characteristics are evident.
</UL>
<b>Males	</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Milt is released when the abdomen is pressed gently.
<LI>Secondary sexual characteristics are evident.
</UL>
	Brooders must be handled with extreme gentleness.  They are physically very vulnerable during spawning and may die if dropped or roughly handled.  Often, a good deal of the farmer's resources has gone into developing the broodstock line and keeping the fish healthy.  The potential return from this investment can easily be eliminated through sloppy handling.
<p>	
When the brooders are kept in ponds or pens, all water quality parameters, such as temperature and oxygen, should be kept at optimal levels.  A satisfactory amount of high quality, well balanced feed should be provided.  If the fish are moved from one set of conditions to another, time must be allowed for acclimation.  When handling the fish, gentle firmness should be the rule.  Covering the fish with wet burlap or cloth, or covering their container to cut off light, will help to keep them calm.  Tranquilizers may be used when fish are to be injected or stripped.  

<H3>Injecting the Fish</H3>
	There are two common places to inject hormones into a fish.  An intraperitoneal (within the body cavity) injection is given through the ventral (bottom) part of the fish
behind either the pelvic or pectoral fin (Fig. 2).  Intramuscular (within the muscle) injections are commonly done on the dorsal (upper) part of the fish above the lateral line and below the anterior part of the dorsal fin (Fig. 3).  In either case, it is important to place the needle so that it slides under the scale rather than through it.
<p>
	Two dosage levels are commonly used: a preparatory dose and a decisive, or final, dose with a time gap generally of 12 to 24 hours between the two injections.  The preparatory dose brings the fish to the brink of spawning, and the decisive dose induces ovulation.  In general, the preparatory dose is about 10 percent of the total dose. For some fish, several preparatory doses may be necessary.

<H3>Stripping</H3>
	Stripping should be carried out as soon after ovulation as possible.  Fish should be anesthetized and examined 6 to 12 hours after the final injection.  Before stripping, both the male and female should be cleaned and dried around the vent with a soft towel because residual anesthetic will kill sperm.  Water, fish "slime", feces, and blood should not be allowed to mix with the gametes as they are stripped.
<p>	
To strip the fish, the female should be held around the caudal fin with one hand, while applying slight pressure to the abdomen with the other hand.  If ovulation has occurred, a stream of eggs will emerge.  If only a few appear, the female is still "green" and should be returned to the holding tank.  If there is a stream of eggs, the abdomen should be messaged from front to back to strip out all the eggs.

<H3>Some Examples</H3>

     The following procedures provide examples of  a variety of
techniques used to induce spawning.

<H4>Golden Shiners</H4>
	Some fish can be induced to spawn simply by providing an appropriate environment.  An example is furnishing spawning substrate for golden shiners, which naturally lay their eggs on vegetation.  There are two common ways of doing this.  The first is to plant natural vegetation around the shore.  The second is to place spawning mats in the pond.  The advantage of spawning mats is that once the eggs are laid, the mats can be removed and placed in another pond for grow-out.  One common method for constructing these mats is to sandwich spanish moss or a similar material inside steel-welded wire.  A piece of 2" by 4" steel mesh is folded in half so that the dimensions of the mat are about 20" by 40".  The spanish moss is placed inside the fold, and hognose rings are used to hold the bottom together.  

The following is adapted from <I>Third Report to the Fish Farmers</I>, published by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.<p>
<OL>
<LI>Twenty to forty pounds of brood stock may be stocked per acre.

<LI>Plankton blooms can inhibit spawning.  If heavy blooms occur, the pond should be flushed with fresh water.  

<LI>If grass is to be planted, the water level in the brood pond should be lowered during early spring to allow growth along the shoreline.  Once the grass has been established, the ponds should be refilled.

<LI>If spawning mats are to be used, they should be placed in shallow water, about one inch below the surface with one side at the edge of the pond.  Several mats may be placed end-to-end.  
<LI>As each mat fills with eggs,
it should be transferred to a rearing pond for grow-out.  Care must be taken so that the mats do not become over-populated with eggs, because they may eventually smother each other or be attacked by fungus.  
<LI>If spawning activity diminishes quickly, a rapid rise in the water level may extend activity.
</OL>
<H4>Trout</H4>
	In nature, trout build their nests in gravel and require cold, flowing, aerated water to reproduce.  Changes in photoperiod are critical for bringing the fish to spawning condition.  The spawning season varies with locality, temperature, and the species or strain of fish.  Brook and brown trout are fall spawners, while rainbow trout spawn in the spring.  The following steps, summarized from Fish Culture Manual, published by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, illustrate one method for spawning trout by stripping females and mixing the eggs with milt.  Many other methods also exist.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize the fish.  Placing them in MS-222 at a concentration of 130-260 mg/l (assuming temperature between 4 C and 15 C) is common.  The solution should be within 5 C of the holding or rearing containers, and the pH should be between 6 and 8.
<LI>Holding the caudal peduncle with one hand and supporting the head with the other, dip the fish in clean water to wash off the anesthetic.
<LI>Strip the female's eggs into a dry, shallow container.  The fish should be held belly down in a horizontal position with the head slightly higher than the tail.  Gently
press upward near the base of the pelvic fin to start the flow of eggs.  Slowly stroke the belly, moving the hand from front to rear using constant pressure.  Repeat this procedure until no more eggs are obtained.
<LI>In the dry method of fertilization, sperm from the males is poured onto the eggs.  Water should not come into contact with the mixture for it will inhibit fertilization by the sperm.  The sperm, eggs, and ovarian fluid should be gently mixed with a feather.
<LI>After 30 seconds, fertilization will have taken place.  Add enough water to cover the eggs and mix again.
<LI>Let the fertilized eggs soak for 30 seconds.
<LI>Rinse the fertilized eggs in clean water.  
<LI>Water harden the eggs.  This is a process whereby the eggs absorb water and grow about 20 percent.  Place the eggs into a container that will accommodate them as they grow.  Add water, then do not disturb for an hour.
<LI>Put into incubators.
</OL>

<H4>Catfish</H4>
	Temperature is a determining factor in the control of catfish reproduction.  Spawning activity begins after water temperatures stay consistently above 70 F.  It drops off when temperatures fall below 70 F or rise above 85 F.  There are a variety of methods commonly used for spawning catfish, including spawning in ponds, spawning in pens, and hand stripping.  In many, though not all cases, hormone injection may be desirable.  The following procedure from Third Report to the Fish Farmers provides an example of spawning induction with hormones followed by hand stripping.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize the fish with MS-222 at a concentration of 80 mg/l.

<LI>If the fish are kept in a holding tank, loosely stitch their mouths closed to prevent them from biting one another.  The thread must be loose enough to allow respiration.  

<LI>Using an 18-gauge needle, inject intraperitoneally with:
	a.  3.5-4.0 mg of acetone-dried pituitary gland extract per kilogram of fish for the female and about 2 mg per kilogram for the male, or
	b.  500-800 international units of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) per pound of fish.

<LI>If necessary, inject again 48 hours later.  Usually, the female ovulates within 16-20 hours after an injection.  

<LI>Strip the eggs and the milt into a 0.3 percent solution of common salt.  

<LI>Very gently mix the eggs and milt.  Fertilization should occur in 2-5 minutes.

<LI>Place the egg mass in a suitable incubator for hatching.

<LI>After 10-12 hours, stop the water flow and treat with a 0.3-0.5 percent solution of alkaline protease enzyme for 2-3 minutes while gently stirring.  This will dissolve the sticky layer of the eggs and allow them to float free.  

<LI>When the eggs begin hatching, they should be taken out and placed in a flat tray.  
</OL>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
	Many species of fish will not readily reproduce under certain culture conditions.  Others will, but not necessarily when the farmer desires.  In these cases, induction of spawning can be of great value.  
<p>
	Two techniques are commonly used, sometimes in conjunction with one another.  The first is manipulation of the culture environment to mimic some important quality in the fish's natural environment.  The second is injection of hormones to stimulate spawning.  The hormones may be natural hormones taken from fish or other animals, genetically engineered from bacteria, or synthetic analogs of naturally-occurring hormones.  
<p>
	Methods vary from species to species and situation to situation.  However, at least two generalizations can be drawn.  First, brooders are very vulnerable to rough handling.  Care should always be used to avoid damaging these valuable animals.  Second, a fish that does not have mature gametes will not produce viable eggs or sperm no matter how many times it is injected with hormones.  Ripeness is the result of environmental factors working over a period of time, leading to maturation of the gonads and production of viable eggs.  
<p>
	Many procedures have been developed for inducing fish to undergo the last steps of spawning.  Farmers should thoroughly research the procedures that have been developed for their species of fish through experimentation, and select those that best suit the circumstances.  In addition, once the fish have spawned, there are many techniques involved in incubating and caring for the eggs, and caring for the hatched fry.  These too must be thoroughly researched.

<H1>Walleye Culture in Minnesota</H1>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
     Walleye is indisputably the king fish of the north.  No other species elicits as much passion from the avid angler, or is more sought after.  Consequently, there is great interest in intensively culturing walleye to food size.  Unfortunately, because of certain characteristics (including intractable feeding habits and a tendency toward cannibalism when young), walleye are very difficult to culture.  As a result, farmers have been limited to raising fingerlings in semi-natural ponds for stocking into natural bodies of water.
<p>
     In an effort to investigate the potential for walleye culture in Minnesota, a demonstration project was included as part of the Minnesota Aquaculture Development and Education Program (MADEP).  The objective was to provide a first step toward designing a profitable production system for food-size walleye.  The project addressed questions of walleye growth rates in captivity, time needed to achieve market size, and the use of artificial feed.  
<p>
     Four private farmers from different areas of Minnesota participated in the project by raising walleye in existing ponds.  One participant was in the far northwestern corner of the state, one in the southwest, and two in east-central Minnesota.   Because some of the ponds were not drainable, cages were constructed for raising the fish.   The cages allowed the walleye to be easily sampled, harvested, and monitored.  They also confined the fish, and thus increased the likelihood that they would stay on dry feed.
<p>

[figure 1]

<H3>Background</H3>
     In the wild, walleye feed exclusively on living organisms, such as zooplankton, insects, and other fish.  This preference is so strong that many walleye will starve to death before they will eat artificial feed.  When farmers try to train walleye to eat artificial feed, mortality rates of 50 to 90 percent are common.  This training process is costly and requires a high capital investment, intensive labor, and expensive  feeds.  Newly hatched fry must be confined to indoor tanks where light, water quality, and feeding can be tightly controlled, and food must be provided constantly for up to one and one-half months.  In addition, the feed must be formulated to exacting standards and contain large amounts of protein.
<p>
     One major source of fry mortality during training is non-inflation of the swim bladder (an organ used to maintain buoyancy) after hatching.  This organ must be inflated when fry are very young or they will sink to the bottom of the tank and die.  Although the cause of this problem is not yet well understood, it is the subject of much current research.  Another major source of mortality is cannibalism.  With no natural feed available, fry will eat each other.  After hatching, one fry can eat another that is almost equal in size.  As they grow older, a larger size difference is required.
<p>
     If walleye trained to eat artificial feed are stocked in a pond where natural feed is also available, they may switch back to the natural feed.  Even when this supply can no longer support them, they may not return to eating the artificial food and their growth may slow.
<p>
     Because they are carnivores, walleye have a high protein requirement, which typically means feeding costs are relatively high.  Research is being done to more 
precisely determine their nutritional requirements.
<p>
     Walleye are crepuscular fish.  They tend to feed when light levels are low, such as at dawn, dusk, and before rainstorms.  In very turbid water, they may be active during the day as well.  A layer in their eyes, the tapitum lucitum, gathers light and provides them with excellent night vision.  This affinity for low light may be an important consideration when determining feeding regimes and designing walleye culture facilities.
<p>
     Walleye do have some advantages as a culture species.  They tolerate a wide range of physical and chemical conditions.  This tolerance is related to their natural environment, which is typically large, semi-turbid waters, where temperature and water quality vary considerably.  Although they tolerate temperatures between 4 C (39F) and 30 C (86 F), walleye grow best between 20 C (68 F) and 23 C (73 F).  Spawning occurs shortly after ice-out in spring when temperatures are between 7 C (45F) and 9 C (48 F).  They can withstand dissolved oxygen levels as low as three parts per million (ppm) and have been known to withstand two ppm for extended periods in the lab.  This hardiness is important because daily and seasonal changes are common in intensive outdoor culture systems.
<p>
     Male walleye mature at two to four years, at 280 mm (10.9") in length, while females mature at three to six years, when they are 350 to 430 mm (13.6" - 16.8") long.  The females spawn in shallow water where oxygen levels are high, and prefer sand, gravel, or rocks as substrate.  Group spawning appears to be common.  During spawning, milt and eggs are released into the water column, where they fuse and settle to the bottom.  On average, 60,000 eggs are released per kilogram of female.  The life expectancy of a walleye is five to seven years in southerly, warmer climates and 12 to 15 years in northern areas.

     In July 1989, 16,000 walleye fingerlings were trapped from ponds in Erskine, Minnesota, and transported to the Leech Lake Reservation Fisheries Department Hatchery.  They were trained to eat a dry diet in three separate indoor raceways at 20 C (68 F) over five weeks.  During the first five days, they were fed Dry-Feed Kyowa C-1700, dispensed by electronically triggered automatic feeders at a rate of 10 percent of the total body weight per day.  After this, they were switched to Dry-Feed Kyowa C-2700, then seven days later to a grower diet called Bio-dry 4000.  Raceways were cleaned daily to maintain good water quality.
<p>
     During the five weeks of conversion, four grow-out sites were prepared with docks, cages, and aeration.  Initially, one cage was built at each site and aeration systems, which ran continuously throughout the two-year project, were installed.  Cages were constructed to be very light, strong, easy to clean, inexpensive, and simple to build.  The dimensions were six feet long by three feet wide by six feet deep.  The total volume was 108 cubic feet.  The frame was built of one-inch PVC tubing, which is light, cheap, and easy to use.  Quarter-inch mesh Vexar plastic netting was attached to the frame to contain the fish.  This was small enough to keep the fish from escaping, but large enough to limit fouling.  Floatation was provided by closed-cell, rigid polystyrene foam mounted under the wooden cover.  The total cost was $158.91 per cage.
<p>
     On August 24, approximately 20.5 pounds of fish at 85 fish per pound were delivered to each site.  They were allowed to grow until they reached a maximum density of 0.5 pounds of fish per cubic foot of cage, (54 pounds per cage).  At that point, another cage was built and the walleye were divided between the two.  The southwestern site and one of the east-central sites each had six cages by the end of the project, while the other east-central site had two, and the northwestern site had one.
<p>
     After stocking, the walleye were fed Bio-dry 4000 for a period of time and then switched to a salmon diet.  As the fish grew, they were fed progressively larger pellets.  The feeding ration ranged from five percent body weight per day in summer to one percent body weight per day in winter.  An automatic cage-mounted belt feeder (made by Zeigler Bros., Inc.) was used to provide the feed throughout the day.  
<p>
     Water quality and fish growth were monitored throughout the project.  Dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, and water temperature measurements were taken three times each week and total alkalinity, total hardness, and ammonia nitrogen were monitored.  Periodic, random samplings were conducted to measure walleye weight and length and to check for signs of stress or disease.

<H3>Summary of Project Results</H3>
     Individual growth rates varied a great deal between the four sites (Figs. 1 and 2).  By mid-summer 1991, walleye at the southwestern site (where the fastest growth occurred) weighed an average of 0.37 pounds each, while at one of the east-central sites, they weighed 0.01 pounds.  Walleye at the southwestern site, which were allowed to continue to grow beyond the end of the project, were again sampled in October, 1992.  Their average weight was 0.44 pounds. and their length ranged from 9.9 inches to 14.2 inches.  The range of weights was from 0.34 pounds to 1.2 pounds.
<p>
     Mortality varied between sites.  At the southwestern site, 1,077 of the original 1,760 stocked fish, or 61.2 percent, remained by June 1991.  At the northwestern site, 200 fish, or 11.4 percent survived.  Two major problems affected survival.   At one site, the walleye succumbed to a Trichodina infection.  Although the walleye were treated and the disease was eliminated, it caused heavy losses.  At one of the east-central sites, survival had been 65.9 percent through June 1991.  However, at the beginning of June, all the walleye died from an unknown cause.  They were examined by diagnostic laboratories at Purina Mills and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture but nothing definitive was found.  Two of the most likely possibilities were: (1) the pond was struck by lightening during a storm, or (2) the storm flushed contaminants from surrounding agricultural lands into the water.


<H3>Conclusion</H3>
     Walleye were able to thrive, and at least a portion of the crop, reached market size in two growing seasons.  However, had this been a commercial venture, it would have lost money.  A number of factors, including high feed costs and low loading rates, contributed to the loss.
<p>
     Feed costs were high for two reasons.  First, because of the high protein content, the price of the feed itself was high.  Second, the conversion of feed to fish flesh was very poor.  This may have been largely due to uneaten feed simply falling through the cage.  Research is currently underway on the nutritional requirements of walleye to better tailor the feed to their specific needs.  Related to this, research needs to be done regarding the most efficient methods, frequency, and quantity for feeding.  With improvements in these areas, the conversion ratio of feed to fish flesh will improve, allowing higher yields at lower cost.
<p>
     Loading densities were kept conservatively low.  This resulted in inefficient use of space, high construction costs, and low overall yield.  Other cage-cultured species are commonly stocked four times more densely.  More research must be completed on optimal stocking densities for ponds and cages.
<p>
     Another critical area of work for both public and private researchers is the development of domesticated lines of walleye for intensive culture.  Animals caught from the wild cannot be expected to perform as well as domesticated strains raised in intensive culture.  They are not as resistant to disease, cannot convert artificial feed as efficiently, nor do they respond well to a wide array of conditions found in a culture situation.  With a selective breeding program, a domesticated line of walleye may be developed that will thrive in captivity.

<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
	Rusty crayfish (<I>Orconectes rusticus</I>) have 
invaded portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ontario 
and many other states.  Although native to parts of 
some Great Lakes states, rusty crayfish have 
spread to many  northern lakes and streams where 
they have caused a variety of ecological problems.  <p>

	Rusty crayfish were probably spread by non-
resident anglers who brought them north to use 
as fishing bait.  As rusty crayfish populations 
increased, they were harvested for the regional 
bait 
market, and for biological supply companies.  Such 
activities probably helped spread the species 
further.  Invading rusty crayfish frequently 
displace native crayfish, reduce the amount and 
kinds of 
aquatic plants and invertebrates, and reduce some 
fish populations.  Environmentally sound ways to 
eradicate or control introduced populations of 
rusty crayfish have not been developed, and none 
are likely in the near future.  The best way to prevent 
further environmental problems is to prevent or 
slow their spread into new waters.

<H3>ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION</H3>
	There are over 350 species of crayfish in 
North America.  Sixty-five of these species, 
including rusty crayfish, belong to the genus 
<I>Orconectes</I>.  Rusty crayfish are thought to be 
native to 
the Ohio River basin and the states of Ohio, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, and Illinois. But, 
now rusty 
crayfish are also found in Michigan, Massachusetts, 
Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, New 
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, all New England 
states except Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and many 
areas of Ontario, Canada (see Fig. 1, North 
American Distribution).  They were not found in 
Wisconsin in a 1932 survey, but populations have 
rapidly expanded throughout Wisconsin lakes and 
strerams since their introduction around 1960 
(Capeli and Magnuson 1983).  The first observation 
of 
rusty crayfish in Minnesota was in 1967 at Otter 
Creek in southern Minnesota.  A statewide study 
(Helgen, 1990) reported their presence in many 
areas of the state.  So far, they have been found 
in 11 
counties and 19 different lakes and streams (see 
Fig. 2, Minnesota Distribution).
<P>
	The rusty crayfish found in southern Minnesota 
(Des Moines and Cedar River basins) and 
east central Minnesota (St. Croix River and 
tributaries) may have resulted from the natural 
dispersal 
of introduced populations from Wisconsin, Iowa, and 
Ontario.  Rusty crayfish populations in the rest 
of Minnesota, however, were probably spread there 
by people.
<p>
	Although, there is no direct evidence that 
people spread rusty crayfish, it is generally 
believed 
that anglers using crayfish as bait represent the 
primary source for introduction.  While crayfish 
never 
were a significant component of Minnesota live bait 
sales, they are popular in other states and may 
have been brought in by non-resident anglers.  
Rusty crayfish are also sold to schools by 
biological 
supply houses.  Even though a warning not to 
release rusty crayfish into the wild accompanies 
the 
crayfish sold to schools, such warnings may be 
forgotten or live crayfish may be given away to 
students.  Crayfish from schools or collected from 
the wild and placed in home aquariums may 
eventually be released.  Developing a viable 
commercial harvest of rusty crayfish from natural 
lakes 
could be incentive for unscrupulous trappers to 
plant them in other lakes.  In fact, this kind of 
activity 
may have contributed to the spread of rusty 
crayfish in Wisconsin, according to Wisconsin DNR 
Fisheries Manager Harland Carlson.  
<P>
	The harvest of rusty crayfish, which is just 
beginning in Minnesota and possibly expanding in 
Wisconsin, may provide the only beneficial use for 
this exotic.  Regulations in both Minnesota and 
Wisconsin now make it illegal to introduce rusty 
crayfish into any water body.  In Minnesota, it is 
illegal to sell live crayfish as bait, introduce 
crayfish from one body of water to another, or to 
transport live rusty crayfish.  A Department of 
Natural Resources permit is required to 
commercially 
harvest or culture crayfish in Minnesota.

<H3>LIFE HISTORY</H3>
	Rusty crayfish inhabit lakes, ponds, and 
streams.  They generally prefer areas that offer 
rocks, 
logs, or other debris as cover.  The bottom type 
may be clay, silt, sand, gravel, or rock.  Rusty 
crayfish 
inhabit both pools and fast water areas of streams.  
They generally do not dig burrows other than 
small pockets under rocks and other debris, 
although there have been reports of more 
substantial 
burrows.  Unlike some species (such as the 
papershell crayfish, Orconectes immnis) which dig 
burrows to escape ponds that are drying up or 
becoming inhospitable, rusty crayfish need 
permanent 
lakes or streams that provide suitable water 
quality year round.
<P>
	Mature rusty crayfish mate in late summer, 
early fall, or early spring.  The male (Diagram 1) 
transfers  sperm to the female (Diagram 2) which 
she then stores until she is ready to fertilize the 
eggs, typically in the spring (late April or May) 
as water temperatures begin to increase.  The 
stored 
sperm are released as eggs are expelled and 
external fertilization occurs.  The eggs are then 
attached 
to the swimmerets on the underside of the crayfish 
abdomen (tail).  Just prior to egg laying, white 
patches on the underside of the abdomen (tail) 
appear, especially on the tail fan (Diagram 2).  
These 
white patches are glair, a mucus-like substance 
secreted during egg fertilization and attachment.  
Rusty crayfish females lay from 80 to 575 eggs.
<P>
	The eggs hatch in three to six weeks, 
depending on water temperature.  Once the eggs have 
hatched, the young crayfish cling to the female's 
swimmerets for three to four molts (molting is when 
crayfish shed their old shell to allow growth).  
Young crayfish may stay with the female for several 
weeks.  She offers them protection during this 
vulnerable life stage.  Eventually the young leave 
the 
female.  They undergo eight to ten molts before 
they mature which may occur during the first year, 
but more likely, the following year.  Rusty 
crayfish reach maturity at a total length of one 
and three-
eighths inches and reach a maximum length of about 
four inches. They averaged two and one-half 
inches in Wisconsin collections (Hobbs and Jass, 
1988). 
<P>
	It is important to note that it is not 
necessary to introduce both a male and a female 
crayfish 
to begin a new population.  One female carrying 
viable sperm could begin a new population if 
released into a suitable environment.  Rusty 
crayfish readily mate in captivity so it is 
reasonable to 
expect that mature females whether used as fishing 
bait or as science class study specimens could 
produce offspring.
<P>
	Growth slows considerably after crayfish reach 
maturity.  While mature males molt twice per 
year, females usually only molt once.  Females molt 
after the release of their young, typically in June 
or early July  In the spring, males will molt into 
a sexually inactive form (called Form II) and then 
molt back into the reproductively competent form 
(Form I) in summer.  Form I males are 
characterized by large claws, a hook on one pair of 
their legs (Diagram 1), and hardened gonapods.  
The hook and the larger claws are used for grasping 
females during mating.  Because males have an 
additional molt each year, they are usually larger 
than females of the same age. A typical rusty 
crayfish lives three to four years.

<H3>FOOD HABITS</H3>
	Crayfish are considered opportunistic feeders.  
Rusty crayfish feed on a variety of aquatic 
plants, other benthic invertebrates (like round 
worms, snails, leeches, clams, aquatic insects, and 
other 
crustaceans like amphipods and water fleas), 
detritus (decaying plants and animals including the 
associated bacteria and fungi), fish eggs, and 
small fish.  

<H3>POTENTIAL IMPACTS</H3>
	Rusty crayfish may cause a variety of negative 
environmental and economic consequences 
when introduced to new waters.  First, they are an 
aggressive species which often displace native or 
existing crayfish species.  The displacement of 
crayfish such as O. virilis and O. propinquus has 
occurred in many northern Wisconsin lakes, northern 
Ontario, and in the Kawartha Lakes region of 
southern Ontario (Capelli 1982, Munjal and Capelli, 
1982).
<P>
	Perhaps the most serious impact is the 
destruction of aquatic plant beds.  Rusty crayfish 
have 
been shown to reduce aquatic plant abundance and 
species diversity (Lodge and Lorman, 1987; 
Olsen et. al., 1991).  This can be especially 
damaging in relatively unproductive northern lakes 
where 
beds of aquatic plants are not abundant to begin 
with.  Submerged aquatic plants are important in 
these systems for:<p>
<UL>
<LI>habitat for invertebrates (which provide 
food for fish and ducks),
<LI>shelter for young gamefish, panfish, or 
forage species of fish,
<LI>nesting substrate for game fish like 
northern pike, and
<LI>retarding wave action that may cause 
erosion. 
</UL> 
Although other crayfish eat aquatic plants, rusty 
crayfish eat even more because they have a higher 
metabolic rate and appetite (Jones and Momot, 
1983), grow to a larger size, hide less from 
predators 
-- and therefore feed longer (Stein, 1977) -- and 
attain high population densities.  
<p>
<table border=1>
<TD>
<H3>Should rusty crayfish be used to control Eurasian 
water milfoil</H3>
 (an exotic plant species that forms 
dense mats and adversely affects swimming, boating 
and fishing)?  The use of one exotic species to 
control another is highly discouraged without 
proper long term studies.  Rusty crayfish, as well 
as 
other crayfish, cut plant stems as they feed. Much 
of the plant then floats away.  Since Eurasian 
water 
milfoil spreads and reproduces primarily by plant 
fragmentation, crayfish could accelerate its 
spread.  
Also, Eurasian water milfoil is less able to 
establish itself in areas with healthy native 
plants.  Areas 
disturbed by rusty crayfish may be more susceptible 
to invasion by Eurasian water milfoil.  In 
addition, if a suitable biological control for 
Eurasian water milfoil is found, rusty crayfish 
could 
interfere with its effectiveness (through 
predation).  Since there is no research into the 
effectiveness of 
using rusty crayfish for Eurasian water milfoil 
control and rusty crayfish usually do not become 
abundant in the lakes most susceptible to Eurasian 
water milfoil, their introduction would not likely 
have the desired effects.  No one should introduce 
this species into any water body.
</TD>
</Table>
<p>
	Rusty crayfish, especially juveniles, feed 
heavily on benthic invertebrates like mayflies, 
stoneflies, chironomids, and amphipods.  It has 
been estimated that rusty crayfish might consume 
twice as much food as similarly sized northern 
crayfish because of a higher metabolic rate (Momot, 
1992).  So, rusty crayfish are probably more likely 
to compete with juvenile game fish and forage 
species for benthic invertebrates than would native 
crayfish species.  Displacement of native crayfish 
by rusty crayfish, therefore, could result in less 
food for fish.  Fish will eat crayfish, but because 
of 
their thick exoskeleton (shell) relative to soft 
tissue, their food quality is not as high as many 
of the 
invertebrates that they replace.  Less food or 
lower food quality means slower growth which can 
also 
reduce fish survival.
<P>
	Finally, it has been suggested that rusty 
crayfish harm fish populations by eating fish eggs.  
While rusty crayfish have consumed fish eggs under 
various circumstances (Horns and Magnuson, 
1981), there is no scientific study directly 
linking fishery declines with crayfish egg 
predation.  Its 
likely that those fish species that lay eggs in 
relatively warm water (greater than 50 F) are more 
susceptible to crayfish predation than fish that 
spawn during colder water periods (Momot, 1992).  
For instance, centrarchids like smallmouth bass, 
largemouth bass and sunfish are more likely to be 
affected than lake trout, walleye or northern pike.  
Wisconsin DNR Fisheries manager Harland 
Carlson, however, has observed actively feeding 
crayfish during lake trout spawning in November 
(water temperature 46 to 50 F).  Reduction in 
reproductive success of walleye in Lake Metonga, 
Wisconsin was reported (Lodge, et.al, 1985) 
following the rusty crayfish invasion, however, 
walleye 
reproduction in other Wisconsin lakes invaded by 
rusty crayfish was not similarly impacted.  Perhaps 
the lower quality walleye spawning substrate of 
Lake Metonga compared to other lakes invaded by 
rusty crayfish allowed the impact on walleye 
reproduction.  There is, however, no direct 
evidence 
proving or disproving this speculation.
<P>
	Male bass and sunfish protect their nests 
until the eggs hatch and the advanced fry swim 
away.  Dr. Bill Swenson, University of Wisconsin - 
Superior fishery scientist, has observed rusty 
crayfish attacking bluegill nests that were guarded 
by males.  He also observed rusty crayfish in other 
unguarded nests.  It is not known, however, if 
rusty crayfish caused the bluegills to abandon 
their 
nests or if they destroy bluegill eggs on a regular 
basis.  
<P>
	No detailed research has been done that proves 
rusty crayfish cause declines in fish 
populations.  Observations and circumstantial 
evidence gathered by Wisconsin fishery managers 
suggest that bluegill and northern pike populations 
frequently decline following introduction of rusty 
crayfish (Harland Carlson and Chris Sand, Wisconsin 
DNR, personal communication).  Largemouth 
bass in Lake Lenore and smallmouth bass in 
Pounsford Lake, Ontario also seemed to decline 
following introduction of rusty crayfish (Dr. 
Walter Momot, personal communication).  Impacts on 
other fish species are not as obvious.  The primary 
cause of bluegill, bass and northern pike declines 
is probably reduced abundance and diversity of 
aquatic plants. Reduced food (such as mayflies, 
chironomids and amphipods) and egg predation may 
also play a role.  Because impacts and 
population abundance of rusty crayfish vary in 
apparently similar lakes, it is not possible to 
predict 
what will happen when they invade a new lake.  It 
is clear, however, that rusty crayfish are an 
aggressive, unwanted exotic.
<P>
	Cabin owners on heavily infested northern 
Wisconsin lakes have even stopped swimming 
because large numbers of rusty crayfish occupy 
their favorite swimming area throughout the day.  
They fear stepping on them and getting pinched by 
the large-clawed "rustys."  Other crayfish species, 
even if abundant, are usually less conspicuous 
during daylight hours.

<H3>CONTROL</H3>
	Many chemicals kill crayfish.  Some chemicals 
even selectively kill crayfish, however, none 
are currently registered for use on crayfish (Bills 
and Marking 1988), and none selectively kill rusty 
crayfish over other crayfish species.  Intensive 
harvest will not eradicate or control crayfish but 
may 
help reduce adult populations and minimize some 
impacts.  Some researchers have suggested that 
nuisance populations of rusty crayfish are the 
result of poor fishery management and that by 
restoring a healthy population of bass and sunfish, 
rusty crayfish would not be as disruptive (Momot, 
1984) in some lakes.  The best method of control, 
however, is to prevent their introduction.  
Educating anglers, crayfish trappers, bait dealers 
and teachers about the risks posed by rusty 
crayfish 
will help reduce the risk of spreading rusty 
crayfish to new areas.

<H3>IDENTIFYING RUSTY CRAYFISH</H3>
	Identifying crayfish can be very difficult.  
Positive identification requires looking at a 
number of characteristics and having enough 
experience to interpret them.  Here are some 
general, 
easily observed characteristics that can be used to 
help you identify mature adults of four common 
crayfish species found in the Great Lakes region.  
Other species found in the region include 
Cambarus diogenes, Procambarus acutus acutus, and 
in southern parts of the region Procambarus 
clarki.  The following are general identification 
guidelines and should not be used when positive 
identification is needed.  Contact your local 
fishery management agency or Minnesota Sea Grant 
(see 
address and telephone on last page) if positive 
identification is required.
<P>
	Rusty crayfish can generally be identified by 
their more robust claws which are larger than 
either O. 
immunis or O. virilis, and by the dark rusty spots 
on each side of their carapace.  The spots are 
placed as though you 
picked up the crayfish with paint on your 
forefinger and thumb (Figure 2A).  The spots may 
not always be present 
or well developed in rusty crayfish from some 
waters.  

	Compared to the rusty crayfish, O. virilis can 
often be distinguished because its claw is more 
blue and has 
distinct white wart-like bumps.  The rusty claw, by 
comparison, is grayish-green to reddish-brown and 
is smoother 
(Figure 3).  

	O. propinquus has a claw very similar to the 
rusty crayfish, but O. propinquus lacks the dark 
spots on each 
side of the carapace.  Instead, it has a dark brown 
to black patch on the top of the abdomen ("tail 
section").  This 
gives the impression that a light colored stripe 
runs along each side of the abdomen (Figure 2B).

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Fish farming, or aquaculture, has attracted the attention of farmers, landowners, and investors as an alternative agriculture enterprise. Like other forms of farming, fish production involves capital investment, labor, management, and risks. If you are considering fish farming, this checklist can help you determine whether a fish farming enterprise is feasible for your particular situation. The checklist, of course, does not cover all possibilities. Answering yes to most questions won't guarantee success, just as answering no won't mean automatic failure. The checklist does address the most important considerations. To have a good probability of success, most of your answers should be in the yes column when you begin a fish farming operation.

<H1>Choosing an Organizational Structure for Your Aquaculture Business</H1></Center>
<HR size=5%>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
There are approximately 2.3 million farms in the United States, ranging in size from small part-time farms to very large operations. Regardless of size, all farms are a  form of business and can be organized or structured in several ways. Individuals involved in th business of fish farming need to be aware of the various organizational structures available  to them, including sole proprietorship, partnerships (general and limited) and corporations (regular and subchapter-S).
<p>
The specific circumstances of the fish farm business dictate which of these structures is most suitable. For example, large farms with numerous employees and a large investment requirement may find it advantageous to consider a more formalized structure, such as a corporation. However, most farms are not in this category. In fact, 70% of the farms in the United States fall at the lower end of the income scale. This group is highly dependent on non-farm income. Overall net off-farm income has increased from 10% in 1960 to 42% in 1986. Nevertheless, these small farms or operations may still benefit from particular organizational structures.
<p>
This paper reviews the various forms of organizational structures which can be utilized in fish farming businesses and presents the advantages and disadvantages of each structure as they relate to such businesses.
<H3>Organizational Structures Sole Proprietorship</H3>
Most farms in the United States are organized as sole proprietorships. Under this structure the farmer is the sole owner, has legal title to the property, and is self employed. Management decisions are solely under the control of the farmer. Resources for the operation are limited to that available to the sole proprietor. With this organizational structure, personal and business assets of the owner are jointly at risk in the operation. Liability is not limited  to only that which is invested in the business. The farmer has total liability for all payments or actions, whether incurred personally or through the farm business. If aquaculturists are sued for a farm accident, their home and personal assets may also be in jeopardy. This is a risky situation for a farm business that may be a part-time venture. Especially, if a substantial amount of personal assets are involved.
<p>
Sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business organization as far as start-up and record-keeping  are concerned, but it has its disadvantages. Sole proprietorship has been described as a hindrance to estate planning, farm transfer, and farm efficiency. However, if the farm operation will cease upon the death of the sole proprietor, it is the simplest structure to liquidate. Alternative organizational structures should be considered if "continuity of life" of the business is a concern.
<p>
Farm efficiency varies with the age of the sole proprietor. In the early years of an operation, efficiency is low, as assets are being accumulated. Mid-way in the operation, as the farmer's net work and risk increase, the farm is at peak operating efficiency. But as the years go on and retirement is considered, the operator usually becomes more conservative and is less willing to assume risk, thus efficiency generally declines. This cyclic pattern can be avoided by transferring the estate during the time of its peak efficiency. In most cases, however, transfer of assets such as land, buildings, livestock, machinery, etc., does not normally occur until the owner's death.
<p>
Landlord-tenant arrangements may be a practical alternative for older farm operators. Under this alternative, the landlord is still the owner of the property, but he/she receives income through rental. This option allows the conversion of farm income (earned) to invest income. Rental income is not considered "earned income"; therefore tax, nor does it reduce social  security tax, nor does it social security benefits. The rental option is also attractive if several heirs are involved but not all are personally interested in continuing the operation.
<p>
<H3>Partnership</H3>
Partnership are the organizational structure of nearly 12% of the farm business nationwide. This arrangement is similar to a sole proprietorship, except that it consists of two or more persons as co-owners. In agriculture, parent/child partnerships have been popular.
<p>
There are two types of partnership: general and limited. In a general partnership, each partner shares in the ownership, management, and liability of the farm business. Each partner is equally liable for any and all payments or actions of the business whether incurred personally or by partner. The individuals, not the partnership, are the taxpayers as is the case in a sole proprietorship. No legal agreement are required to establish a general partnership. This informal arrangement may be dissolved with the same ease with which it was formed. One CO-owner may dissolve the partnership.
<p>
The main advantage of the partnership arrangement is the increase in resources brought to the business as additional partners enter into the operation. But with this increase in resources, comes a loss of total management control.
<p>
Partnership have disadvantages when considering estate planning and transfer. If a partnership is dissolved, property transfer becomes complicated. In the event of the death of a partner, the survivors are generally required to liquidate the business and distribute the assets. If a partner is planning for the business to continue after his death, an agreement with the stipulation should be drawn up. That certainly would be the case in parent/child partnership. However, if additional general partner, especially if the added partner is a minor. 
<p>
A limited partnership is made up of both limited and general partners. The limited partners share in the businesss profits and losses, but are not involved in management. The general partner views the limited partner as an additional source of resources without obligation of sharing management decisions. The limited partners risk and liability are only to the extent of their investment in the business. Therefore, for limited partners, the business is an investment in which they have neither management responsibility nor the unlimited liability of a general partnership or sole proprietorship. The limited partner is essentially trading a voice in management for limited liability.
<p>
Generally, profits are not equally shared among general and limited partners in a limited partnership. The general partners are normally paid a salary for managing the operation, and the remaining profits are proportionally distributed. As is the case with sole proprietorship and general  partnership, the individuals are still the taxpayers. Occasionally, a limited partnership may be perceived as a corporation by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and taxed accordingly. Care should be taken that the limited partnership does not have the corporate features of:
<OL>
<LI>Continuity of life
<LI>Centralized management 
<LI>transfer of partnership interests to another individual, and 
<LI>limited liability
</OL>
The future of "continuity of life" is normally not applicable since partnership may be dissolved by a general partner. A limited partner may terminate involvement without disrupting the business or partnership.
<p>
The limited partnership does require a formal legal arrangement that meets state requirements. It is required that the agreement be legally filed, normally with the Secretary of state or similar office.
<H3>Corporations</H3>
Fewer than 5% of the farming operations in the United States are incorporated. However, corporations are the most rapidly growing type of farm business organization. A corporation is a legal entity. The rights of a corporation are similar to those of individuals. Corporations can enter into contracts, own real and personal property, and sue or be sued independently of the stockholders. Ownership of a corporation is held as shares of stock which are claims on the net worth of the business. The two primary classes of stock are preferred and common.
<p>
Management and control of a corporation are shared among the following three groups: the stockholders, the board of directors, and the officers. Basic decisions are made by stockholders, while the board of directors sets the policies for the corporation. The day-to-day decisions are made by the officers. The individual may manage and operate the farm just as any business manager would, but does so as an employee of the corporation. Although the corporation is owned by the stockholders, the corporate structure provides a means of separating ownership from management and of protecting both parties from risks or liabilities associated with the corporation. Accordingly, unlike sole proprietorships or partnerships, stockholders are not personally liable for actions of the corporation. Liability is limited to the individual investments of the stockholders. A corporation is the best organizational structure as far as protection of personal assets is concerned. A corporation, like a partnership, provides a means by which related or unrelated individuals may combine their funds and operate a business. However, in the case of a corporation, the organization is considerably more structured and legally binding.
<p>
A corporation can be organized to exist perpetually or for a term of years. It is legally created and can only be terminated through the legal process. Incorporation of a farm business can help to hold the farm together through generations. Death of stockholder, including the head of the farm business, doesn't result in the dissolution of the business. Likewise, any stockholder can sell their shares without breaking up the business. The stock can simply be transferred to a new owner. Estate planning is also simplified, because stock shares can be transferred to heirs more easily than titles to land and buildings.
<p>
As far as organization and taxation are concerned, two types of corporations exists. They are the regular or subchapter-C corporation and the pseudo or subchapter-S corporation. When the structured as a C corporation, the corporation is the taxpayer. Earnings and profits are distributed to the shareholders as dividends, and the dividends are taxed as ordinary income. Stock holders do not directly share in the losses of the corporation.
<p>
The subchapter-S corporation was authorized in 1958, especially for small business including agriculture. In order for stockholders to request subchapter-S classification, the following criteria must be met: 
<OL>
<LI>only one class of stock
<LI>less than 35 initial stockholders
<LI>consent of all stockholders to the subchapter-S choice.
</OL>
A husband and wife are treated as one stockholder. If a corporation ceases to meet the requirements of an S corporation, it is terminated. The corporation charter may also be revoked if it is the desire of greater than half of the stockholders. The primary difference between a C and an S corporation, besides the class of stock, is taxation. The S corporation is taxed as a partnership. Both profits and losses are passed on to the stockholders. As is the case with a limited partnership, the officers of the corporation are compensated before the remaining profits are distributed.
<p>
The corporation is the most involved as far as organizational costs and record keeping are concerned. Articles of incorporation are required, officers must be elected, and aboard of directors formed. Most states require stockholders to meet at least once annually and annual fees and taxes may be imposed on the corporation. In many instances, federal, state , and social security taxes have actually increased following incorporation. Regulations concerning incorporation must be adhered to strictly; otherwise, the stockholders stand the risk of having "the corporate veil pierced." In that case individual stockholders are personally liable for the actions of the corporation.
<H3>Summary</H3>
The issues concerning the choice of organizational structure for farm businesses are: 
<OL>
<LI>resources
<LI>liability
<LI>management control
<LI>taxation
</OL>
The most suitable choice for a given farm business depends upon how one or more of these factors affect the financial and personal well-being of the individuals involved.
<p>
In the case of sole proprietorship, the primary advantage is total management control. Resources are limited to that available to that sole proprietor. The sole proprietorship offers little protection of personal assets which are not a part of the operation. It is the least effective in maintaining the operation at peak efficiency. Transfer of assets and estate planning also are difficult.
<p>
The general partnership is similar to a sole proprietorship, but it involves more than one individual. The primary advantage of the general partnership over the sole proprietorship are additional resources. There is no further liability protection, and in fact,  risk increases because each partner is liable for the actions of the other. Additionally, management must be shared. This can be a disadvantage unless partners are involved in different aspects of the operation. It has no advantages over the sole proprietorship concerning continuity or estate planning.
<p>
The limited partnership also provides additional resources. Its advantage over the general partnership concerns the issues of management and liability. A limited partner does not dilute the management of an operation. The departure of a limited partner does not affect the business as greatly as the departure of a general partner. More paperwork is involved in a limited partnership. It offers no advantages for estate planning or continuity of the operation.
<p>
The most formalized organizational structure is the corporation, either subchapter-C or S. Unless the operation is very large, most farmers wishing to incorporate will most likely choose the subchapter-S format. The primary advantages are limited liability of participants and continuity of the operation. Since all profits are passed on to the stockholders as income, there are few if any tax advantages. On the other hand, very large corporations may benefit from C corporation status. This is the only organization structure in which the individual is not the taxpayer. Tax laws have been designed to make the C corporation structure beneficial  only to large operations with numerous employees and large capital requirement.
<p>
Fish farming is a business, and as is the case for any other business, individuals should use the organizational structures which offer them the most advantages. Because fish farming is such a diverse business activity, no single structure can meet the needs of individuals or for all situations. Therefore individuals involved in the business of fish farming should weigh the pros and cons of the various organizational structures and make decisions that best meet their needs.

<H1>Coping with Erosion and High Water on Minnesota Point in Duluth</H1>
<H4>by</H4>
<H3>Dale Baker and Harun Rasid</H3>
</Center>
<hr>
<H3>Minnesota Point</H3>
Minnesota Point, also called Park Point, is a well known Duluth neighborhood and a population of about 1,500, it is a major year-round recreational area with beaches and an airport. Minnesota Point is located at the western tip of Lake Superior, at the mouth of its largest tributary, the St. Louis River.
<p>
Minnesota Point, seven miles long and averaging 500 feet wide, is geologically part of a continuous, sandy, baymouth bar that stretches between Duluth and Superior. The middle of the bar is submerged, creating the natural entry that separates Minnesota Point on the northwest from Wisconsin Point on the southeast. This bar was formed by two processes: primarily by sands carried from the South Shore and deposited by lake currents, and secondarily by sediment deposited by the St. Louis and Nemadji rivers.
<p>
Together, Minnesota Point and Wisconsin Point are about 10 miles long. They protect a magnificent natural harbor, but are extremely vulnerable to the erosive forces of the Lake Superior. On the lake side, extensive sand dunes are constantly shifted by wind blowing off the lake. On the bay side, the land is relatively low and is therefore susceptible to flooding and wave-induced erosion.
<p>
Lake Superior's record high water levels  during 1985-86 caused flooding on Minnesota Point. This was not the first time that flooding had occurred: the early 1950s and mid-1970s were also periods of abnormally high lake levels. Modest increases in water levels dramatically affect residents on Minnesota Point. This is especially true on the bay side, where homes are just a few feet above the average water level.
<H3>Survey Methods</H3>
A survey was carried out in summer 1987 to assess the effects of the 1985-86 high water levels on Minnesota Point. The project was conducted by the geography departments at both the University of Minnesota-Duluth and Lakehead University, and by the Minnesota Sea Grant Extension Program. This survey obtained information on structure setbacks, erosion rates, flooding problems, and shore protection measures. The results are compiled in Table 1.

<p>
Every other house with a mailbox was sampled. If the respondent agreed to an interview, the questionnaire was filled out immediately. If no one was home, the questionnaire was left in the mailbox with a request that it be returned by mail. Of 250 households visited, 175 people responded. This represented 70% of those sampled and 36% of all homes on Minnesota Point.
<H3>Survey Results</H3>
The survey revealed significant differences in the nature of the erosion and flood problems on the two sides of Minnesota Point. On the bay side, most structures have a minimal setback from the water, and many are less than three feet above the long-term average lake level. Consequently, if the lake rises even slightly above normal, many of these properties are subjected to flooding. The intensity of erosion on the bay side is considerably lower because the bay has only several miles of open water or fetch, over which waves can build. On the lake side, in contrast, the maximum  fetch exceeds 350 miles.
<p>
On the lake side, erosion rates are greater, but most structures are on higher ground and have a  much deeper setback. More than one-third of the structures on the bay side have setbacks of less than 30 feet, whereas 90% of those on the lake side have setbacks of more than 100 feet. Three areas with different types of erosion and flood problems were identified. (Figure 1).
<p>
Landowners were asked to estimate the depth of shoreland lost during the 1985086 high water period, as well as the total depth lost since they purchased the property. The long-term erosion rates were considerable lower than those for 1985-86. This was especially true on the bay side, where almost  50% of the total reported erosion occurred during 1985-86. Accelerated erosion during this period was due to 12 consecutive months of record high water levels.
<p>
Despite shorter fetches and lower erosion rates on the bay side, 71 percent of respondents there reported erosion problems, compared to only 34 percent on the lake side. This is probably because smaller setbacks and lower elevations on the bay side make erosion problems more obvious to people living there. In addition, most properties on the bay side extend to the water's edge, whereas on the lake side a public beach serves as a buffer between private land and the water's edge.
<p>
Residents reported a variety of flooding problems. Many noted that they had water in their basements for several weeks. Others said their yards and outbuildings (storage sheds, garages, etc.) had flooded. Reports of flooded basements were almost twice as high on the bay side as on the lake side. Reports of flooded yards and outbuildings were almost five times as high on the bay side as on the lake side.
<p>
Many respondents (about two thirds on the bay side and one-third on the lake side) reported having some type(s) of shore protection, such as retaining walls (most common), rock rip rap, and sand and gravel fills. The average cost shore protection was $1,003 on the lake side and $2,365 on the bay side, or about 1.9% and 4.5%, respectively, of reported property values. Some respondents said that their shore protection was damaged by high water during 1985-86.
<p>
Property owners had very little protection from flood problems. Very few had federal flood insurance. Many buildings could not quality for the National Flood Insurance Program without adequate flood-proofing measures. About one-third of the respondents used sump pumps as their only protection against having standing water in their basements.
<H3>Protecting Minnesota Point Sand Dunes</H3>
Most of the Minnesota's Lake Superior shore consists of rock and red clay. The vast sandy beach of Minnesota Point is not common. For traditional solutions to coastal erosion caused by wave action, refer to the references. The erosion protection information presented here is for sandy areas that are subject to wind erosion. This is a problem on the lake side of Minnesota Point.
<p>
Sand dunes act as buffers to erosion. The dunes are dynamic; they shift and move. When the dunes are intact, they form a physical barrier, a dune line or dune field, which acts like a sea wall by providing protection from wind and waves. Breaks in the dune line expose low lying back areas to potential damage from strong winds coming off Lake Superior.
<p>
Shifts in dunes and breaks in dune line can occur in just a few hours. If a blow hole forms in a dune line, unto 3,000 cubic feet of sand can shift during a single storm.
<p>
Vegetation can help prevent dune erosion. Therefore, revegetation of dunded areas is important  in stabilizing windblown sand. As the plants grow, their roots hold the sand in place and their tops decrease the wind velocity at the soil line, thus reducing sand movement.
<p>
It is a challenge to establish vegetation in sand. Plants should be mulched, watered, and fertilized for the first year. Plants that grow naturally on dunes will  give the best results.
<p>
In a 1981 demonstration by Minnesota Sea Grant, dune grass was the number one choice for use in revegetation. Other plants that did well in the sandy environment were red osier dogwood, Siberian peashurb, hedge cotneaster, tartarian honeysuckle, eastern ninebark, common lilac, box elder, jack pine, and other plants already common on Minnesota Point.
<p>
Dunes are extremely important in controlling wind erosion on Minnesota Point. To protect the dunes, it is essential to control pedestrian traffic and prohibit the use of vehicles.
<p>
If it is necessary to cross dunes, the use of designated trails with boardwalks or bark mulch can minimize damage. To be successful, such efforts will require community involvement and CO-operation between citizens, the Parks and Recreation Department, and the Police Department.
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
Minnesota Point is subject to both erosion and coastal flooding problems. The lake side has more dune loss and shore erosion because its long fetch allows greater wave action. They bay side has more flooding because of its lower elevation and smaller setbacks.
<p>
Properly designed shore protection structures may be necessary to prevent wave-induced erosion. Vegetation and community-based conservation practices can help prevent wind erosion.
<p>
Lake Superior water levels will continue to go through periodic fluctuations. Residents of Minnesota Point should acknowledge the inevitability of such fluctuations and plan accordingly.
<p>
Sump pumps are the only flood-proofing measure commonly used on Minnesota Point. Other flood-proofing techniques are available. Further information can be obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. See references.

<Caption>History of Minnesota Point</Caption>
<TC>
<TD>
<b>Important Dates:</B><p>
1679 - the first visit by a European, Greysolon Sieur DuLhut<br>
1854 - signing of the treaty of LaPointe, which transferred ownership fo Minnesota Point from the Chapewa to the U.S. Government.<br>
1858 - Completion of the first lighthouse on Lake Superior<br>
1897 - Opening of Minnesota Point's first Coast Guard station<br>
1905 - Construction of the original bridge to Minnesota Point.<p>
Because of its location, Minnesota Point became a transportation center for shipping by vessel and rail. A trading post and dock were built in 1852. By 1870, there were wharves and docks on both sides of Minnesota Point. The natural channel between the lake and the harbor was in Superior, Wisconsin, but some Duluthians wanted a channel of their own.
</TD>
</TC>

<TD>
<b>Creation of Duluth Entry:</B><p>
<blockquote>
"The channel was not a good one. Duluth had only one opinion...that we should cut a new channel through Minnesota Point close to our city, but at this suggestion Superior set up a cry that this would ruin the existing channel with mud and slit.
<p>
I was engaged by the citizens of Duluth to dig channel.<p>
We began work on a Saturday and by night Superior knew what we were about. At once the people over there began  to scurry around to get a Federal injunction restraining us. I hired a gang of several hundred men... and we worked all that day and far into the night...When the Superior people came over Monday morning there was the channel open and they couldn't do anything."<p>
</blockquote>
R.S. Munger, 1871, from the <I>History of Duluth</I> by Woodbridge and Pardee, as cited in "Park Point," edited by Mrs. John Soetebier.

<font size=8>E</font>xotic species are on the move. Zebra mussels, ruffe, spiny water fleas, and milfoil are four destructive and aggressive invader species looking for a ride to a new lake or river. These pests are easily transported by people, boats, and fishing gear.<p>

It takes only one mistake by one boater to infest a lake or river. Don't be the one!<p>

<H3>ZEBRA MUSSELS</H3>
Zebra mussels are fingernail-size clams with yellowish or brownish shells marked with wavy bands. Their larvae are too small to be seen, but they live for weeks in any water left in your boat. As zebra mussels grow, they form clumps that damage your boat, kill native clams, foul beaches with stinky razor-sharp shells, and clog water intake pipes.
<H3>RUFFE</H3>
The ruffe is a cool or cold water fish from northern Europe that resembles yellow perch. In just a few years, it has become the dominant species in Minnesota's St. Louis River and has spread to other parts of Lake Superior. The ruffe is a fierce competitor for food and habitat. As its numbers increase, other species are expected to decline.
<H3>SPINY WATER FLEA OR B.C</H3>
Spiny water fleas - also called B.C. after their latin name - are large zooplankton found in all the Great Lakes and several inland lakes. Although they are less than one-half inch long, B.C. compete with small fish for food and can disrupt the ecosystem. When B.C. collect on fishing line, they look like bristly gobs of jelly with black spots.
<H3>EURASIAN WATER MILFOIL</H3>
Milfoil is a plant with long, flexible stems with feather-like leaves attached in whorls of four. Milfoils grows and spreads so fast, it quickly chokes out native plants and harms fish habitat. It grows in thick mats, ruining lakes for boating, fishing, and swimming.<p>

<H3>WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE, CAN HURT!</H3>	
Prevent the spread of these pests with a thorough inspection of your boat and fishing gear.
<H3>BEFORE YOU USE YOUR BOAT IN ANOTHER LAKE OR RIVER:</H3>
<b>Clean your boat</b><br>
Clean all mud and plant matter from your boat, trailer, propeller, live will and anchors before leaving the landing. Even canoes should be checked inside and out.<p>
<b>Dry or wash your boat and fishing equipment</b><br>
Drain live wells, bait buckets, and bilge areas. Let your boat and trailer dry in the sun for at least three days before you use it again in another lake or river. <b>Or</b> wash your boat and equipment with very hot water (at least 105 degrees F). Make sure tackle and fishing line are free of B.C. eggs.<p>

<H3>Zebra Mussel ALERT</H3>
The barnacle-like zebra mussel poses a multibillion threat to North America's industrial, agricultural and municipal water supplies, and it could become a costly nuisance for freshwater shipping, boating, fishing, and claming as well. First found in 1988 in the Great Lakes, this invader could become more widespread than the German carp and cause far more economic damage than Mediterranean fruit fly.<p>

<H3>How to Identify It</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Zebra mussels look like small clams with a yellowish or brownish "D"-shaped shell, usually with dark and ligh-colored stripes (hence the name "zebra").
<LI>They can be up to two inches long, but most are under an inch. Zebra mussels usually grow in clusters containing numerous individuals (see photo) and are generally found in shallow (6-30 feet), algae-rich water.
<LI>Zebra mussels are the ONLY freshwater mollusc that can firmly attach itself to solid objects - submerged rocks, dock pilings, boat hulls, water intake pipes, etc.

<H2>Closing the door on invaders</H2></Center>
<HR size=3%>
	Tough new ballast water exchange restrictions may have 
closed the door on a harmful new exotic species. 
<p> 
	The amphipod, Gmelinoides fasciatus, also known as the 
zebra amphipod, has spread from Lake Baikal to the Russian 
port of St. Petersburg -- a port with plenty of cross traffic 
to the Great Lakes.
<p>
	Sea Grant Extension educator Jeff Gunderson discovered 
this potential invader during a recent trip to Russia.  He is 
working with Russian scientist, Dr. Vadim E. Panov of the St. 
Petersburg Zoological Institute, to make information on this 
and other species of concern available in English.
	How this species made its way out of its native habitat 
and into an area where it could be picked up and transported 
to North America is an interesting case study of how exotics 
spread, said Gunderson.

</Table>
</Center><p>
	Gmelinoides was introduced from Lake Baikal into a few 
northern Russian lakes in the early 1970s to provide a fast- 
growing food source for fish.  Within a decade, this invader 
made its way out of those lakes through streams and 
eventually found its way into Lake Ladoga, a very large deep 
lake just north of the port of St. Petersburg. 
<p>
	Another factor that is sure to cause this species to 
spread is that Russian entrepreneurs, hungry for new business 
opportunities, are now harvesting Gmelinoides for use as live 
fish food in the European aquarium market.  That means, 
according to Russian scientists, that it is only a matter of 
time before this species spreads throughout Europe.
<p>
	As with other successful invaders, like the zebra 
mussel, ruffe or B.c., Gmelinoides grow quickly, reproduce 
quickly, and crowd out native species.  
<p>
	"Hopefully, the Great Lakes have closed the door to this 
potential introduction in time," said Gunderson.
<p>
	This summer, U.S. and Canadian authorities began 
enforcing a policy that requires shippers to exchange their 
freshwater ballast on the high seas to kill any potential 
invading freshwater organisms. 

<H3>Russians have lots of ruffe info</H3>
	The ruffe, an agressive invading fish species from 
Russia, is causing lots of problems in the western end of 
Lake Superior.  Scientists here are scrambling to learn as 
much as they can about the ruffe in hopes that effective 
controls can be developed before it spreads to the other 
Great Lakes.
<p>
	During a recent trip to Russia, Sea Grant Extension 
educator Jeff Gunderson met Ryzkov, director of the Fisheries 
Industry Research Institute in Petrozavodsk State University, 
who told Gunderson that there is a significant amount of 
research on ruffe described in Russian literature.  Kutuzov 
told Gunderson that he is willing to compile an English 
bibliography of Russian research literature on the ruffe. 
<p> 
	Sea Grant is working with Russian scientists to 
translate this information and make it available to North 
American researchers.  Knowing how this fish behaves in its 
native habitat is important to understanding how it is acting 
differently here, said Gunderson.

<Title>ZEBRA MUSSELS THREATEN INLAND WATERS</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">

<H2>ZEBRA MUSSELS THREATEN INLAND WATERS</H2></Center>
	Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were first 
discovered in the Great Lakes in 1988.  Within one year, 
zebra mussels colonized nearly every firm object in Lake 
Erie. Zebra mussels quickly spread to all the Great Lakes. 
<p>
	Expansion to inland waters continues at an alarming 
rate.  For example, in 1992 zebra mussels made their way out 
of Lake Michigan into the Mississippi River basin via the 
Chicago Sanitary Shipping Canal--an artificial channel that 
links the Great Lakes drainage basin with the watershed 
drained by the Mississippi River.  At the end of the 1992 
season, zebra mussels were being found in isolated pockets 
from Minneapolis to St. Louis.

<H3>ZEBRA MUSSEL HISTORY</H3>
	Zebra mussels have been in western and central European 
waterways for nearly 200 years.  While we can learn a lot 
from looking at how zebra mussels behave in Europe, zebra 
mussels face a different ecosystem in North America.  
Comparisons and predictions based on European experience may 
not be accurate. 
<p>
<center>
<Table border=2>
<TD>
<img align=center src="/images/ruffe-zm/zm1_sm.jpeg" alt="zebra mussel picture">
</TD>
</Table>
</Center><p>
	Zebra mussels are native to western Russia, near the 
Caspian Sea.  Canals built during the late 1700s allowed the 
mussel to spread throughout eastern Europe.  During the 
1800s, canals were built across the rest of Europe.  The 
canals made shipping easier but also allowed rapid expansion 
of the zebra mussels range.  By the 1830s the mussels had 
covered much of Europe and Britain.
<p>
	Successful introduction of zebra mussels into the Great 
Lakes probably occurred in 1985 or 1986 when one or more 
transoceanic ships discharged ballast water into Lake St. 
Clair.  The freshwater ballast, picked up in a European port, 
contained zebra mussel larvae and possibly juveniles.  Being 
a temperate, freshwater species, they found the plankton-rich 
Lakes St.Clair and Erie to their liking.
<p>
<H3>ZEBRA MUSSEL BIOLOGY</H3>
	The mussel's reproductive cycle is one key to its rapid 
spread and high abundance.  Egg production starts when water 
temperature warms to about 54 degrees F.  A fully mature 
female mussel may produce several hundred thousand eggs per 
season.<p>
	Eggs are fertilized outside the mussel's body and within 
a few days develop into free-swimming larvae called veligers.  
Veligers remain suspended in the water from three to four 
weeks, drifting with the currents.  If they don't settle onto 
firm objects, they die.  In fact, most do.  Those that find a 
hard surface quickly attach themselves and transform into the 
typical, double shelled mussel shape.  Within a year, a zebra 
mussel can grow up to an inch and become sexually mature. 
European studies report mussels may live four to six years, 
but in lake Erie three years seems to be the maximum, and the 
average is much less. <p>
	Zebra mussels generate a tuft of fibers known as a 
byssus, or byssal threads, from a gland in the foot.  The 
byssus protrudes between the two halves of the shell. These 
threads attach to hard surfaces with a powerful glue that 
anchors the mussels in place.  Small juveniles can actually 
break away from their attachments and generate new, buoyant 
threads that allow them again to drift with the currents and 
find a new home.<p>
	Any hard surface that is not toxic can be colonized by 
zebra mussels--rock, metal, wood, vinyl, glass, rubber, 
fiberglass, paper, plants, other mussels. Beds of zebra 
mussels in some areas of Lake Erie contain between 30,000 and 
70,000 mussels per square meter.<p>
	Zebra mussels can become established regardless of 
depth, light intensity or even winter temperature.  Colonies 
grow rapidly wherever oxygen and particulate food is 
available and water currents are not too swift--generally 
less than six feet per second.  Colonies are rare in wave-
washed zones except for sheltered nooks and crevices.  In 
most European lakes the greatest densities are at depths 
ranging from 6 to 45 feet.<p>
	Zebra mussels also colonize soft, muddy bottoms.  Hard 
objects, such as pieces of native mussel shells, act as a 
base for settling veligers.  As a few mussels begin to grow, 
they serve as substrate for additional colonization.  In this 
way, extensive mats of zebra mussels can form on soft lake 
and river bottoms.

<H3>ZEBRA MUSSELS ALTER THE ENVIRONMENT</H3>
	Zebra mussels are filter feeders.  They strain water for 
the food they need.  Unused food is bound with mucous into a 
pellet called pseudofeces which is ejected.
	Each adult zebra mussel can filter about one liter of 
water per day.  Nearly all particulate matter, including 
phytoplankton and some small forms of zooplankton are 
removed.  These microscopic plants and animals are the base 
of the food chain.  Small fish such as young sportfish or 
forage fish, depend on this food for survival and growth.  
The long-term consequences of removing so much food from the 
environment is still being studied.
<p>
	Scientists and boaters saw a great increase in water 
clarity in Lake Erie between 1989 and 1991.  Shallow bays are 
being recolonized by rooted, aquatic plants since sunlight 
can now penetrate.  Much of this change has been attributed 
to zebra mussels.
<p>
	Native North American mussels have suffered greatly as a 
result of being encrusted with zebra mussels.  Sometimes 
several thousand zebra mussels are found on a single native 
mussel.  In Lakes St. Clair and Erie, zebra mussels have 
severely reduced populations of native mussels.  Some mussel 
species in the St. Croix River are very rare and are 
officially listed as endangered.  As zebra mussels spread, 
biologists are concerned that these species face imminent 
extinction.

<H3>ZEBRA MUSSELS AFFECT INDUSTRY AND RECREATION</H3>
	Because zebra mussels prefer hard surfaces at moderate 
water depth, water intake structures such as those used by 
power plants and city treatment plants, are susceptible to 
clogging by zebra mussels.  In fact, since 1989, some 
facilities located on Lake Erie have reported big reductions 
in pumping capacity and occasional shutdowns caused by 
encrusted zebra mussels. 
<p>
	Recreational users of water infested with zebra mussels 
can also be affected.  Unprotected docks, breakwalls, boat 
bottoms, and engine outdrives can provide the hard surface 
zebra mussels need to colonize and grow.  In Lakes Erie and 
St. Clair there were numerous reports of boat engines 
overheating because cooling water inlets were clogged by 
zebra mussels.  Boaters need to make frequent inspections of 
these areas in the future.  Anti-fouling paints containing 
copper or tin are effective in preventing zebra mussel 
buildup, but their use is banned in Michigan, and restricted 
in other states (contact your state's Department of 
Agriculture)because they can harm other aquatic life. 

<H3>WHAT'S BEING DONE TO STOP ZEBRA MUSSELS?</H3>
	Zebra mussel can spread to inland waters either as 
veligers transported in water, or as adults attached to boat 
hulls, engines, bait traps, or on other items. Veligers don't 
survive drying but they can survive in any small pool of 
water. Adult zebra mussels can close their shells and survive 
drying for several days.  In moist environments they can 
survive out of the water even longer.

	The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 
cooperation with Minnesota Sea Grant and the Bell Museum of 
Natural History has published a handy field guide to Exotic 
Species with this checklist to help you prevent the spread of 
zebra mussels and other exotic species from one body of water 
to another:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Remove plants and animals from your boat, trailer, 
and accessory equipment (anchors, centerboards, trailer 
hitch, wheels, rollers, cables, and axles) before leaving the 
water access area.
<LI>Drain your livewells, bilge water, and transom wells 
before leaving the water access area.
<LI>Empty your bait bucket on land, never into the water.  
Never dip your bait or minnow bucket into one lake if it has 
water in it from another.  And never dump live fish from one 
water body into other waters.
<LI>Wash your boat, tackle, downriggers, and trailer with 
hot water when you get home.  Flush water through your 
motor's cooling system and other boat parts that normally get 
wet.  If possible, let everything dry for three days before 
transporting your boat to another body of water.  
<LI>Learn what these organisms look like.  If you suspect 
a new infestation of an exotic plant or animal, report it to 
your Department of Natural Resources.
<LI>Check with the DNR for recommendations and permits 
before you try to control or eradicate an exotic "pest."  
Remember, exotic species thrive on disturbance.  Do-it-
yourself control treatments often make matters worse and can 
harm native species.

<H3>The Ruffe</H3>
The Eurasian ruffe (rhymes with tough) may pose a serious ecological threat to water environments and to sport and commercial fishing. This invader may compete with native fish for food and habitat. First reported in western Lake Superior in 1986, the ruffe population has rapidly increased  in the St. Louis River at Duluth-Superior and spread to other rivers and bays along the south shore of western Lake Superior. <P>

<Center><A HREF="/images/ruffe-zm/ruffe1.jpeg">
<img align=center src="/images/ruffe-zm/ruffe1_sm.jpeg"></A></Center><p>

There is a great concern over the potential for the ruffe to expand  its range in North American waters. Early detection of isolated populations may help slow or restrict the spread of the Eurasian ruffe. Your help is vital to prevent the spread of ruffe and to report new sightings. <p>
<H3>What You Can Do</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Learn to identify the ruffe (see picture below). If you catch a ruffe outside the Duluth area of Lake Superior or the St. Louis estuary, kill it, freeze it, and call the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Exotic Species Program in St. Paul, <B>1-800-766-600</B>, or <B> (612) 296-2385</B>, a local DNR fishery office, or Minnesota Sea Grant Extension in Duluth, <B> (218) 726-8712. Minnesota prohibits transportation of live ruffe. <I>Do not throw it back alive!</I></B>
<LI>Always drain your livewells, bilge water, and transom wells before leaving the water access.
<LI>Never empty your bait bucket into the water, always empty it on land.

<H2>RUFFE</H2>
<H3>A new threat to our fisheries</H3>
</Center>
The ruffe (pronounced ruff), is a small but aggressive fish species native to Eurasia. It was introduced into Lake Superior in the mid-1980s in the ballast water of an ocean-going vessel. 
<p>
Because the ruffe grows very fast, has a high reproductive capacity, and adapts to a wide variety of environments, it is considered a serious threat to commercial and sport fishing.  It also has the potential to seriously disrupt the delicate predator/prey balance vital to sustaining a healthy fishery.
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_3.gif" border=2>
<H3>Effects of the ruffe on other species</H3>

Explosive growth of the ruffe population means less food and space in the ecosystem for other fish with similar diets and feeding habits.  Because of this, walleye, perch, and a number of small forage fish species are seriously threatened by continued expansion of the ruffes range.  
<p>
While it is too early to tell exactly how the ruffe will affect other fish in the St. Louis River, Duluth/Superior harbor area of Lake Superior, its numbers have increased dramatically while other species, especially emerald shiner, yellow perch and troutperch, have declined (See Graph 1).  It would be easy to blame all of these changes on the ruffe, but some could be the result of natural fluctuations, fishing pressure, or fisheries management practices. 

<H3>How fast is the ruffe spreading?</H3>

The ruffe was first collected in the Duluth/Superior harbor area of Lake Superior in 1986 during a routine analysis of the local fishery.   The first official identification of ruffe was in 1987, but it was probably introduced about 1985.  In the short time since its introduction, the ruffe has become the most numerous fish in the St. Louis River, as measured by trawl samples.  As of 1993, the ruffe has spread east along Lake Superiors coast to Chequamegon Bay in northern Wisconsin, and north to Thunder Bay, Ontario. Ruffe probably moved across the lake to Thunder Bay via intralake ballast exchange.   So far, Lake Superior is the only place the ruffe is found in the Western Hemisphere.  Ruffes ability to move from lake to lake in ships ballast, however, will make it difficult to prevent the fish from expanding its range to the lower Great Lakes.  

<H3>Control strategies in the St. Louis River.</H3>

Fisheries managers first tried to control ruffe by increasing the number of its predators, especially walleye and northern pike.  They did this by limiting sport catches of these species, and stocking walleye and northern pike.  Early results of the predator stocking program have been disappointing, but it is too early to judge the effectiveness of this approach since fish often take several years to switch to a new food source.
<p>
Researchers analyzed stomach samples of the predators and found very few ruffe in walleye stomachs.  Bullheads appear to be the only species that consistently eat ruffe.  Research suggests that predators stocked to control ruffe may not eat them because they prefer soft-rayed shiners and small hard-rayed fish like darters and young perch.  This could explain the increase in ruffe and reduction in these forage species.
<p>
Recent surveys of northern pike stomachs, however, suggest that ruffe may be growing in importance as a food source.  Ruffe made up less than one percent of fish eaten by northern pike in 1989.  By 1992, the figure had climbed to 15 percent.
<p>
The battle to keep the ruffe from spreading is being fought on several fronts.  For instance, poison may be used to eradicate ruffe when the fish is found in small numbers at a new location.   Poisoning was considered for areas where the ruffe is firmly entrenched, but was ruled out.  As one researcher said, "The cost would have been staggering, and it probably would have failed.  All it takes is one pair of ruffe to survive and the problem starts all over again."  
<p>
Chemical controls that kill ruffe but leave other species unharmed are being sought.  For instance, researchers are exploring the possibility that the ruffe is susceptible to low doses of the lampricide TFM, a chemical that in low doses kills lamprey but not other fish.  Recent field tests have shown that treating streams with TFM for lamprey control kills a high percentage of the ruffe.  TFM, however, is only registered for use on lamprey.  Fisheries managers have also considered a program to net and destroy as many ruffe as possible in the St. Louis River, on the theory that the ruffes range would not expand as rapidly if populations were controlled.  
<p>
Fisheries managers will plan eradication and control measures for Lake Superior rivers and streams on a case by case basis. The overall goal, however, is to contain ruffe to the western part of Lake Superior.  To keep ruffe from spreading to the other Great Lakes, the Lake Carriers Association developed voluntary guidelines for handling ballast water in Great Lakes ships.  Under these new guidelines, ships going to other Great Lakes are required to exchange ballast in deep (at least 240 feet) water west of a demarcation line between Onton-agon, Michigan and Grand Portage, Minnesota and at least five miles from the south shore of Lake Superior.

<H3>What do we know about ruffe?</H3>

Because ruffe are so new to North America, fisheries managers rely on European studies that describe their life cycle and habits.  Even with these data, it is difficult to predict how an exotic species will act in a new environment.
<p>
In Europe, the ruffe generally matures in two or three years, but it may mature in one year in warmer waters.  It spawns between mid-April and July, depending on location, water temperature, and preferred habitat.  A female ruffe lives an average of seven years, but may live up to 11 years.  Males live up to seven years but have an average lifespan of three to five years. 
<p>
The ruffes range includes northeastern France, England, the rivers entering the Baltic and White Seas, most of Siberia, and the Baltic Sea.  Before coming to North America, the ruffes most recent expansion was to Loch Lomond, Scotland where it may have been responsible for dramatic declines in the local perch population (See Graph 2). 

<H3>A hearty species</H3>

The ruffe can thrive in a wide range of temperatures and habitat.  The ruffe has a faster first year growth rate than most of its competitors. It starts reproducing at age two or three, but can reproduce after the first year in warmer waters.  An average female can produce 13,000 to 200,000 eggs per season.  Due in part to its hearty reproductive rate, ruffe populations can explode quickly.
<p>
In Europe, the ruffe is found in fresh and brackish (salinity less than 3-5 ppm) waters and in all types of lakesfrom deep, cold, and clear to shallow, warm and full of nutrients.  In rivers, the ruffe prefers slower-moving water; in lakes, it prefers turbid areas and soft bottoms, usually without vegetation.
<p>
Unlike other perch species, the ruffe is more tolerant of murky, nutrient-rich (eutrophic), conditions (See Graph 3).  Like walleye, the ruffe spends its days in deeper water and moves to the shallows to feed at night.
<p>
To avoid predators, the ruffe prefers darkness. Although it has poor eyesight, the ruffes head has a well developed system of bone canals that contain sensory organs called neuromasts.  Such organs are common among perch species in early life stages, but they tend to atrophy as the fish reach adulthood.  In adult ruffe, however, these sensory organs continue to detect water vibrations given off by both predators and prey.

<H3>Do ruffe eat other fish's eggs?</H3>

In Europe, the ruffe is known to eat other fishs eggs, but its main diet consists of small water insects and larvae found primarily in the bottom (benthic) layer of the water column.  In the St. Louis River, an important hatchery area for many Lake Superior fish, ruffe stomach samples reveal few fish eggs. But the ruffe is an opportunistic feeder and will eat almost anything.  So far, the ruffe seems to have the same basic diet of insects and larvae it has in its native Eurasian environment.  While fish eggs do not seem to be part of the ruffes regular diet in the St. Louis River, thats no guarantee fish eggs wont be part of the ruffes diet in other North American habitats. 

<H3>The "bottleneck effect"</H3>

Whether ruffe feed on fish eggs may be less important than whether ruffe eat the food preferred by other fish.  Because of its sheer numbers, and the variety of food it eats, the ruffe will reduce food sources for many fish species.  If the ruffe, in turn, is not eaten by native predatorsor if young predator fish starve before they get big enough to eat ruffe, the result will be an explosion of ruffe and population bottlenecks in other species. 
<p>
For example, recently hatched yellow perch must consume large amounts of plankton in a fairly short time in order to grow to the next stage.  At stage two, yellow perch must eat larger food items  small crustaceans and insects  abundant near the bottom of the water column.  Only after passing these two hurdles do  yellow perch get big enough to eat other fish.  If the ruffe interrupts either growth stage by reducing the food supply just as the yellow perch need it (an ecological bottleneck), the yellow perch population will crash.   

<H3>What you can do to slow the spread of ruffe</H3>

Because ruffe could easily spread to inland waters, the Minnesota and Wisconsin departments of natural resources enforce regulations that make it illegal to transport ruffe, dead or alive.
The ruffe cannot be used as bait by anglers, and bait dealers who trap in areas infested with ruffe should take special precautions to insure they are not contributing to the spread of this exotic species.
<img align=right src="/images/ruffe-zm/ruffe1_sm.jpeg" border=2>
<p>
The ruffe is one of a number of exotic species causing concern in the Great Lakes region. You can help prevent the spread of exotic species with a thorough inspection of your boat and fishing gear.  Clean all mud and plant matter from your boat, trailer, propeller, live well and anchors before leaving the landing.  Even canoes should be checked inside and out.
<p>
Drain live wells, bait buckets, and bilge areas.  Inspect and clean fishing tackle.  Let your boat and trailer dry in the sun for at least three days before your use it again in another lake or river.  Or, wash your boat with very hot water (at least 105 degrees F).  	

<H3>Ruffe are a threat to fisheries</H3>

Predicting the effect of any exotic species on its new home is difficult.  The ruffe is no exception.  Experience in Scotland and Russia, however, points to serious problems for North American fisheries if ruffe escapes from its limited range in western Lake Superior.  In Loch Lomond, Scotland, native perch populations declined dramatically when the ruffe was introduced.  In some Russian waters, the ruffe has harmed whitefish populations by preying heavily on whitefish eggs.  Movement of the ruffe to the lower Great Lakes, or to inland lakes and rivers could have devastating consequences.  

<H3>What does a ruffe look like?</H3>

The ruffe is a small fish that resembles a yellow perch with walleye markings.  In fact, it is a member of the perch family. An adult ruffe is about five to six inches long.  It rarely exceeds 10 inches in length.  At first glance, ruffe can resemble young walleye, yellow perch, johnny darter, or troutperch, but there are ways to tell the difference.  
<p>
The most obvious differences are the ruffes large, continuous dorsal fin and its slightly downturned mouth.  Other distinguishing characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>size:  ruffe are small, adults average 4-6 inches in length

<LI>color:  color and markings are similar to walleye.
The average ruffe is 4-6 inches long 
The ruffe is a member of the 
perch family, so...

<LI>it has spiny dorsal and anal fins

<LI>it has two fins on top, the front fin has hard and sharp spines (also called rays), the back fin has soft rays.  
<img align=right src="/images/ruffe-zm/ruffe2_sm.jpeg" border=2>
and
</UL>
The ruffe is different from other perch because...
<UL>
<LI>it has a very large dorsal fin, joined together, front and back The front part of this large dorsal fin has 11-16 spines.

<LI>it has a slightly downturned mouth

<LI>it has no scales on its head
</UL>
Dont mistake ruffe for troutperch.  Troutperch are a softrayed fish with a single top fin, and are smaller than ruffe.

<H3>Exotic Introductions</H3>
"Exotic" species - organisms introduced into habitats where they are not native - are severe world-wide agents of habitat alteration and degradation. A major cause of biological diversity loss throughout the world, they are considered "biological pollutants."
<p>
Introducing species accidentally or intentionally, from one habitat into another, is a risky business. Freed from predators, parasites, pathogens, and competitors that have kept their numbers in check, species introduced into new habitats often overrun their new home and crowd out native species. In the presence of enough food and a favorable environment, their numbers will explode. Once established, exotics rarely can be eliminated.
<P>
Most species introductions are the work of humans. Some introductions, such as carp and purple loosestrife, are intentional and do unexpected damage. But many exotic introductions are harmful to recreation and ecosystems. They have even caused the extinction of native species - especially those of confined habitats such as islands and aquatic ecosystems.

<p>
The recent development of fast ocean freighters has greatly increased the risk of new exotics in the Great Lakes region. Ships take on ballast water in Europe for stability during the ocean crossing. The water is pumped out when the ships pick up their loads in Great Lake Ports. Because the ships make the crossing so much faster now, and harbors are often less polluted, more exotic species are likely to survive the journey and thrive in the new waters.
<p>
Many of the plants and animals described in this guide arrived in the Great Lakes this way. But they are now being spread throughout the continent's interior in and on boats and other recreational watercraft and equipment. <b>This guide is designed to help water recreationalists recognize these exotics and help stop their further spread.</B>
<H3>Midwest Aquatic Exotics</H3>
<B>Common Carp</B> (<I>Cyprinus carpio</I>)are domesticated ancestors of a wild form native to the Caspian Sea region and east Asia. Carp degrade shallow lakes by causing excessive turbidity which can lead to declines in waterfowl and important native fish species.<p>
<b>Sea Lamprey </b> (<I>Petromyzon marinus</I>) are predceous, eel-like fish native to the coastal regions of both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. They entered the Great Lakes thorough the Welland Canal about 1921. They contributed greatly to the decline of whitefish and lake trout in the Great Lakes.
<p>
<b>Rusty Crayfish</b>  (</I>Orconectes rusticus</I>)are native to streams in the Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee region. Spread by anglers who use them as bait, rusty crayfish are prolific and can severely reduce lake and stream vegetation, depriving native fish and their prey of cover and food. They also reduce native crayfish populations.
<p>
<b>White perch</B> (</I>Morone americana</I>) are native to Atlantic coastal regions and invaded the Great Lakes through the Eire and Welland canals. Prolific competitors of native fish species, white perch are believed to have the potential to cause declines of Great Lakes walleye populations.<p>
<b>Flowering rush</b> (<I>Buttons ambulates</I>)
 is a perennial plant from Europe and Asia that was introduced in the Midwest as an ornamental plant. It grows in shallow areas of lakes as an emergent, and as a submersed form in water up to 10 feet deep. Its dense stands crowd out native species like bulrush. The emergent form has pink, umbellateshaped flowers, and is 3 feet tall with triangular-shaped stems.
<p>
<b>Curly-leaf pondweed</b> (<I>Potamogeton crispus</I>) is an exotic plant that forms surface mats that interfere with aquatic recreation. The plant usually drops to the lake bottom by early July. Curly-leaf pondweed was the most severe nusiance aquatic plant in the Midwest until Eurasian watermilfoil appeared. It was accidentally introduced along with the common carp. It has been here so long, that most people are not aware it is an exotic.
<p>
<center><H2>Zebra Mussel</H2>
<H4><I>Dreissena polymorpha</I></H4></Center>
Zebra mussels are small, fingernail-sized mussels native to the Caspian Sea region of Asia. They were discovered in Lake St. Clair near Detroit in 1988. Tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions, zebra mussels have now spread to parts of all he Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and are showing up in inland lakes. Zebra mussels clog water-intake systems of power plant and water treatment facilities, and the cooling systems of boat engines. They have severely reduced, and may eliminate native mussel species.
<p>
Female zebra mussels can produce as many as 1 million eggs per year. These develop into microscopic, free-swimming larvae (called veligers) that quickly begin  to form shells. At about three weeks, the sand grain-sized larvae start to settle and attach to any firm surface using "byssal threads". They will cover rock, gravel, metal,  rubber, wood, crayfish, native mussels, and each other.
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_2.gif" border=2>
<p>
Zebra Mussels filter plankton from the surrounding water. Each mussel can filter about one quart of lake water per day. However, not all of what they remove is eaten. What they don't eat is combined with mucus as "pseudofeces" and discharge onto the lake bottom where it accumulates. This material may benefit bottom feeders while reducing the plankton food chain for upper water species.
<p>
Diving ducks and the freshwater drum eat zebra mussels, but will not significantly control them.
<p>
<H3>Likely means of spread:</H3> Microscopic larvae may be carried in livewells or bilgewater. Adults can attach to boats or boating equipment that sit in the water.

<Center><H2>Ruffe</H2> <H4><I>Gymnocephalus cernuus</I></H4></Center>
<p>
The ruffe is a small European member of the perch family that is native to central and eastern Europe. It was introduced to Duluth harbor, probably in tanker ballast water, around 1985, and is spreading to other rivers and bays around Lake Superior.
<p>
In Europe, the ruffe is a pest species in newly invaded areas. In a Scottish lake it displaced the native perch population, and in lakes in Russia, it has significantly reduced whitefish populations.
<p>
In the St. Louis River near Duluth, populations of yellow perch, emerald shiners, and other forage fish caught in survey trawls have declined dramatically as numbers of ruffe have increased.
<p>
The ruffes ability to displace other species in newly invaded areas is due to:
<OL>
<LI>its high reproductive rate
<LI>its feeding efficiency across a wide range of environmental conditions, and 
<LI>characteristics that may discourage would-be predators such as walleye and pike.
</OL>
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_3.gif" border=2>
Ruffe grow rapidly and can reproduce in their first year. In the St. Louis River, females can lay between 45,000 and 90,000 eggs a year. Ruffe are primarily bottom feeders, preferring dark environments where they can hide from predators. Ruffe rarely grow bigger than 5 inches, although the sharp spines on their gill covers, dorsal and anal fins make them difficult for larger fish to eat.

<H3>Likely means of spread:</H3>
Ruffe could be accidentally transported in livewells, bilge water, bait buckets, and in the ballast water of Great Lakes freighters.
<Center><H2>Spiny Water Flea</H2>
<H4><I>Bythotrephes cederstroemi</I></H4></Center><p>
The spiny water flea, or "B.C.", is not an insect at all, but a tiny (less than half an inch long) crustacean with a long, sharp, barbed tail spine. A native of Great Britain and northern Europe east to the Caspian Sea, the animal was first found in Lake Huron in 1984 - probably imported in the ballast water of a trans-oceanic freighter. Since then, populations have exploded and the animal can now be found throughout the Great Lakes and in some inland lakes.
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_4.gif" border=2>
<p>
No one is really sure what affect spiny water fleas will have on the ecosystems of the Great lakes region. But resource managers are worried, because the animals may compete directly with young perch and other small fish or food, such as <I>Daphnia</I> zooplankton.
<p>
Spiny water fleas also reproduce rapidly. During warm summer conditions each female can produce up to 10 offspring every two weeks. As temperatures drop in the fall, eggs are produced that can lie dormant all winter.
<p>
High numbers would not pose a problem if spiny water fleas were heavily consumed by predators. But its sharp spine makes it extremely hard for small fish to eat, leaving only some large fish to feed them. As a result, spiny water flea populations remain high while populations of plankton, which they eat, have declined.
<p>
<H3>Likely means of spread</H3>
Spiny water flea eggs and adults may wind up unseen in bilge water, bait buckets, livewells. Also, fishing lines and downriggers will often be coated with both eggs and adults.

<Center><H2>Eurasian Watermilfoil</H2><H4><I>Myriophyllum spicatum</I></H4></center><p>
Eurasian watermilfoil was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Spread westward into inland lakes primarily by boats and also by waterbirds, it reached midwestern states between  the1950s and 1980s.
<p>
In nutrient-rich lakes it can form think underwater sands of tangled stems and vast mats of vegetation at water's surface. In shallow areas the plant can interfere with water recreation such as boating, fishing, and swimming. The plant's floating canopy can also crowd out important native water plants.
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_5.gif" border=2>
<p>
A key factor in the plant's success is its ability to reproduce through stem fragmentation and underground runners. A single segment of stem and leaves can take root and form a new colony. Fragments clinging to boats and trailers can spread the plant from lake to lake. The mechanical clearing of weed beds for beaches, docks, and landing creates thousands of new stem fragments. Removing native vegetation creates perfect habitat for invading Eurasian watermilfoil.
<H3>Likely means of spread</H3>
Milfoil may become entangled in boat propellers, and may wrap around other external parts of the boat. Stems can become lodged among any watercraft apparatus or sports equipment that moves through the water, including boat trailers.

<Center><H2>Purple loosestrife</H2><H4><I>Lythrum salicaria</I></H4></Center><p>
Purple loosestrife is a wetland plant from Europe and Asia. It was introduced into the east coast of North America in the 1980s. First spreading along roads, canals, and drainage ditches, then later distributed as an ornamental, this exotic plant is in 40 states and all Canadian border provinces.
<p>
Purple loosestrife invades marshes and lakeshores, replacing cattails and other wetland plants. The plant can form dense, impenetrable stands which are unsuitable as cover, food, or nesting sites for a wide range of native wetland animals including ducks, geese, rails, bitterns, muskrats, frogs, toads, and turtles. Many rare and endangered wetland plants and animals are also at risk.
<img align=right src="/images/x9_gifs/x9_6.gif" border=2>
<p>
Purple loosestrife thrives on distributed, moist soils, often invading after some type of constriction activity. Eradicating an established stand is difficult because of an enormous number of seeds in the soil. One adult plant can disperse 2 million seeds annually. The plant is able to resprout from roots and broken stems that fall to the ground or into the water.
<p>
A major reason for purple loosestrife's expansion is a lack of effective predators in North America. Several European insects that only attack purple loosestrife are being tested as a possible long-term biological control of purple loosestrife in North America.
<H3>Likely means of spread:</H3>
Seeds escape from gardens and nurseries into wetlands, lakes, and rivers. Once in aquatic systems, seeds are easily spread by moving water and wetland animals.
<p>
<center>
<H2>CHECKLIST</H2>
<H4>Clean Boats, clean waters...</H4></center><p>
If you are a water recreationalist - a boater, an angler, a water skier, sailor, or a canoeist - there are some important things you can do. <B>DON'T</B> transport water, animal, or plants from one lake or river to another. In many states and provinces it is illegal to transport exotic species.
<UL>
<LI><B>Remove</B> plants and animals from your boat, trailer, and accessory equipment (anchors, centerboards, trailer hitch, wheels, rollers, cables, and axles) before leaving the water access area.
<LI><B>Drain</B> your livewells, bilge water, and transom wells before leaving the water access area.
<LI>Empty your bait bucket on land, never into the water. Never dip your bait, or minnow bucket into one lake if it has water in it from another. And never dump live fish from one water body into other waters.
<LI><B>Wash</B> your boat, tackle, downriggers, and trailer with hot water when you get home. Flush water through your motor's cooling system and other boat parts that normally get wet. If possible, let everything dry for three days before transporting your boat to another body of water. (Both hot water, and drying will kill zebra mussel larvae and spiny waterfleas.)
<LI><B>Learn</B> what these organisms look like (at least those you can see). If you suspect a new infestation of an exotic plant or animal report it to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
<LI><B>Consult</B> the DNR for recommendations and permits before you try to control or eradicate an exotic "pest." Remember, exotic "pest" species thrive on disturbance. Do-it-yourself control treatments often make matters worse and can harm native species.

<TITLE> Exotic Species </TITLE>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<center><img align=center src="/Images/sg_logo.gif">
<H2>Three-State Exotic Species Boater Survey:<br>
What do boaters know and do they care?</H2>
<H4>by</H4> 
<H3>Jeff Gunderson<br>
Minnesota Sea Grant Extension</H3></Center>
<HR size=4%>
A survey of boaters in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio was conducted to:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>evaluate the effectiveness of aquatic nuisance exotic species boater education programs
<LI>determine how best to reach boaters and change their behavior to reduce the risk of spreading exotics
<LI>help define the risks boaters pose for spreading exotic species, and
<LI>find out what boaters know about exotics.  
</OL>
The survey was conducted by the Minnesota Center for Survey Research in cooperation with the Minnesota Sea Grant College Program, the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  Mail surveys were sent to 2400 randomly selected boaters (800 in each state).  Survey response rate averaged 56 percent and was highest in Minnesota (64%) and lowest in Ohio (44%).  A telephone survey of 279 non respondents was conducted to determine if non-respondents differed from respondents.  Because the mail survey response rate from Ohio was significantly lower than for the other states, more telephone surveys were conducted there (170) than in Wisconsin (53) or Minnesota (56).
<p>
The amount of effort put forth, and the educational methods or other incentives used to change boater behavior to reduce their risk of spreading exotic species, differed dramatically among the three states.  More effort has been expended and a greater variety of techniques have been used in getting the exotic species message out in Minnesota than in the other two states surveyed.  In Minnesota there are civil penalties for transporting exotic species, road checks to enforce the regulations, and inspection/education programs at accesses to infested waters.  In addition, exotic species messages have been presented on billboards, the cover of the fishing regulations pamphlet, at boat accesses, via the media, at conferences/workshops and boat/sports shows, in fact sheets and brochures, and in educational packages distributed to lake and fishing associations.  The efforts in Minnesota have been primarily directed at Eurasian watermilfoil and purple loosestrife but have included many other exotics including zebra mussels, Eurasian ruffe, <I>Bythotrephes</I> (the spiny water flea), and the rusty crayfish.  Efforts to restrict the spread of exotics in Ohio and Wisconsin have been focused primarily on zebra mussels and have relied mainly on the media, information presented at conferences/workshops and boat/sport shows, and distribution of brochures and fact sheets.  Throughout this paper "exotic species" refers to nuisance aquatic exotic species and does not include intentionally introduced exotics like steelhead, chinook salmon, coho salmon, etc.
<p>
Survey results indicate Minnesota boaters are more knowledgeable about exotic species issues and have already changed their behavior to a greater extent (to prevent the spread of exotics) than boaters in the other two states (figure 1). 
<img align=right src="/images/survey/fig1.gif" border=2 alt="Figure 1">
This suggests that educational programs are effective.  Also, more Minnesota boaters (91%) felt that it was very important to take precautions to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil (figure 2) than boaters in Wisconsin (54%) and Ohio (29%).  Generally, boaters in all three states felt that it was important to take precautions to prevent the spread of zebra mussels.  However, a greater percentage of boaters in Minnesota and Wisconsin (80% for both states) felt it was very important to take steps to prevent spreading zebra mussels than boaters in Ohio (70%).  Throughout the survey, Minnesota boaters were more concerned and aware of the threats posed by spreading exotic species than boaters in Wisconsin and Ohio.  Ohio boaters were less concerned than Wisconsin boaters.  For example, when asked to rank the importance of taking precautions to prevent the spread of <I>Bythotrephes</I> and Eurasian ruffe, 54 percent of Minnesota boaters felt it was very important compared to 42 percent of Wisconsin boaters and 31 percent of Ohio boaters (figure 2).

Boaters' responses to questions that asked where they obtained their information is subject to the availability of the source as well as the effectiveness of the source of information.  We, therefore, not only asked boaters to list the best sources of information on exotic species that they were exposed to, but we also asked them to rank the effectiveness of a variety of information sources, irrespective of whether they had been exposed to it.
<p>
The media, especially newspapers and television were the two most important sources of information about exotic species for all three states.   The third most important source of information for Minnesota boaters was signs at boat accesses, while for Wisconsin and Ohio boaters it was Magazines.  The high ranking of signs at boat access sites in Minnesota reflects their more extensive use than in Wisconsin and Ohio.  However, when asked what they thought would be the most effective way to deliver the exotic species message (irregardless of what they had been exposed to), boaters in all three states ranked highly signs at boat accesses.  Boat access signs were ranked first in Minnesota and Wisconsin and third in Ohio.  Boaters in all three states ranked the inclusion of exotic species information in boating and fishing regulations pamphlets second.  Minnesota boaters ranked inspection/education programs at boat accesses third, while brochures were ranked third in Wisconsin and second in Ohio.
<p>
Boaters that reported boating in waters infested with exotic species in 1993, knew the waters were infested primarily because of signs at boat accesses in Minnesota (87%) and Wisconsin (56%), but in Ohio they found out primarily from newspapers (86%).  The responses also reflected the importance of signs at boat accesses, and the news media.
<p>
Boaters were also asked what influenced them to take precautions against spreading exotic species.  "A sense of personal responsibility and a desire to keep exotics out of my lake or stream" were the primary reasons reported in all three states.  Signs at boat accesses, the media, and regulations (in Minnesota) were also influential.  The fact that a high percentage of boaters are motivated to prevent the spread of exotic species through a sense of personal responsibility is encouragement for continued educational efforts.  It shows that boaters are receptive to exotic species messages and willing to change their behavior.
<p>
The survey found that boaters present a significant vector for the spread of exotic species.  The shorter the time a boat is left out of water before it is moved to a different water body and the more often it is used in two different water bodies, the greater the risk of spreading exotic species such as zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil, and spiny water flea.  In Minnesota and Wisconsin, 20 percent of respondents reported using their boat in different water bodies within <b>the same day</B> an average of 4 times during 1993 (figure 3).
<img align=right src="/images/survey/fig3.gif" border=2 alt="Figure 3">
Twenty three percent used their boat in different water bodies <b>within two days</B> an average of six times in 1993.  Thirty percent used their boats in different water bodies <b>within 3 to 5 days</B> an average of seven times during 1993.  Ohio respondents were less likely to boat in different water bodies within these time frames, which likely reflects the less abundant water resources compared with Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Approximately 20 percent of Minnesota and Wisconsin boaters and 44 percent of Ohio boaters knew they boated in infested waters in 1993.
<p>
When asked why they didn't take precautions to prevent the spread of exotic species, boaters in all three states indicated that it was primarily because they didn't know what to do or that they didn't boat in infested waters (figure 4).  Very few boaters said taking precautions is useless or that exotic species are not a problem (figure 4).  
<img align=right src="/images/survey/fig4.gif" border=2 alt="Figure 4">
Again this is encouragement for continued educational programs.  Also, in Minnesota, where there has been a greater effort toward exotic species boater education than in the other two states, significantly fewer boaters reported that they didn't know what to do (28%) compared to boaters in Wisconsin (39%) and Ohio (45%).
<p>
Boaters were asked how often they took certain precautions to prevent the spread of exotic species.  A high percentage of boaters in all three states indicated that they almost always made visual inspections of their boats and drained water from live wells and bilges.  Since zebra mussels attach to aquatic vegetation and Eurasian watermilfoil can be spread by plant fragments, it is important to remove all vegetation from boats, trailers, equipment, etc. before going to another lake or river.  Only in Minnesota did a high percentage of boaters (75%) report that they almost always remove vegetation and mussels from their boat and equipment.  Fewer boaters removed vegetation and mussels in Wisconsin (49%) and Ohio (51%).  This again seems to reflect positively on Minnesota's Eurasian watermilfoil educational campaign.  In all three states, however, only about fifty percent of boaters reported almost always dumping out their bait on shore and only about thirty percent said they almost always let their boat dry for ten days before going to another lake or river. 
<p>
Boaters were asked what problems zebra mussels cause, to try to find out what boaters knew about them.  The top three responses in Minnesota were: 
<p>
<OL>
<LI>disrupt the ecosystem, 
<LI>encrust boats, breakwalls and buoys and 
<LI>clog pipes. 
</OL>
In Wisconsin boaters listed the problems in a slightly different order: 
<p><OL>
<LI> disrupt ecosystems, 
<LI>clog pipes and 
<LI>encrust boats breakwalls and buoys.  
</OL>
In Ohio, which has more experience with zebra mussels, a different problem made it into the top three responses: 
<p>
<OL>
<LI>clog pipes,
<LI>encrust boats, breakwaters, buoys, and 
<LI>damage boats.
</OL>
<p>
In order to determine if boaters perceived exotic species as a threat to their lakes and streams, they were asked to rank a variety of possible threats.  Only in Minnesota did exotic species rank among the top three concerns.  Boaters in all three states felt that polluted runoff was more of a threat to lakes and streams than were exotic species.  In Wisconsin and Ohio, Industrial pollution, fish contaminants, faulty septic systems, and habitat loss were also more of a concern than exotic species.
<p>
There was concern that non-respondents to the mail survey were significantly different in their behavior and knowledge of exotics than respondents.  The telephone survey of non-respondents, however, found that mail survey non-respondents did not differ significantly from respondents in their attitudes, behavior, or understanding of exotics.  Non-respondents did, however, boat less often than mail survey respondents.
<p>
In conclusion, survey results suggest that:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>boater education programs and other incentives have been effective in changing boater behavior to reduce the risk of spreading exotic species, 
<LI>a majority of boaters believe it is important to prevent the spread of aquatic exotics, 
<LI>the best methods for reaching boaters include the media (especially newspapers), signs at boat accesses, and information included in fishing/boating regulation pamphlets, and 
<LI>boaters do present a significant risk for spreading aquatic exotic species.  
</OL>
There are still, however, many existing boaters who have not changed their behavior and many new boaters each year who must be reached.  The threat posed by exotic species is a long term problem that will need continuing emphasis from management agencies and educational institutions.

<TITLE> Survey</title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>What do Boaters Know about Exotic Species</H2>
<H2>and Do They Care?</H2></Center>

Minnesota Boaters are more knowledgeable about exotic species 
issues and have already changed their behavior to a greater 
extent to prevent the spread of exotics than boaters in 
Wisconsin and Ohio, according to a recent survey of 
recreational boaters in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio by 
Jeff Gunderson, Minnesota Sea Grant Extension fisheries 
educator.  
<p>
Minnesota boaters also cared more about the threats posed by 
exotics.  This suggests that boater education programs are 
effective in Minnesota.
<p>

Exotic species refers to nuisance aquatic species such as 
Eurasian watermilfoil, purple loosestrife, zebra mussels, 
Eurasian ruffe, the rusty crayfish, and the spiny waterflea.
<p>

Most boaters ranked newspapers and television as the most 
important sources of information about exotics.  The third 
most important source for Minnesota boaters was signs at boat 
accesses, while for Wisconsin and Ohio boaters it was 
magazines.  This reflects a more extensive use of signs in 
Minnesota than in Wisconsin and Ohio.  Boaters in all three 
states ranked access signs as the most effective way to 
deliver messages, regardless of what other forms of messages 
they had been exposed to.
<p>

"A high percentage of boaters are motivated to prevent the 
spread of exotics through a sense of personal 
responsibility," said Gunderson.  "This provides 
encouragement for educational efforts, and shows that boaters 
are receptive and willing to change their behavior."
<p>

The survey also found that boaters can be a significant 
factor in the spread of exotics.  The less time a boat is 
left out of the water before it is moved to a different lake, 
and the more often it is used in different lakes, the greater 
the risk of spread.  In Minnesota and Wisconsin, 20 percent 
of respondents used their boat in different water bodies 
within the same day an average of four times during 1993.
<p>

If boaters don't take precautions, it's because they don't 
know what to do, or that they don't think they boat in 
infested waters.  Few boaters said taking precautions is 
useless or that exotic species are not a problem.
<p>

"This is all encouraging," said Gunderson.  "There are many 
boaters, however, who have not changed their behavior and 
many new boaters each year who must be informed.  The threat 
posed by exotic species is long-term, and will need 
continuing emphasis from management agencies and educational 
institutions."
<p>

This survey was conducted by the Minnesota Center for Survey 
Research in cooperation with the Minnesota Sea Grant College 
Program, the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network, and the Minnesota 
Department of Natural Resources.  For a copy of the Three-
State Exotic Species Boater Survey:  What do boaters know and

<Title>Bow Watch </title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>Bow Watch--Thoughts from the Director</H2></Center>

Welcome to Minnesota Sea Grant's 20th year of existence as a 
program!  We first began operating in January, 1975 when Dale 
Baker came on staff as the result of a grant from the 
National Sea Grant office to the University of Minnesota.  
<p>
Many changes have happened since then, the most recent being 
the move of our main office from St. Paul to Duluth.  We've 
added some new staff members (see articles on page 6) and 
changed the duties of some of our continuing staff.  Cindy 
Hagley is now our program coordinator as well as continuing 
her role as our water quality specialist.  Mike McLean is now 
our communications director.  Transitions are never without 
challenges, but they bring opportunities, too.
<p>

One of our opportunities is changing the Seiche.  Inside this 
revamped issue you will find many articles of interest to 
people living around or interested in Lake Superior.  We 
decided to feature the ruffe in this issue because of the 
potential impacts it can have on the waters of the Great 
Lakes.  We thought it would be a good opportunity to make you 
aware of the current efforts to control its spread.
<p>

Since the discovery of the ruffe in Lake Superior, Minnesota 
Sea Grant has actively sponsored research and education 
efforts to discover as much as possible about this species 
and to help stop its spread.  Minnesota Sea Grant has also 
taken the lead in developing an extensive Great Lakes 
outreach program to inform the public, policy makers and 
management agencies about the ruffe.
<p>

Because researchers in the lower Great Lakes states do not 
have ready access to ecosystems affected by the ruffe, 
Minnesota Sea Grant is developing a regional approach to the 
problem.  Minnesota researchers have involved Sea Grant 
investigators from other states.  They propose to study the 
ruffe's effects on the Duluth-Superior harbor ecosystem and 
at the pre- and post-invasion conditions in Lake Superior.  
Our Sea Grant researchers also propose to look at new control 
strategies.   
<p>

With this information, the potential ecological and economic 
impacts on the other Great Lakes can be better understood, 
and a coherent Great Lakes-wide strategy can be developed.  
With the combined talents of the Great Lakes Sea Grant 
programs, a major, regionally-coordinated initiative can be 
implemented to deal with the spread of the ruffe.
<p>

If you have questions or concerns about Lake Superior, what 
Minnesota Sea Grant is doing about an issue, or have 
something you'd like to have discussed in this column, let me 
hear from you.
<p>

Let's hope the next 20 years of Minnesota Sea Grant produces 
even more improvements in the quality of the environment and 
economy surrounding Lake Superior and the rest of Minnesota's 
aquatic resources.
<p>

<h3>Minnesota DNR Releases Lake Superior Fisheries Management 
Plan</H3></center>

In January the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 
(DNR) released a draft fisheries management plan for Lake 
Superior.  The plan proposes no dramatic changes, but it does 
suggest a new philosophy:  that future management decisions 
be based on sound biology.  The lake would be managed by 
determining what its forage base is and then seeing what kind 
of fish populations that forage base will support.  As Sam 
Cook, outdoors writer for the Duluth News-Tribune explained, 
it lets the lake call the shots.  
<p>
The public review deadline was March 1.  If you missed your 
chance to comment or to attend the open houses on the subject 
(held in Duluth, St. Paul and Schroeder), copies of the plan 
are still available from the DNR Lake Superior fisheries 
office,  (218) 723-4785.
<p>
<H3>Has Anybody Seen My Baby (Zebra Mussel)?</H3>

Few young zebra mussels were found during field studies this 
summer in the Duluth-Superior harbor.  Sea Grant Researcher 
Mary Balcer says no "major explosion" in the population is 
occurring there,  although there are large isolated 
populations of adults.  
<p>
The adults don't seem to be reproducing, so Balcer is 
currently studying why.  She suspects low calcium levels in 
the harbor water might be the cause.
<p>
For more information, contact Mary Balcer, University of 
Wisconsin-Superior, (715) 394-8424.

<TITLE>Ruffe Waters</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>Ruffe Waters Ahead for All the Great Lakes ?</H2>

<H3>By Marie Sal&eacute;s</H3>
</Center>

When Dennis Pratt, a fisheries biologist with the Wisconsin 
DNR, pulled a one-inch ruffe (pronounced rough) out of a net 
in 1987 from the Duluth-Superior harbor its identity was a 
mystery.  And no wonder, it was the first of its kind to be 
found in North America.  When he searched for and found a 
larger ruffe two months later, it was still a mystery, but 
not for long.
<p>
"We knew it was the same fish because it was the one we 
couldn't identify," said Pratt.  "We keyed it out and it kept 
coming up as being in the perch family.  We knew it wasn't a 
darter because they don't get that big, or grow so quickly.  
I took it home and spent a lot of time alone with it that 
night trying to figure out what it was.  My wife remembers 
that!"
<p>
Pratt finally discovered its true identity that night by 
paging through a book on European freshwater fish that he'd 
kept since his college days. "The description fit exactly and 
that's when we realized it came from Eurasia."  It was 
transported as a stowaway to the harbor in ships' ballast 
water.
<p>
Since it was first identified, the Eurasian ruffe has become 
extremely abundant in the Duluth-Superior harbor.  What to do 
about its spread and whether control measures will keep it 
from the rest of the Great Lakes is disputed.
<p>
Last year was a banner one for the ruffe.  At three million 
strong, the spiny, perchlike little fish is now the most 
numerous fish in the St. Louis River, as measured by trawl 
samples.  They are rapidly spreading eastward along the south 
shore of Lake Superior.  In 1994, new populations were found 
in Chequamegon Bay, Saxon Harbor (all Wisconsin), Black River 
Harbor and Ontonagon River (Michigan), and Thunder Bay, 
Canada.
<p>
The ruffe is considered a serious threat to commercial and 
sport fishing because it can disrupt the delicate 
predator/prey balance vital to sustaining a healthy fishery.  
Before coming to North America, the ruffe's most recent 
expansion was to Loch Lomond, Scotland, where it may have 
been responsible for dramatic declines in the local perch 
population.  
<p>
When the ruffe was discovered, the state Departments of 
Natural Resources (DNR) in Minnesota and Wisconsin quickly 
developed a control plan.  Like many human efforts to control 
nature, the plan met with varied success.  Some early 
suggestions like poisoning the entire harbor were discarded 
as unworkable because ruffe were found to be living in Lake 
Superior already.  A pair of ruffe entering into a harbor 
devoid of competition from other fish would soon have taken 
over with an even stronger hold.  Stocking the waters with 
sterile males to interfere with reproduction was also 
considered, but was deemed ineffective.  
<p>
The DNR chose to restrict the harvest levels allowed on ruffe 
predators, the walleye and northern pike, cutting the fishing 
limit by half.  To aid these efforts they stocked the St. 
Louis River with massive numbers of the predator fish.  
However, even these measures have not kept the ruffe 
population from increasing.  
<p>
The bright spots were the public education efforts and 
restrictions on live bait harvest from Lake Superior that 
have kept the ruffe from spreading to inland waters.   
<p>
The plan also initiated the voluntary ballast water exchange 
program by ships, which seems effective.  Ships going to 
other Great Lakes are required to exchange "contaminated" 
ballast in deep (at least 240 feet) water west of a 
demarcation line between Ontonogan, Michigan and Grand 
Portage, Minnesota and at least five miles from the south 
shore of Lake Superior.
<p>
"It's an inconvenience, but it's a matter of cooperation" 
said Ray Skelton, Seaway Port Authority.  "Anytime you add a 
procedure there's a cost involved but industry has borne it."
<p>
Resource managers fear that if allowed to spread to the lower 
Great Lakes where the habitat is more favorable and the 
fisheries more vulnerable, the ruffe could have an even 
greater economic and ecological impact than they have had in 
the Duluth-Superior area.  
<p>
A recent economic analysis by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration for the Aquatic Nuisance Species 
Task Force estimates that the annual loss of income to sport 
and commercial fishing due to a fully-developed ruffe 
population in the Great Lakes could run to $120 million.  
<p>
To get a handle on stopping the spread, a Ruffe Control 
Committee was formed, made up of members from federal, state, 
university, tribal, sportfishg and Great Lakes organizations.
<p>
The committee recently approved a federal control plan which 
includes measures such as ballast water management, research 
on the ruffe population, surveillance sampling to find new 
populations of ruffe, public education and continuing the 
stocking of ruffe predators in the harbor.  
<p>
The numbers support the control program. The economic 
analysis mentioned above estimates that a control program 
will yield a 44 to 1 return and a net public savings of $513 
million over the next five and one half decades, with the 
sportfish angling business benefiting the most.
<p>
However, a limited and experimental poisoning of five estuary 
mouths along the south shore of Lake Superior, west of 
Michigan's Keewenaw Peninsula is drawing the most discussion.  
The chemicals used would be similar to those that kill 
lamprey, but would be required in slightly higher 
concentrations.  Other "innocent-bystander" fish would also 
be killed.
<p>
Unlike the impression given by some regional media, "We won't 
be using truckloads of chemicals," said Tom Busiahn, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service supervisor in Ashland, Wisconsin 
and chair of the Ruffe Control Committee.  Busiahn recently 
conducted public meetings in Superior, WI; Buffalo, NY; 
Chicago, IL and Marquette, MI.  The final one was held on 
March 7 in Bay City, MI.
<p>
"Generally, in the lower lakes, there's strong support for 
containing the ruffe in Lake Superior," Busiahn said  "During 
our meeting in Superior there was more concern about the use 
of piscicides (fish poison)."
<p>
"We can't support a chemical release plan until it is more 
fully developed and reviewed by peers," said Dave Zentner, 
Izaak Walton League.  "We also think it is futile. Our 
general impression is there's little hope that such a 
chemical experiment will be effective.  There's a low 
probability of success."
<p>
"The ruffe are going to be around forever and ever and they 
are going to spread," said George Spangler, University of 
Minnesota professor and a control committee member.  "We'd 
like to think we have a control technology in place, but we 
don't.  All it will do is delay the ruffe's arrival at other 
points in the Great Lakes." 
<p>
Others in the environmental community are more comfortable 
with the idea of chemical application, like Mike Furtman of 
Duluth,  who would rather err on the side of trying to 
restore a natural ecosystem with the chemicals than to suffer 
the long-term effects the ruffe could have.
<p>
Busiahn is frustrated by all the speculation.  "No one knows 
what will happen in the future.  We're trying to gather 
information that will address some of those uncertainties."  
It will take an  estimated five years, the life span of a 
ruffe, before it's known whether the chemical treatments have 
been successful.
<p>
Researchers hope that the information gathered from the 
chemical treatments will be valuable if the ruffe spread to 
inland lakes or other isolated areas.  It may also buy some 
time, so that when/if the ruffe spread, there will be a 
better chance to control them.  For information on Sea 
Grant's research efforts on the topic, see "Bow Watch," page 
2.
<p>
From Pratt's discovery to the current controversy, at the 
center remains the little fish, oblivious to its effect on 
Homo sapiens.  "This ruffe business has generated a lot of 
work," said Busiahn.  "It's just one part of my job, and it 
could easily become my whole job."
<p>
If you'd like to comment on the plan, contact the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service.  The official comment period ended 
March 13, but the service will still consider what you have 
to say.  The Ruffe Control Committee will meet soon to 
discuss the outcome of the comment period.  The committee's 
parent group, the Aquatic Nuisance Species Committee has 
until July 12 to revise the control plan.

Wildlife office at (715) 682-6185.

<Title>New Fact Sheet Available About a Nasty Native Invader</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>New Fact Sheet Available About a Nasty Native Invader</H2></Center>

The rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) has invaded parts of 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ontario and many other states.  
Although native to some parts of the southern Great Lakes 
states, these crayfish have spread to many northern lakes and 
streams where they have caused ecological problems.
<p>
Jeff Gunderson, Minnesota Sea Grant Extension fisheries 
educator, has just published the fact sheet, Rusty Crayfish:  
A Nasty Invader, that outlines the biology, ecological 
impacts and identifying characteristics of the rusty crayfish 
.  <p>

Rusty crayfish were probably spread by non-resident anglers 
who brought them north to use as fishing bait. 
<p>
"These animals are just plain mean," said Gunderson.  "They 
push out the more docile native crayfish and reduce the 
variety and amount of water plants and animals.   They can 
even lower some populations of fish."
<p>
Some cabin-owners on infested northern Wisconsin lakes have 
even stopped swimming because so many of the crayfish occupy 
their favorite swimming area throughout the day.  They fear 
stepping on them and getting pinched by their large claws.  
Other crayfish species, even if abundant, are usually less 
noticeable during daylight.
<p>
Environmentally-sound ways to eradicate or control introduced 
populations have not been developed, and none are likely in 
the near future.  The best way to prevent further 
environmental problems is to prevent or slow their spread 
into new waters.  It is now illegal in both Minnesota and 
Wisconsin to introduce rusty crayfish into any water body.  
In Minnesota, it is illegal to sell live crayfish as bait, 
introduce crayfish from one water body to another or to 
transport live rusty crayfish.
<p>
The good news is that they're tasty.  The harvest of rusty 
crayfish is just beginning in Minnesota and is expanding in 
Wisconsin.

back of this newsletter.  For more information about the 
rusty crayfish, contact Jeff Gunderson, (218) 726-8715.

<Title>Snowmobiling on the North Shore..</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>Snowmobiling on the North Shore Trail Brings 
$2.1 Million to Local Economy</H2></Center>

Snowmobilers using the North Shore Trail spend an estimated 
$2.1 million each year, mainly during multi-day trips.  A 
research paper by MN Sea Grant's Glenn Kreag and Jennifer 
Moe, Minnesota's North Shore Snowmobile Trail:  What is its 
value?, also describes how snowmobilers choose trails; how 
far they travel on their snowmobiles, for how long and with 
how many people.  
<p>
Significant differences exist between local (Northeast MN 
residents) and visiting snowmobilers.  For instance, resident 
snowmobilers travel an average of 282 miles on multi-day (2.7 
days) trips.  Their party size is 15 people, and they spend 
$7.86 per person, per day on food.  Visiting snowmobilers 
travel more, 367 miles, their group size is less, 6.8 people, 
but the time they spend here is more, 3.3 days.  They also 
spend more on food ($9.64 per person).
<p>
The North Shore Trail is currently 152 miles long, running 
between Duluth and Grand Marais.  "The significance of the 
trail goes beyond the dollars it generates" said Kreag.  "It 
is a key resource that has helped stabilize the tourism 
industry by allowing tourism businesses to stay open during 
winter.  A longer tourist season has also attracted new 
development, creating a greater variety of facilities for all 
tourists, year-round.
<p>
"Excellent trail maintenance is vital to continued 
snowmobiler satisfaction.  Even the North Shore Trail with 
its long winter season and high average snow cover 
occasionally experiences deteriorated trail conditions during 
peak weekends.  Other issues, such as management policies, 
crowding and safety may impact future growth.  Environmental 
quality and conflicts with other trail users are also 
concerns," said Kreag.
<p>
"The economic impact of snowmobiling is significant to the 
local economy of the North Shore in winter.  With growth of 
both residents and visitors in the area, more use can be 
expected.  However, the North Shore Trail will be a 
significant economic factor in the winter tourism business 
for many years," said Kreag.

<Title>The Water Line</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>The Water Line</H2></Center>

	Are you a public official in Northeastern Minnesota with 
concerns about the quality of well water in your area?  Do 
you have questions about how septic systems should be 
installed?  Confused about where to turn for this 
information?  
<p>
	The water information phone line was developed to help 
decision-makers and citizens through the water quality 
information maze, or to at least start at the right point.  
It is a cooperative effort between Minnesota Extension 
Service, MN Sea Grant and the American Ground Water Trust.  
<p>

	A toll-free phone line will provide people with water 
information, and aid those involved in the management, 
decision-making and use of Minnesota's water resources, 
particularly ground water.  The line will be connected this 
spring to serve Minnesotans in 11 northeast and east central 
counties.
<p>

	Minnesota Sea Grant's Deanne Roquet will be the 
principle phone contact.  She will provide technical 
information to callers or will refer them to a network of 
senior-level professionals who are volunteering their 
services.  If it's an issue an agency handles, she will refer 
the caller to the appropriate agency staff.
<p>
  	No question will be too big or too small.  Look for the 
phone number in a future issue of the Seiche.

<Title>Watermilfoil Research Update</Title>
<body background="/images/background/tile19.jpg">
<Center><H2>Watermilfoil Research Update</H2>
<h3>By Mike McLean</H3>
</Center>

	Insects that live in the plant stalks of native Northern 
watermilfoil could be used to attack Eurasian watermilfoil, a 
harmful exotic species that was spreading rapidly in 
Minnesota lakes.
<p>
	Sea Grant researchers Ray Newman and Florence Gleason 
are investigating new biological controls of Eurasian milfoil 
by looking for natural pests, and learning about milfoils 
own chemical defenses.  This research is part of Sea Grant's 
focus on finding safe, selective and cost-effective ways to 
control exotic species.
<p>
	A small weevil, native to North American waters, uses 
the native Northern watermilfoil as a host during much of its 
life cycle.  This insect, explained Newman, lays eggs on the 
tips of the milfoil plant.  When eggs hatch, the young eat 
the plant from the inside out, burrowing several feet down 
the length of the plants stem.  This retards growth and 
weakens the plant.
<p>
	Lab tests confirm that these insects will also feed on 
Eurasian milfoil.  The switch from Northern to Eurasian 
watermilfoil appears to be easy after weevils make the switch 
from Northern watermilfoil to Eurasian.  They don't easily 
switch back to Northern watermilfoil. 
<p>
	Finding out why these weevils end up preferring Eurasian 
milfoil is the goal of Newman and Gleasons research,  Newman 
speculates that native plants have evolved specific defenses 
against weevils that the non-native Eurasian watermilfoil 
lacks.  Learning about these chemical defenses is another 
important step in the fight against milfoil, he said.
<p>
	Finding a natural way to control Eurasian watermilfoil 
is important, said Newman. While chemical control may still 
play a role in specific settings -- such as near crowded lake 
accesses, and to clear navigation channels -- natural 
controls have clear advantages.  First, these weevils are 
already here; there isnt the danger of adding one exotic 
species to the environment to get rid of another.  Second,  
effective biological control should result in long-term 
declines.  Chemical control must often be repeated. Third, 
the natural pest will specifically target the exotic species, 
reducing the risk that native species will be harmed in the 
process. Finally, natural controls are far cheaper in the 
long run than repeated use of expensive chemicals.

<center><H2>A Model Program for Fish Growth</H2></Center>
<hr width = 50%>
This software package (available for both macintosh and IBM compatible PC platforms) is used to identify the separate effects of age and environment (or growth-year) on the growth of animal hard-parts, particularly <B>fish scales</B>. Weisberg (1993) described the models underlying this program and analyzed an example data set. This software comes with the program itself along with a printed copy of the manual. The manual covers the development of the models, each menu item of the program, and a step-by-step analysis of the data set in Weisberg (1993).
<H3>A BRIEF DESCRIPTION</H3>
<Center><H3>Development of the Analytical Models</H3></Center>
A fish's growth history is recorded in the annular marks on their scales or other hard-parts. Fish grow in accordance to intrinsic effects of age and size already attained and in response to extrinsic factors of their biotic and abiotic environment (Weisberg 1993). Extrinsic factors include the effect of different stocks, capture locations, gears, sex or management strategies on growth. In past analyses, the effect of extrinsic factors on growth was difficult to interpret because of the inclusion of the effect of age. This program is used to separate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and then, to explore some of the factors contained in the extrinsic factors.<p>

The program implements a family of linear models to analyze hard-part increment data. The program uses standard linear model theory to produce a few easy interpretable parameters and standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) tables and tests. The three models used in this program generalize the methodology given by Weisberg (1986) and Weisberg and Frie (1987), removing the limitation of a single sample from a population in those papers. This program supersedes a program that was previously distributed by Minnesota Sea Grant (1989).

<H3>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</H3>
	Fish diseases are a common problem in fish culture. A basic understanding of the nature of fish diseases is important for fish culturists. With this information, the culturists will be better equipped to prevent and handle disease outbreaks.
<H3>WHAT IS AN INFECTIOUS FISH DISEASE?</H3>
Fish, like all animals, are subjec to a variety of diseases. They can suffer from infectious diseases caused by pathogens, which are organisms capable of causing disease only when the host's resistance is lowered. These include parasites, bacteria, or viruses.
<p>
Fish can also suffer from environmental and nutritional diseases. A fish disease is a state of imbalance between the fish and its environment, which may lead to death.
<p>
Under natural conditions, fish seldom suffer from severe disease outbreaks. However, when fish are crowded and reared under unnatural conditions, teh potential exists for a serious disease outbreak.
<H3>WHAT CAUSES FISH DISEASES?</H3>
Fish diseases are the result of interaction between a pathogen, a fish (host), and a stressful environment (Figure 1). Even if the pathogen is present, a disease outbreak will not occur unless the environment becomes too stressfull for the fish (Figure 2).
<p>
Intensively raised fish are stressed by fluctuating water temperatures, changes in water quality, overcrowding, handling, and transport. Fish can handle these stresses up to a point but when they can no longer adjust, they may succumb to disease and eventually die.
<H3>HOW CAN DISEASE BE PREVENTED?</H3>
Prevention of disease is a primary goal in aquaculture. Ideally, the fish facility should be maintained pathogen-free but this cannot always be done. If the fish are bought, the buyer should only obtain fish that are <B>certified disease-free</B>. The fish should be stocked in an environment with sufficient oxygen, low levels of ammonia, and miniaml organic loading (overfeeding fish will result in an accumulation of food, causing poor water quality). Finally, the fish must not be handled too often or too roughly. Keep the amount of stress encountered by the fish to a minimum. For example, transportation and handling stress can be reduced by adding 0.1% to 0.3% salt and enough calcium chloride to raise the total water hardness to 50 parts per million for soft waters. Additional calcium chloride is not needed in hardre waters.
<H3>WHAT ARE WARNING SIGNS OF DISEASES?</H3>
In spite of the best preventive efforts, diseases may occur. It is vital to detect the disease as soon as possible. The best way to detect a disease at its onset is by observing the fish when they are feeding. If any of the folloing are observed, a disease outbreak may be starting and immediate treatment is necessary.

</UL></TD></TR></table>
</center>
<p>
Fish mortality rates should be carefully monitored and recorded every day. This can indicate the trend of the disease and provide clues as to the cause. Figure 3 (Meyer et al. 1983) illustrates the relationship between cumulative mortality and time (days), which helps trace the cause of the problem. Line (A) represents a die-off due to a severe environemental failure (e.g., low oxygen or a toxic chemical). Line (B) is die-offs due to a severe disease outbreak; line (C) is die-offs due to a persistent disease. A diagnostic laboratory can use this information to help distinguish between an infectious disease and other types of disease.
<p>
[Figure 3]
<p>
<H3>DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION</H3>
In most cases, fish culturists will need the assistance of a trained pathologist to diagnose and treat a disease.
<H4>HOW CAN AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE BE DIAGNOSED?</H4>
If an infectious disease outbreak is suspected because of a warning sign(s), then samples of fish should be sent to a disease specialist for analysis. Contact a disease specialist or laboratory for specific instructions on how many fish to send and how to ship them.
<p>
The following list consists of the kinds of fish to sample (in order for preference from excellent to fair), that can best be used by a disease specialist to determine the cause of a disease:
<OL>
<LI>Fish, delivered live, exhibitng behavioral symptoms such as lethergy, lislessness, or erratic swimming. Probability of finding the cause is high.
<LI>Fish, delivered live, exhibiting overt physical symptoms such as open sores, eroded areas on the body surface or gills, bloody fins, and swollen or clubbed gills. The probability of finding the cause is high.
<LI>Dead fish that still have red gills and somewhat normal amounts of color and mucus. This is a fair sample; the probability of identifying the cause of death depends on how long the fish have been dead.
</OL>
The following list consists of the kinds of fish samples that <b>cannot</B> be used by a disease specialist to determine the cause of the disease:
<OL>
<LI>Several fish taken at random from a seine sample. This is a poor sample; the probability of identifying the cause of death is low since a majority of the fish may be healthy. The fish that are sampled must have the symptoms.
<LI>Dead fish that have lost body color and mucus layer and have white, mushy gills or fish that have been frozen. These are unusable samples.
</OL>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
The discovery that fish oil may have unique benefits in the fight against coronary heart disease has stimulated a tremendous amount of research which this publication summarizes. Although the subject is complex, the study of fish oils is very worthwhile because it provides a totally new perspective on the relationship of diet to coronary heart disease.
<p>
We have been inundated with oversimplified information about the effects of diet on blood cholesterol. It has led most people to believe that low blood cholesterol achieved by eating a low cholesterol diet is the one and only key to good health, particularly good heart health. Because of this, when the health benefits of fish oil were first reported, most people assumed that its primary benefit is the lowering of blood cholesterol. The health benefits of fish oil, however, are primarily related to the reduction of platelet activity, not the reduction of blood cholesterol. While some studies do show that fish oil moderately reduces blood cholesterol, it has been shown to increase blood cholesterol in many other studies. While attaining a low blood cholesterol is considered healthy, it is only one of many factors affecting heart disease which must  be considered. This publication explains more fully the relationship of diet to coronary heart disease and the health benefits of fish oil.
<H3>The Benefits of Fish Oil</H3>
Fish oil has many names. One of the most common is <B>omega-3 fatty acid</B> pr its scientific abbreviation, <B>N-3</B>. N3 fatty acids are found mostly in fish, but are contained in other foods as well. Fish oil is the best food source of these fatty acids.
<p>
The primary benefit of N-3 fish oil is the reduction of platelet activity (blood clotting) and plaque formation which in turn can prevent heart attacks. Here's how it works.
<p>
Platelets are clot-forming blood cells which prevent excessive bleeding. Overly active platelets, however, may speed the build-up of plaque, a deposit of fatty or fibrous material which narrows a blood vessel wall. Elevated blood cholesterol also contributes to the acceleration of plaque formation. When plaque narrows an artery it is easier for a blood clot to get stuck in the artery and this can cause a heart attack. Because platelets also form blood clots, this is likely to occur. That's why it is desirable to reduce platelet activity and why N-3 fatty acid, fish oil, is beneficial.
<H3>Atherosclerosis</H3>
Plaque build-up and narrowing of an artery is called atherosclerosis. It is a disease of aging which begins early in life. The process of this disease is complicated, involving <I>monocytes</I> (white blood cells), platelets, various tissue cells, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), as well as cholesterol, as commonly believed, but also fat, smooth muscle cells, calcium, and other components.
<p>
Atherosclerosis starts when the cells which cover the inner surface of a blood vessel become injured. Monocytes and platelets, both found in plaque, adhere to the injured area and attempt to repair it. Monocytes encourage the formation of foam cells and platelets stimulate the movement of smooth muscle cells into the injured area. All of these cells begin to accumulate in the blood vessel and it becomes progressively more narrow.
<p>
Fish oil, N-3 fatty acid, reduces the activity of monocytes and platelets, cell production, narrowing of the arteries, and production,  narrowing of the arteries, and the chance of blood clots and heart attack. Some research indicates that fish oil reduces the risk of heart attack even in people how already have extensive atherosclerosis.
<H3>Polyunsaturated, Saturated, N-6, and N-3 Fatty Acids</H3>
There are more than twenty different types of fatty acids commonly found in food. In general, all foods contain most of the twenty types of fatty acids to some degree. Saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are two types we hear a lot about. As all foods and oils contain most of the different types of fatty acids to some extent, even polyunsaturated vegetable and fish oils contain some saturated fat. Fish oil, the most polyunsaturated of all oils, contains 15% to 30% saturated fat. Thus the terms polyunsaturated and saturated are inadequate to accurately describe fat or oil.
<p>
All polyunsaturated fatty acids are different and so have different health effects. And all fats, polyunsaturated or saturated, have both health benefits and drawbacks. For example, vegetable oil, an N-6 polyunsaturated oil, is often promoted for lowering blood cholesterol and undesirable low-density lipoproteins (LDL). However, it may increase the chance of heart attack by lowering high-density lipoproteins (HDL) which keep arteries clean, and by increasing the activity of platelets and monocytes, which is reduced by N-3 oils (von Schacky 1987). Advertisements which promote the health benefits of one oil over all others are again providing oversimplified information. Every oil has its health benefits and drawbacks. None is a cure-all. The important N-3 and N-6 fatty acids of foods are shown in the table below.<p>

<H3>How N-3 and N-6 Fatty acids Affect Your Health</H3>
N-3 and N-6 fatty acids have negative and positive health effects. N-6 fatty acids encourages the formation of eicosanoids called prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These are potent chemicals which can increase platelet and monocyte activity respectively, thus increasing the risk of heart attack. The good news is that both N-6 and N-3 fatty acids reduce certain lipoproteins which carry plasma lipids (fatty materials) in the blood plasma. Plasma lipids consist party of cholesterol and triglycerides. The reduction of lipoproteins in effect  reduces plasma lipids and ultimately helps preven atherosclerosis and heart disease.
<p>
N-6 and N-3 fatty acids compete with each other. Therefore, the amount of N-6 and N-3 fatty acids, the N-6/N-3 ratio, is very important. Americans eat 17 times as much N-6 fatty acid, usually in the form of vegetable oil, as the eat N-3, which is very unhealthy. Ideally people should eat approximately 5 times as much  N-6 fatty acid as N-3 fatty acid, a 5/1 ratio. The health benefits are an increase in prsotacyclin and a decrease in thromboxane. Prostacyclin reduces platelet activity (clotting) and prevents heart  attacks by preventing arterial spasms. A decrease  in thromboxane  is also desirable because it increases platelet 
activity and arterial spasms, the opposite effect of prostacyclin.

<H3>The N-3 Fatty Acid in Fish</H3>
The amount of N-3 oils varies in different types of fish. It is commonly believed that only salt water fish contain significant levels of N-3 fatty acid. This is <B>not</B> true. Freshwater fish from cold northern waters, including Lake Superior, can have significant levels as well (Want et al. 1990).
<p>
The following are recommended saltwater and freshwater fish with a high N-3 oil content:
<p>

</TC>
</table></center><p>
Fish not recommended are those with low levels of N-3 oils. They are:
<p>

<table border=1>

flounder<BR>

<TC>
<TD><B>
pike<BR>
shark<BR>
snapper<BR>
sole<BR>
walleye<BR>
whiting<B></TD></TC>
</table>
</center>
<p>

For maximum benefits, fish with high N-3 oil content should be prepared with additional oil by baking, broiling, or grilling. Preparing fish with batter, breading, or frying reduces health benefits significantly. The result is a less desirable N-3/N-6 ratio when vegetable oil (N-6) is added during preparation.
<p>
Fish oils, like any food, have disadvantages as well as benefits. Because fish oils are highly polyunsaturated they become rancid quickly. Although this usually has no effect on the nutritional value, eating rancid fish is obviously not a good idea. Because rancid fish smell fishy, they are not very appetizing. Proper storage and short storage periods can alleviate the problem of rancidity.
<H3> Alternative sources of N-3 Fatty acids</H3>
There are other sources of N-3 fatty acids such as fish oil capsules, canola oil, and flax oil. Use of fish oil capsules should be done only with the recommendation of your doctor, who should also specify the brand. Canola and flax oils have less potent forms of N-3 fatty acids and would need to be eaten in approximately 20 times the amount to get comparable benefits of consuming fish oil rich in N-3 fatty acids.

<H3>Dietary Recommendations</H3>
It is best to eat a variety of oils in moderate quantities given the wide range of effects of different oils. In general, you should eat more N-3 fatty acids and less N-6 vegetable oil to attain a more balanced N-3 /N-6 ratio. Recent studies suggest that eating 0.5 to 1 gram of fish oil daily reduces the risk of heart disease death in middle-aged American men by 40 percent. The most efficient way to add these important oils to your diet is to eat two meals per week of fish rich in N-3 fatty acids prepared without additional oil.

A Tasty Tradition</H2><p>

<H3>The Tradition</H3>
The fish boil has been a Great Lakes tradition for more than a hundred years. Legend has it that Scandinavians brought the custom to the early settlements around Lake Michigan. Whitefish and Lake trout were plentiful, and it was easy to preapare a meal outdoors by boiling fish, potatoes, and onions together in a large pot. <p>

Today, if you visit any number of quaint coastal villages on the Upper Great Lakes on a summer or fall evening, you may see a traditional fish boil taking place. The fish boil is the Great Lakes' answer to the New England clambake. There is a festival atmosphere as  guests mingle in line and share picnic tables. Often guests are treated to live entertainment or music.<p>

Whitefish and lake trout are normally used for the fish boil. With the fresh fish, potatoes, and onions, the fish boil is a culinary delight. Blackened cast-iron kettle remains the standard cooking utensil, but stainless steell and aluminum pots are becoming more popular because they are so readily available.<p>

A fire of logs or slab wood is kept burning under the kettle. The less adventurous may prefer to use a propane torch. When the salted, seasoned water comes to a boil, the potatoes are lowered into the pot in a wire basket and boiled; then the onions are added and they are boiled together (see cooking instructions for detail about timing). Finally, the fish is placed in a second wire basket and lowered into the pot. The second basket fits precisely into the first basket without touching the potatoes and onions.<p>

About 10 minutes later, the fish is done and the <b>overboil</b> is performed. A pint of kerosine is added to the fire. As flames shoot skyward, the flash of heat causes an overboil, flushing the froth from the surface of the churning water. The flash and roar of the overboil announce that food is ready. When the fire subsides, the baskets are removed and drained. Coleslaw and bread are typically served with the meal.<p>

<H3>Preparing the Fish</H3>
Although lake trout and whitefish are traditional choices, other trout or salmon may be used. You will need aboiut three-fourths of a pound of fish chunks per person. Remove the large scales on salmon and trout. Slit whole fish from vent to gills, and remove the internal organs, including the kidney (the dark material along the backbone).<p>

The fish is now ready to be chunked or <b>steaked</b>. Remove the head and fins. Cut the fish into cross-sectional peices two to three inches thick. Fresh fish is preferred, but frozen, dressed fish may also be used. Cut it into chunks before it thaws completely.<p>

To use fish fillets instead of chunks, keep the skin on and cut fillets three to four inches long. Fillets have more of a tendency to fall apart. This may be caused by a strong boiling action, a vigorous overboil, or overcooking.<p>

<H3>Preparing other Ingredients</H3>
<b>Potatoes:</b> Allow two potatoes (preferable new red potatoes) per person. Select or cut potatoes so they are uniform size. Wash but don't peel them. Remove a slice from each end so the seasoning penetrates better.<p>
<b>Onions:</b> Allow one medium-size whole onion, peeled, per person.<p>
<b>Salt:</b> Use about a quarter cup of salt per pound of fish (one pound of salt for every six pounds of fish). Add half the salt before the potatoes go in; add the rest along with the fish.<p>
<b>Seasoning:</b> Use cheeseloth to make a seasoning packet containing bay leaves, whole allspice, and peppercorns in roughly equal proportions. You may want to add herbs or spices of your own choosing. To feed 10 people, the seasoning packet should be about the size of a golf ball. Add the seasoing packet when the potatoes go into the boiling water.<p>

<p>
<B>Water:</B> There should be about a gallon of water for every two and a half to three pounds of fish.<p>

<b>Condiments:</B> Have drawn butter and fresh parsley available for use on the potatoes. Have lemon wedges for use on the fish.<p>

<H3>Cooking Instructions</H3>
Add half of the salt to the water and bring it to a rolling boil. Each time you add ingredients, let the water return to a rolling boil and then cook for the recommended amound of time. Place the potatoes and seasongs in the larger wire basket and lower it into the water; boil for eight to 10 minutes. Add onions; boil for another two to four minutes. Add the rest of the salt; lower the fish, in the smaller wire basket, into the water and boil for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.<p>

To do the overboil, add a pint of kerosene to the fire. (You can omit the overboil if you skim the froth off before removing the baskets). Remove and drain both baskets. Serve the meal with bread and coleslaw, with the drawn butter, parsley, and lemon wedges. To eat the fish, peel off the skin and lift out the bones. <br>

SUPERIOR PURSUIT:<br>
FACTS ABOUT THE GREATEST GREAT LAKE</font></center>
<hr width=25%>

Whether you visit Minnesota's North Shore or live there year-round, Lake Superior is a constant source of wonder.  From the sunny calm of July to the gray crashing waves of November, the lake helps shape the climate, landscape, economy, and quality of life along the shore.  Here are some facts about Lake Superior that show the greatness of this inland sea.<p>

<H1>Size</H1>

Lake Superior covers 31,280 square miles, the area of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New Hampshire combined.  It is the greatest Great Lakethe largest lake in the world by surface area, and the second largest by volume.  Only Lake Baikal in Siberia contains a greater volume of fresh water.<p>

Lake Superior is the deepest of the Great Lakes.  Along much of Minnesota's North Shore, the lake is 700 feet deep within three miles of land.  The deepest spot, 1,333 feet, is 40 miles off Munising, Michigan.  One of the world's tallest buildings, Chicago's Sears Tower, could fit in that hole with only a few floors sticking above the water.<p>

For a good idea of Lake Superior's length, drive the 350 miles from Chicago to Cleveland.  To appreciate its width, drive the 160 miles from Duluth to Minneapolis.  If Lake Superior's shoreline were unraveled into a highway, it would extend 1,826 miles, the distance from Duluth to Miami.  Lake Superior's watershed covers 491,300 square miles.  This basin is small for the size of the lake.<p>

<H1>Creation of the Lake</H1>

Fire and ice, in the form of volcanoes and glaciers, created Lake Superior.  One billion years ago, molten basalt erupted from the mid-continent rift, which extended from near Thunder Bay, Ontario, to Kansas.  Lava flowed from the rift for 100 million years, resulting in a layer of basalt as much as five miles thick.  Billions of tons of molten rock, moving from underground to the surface, caused the surface to gradually sink and form the broad, shallow Superior basin.<p>

Had the rift continued to evolve, the North American continent would have split in two, and Duluth might now be on an ocean instead of a lake.  But the forces that fueled the rifting stopped, leaving behind the basalt covered North Shore seen today.  The basin continued to sink, accumulating eroded sand and mud.  Except for some river drainage, the Superior basin remained dry and level until about one million years ago, when glacial ice began to sculpt it into roughly its present shape.<p>

Ten thousand years ago, the last ice mass began a slow retreat from western Lake Superior while the eastern drainage outlet was still blocked by ice.  Between the ice front and the highlands surrounding the southwestern tip of the lake, impounded water formed Glacial Lake Duluth, with a surface 500 to 600 feet above the present lake level.  Wave-cut cliffs and terraces line Duluth's Skyline Drive, well above today's lake level.  This is the remains of one of the highest former shorelines of Glacial Lake Duluth.<p>

Water flowed out of this large glacial lake through the Brule River, into the St. Croix River, and then to the Mississippi River.  As the ice retreated north, the present outlet was established through the St. Mary's River and the water level fell.<p>

<H1>Water</H1>

Lake Superior contains three quadrillion (3,000,000,000,000,000) gallons of water.  That's ten percent of the world's fresh surface water and one half of the water in the Great Lakes.  Lake Superior contains enough water to flood all of Canada, the United States, Mexico, and South America with one foot of water.<p>

Each year, 2.5 feet of water fall on the lake as rain or snow, and two more feet enter through streams or ground water.  The Nipigon River in Ontario and the St. Louis River in Duluth/Superior are the largest tributaries; 18 smaller rivers and streams also flow into the lake.  Of the 4.5 feet of water flowing into the lake, 1.6 feet evaporate and the remainder flows to the lower Great Lakes.  The average annual flow from Lake Superior into Lake Huron is 75,000 cubic feet of water per second.  That's about seven times the flow of the St. Louis River as it enters Lake Superior.<p>

Tidal motion, caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, affects Lake Superior water levels less than one inch.  Instead, weather conditions produce a tidal-like rise and fall called a seiche ("saysh").  Seiches occur after water is piled up on one side of the lake by wind or high barometric pressure.  When this force shifts or diminishes, the water rocks back and forth from one shore to the other with decreasing amplitude, like water in a pan that's been tipped then laid flat.  Such seiches can affect water levels by as much as one foot.<p>

<H1>Weather</H1>

Lake Superior, with an average annual temperature of 40 F, moderates temperatures, making winters warmer and summers cooler.  The effect is strongest when the wind blows off the water, and is most pronounced on the shore and on slopes that face the lake.<p>

During May and June, when inland areas bask in spring sun, the shore is often shrouded in fog.  Spring fogs occur when warm air flows out over the cold lake and the moisture in it condenses.  Duluth gets an average of 53 days of heavy fog each year (the Twin Cities average 11 foggy days per year).  These foggy days, punctuated with the sounds of sea gulls and fog horns, have an appeal all their own.<p>

Fall is the season for "northeasters." These gales, with strong winds and rain, occur when low pressure systems pass over the lake.  Most of Lake Superior's 350 shipwrecks occurred during such storms.<p>

In winter, temperatures rarely dip below -30 F near the lake.  Inland temperatures, on the other hand, can reach -45 F.<p>

Increased snowfall along the shore is not as pronounced in Minnesota as it is in Wisconsin and Michigan.  Portions of Michigan's Upper Peninsula normally receive 350 inches of snow, while downtown Duluth receives an average of only 55 inches.  Because the air cools and releases moisture as it rises, more snow  75 inches  falls over the hill in Duluth, a mile or more from the lake.  It often snows over the hill while it rains near the shore.<p>

During most winters, Lake Superior becomes about 40 percent to 95 percent covered by ice.  It occasionally freezes over completely.  Open water often persists in the center of the lake, because ice that forms there can be blown around or broken up by strong winds.<p>

<H1>Water Quality</H1>

Lake Superior is the cleanest, clearest, and coldest of the Great Lakes.  Underwater visibility is often 50 to 75 feet because of low concentrations of nutrients, suspended sediments, and organic material.  The water is usually more turbid at stream mouths, especially near the St. Louis River.  After storms and on windy days, the water in the western tip of Lake Superior is often reddish-brown due to suspended red clay eroded from the Wisconsin shore.<p>

Acid precipitation falls on Lake Superior as both rain and snow.  The lake is so large, however, that it has not been noticeably affected.  Spring runoff from the melting of acid snow could cause "pulses" of acidity in streams, which could cause problems for some spawning fish.  In general, however, acid precipitation should not be a serious problem in the near future.<p>

Toxic pollution in Lake Superior is low compared to the other Great Lakes.  Nevertheless, PCBs, dieldrin, toxaphene, and DDT pose a threat because they remain in the water and sediment for a long time, and can accumulate in fish.  Most of these toxic substances often come from the atmosphere, entering the lake through precipitation or dust.  Scientists believe that air currents may carry contaminants from hundreds or even thousands of miles away.<p>

Dieldrin concentrations have always been low in Lake Superior fish.  Studies on western Lake Superior show decreasing levels of DDT and PCBs.  Nevertheless, state advisories recommend that anglers limit their consumption to smaller fish of selected species.  For current fish consumption advisories, consult the state fishing regulations booklet, or call the Minnesota Department of Health (612) 627-5047, Pollution Control Agency (612) 296-6300, or Department of Natural Resources (612) 296-2835.<p>

<H1>The Fishery</H1>

The intentional and unintentional introduction of new fish and other aquatic species has caused great changes in Lake Superior.  This began before 1900, with stocking of rainbow trout (steelhead) and brown trout.  After 1965, coho, chinook, and Atlantic salmon, and splake (a cross between lake trout and brook trout) were added.  Only two kinds of trout are native to Lake Superior: lake trout and brook trout.<p>

Sea lamprey and rainbow smelt were introduced accidentally.  The lamprey, a parasitic fish, entered the Upper Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean after the Welland Canal was built to let ships bypass Niagara Falls.  Sea lamprey feed by attaching themselves to their prey, rasping a hole in the skin, and consuming blood and body fluids.  Each sea lamprey can destroy up to 40 pounds of fish in the 12 to 18 months it spends in the lake.<p>

Sea lamprey reached Lake Superior in 1938, and eventually decimated populations of lake trout and other large fish.  The lake's annual lake trout harvest, which had averaged 4.5 million pounds from the 1920s through the late 1940s, fell to 500,000 pounds by 1960.<p>

Although lamprey still cause severe losses of Great Lakes fish, their numbers are controlled chemically, mechanically, and biologically; immature lamprey are poisoned in their stream-bottom burrows, barrier dams are constructed to keep adults from entering rivers to spawn, and male lamprey are being sterilized and released to reduce reproduction.<p>

By the 1960s, rainbow smelt, which were introduced in the 1930s, became the most abundant fish in Lake Superior.  Smelt increased rapidly following the decline of the lake trout.  Native lake herring, the major food of lake trout and other predators, once provided an 18 million pound annual commercial harvest, but declined to near extinction by the mid-1970s.  Smelt, along with intense commercial fishing, may have played a key role in the decline of herring.  Since 1979, however, smelt have declined significantly and herring have rebounded.<p>

New exotics continue to cause changes that could have severe economic repercussions in the Great Lakes.  The ruffe ("ruff"), a perch-like fish from Europe, was first discovered in the St. Louis River in 1986.  By 1992, ruffe had become the most numerous fish in the river, as measured by trawl samples,  Biologists fear that the ruffe might spread to the lower Great Lakes and reduce whitefish and yellow perch populations.<p>

Bythotrephes cederstroemi, a European zooplankton (a tiny crustacean) known as either B.C. or spiny waterflea, first appeared in Lake Huron in 1984 and in Lake Superior in 1986.  It is now commonly seen on fishing lines in Lake Superior in late summer.  B.C., which can grow to about one-half inch long, might cause problems by eating smaller zooplankton, competing with some fish for food.  Unfortunately, fish that feed on zooplankton cannot eat B.C. because it is so large and has a long, spiny tail.<p>

The zebra mussel is another exotic species that affects the Great Lakes.  Although it is found in small numbers in the St. Louis River harbor area of Lake Superior, it does not appear to be reproducing there.  The zebra mussel is causing severe problems in the other Great Lakes.  Large numbers can attach to the interior surfaces of boat motors and water intake pipes, clogging them.  Zebra mussels can also attach to native mussels and smother them.  <p>

These new invaders ruffe, B.C., and the zebra musselare thought to have entered the Great lakes in ballast water discharged from oceangoing vessels.  A new requirement that ships exchange ballast water in mid-ocean may reduce the likelihood of other exotics entering and possibly disrupting the Great Lakes ecosystem.  <p>

Lake Superior's fishery has seen tremendous improvement in the last 25 years due to stocking, natural reproduction, and lamprey control.  The lake trout population continues to rebound.  Lake trout provide an excellent sport fishery and, in a few parts of Lake Superior, a viable commercial fishery.  In Minnesota, the commercial catch is limited to an assessment fishery: commercial gill-netters harvest a limited number of lake trout in exchange for providing biological information to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  Species currently harvested commercially include lake trout, whitefish, herring, chubs (deepwater ciscoes), siskowet (deepwater lake trout), and smelt.<p>

Trout and salmon continue to increase in size and number.  They support a viable charter and recreational fishing fleet that contributes significantly to the region's economy.<p>

<H1>Shipping</H1>

Lake Superior is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the St. Lawrence Seaway.  The 2,343 mile trip by boat from Duluth/Superior to the ocean takes about seven days.<p>

Duluth/Superior is the busiest inland port in the country.  In 1992 there were 35 ocean going vessels and 737 lakers (Great Lakes travel only), and in 1993 (January thru September) there were 50 ocean going vessels and 648 lakers.  Taconite (pelletized iron ore) and coal are the major domestic cargoes.  Taconite is shipped to steel mills on the lower Great Lakes.  Low-sulfur western coal is shipped to Michigan, where it is burned to generate electricity.<p>

<H1>Tourism</H1>

The Lake Superior basin is not extensively developed.  The basin is about 90 percent forested and has about 558,000 U.S. citizens and 147,000 Canadians.  There are only two large metropolitan areas: Duluth/Superior and Thunder Bay.<p>

Sightseeing, fishing, and pleasure boating draw people to Minnesota's North Shore.  In 1992, tourists spent $63 million in Duluth.  In the three north shore counties, tourists spent $436.9 million in 1991, creating an estimated 9,146 jobs.  Cook County, which borders Lake Superior and Canada, has the most tourism-dependent economy in Minnesota.<p>

Recreational boating continues to grow in popularity.  Between 1976 and 1984, the number of boats docked on western  Lake Superior increased 83 percent.  In 1984, about 1,350 boats were docked at seasonal slips in Minnesota and Wisconsin.  <p>

Numerous charter fishing boats operate in the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior.  There were 61 licensed charter fishing captains in 1992. <p>

Recreational SCUBA diving is also growing in popularity.  Divers are attracted to the North Shore's craggy coast, which is the final resting place for five shipwrecks.  Interesting underwater rock formations and shallow rock reefs also attract divers.  Although the water is cold, it is also very clear, making diving in Lake Superior and exciting experience.<p>

<H3>North Shore Climate</H3>
Lake Superior creates its own climate and weather because of its large size and average temperature of 40 degrees F. The lake's influence gives the North Shore a maritime climate, making it warmer in winter and cooler in summer than nearby inland areas. The lake also causes differences between the shore and inland areas in daily weather conditions like air temperature, cloud cover, and wind.

Although the lake tends to moderate seasonal temperature extremes, the North Shore is noted for its sometimes drastic  short-term weather  changes. Squalls are a summer phenomenon along the North Shore. They tend to arrive suddenly on hot, sticky days, and can be very dangerous for people who get caught on the lake. Even on shore, squalls can be an unpleasant experience. Often accompanied by heavy rains and strong winds, they can overturn a boater blow away a poorly staked tent.

An approaching squall often appears as a line of towering cumulonimbus clouds on the west or northwest horizon. These clouds, also known as thunderheads, are bright white and often have an anvil-shaped (flat) top. As the squall gets closer, the dark, ominous bottoms of the thunderheads can be seen.
<H3>Spring</H3>
Cool temperatures prevail in spring. The ice on Lake Superior often remains through April and into May. Occasionally, it even lasts into June. While inland areas begin to warm up, cool air predominates along the shore. When the ice finally melts, warm air flowing over the cool waters of Lake Superior produces fog. While fog can and does occur any time the lake is free of ice, it is more noticeable in May and June. These two months also have more days with light rain or drizzle.
<p>
The spring green-up is usually delayed for up to two weeks along the shore, as a result of cool air coming off the lake. Because of this delayed onset of spring weather, the transition between winter and summer conditions is brief.
<H3>Summer</H3>
Summers are generally pleasant and cool along the North Shore, with temperatures seldom exceeding 90 degrees F. The air is often calm in the early morning and shortly after sunset. During the afternoon, air cooled by the lake tends to blow gently onto shore in a sea breeze. During the night, the breeze is reversed and blows toward the lake.
<p>
The comfortably cool temperatures of the North Shore summer are ideal for many types of recreation. During hot summers, many people - especially city dwellers - cool off with a visit to the North Shore.
<p>
Prevailing winds are from the northeast during June and August and from the west-northwest in July. The wind can shift quickly, however; visitors should be prepared for sudden decreases in temperature when the wind blows off the lake. An average wind speed of 10 to 15 mph during the summer months makes sailing a popular sport on western Lake Superior.
<H3>Fall</H3>
Fall brings the most volatile weather of the year to the North Shore. Things start well: early fall can be the most beautiful time of the year. Lake Superior reaches its maximum temperature by early fall. This tempers the first cold days of the season, providing an extended autumn. The vivid fall colors peak between mid-September and early October.

<p>
Early fall is a quiet period, with onshore and offshore breezes as in the summer, but the transition between fall and winter occurs quickly. Snow flurries can occur in late October, but measurable accumulations usually do not stay on the ground until early November. By November, the polar front has moved southward from Canada. Low pressure systems form over the southwestern U.S. and central Rocky Mountains and move east or northeast toward the Great Lakes region.
<p>
"Nor'easters" occur in late fall when low pressure systems move northeast across central Wisconsin and into the hub of the upper Great Lakes. Violent gale-force northeast winds play havoc with sailing and merchant vessels. One  such storm, in 1975, took the <B>Edmund Fitzgerald</B>. As the low moves into southern Ontario, the wind shifts and the lake is buffeted by strong northwest winds. By December, the polar front generally extends south of the area. The lake still, still unfrozen, contributes energy to storms that move across it.
<H3>Winter</H3>
Dependable snow cover makes the North Shore a winder wonderland. the North Shore ridge holds the state record for the greatest snow accumulations and most days with snow cover. Snow generally covers the ground from November into April. The annual snow-fall averages about 55 inches near the lake and 78 inches along the North Shore ridge.
<p>
"Lake snows" occasionally blanket the shore with three or more feet of dry, fluffy snow in just a day or two. These occur while an extremely cold air mass is centered just north of Lake Superior. Light winds blowing across the lake from the east or northeast meet northerly winds moving down the shore. The snow falls in a narrow band where the winds converge.
<p>
Winter temperatures in northern Minnesota are known for their extremes. Along the North Shore, however, temperatures below -30 degrees F are uncommon, occurring only about once in two years.
<p>
Shore ice begins to form in late November and December, but significantly lake ice does not usually form until well into January. Until the lake freezes, its open waters continue to moderate  winter temperatures on the North Shore.
<p>
Another weather condition that can be dangerous for boaters is the "back door cold front", which can develop strong northeast winds in just a few hours, possibly without cloud formations as a warning. This cold front comes from the northeast instead  of the more typical northwest direction.
<p>
Watch out for the conditions that set up the back door cold front: a weak low pressure system along the central U.S./Canadian border, coupled with a slow moving Pacific front oriented north-south from the low, and a high pressure area with unseasonably cold air situated North of Lake Superior.
<p>
As the Pacific front moves slowly east across the Dakotas, residents of the Lake Superior area may have several warm days that inspire boaters to get on the lake. When the pacific front and its associated low reach Lake Superior, the counterclockwise flow of the low "taps" the cold air north of the lake and lets it flow across the lake unimpeded. Northeast winds behind this cold front race into western Lake Superior at speeds of 45-70 mph.
<p>
The back door cold front can occur almost any time of the year, but the winds are strongest in the spring and early fall, when the temperature contrasts are greatest along the northern tier of states.
<p>
The approach of bad weather may not be obvious. Boaters should be aware of weather patters and listen to the National Weather Service broadcasts on NOAA Weather Radio, Station KIG-64. Special marine warnings are issued when conditions are dangerous. The small cost of a weather radio receiver or a weather crystal for your scanner (162.55 mega-hertz) is a good investment. Taking chances with the weather can be a deadly mistake.

<H2>ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RECREATIONAL FISHING ON MINNESOTA WATERS OF LAKE SUPERIOR</H2>

<H4>By</H4>
<H3>Jeff Gunderson & Glenn Kreag</H3>
</Center>

<H3>SUMMARY</H3>

The recreational fishing industry (including charter fishing) on the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior contributed approximately $9.74 million dollars in direct expenditures to the state in 1990.  Based on the assumptions described below and using an economic multiplier range of 1.3 to 1.8, the state economic impact was estimated at $12.67 million to $17.54 million.  Estimates of the state economic impact can go as high as $34.43 to $49.06 million, depending on the source of the information.
<p>
Lake Superior's charters fishing businesses contributed $6.47 million and noncharter recreational fishing contributed $3.27 million of the total $9.74 million in direct 1990 state expenditures.  Using the economic multipliers listed above, charter fishing businesses generated $8.41 to $11.65 million in state economic impact while noncharter recreational fishing generated $4.25 to $5.89 million.


<H3>METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS</H3>

<H4>Charter Fishing</H4>

The 1990 estimated economic impact of the charter fishing industry was based on a 1987 survey conducted by Gunderson and Mahoney (Gunderson, 1988).  The economic information generated in that survey has been revised in this report to reflect the current number of charter captains and has been adjusted for inflation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index.  The 1987 study found that each charter boat generated $56,350 in direct customer spending in the Duluth-Superior metropolitan area and throughout Minnesota (we did not include the spending at home and in transit for the 15 percent of the clients that came from out of state).  This total includes spending for charter fees, licenses, food, lodging, travel, and entertainment.
<p>
If we adjust for inflation to estimate 1990 spending, then each charter boat generated approximately $64,730 in direct state spending.  Therefore the 100 charter boats operating in 1990 generated a total of $6.47 million in direct state spending ($64,730 X 100 = $6.47 million).  See Figure 1.
<p>
Figure 1.
<p>

People who go charter fishing on Lake Superior also spend money on dining, lodging, and other vacation expenses.  This totals $6.47 million in direct state spending and includes spending in the Duluth- Superior metropolitan area.  Sixty-five percent of this money is spent within 10 miles of the charter boat.
<p>
Expenditures coming into a community from outside are subject to a multiplier effect which creates additional economic activity.  For our region and this industry, it is reasonable to assume that a multiplier between 1.3 and 1.8 applies, depending on the local economy (personal communication, Dr. Wayne Jesswein, University of Minnesota-Duluth).  Applying this multiplier range results in a 1990 estimate of a state economic impact of $8.41 to $11.65 million due to the charter fishing industry. 1
<p>
1 The Minnesota charter fishing economic impact includes some spending that occurred in Superior, Wisconsin.  This is because local spending was defined in the 1987 survey as that spending which occurred within ten miles of the charter boat.  We, therfore, cannot separate money spent in Duluth or Superior by Twin Ports charter clients.
<p>
It was estimated in the 1987 study that each charter boat generated $37,000 in direct local spending.  Adjusted for inflation and the increased number of charter boats, this translates to direct local expenditures of $4.25 million and a local economic impact of between $5.52 and $7.65 million.  Local spending is spending that occurred within 10 miles of the charter boat.

<H4>Noncharter Recreational Fishing</H4>

The estimated economic impact of the noncharter recreational fishery is based on information from the 1985 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation, which was conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The survey reports that on average, $34 was spent per day of Great Lakes fishing.  Adjusting for inflation, the 1990 expenditures per day were estimated at $41.25.  Angler days were estimated from Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) summer creel surveys that report the number of Lake Superior boat and shore angler trips.  Minnesota DNR angler trips are essentially equivalent to the angler days of the USFWS survey.  The term angler days will be used in the rest of this report.
<p>
Angler days over the last 10 years as estimated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Spurrier 1985 and Morse 1989), have ranged from a high of 130,000 days in 1983 to a low of 58,000 days in 1984.  There were 88,300 noncharter angler days estimated in 1988 and 77,100 estimated in 1989 (no estimate was available for 1990).  The 1988-89 average of 82,700 angler days was used since it is representative of recent levels of noncharter fishing activity.
<p>
Anglers were divided into state resident (91 percent) and nonresident (9 percent) categories (personal communication with Stephen Morse, MN DNR).  Multiplying the 75,257 resident angler days times $41.25 per trip resulted in direct state expenditures of $3.10 million dollars.  We estimated nonresident angler expenditures in Minnesota by interpreting USFWS survey data.  We combined trip expenditures and license fees and omitted equipment expenditures to provide an estimate of nonresident expenditure within Minnesota of $22.03 per fishing day.  Total nonresident expenditures were, therefore, estimated to the $3.27 million.  Using the multiplier range of 1.3 to 1.8, the 1990 estimated state economic impact of the noncharter recreational fishery was $4.25 to $5.89 million.
<p>
Minnesota DNR 1990 Information (personal communication with Stephen Morse) shows that approximately 45 percent of anglers came for hometowns within 75 miles of where they fished Lake Superior, 47 percent came from 76 to 300 miles away.  These data are inadequate to separate the state and local economic impacts on noncharter recreational fishing.  We do, however, assume that the majority of the impact occurs locally.

<H4>Total</H4>

The combined 1990 charter and noncharter recreational fishing expenditures in Minnesota were estimated at $9.74 million, as described above.  The state economic impact of those direct expenditures was then estimated at $12.67 to $17.54 million, based on the economic multiplier range of 1.3 to 1.8.
<p>
Another estimate of the total economic impact of Lake Superior recreational fishing can be derived solely form the 1985 USFWS national survey.  The survey reports that 610,000 resident days of fishing took place on Lake Superior and its tributaries in 1985 (Table 83 of that report).  Multiplying the $41.25 expenditures per day (corrected for inflation) by 610,000 resident fishing days results in direct state expenditures of $25.16 million.  Out-of-state anglers (95,000 angler days) contribute an additional $2.09 million in expenditures in Minnesota (based on $22.03 per angler day for nonresidents - our interpretation of USFWS survey data).  The total 1990 state economic impact of recreational fishing on Minnesota waters of Lake Superior was then $35.43 to $49.06 million, using the multiplier range of 1.3 to 1.8. 2
<p>
2Multiplier Effect.  Sport anglers spend money on fishing equipment, travel, lodging, and related supplies.  These expenditures, in turn, can be viewed as sales, mobs, wages, and taxes generated.  Regional economic impact analysis is an attempt to measure more than just the initial direct expenditures.  Secondary impacts are also considered.  The degree to which total economic impact exceeds direct expenditures is a measure called the regional economic impact multiplier.  
<p>
The size of the multiplier depends on the size of the region under study.  Since economic development is regionally oriented, impacts outside the region are not counted, and are referred to as leakages will result in greater economic impacts.  If all the money spent in the region leaked out of the region, the multiplier would equal one (no change).  If half the money spent within the region leaked out and half stayed, there would be an initial economic multiplier effect of wages, and taxes.  If half of this second cycle leaked out and half remained, an additional .25 in economic impact factor would be added to the multiplier making the total economic impact 1.5 + .25 = 1.75.  There would be another .25 of money to enter a third cycle of sales, jobs, wages, and taxes.  If all of this leaked out of the region, there would be no additional impact and the total economic impact multiplier would be 1.75.

<H3>DISCUSSION</H3>

The estimated economic impact of the Minnesota Lake Superior recreational fishery was based on dated information and a number of assumptions.  One assumption was that the 1987 charter fishing survey was still reflective of the industry as it has grown from 67 licenses in 1988 to over 100 licensees in 1990.  The charter fishing estimates are conservative since only the 76 percent of charter clients who said they came only or primarily for charter fishing were included in the he estimates.  Nonresident charter client travel to the charter location was not included be cause we did not know there they spent their money even though a portion of it was surely spent in Minnesota.
<p>
We also assumed the Great Lakes - wide USFWS survey averaged expenditures by all types of Great Lakes anglers (perch, walleye, salmon, trout, smelt, etc.) from both boats and shore.  The USFWS also included estimates for fishing in Great Lakes tributaries for smelt, steelhead, and salmon.  We did not incorporate Lake Superior tributary fishing in our estimates of economic impact.  Therefore, our estimates not only exclude some Lake Superior fishing expenditures by underestimate the impact of boat anglers which, on average, spend more than stream anglers.  As a result, our economic impacts estimates for noncharter recreational anglers are conservative.
<p>
In 1985, the MN DNR estimated 49,477 angler days on Minnesota waters of Lake Superior while the USFWS national survey estimated 705,000 angler days (610,000 resident days and 95,000 nonresident days) of fishing on those waters.  A large discrepancy exists between MN DNR estimates of angler days on Lake Superior and those of the USFWS survey.  One factor that lowers the MN DNR estimates is that winter and tributary fishing are not included in the summer creel survey that we used.  This still does not explain the discrepancy.  We do not support or defend either estimates.  
<p>
Economic impacts vary considerable depending on which estimate of angler effort is used.  While the estimates presented here may not be as consistent or as precise as we'd like, they do provide a range of estimates based on the best information available.  The direct expenditures of all recreational fishing on Lake Superior is likely larger than our estimate of $9.74 million derived from Gunderson's 1987 Charter Fishing Survey and MN DNR creel survey information, but smaller than the $27.25 million estimated solely from the 1985 USFWS National Survey.

	Tourism is an important part of the economy of Duluth, MN.  Since 1980, the Minnesota Sea Grant Program has tracked the visitation at several of Duluths tourist attractions and published in the Duluth and Northeastern Minnesota Visitor Statistics Abstracts.  After 1990, the abstract was no longer published.
<img align=right src="/pubs/T10/dlthmap.gif" border=2>
<H3>Tourism Development</H3>

	Starting in the mid 1980s, the City of Duluth began to upgrade existing tourist attractions and develop new ones.  In particular, the city supported expansion of the Spirit Mountain Ski Area and the Lake Superior Zoo.  New publicly-supported attractions include the William A. Irvin ore boat, the Lake Superior Lakewalk multi-use trail, the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center, Bayfront Festival Park, skywalks and decorative brick street and sidewalk improvements downtown, and major infrastructure improvements in Canal Park to support the development of tourism and entertainment business development. 
<p>
	Hotels, restaurants, recreational services and retail shopping have grown significantly in the Canal Park and Fitger's Mall areas. Fond-du-Luth Gaming Casino operates in downtown Duluth. The North Shore Scenic Railroad is a joint public-private partnership.  New festivals and events are being added to the complement of attractions in Duluth.  The Bayfront Blues Festival, the Port of Duluth Tall Ship Festival, and Taste North Festival were heavily attended in 1994.

<H3>Tourism Growth in Duluth</H3>

	As a result of this development, there has been significant growth in tourism business.  Table 1 shows a steady rise in visitor numbers except for 1992-93 when cold summer weather and flooding problems in other parts of Minnesota cut travel statewide.  In spite of lower visitor numbers in the last two years, tourism spending has continued its steady increase (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table2.html">Table 2</A>) since 1982 reaching an all-time high in 1993 of nearly $110 million.  Similarly, hotel visitor nights (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table3.html">Table 3</A>) have increased; a total of  38% since 1980 and 59% from the 1982 low.  Nineteen-ninety-four figures for Tables 1-3 are not available, however above-average summer weather caused annual visitation to rebound.  Estimates by local hotel and tourist officials indicate that total tourism in Duluth was again at a record level.

<H3>Attraction Visitation</H3>

Visitation figures for various 
attractions (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table4.html">Table: 4</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table5.html"> 5</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table6.html">6</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table7.html"> 7</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table8.html"> 8</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table9.html"> 9</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table10.html"> 10</A>) provide a varied picture.  Canal Park Marine Museum 
(<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table4.html">Table 4</A>) has been one measure of 
general visitor activity for the city since it is a free attraction.  Recent declines however, may be due in part to other 
nearby free activities, particularly the Lakewalk and festivals and events at Bayfront Park.  There are no measures of visitation to these attractions but both are heavily used by residents and visitors.
<p>
	A large increase in visitors to the Spirit Mountain Ski Area (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table5.html">Table 5</A>) is the result of  expansion and the successful 
promotion of low cost annual ski passes. The Lake Superior Zoo's (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table6.html">Table 6</A>) increases are partly due to year-round counting begun in 1989 and expansion projects.  The zoo continues construction and expansion projects, which, along with cold weather, were primarily responsible for reduced visitation in 1992-93.  
<p>
	Some attractions have seen a gradual decline in total visitors.  Some feel this is because of  the many new attractions, festivals, and events that compete for visitors' time.  This may be especially true in the peak summer and fall months when many options are available.  It may also indicate that 
attractions must make continual efforts to stay competitive.  Managers must be innovative in finding new markets and aggressive in upgrading the quality and variety of their facilities and services.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

	Overall, there is no doubt about tourism's significance to Duluth.  In addition to economic activity that is produced by attracting visitors, the city's waterfront and its service base have been enhanced by tourism developments.  The enhancements are a matter of pride to local residents.  They have also created a new reputation and image for Duluth , which is looked on by some as a model of a desirable city in which to visit and live.  
<p>
	Tourism can  be an important part of the local economy but good planning is necessary to make it compatible with other community elements.  Residents should not feel that their city is being "taken over" by visitors.  There are limits to how much tourism should expand as a part of the total local economy in order to keep it from becoming perceived negatively by residents.  Maintaining an awareness of, and responding to local attitudes about Duluths tourism industry is important to keep the support for tourism strong within the community.

<H2>Survival in Cold Water:<br>
Hypothermia Prevention</H2>
<H4>by</H4>
<H3>Chad P. Dawson</H3></Center>
<HR size=3%>
Hypothermia is a risk for anyone who enjoys activities like boating, fishing, swimming, hiking, or skiing. It can occur quickly and it can be fatal.
<p>
Hypothermia occurs when the body's core temperature falls below its normal level of 98.6 F to 95F or cooler. It is the opposite of fever, when the body's temperature is above normal.
<p>
Hypothermia is dangerous because it affects the body's core - the brain, heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Even a mild case of hypothermia affects your physical and mental abilities, and increases the risk of accidents. Severe hypothermia causes loss of consciousness and may result in death.
<p>
Cold water is especially dangerous because loss of body heat occurs 25 times faster in cold water than in cold air. How quickly  you become hypothermic depends on many factors, including your personality and behavior, environmental factors, how you are dressed, and your physical condition.
<p>
Everyone reacts differently to the cold, even under the same conditions. Generally, children lose body heat more quickly than adults. Thin people lose body heat faster than overweight people. The expected survival times in Table 1 are guidelines for the average adult, showing the rapid onset of hypothermia as water temperatures drop.<p>

<H3>The Risk</H3>
Minnesota's inland lakes and streams are generally colder than 70F in winter and spring. Water this cold always presents the danger of hypothermia. Some northern  Minnesota lakes are cold year-round. For example, temperatures in western Lake Superior seldom exceed 70F, except in some bays and shallow beach areas.
<H3>Symptoms of Hypothermia</H3>
When you first fall into cold water you gasp, your skin begins to cool, and your body constricts surface blood vessels to conserve heat for your vital organs. Blood pressure and heart rate increase. Muscles tense and shiver; this produces more body heat, but results in a loss of dexterity and motor control. As your body's core temperature drops further, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rates all decrease.
<p>
As conditions worsen, your mental attitude and level of consciousness change. Resisting help and acting irrational or confused are common indicators of hypothermia. As your core temperature drops dangerously low (from 90F to 82F), you become semiconscious, then conscious.
Stress, shock, and low core temperatures may cause cardiac and respiratory failure.
<p>
Hypothermia symptoms intensify as your core temperature drops. Since each individual reacts differently, the severity of hypothermia is best measured by taking a core temperature reading using a rectal thermometer. Oral measurements do not accurately measure changes in the core temperature.
<H3>Hypothermia and the Diving Reflex</H3>
When a person's face comes into sudden contact with very cold water, the "mammalian diving reflex" may be triggered. This lowers the heart rate, increases blood pressure, shuts down blood circulation to all but the body's core. The result is a lowered metabolism, so the body can conserve oxygen. This may help survival in cold water, since oxygen in the blood is carried to the brain and vital organs where it is needed most.
<p>
As a result of the dive reflex, people submerged for more than four minutes (when brain damage usually occurs) have been successfully resuscitated. The chances for surviving such a near-drowning depend on water temperature (colder is better), length of time under water, age of the person (younger is better), and rescue efforts.
<p>
The dive reflex and hypothermia can lead to fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest. Survival depends on prompt first aid and medical assistance. Cold water near-drowning victims have been revived after as long as one hour under water. Professional medical care is needed to resuscitate these victims, but rescuers should not give up on victims of extended cold water submersion.
<p>
Persistence in first aid and rescue efforts is also critical for cold air hypothermia victims. According to hypothermia researcher Dr. Larry wittmers, "You aren't dead until you're warm and dead."
<H3>First Aid</H3>
Minimize the victim's physical exertion when removing her or him from cold water. Rescuers may have to enter the water to get the victim. Once out of the water, gently remove wet clothing and cover the person with dry clothing or blankets. Protect the victim from wind, especially around the head and neck. Get her or him into a warm environment promptly and avoid re-exposure to the cold.
<p>
Choose first aid methods based on the severity of hypothermia symptoms and the field conditions. Decide if artificial respiration or cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is needed, assess the severity of the hypothermia, and re-warm the victim.
<p>
During all first aid efforts, watch for changes in the victim's temperature and vital signs. "After drop" is a danger when re-warming hypothermia victims because cold blood in the extremities returns to the body core, lowering the core temperature further. See Table 2 for techniques to minimize the effects of "after drop". These general procedure assume a rescuer has no special medical training or equipment, will prevent further heat  loss, and will get professional medical help for the victim as soon as possible.<p>

<p>
To re-warm hypothermia victims in the field:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Use the body heat of a rescuer through maximum direct body contact. Both rescuer and victim should remove outer clothing and be wrapped in a dry sleeping bag or blanket to conserve body warmth. It is best to place the victim between two rescuers.
<LI>Apply hot water bottles or hot, wet cloths to the victim's head, neck, trunk, and groin. Change the water periodically to ensure a constant temperature. The water should be 110-115F to prevent burning.
<LI>Exhale into the victim's face as s/he inhales.
</UL>
Two additional re-warming methods require more equipment than usually available in field situations. These are best left to trained medical personnel: (1) administer heated, humidified oxygen to the victim at a temperature of 102-112F, (2) provide a warm bath of 100-115F water. Immerse the victim's trunk but keep the arms and legs out of the water. These methods should be used only on people without major injuries, who do not need resuscitation, and who have been hypothermic for less than 12 hours.
<p>
Hypothermia victims with moderate to critical symptoms should always be treated by medical professionals as soon as possible. After medical treatment, victims should be protected from the cold and kept warm.
<H3>Hypothermia Prevention: Methods and Equipment</H3>
Conserving body heat is essential for survival and for increasing your chances of being rescued. The rate at which a body cools varies with body size, age, gender, water and air temperature, waves, wind, water currents, and other factors. See Table 3 for examples of how different situations affect survival time for an average sized, lightly clothed adult in 50F water.. Four important prevention principles are illustrated.

</Table></center>
<p>
First, The more body area you keep out of the water, the better your chances for survival. The drown proofing technique of repeatedly lowering your head into the water and floating causes substantial heat loss, and is not recommended in cold water. If you have no personal floatation device and nothing to climb onto, tread water. If possible, climb onto your capsized boat or pull yourself out of the water onto floating object to increase your chances of survival.
<p>
Second, the more energy you use in cold water, the more your body cools off. To minimize your heat loss, use a personal flotation device and do not swim unless shore, a life raft, or an overturned boat is nearby. Swimming decreases survival time, and attempting to swim more than three-quarters of a mile accelerates heat loss and hypothermia. Remaining still in the water increases your survival time. 
<p>
Third, if you cannot climb out of the water, conserve body heat by remaining as still as possible and reducing the amount of your body exposed to the water. Protect your critical heat loss regions: the head, sides, armpits, and groin.
<p>
The Heat Escape Lessening Posture (H.E.L.P) can be used only if you are wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Hold your arms tightly against your sides and across your chest, pull your legs together and up toward your chest. The H.E.L.P position can be difficult to maintain due to wave conditions, PFD design, and body size. A group of two or more people wearing PFDs can huddle together to conserve body heat, offer moral support, and provide a larger target for rescuers.
<p>
Fourth, for the greatest protection against hypothermia, insulate the critical regions of your body with specifically designed PFD. A vest PFD offers more protection than a collar-type, and will improve your chances of survival. Insulated flotation jackets protect more of your body than vest or collar-type PFDs. A hood protects the head and neck area, and a removable seat panel reduces heat loss in the groin area.
<p>
Clothing made of modern water-tight materials like nylon and Gore-Tex help keep warm in and cold water out. While this water-tight fabrics decrease contact with cold water, they require carefully selected underclothing since the garments may not have built-in insulation. If flotation materials are not used, then a PFD must be worn in addition to water-tight clothes.
<p>
Regardless of what you use to prevent hypothermia - life vest, float coal, industrial work suit, survival suit, or drysuit - flotation and insulation are important in increasing your survival time. PFDs designed to prevent hypothermia are recommended for anyone who spends time on a near cold water. To increase your visibility in the water, add reflective tape to your PFD. A strobe light, whistle, or emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) will increase your chance of being rescued.
<p>
Since 1988, Minnesota has required duck hunters to carry a Coast Guard-approved PFD for each person in the boat. Even though the law requires merely having a PFD in the boat, wearing it is recommended. Trying to put on a PFD after falling into cold water is almost impossible.

<H2>Duluth Tourism Spending Doubled Since 1982</H2>
</center>
        Tourism spending in Duluth doubled from a low of 54 million in 1982 to a 1993 
level of 109 million (unadjusted for inflation), say Minnesota Sea Grant 
researchers.  Tourism spending also showed a steady increase during 1992 and 
1993 despite  a slightly lower number of tourists.  
<p>
        A research paper by Minnesota Sea Grant's Glenn Kreag and Jennifer Moe, "Trends
in Tourism Visitation - Duluth, Minnesota 1980-1994," also describes the effects
new tourist attractions have had on tourism and provides lists of visitor 
numbers for various Duluth attractions for the past 15 years.
<p>
        "Since the city made efforts to upgrade tourist attractions in the mid-1980's, 
there has been significant growth in tourism business," said Kreag.  "The Lake 
Superior-related enhancements on the waterfront, such as the Lakewalk, the 
William A. Irvin ore boat, and Canal Park development, are a matter of pride to 
local residents.  They have helped create a new image for Duluth, which is seen 
by many as a national model for designing shoreline areas for both visitors and 
residents."
<p>
        The total number of visitors to and through Duluth was up to 2.9 million in 
1991 from a low of 1.68 million in 1982.  Visitation in 1993 was down slightly 
at 2.3 million due to poor summer weather.
<p>
        Kreag says that there is opportunity for Duluths tourism to grow.  "Good 
planning is necessary to make tourism compatible with other community elements. 
Care needs to be taken so that residents don't feel their city is being 'taken 
over' by visitors.  Being aware of and responding to local attitudes about 
Duluth's tourism industry is important to keep the support for tourism strong 
within the community."

<H3>New Exotic Species Found in Duluth-Superior Harbor</H3>
<p>
</center>
	A new fishy invader, the first reported for Lake 
Superior, has shown up in the Duluth-Superior harbor.  It's 
the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus ), a small bottom-
dwelling fish with distinctive frog-like raised eyes and a 
black dorsal spot.  The 4-1/2 inch fish was found July 19 by a National Biological 
Service fishery research crew conducting a Minnesota Sea Grant project.  It was captured in five meters of water near the Blatnik Bridge during bottom 
trawling for Eurasian ruffe, another exotic fish.<p>
	
"Due to its large size, we think it's lived here 
awhile," said Doug Jensen, Minnesota Sea Grant exotic species 
information coordinator.  "These fish were originally  
introduced near Detroit via ballast water tanks from 
transoceanic ships.  The screening on those tanks is up to a 
half-inch.  So if this fish was introduced in that way, it's 
had some time to grow."<p>
	
Additional sampling in the area has so far failed to 
yield additional specimens.  The collected goby was preserved 
and is currently being held at the Minnesota Sea Grant 
Program office in Duluth.<p>
	
 Like the zebra mussel and ruffe, the goby is native to 
the Black and Caspian seas.  Round gobies were first 
introduced to America along with their cousin the tubenose 
goby in 1990 in the St. Claire River near Detroit.  The 
tubenose goby did not thrive, but the round goby has spread 
into lakes Erie, and Michigan where the largest population is 
now found.  Gobies eat aquatic insects, mussels and snails.  
They can grow up to a foot long, but specimens found in the 
Great Lakes so far have not exceeded seven inches.<p>
	
Gobies are considered undesirable because they compete 
with native fishes for habitat and change the balance of the 
ecosystem.  Round gobies are already causing problems for 
other  bottom  dwelling Great Lakes natives like mottled 
sculpin and logperch.<p>
	
"We think round gobies are so abundant that they are 
occupying a lot of the optimal spawning and hiding places of 
native species," said David Jude, a researcher at the 
University of Michigan's Center for Great Lakes and Aquatic 
Sciences who first discovered the goby in 1990.  "They have 
tremendous range expansion for a species that just got into 
the Great Lakes system a few years ago."<p>
	
Sea Grant is in the process of producing a fact sheet 
that describes the natural history of the goby. 	 
Ironically, in a fact sheet produced by Jude, he says, "We 
expect this fish to continue to expand its populations 
through natural movement into the upper and lower Great 
Lakes, and possibly by hitching a ride, like they did in the 
first place, on an intra-basin ship.  Thus, they could end up 
in Lake Superior sooner than we would predict from other 
considerations."<p>
	
Round Gobies have four characteristics that have allowed 
it to survive and thrive in  America.  
<UL>
<LI> They are aggressive and feed voraciously, with the 
potential to eat the young  of sculpins, darters and 
logperch.  Their aggressive nature probably allows them to 
occupy and defend spawning sites, preventing native species 
access to prime areas.
<LI>They have a well-developed lateral line system, 
almost unique among Great Lakes fishes, which allows them to 
feed in total darkness.  This can help them out-compete 
native fish for food.
<LI>They are robust--able to survive degraded water 
conditions.  This ability, along with its propensity to crawl 
into holes and other crevices probably allowed it to survive 
in the ballast of ships.
<LI> They spawn more often and for a longer period of the 
year than native fishes.
</UL>

round goby, please contact Jim Selgeby, National Biological 
Service, Ashland, WI, (715) 682-6163, or Doug Jensen,

The Minnesota Water Line, 1-800-455-4526, a toll-free 
phone service, is now in operation to provide citizens of 
Northeastern Minnesota with water information.  A Water 
Line specialist will talk with people in non-technical language 
providing information about household water issues, wells, 
septic systems, and other water-related concerns.  The 
service was developed to help local decision-makers and 
citizens find their way through the maze of water quality 
information and regulations, by answering questions 
directly, sending information, or referring people to 
appropriate volunteer professionals or agency staff.
<p>
The Water Line Coordinator will be available to take your 
calls from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday.  At other 
times, leave a message and your call will be returned.  The 
line is a pilot project available in 11 Northeast Minnesota 
counties:<p>

<H3>North Shore Trail Snowmobiling Brings 
                      &#36;2.1 Million to Local Economy </H3>
<p>
</center>
	Snowmobilers using the North Shore Trail spend an 
estimated &#36;2.1 million each year, mainly during multi-day 
trips.  A research paper by Minnesota Sea Grant's Glenn Kreag 
and Jennifer Moe, Minnesota's North Shore Snowmobile Trail:  
What is its value?, also describes how snowmobilers choose 
trails; how far they travel on their snowmobiles, for how 
long and with how many people.  
<p>
	The North Shore Trail is currently 152 miles long, 
running between Duluth and Grand Marais.  "The significance 
of the trail goes beyond the dollars it generates" said 
Kreag.  "It is a key resource that has helped stabilize the 
tourism industry by allowing tourism businesses to stay open 
during winter.  A longer tourist season has also attracted 
new development, creating a greater variety of facilities for 
all tourists, year-round.
<p>
	"The economic impact of snowmobiling is significant to 
the local economy of the North Shore in winter.  With growth 
of both residents and visitors in the area, more use can be 
expected making, the North Shore Trail a significant economic 
factor in the winter tourism business for many years to 
come," said Kreag.
<p>
	"Excellent trail maintenance is vital to continued 
snowmobiler satisfaction.  Even the North Shore Trail with 
its long winter season and high average snow cover 
occasionally experiences deteriorated trail conditions during 
peak weekends.  Other issues, such as management policies, 
crowding and safety may impact future growth.  Environmental 
quality and conflicts with other trail users are also 
concerns," said Kreag.
<p>
	Significant differences in spending and use exist 
between local (Northeast MN residents) and visiting 
snowmobilers.  For instance, resident snowmobilers travel an 
average of 282 miles on multi-day (2.7 days) trips.  Their 
party size is 15 people, and they spend &#36;7.86 per person, per 
day on food.  Visiting snowmobilers travel more, 367 miles, 
their group size is less, 6.8 people, but the time they spend 
here is more, 3.3 days.  They also spend more on food (&#36;9.64 
per person).
<p>

(218) 726-6191.  For more information about tourism, contact 
Glenn Kreag, (218) 726-8714.

<H3>Superior Lakewatch Program Seeks Volunteers</H3>
<p>
</center>
	  The Superior Lakewatch program is a way for citizens to 
help scientists monitor Lake Superior's water quality.  The 
program is seeking volunteer boaters from Minnesota with an 
interest in the environment who have a little time to spare.  
Volunteers are given a simple tool called a Secchi disk (an 
eight-inch circular metal plate painted white that's attached 
to a rope) to determine the transparency of the water.   
<p>
Tests need to be done at the same site six times between May 
and October.  The data volunteers collect enables scientists 
and policy-makers to make informed decisions about the 
management of Lake Superior.  
<p>
	  Think of it as giving Lake Superior a check-up.  
Benefits include an honorary basic membership to the Lake 
Superior Center.
<p>
	  If you're interested, please contact Elaine Ruzycki, 
(218) 726-6840, for more information.

<H3>MN Sea Grant Offers Information about the Rusty Crayfish</H3>
<p>
</center>
	The rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) has invaded 
parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ontario and many other 
northern areas.  Although native to some parts of the 
southern Great Lakes states, these crayfish have spread to 
many northern lakes and streams where they have caused 
ecological problems.<p>
	
Jeff Gunderson, Minnesota Sea Grant Extension fisheries 
educator, has just published the fact sheet, Rusty Crayfish:  
A Nasty Invader, that outlines the biology, ecological 
impacts and identifying characteristics of the rusty 
crayfish. <p> 
	
Rusty crayfish were probably spread by non-resident 
anglers who brought them north to use as fishing bait. 
	"These animals are just plain mean," said Gunderson.  
"They push out the more docile native crayfish and reduce the 
variety and amount of water plants and animals.   They can 
even lower some populations of fish."<p>
	
Rusty crayfish inhabit lakes, ponds and streams.   They 
generally use small pockets under rocks, logs and other 
debris for cover.  Rusty crayfish have been shown to reduce 
the abundance and diversity of aquatic plants.  "This can be 
especially damaging in our relatively unproductive northern 
lakes where beds of aquatic plants are not abundant," said 
Gunderson.<p>
	
 Although other crayfish eat aquatic plants and insects, 
rusty crayfish may eat twice as much because they have a 
higher metabolic rate and appetite.   They also feed longer 
and can attain high population densities faster.  This means 
rusty crayfish are more likely to compete with juvenile game 
fish for insect food than would native crayfish species.  
Displacement of native crayfish by rusty crayfish could 
result in less food for fish.<p>
	
"Environmentally-sound ways to eradicate or control 
introduced populations have not been developed and none are 
likely in the near future,"  said Gunderson.  "The best way 
to prevent further environmental problems is to prevent or 
slow their spread into new waters."<p>
	
It is now illegal in both Minnesota and Wisconsin to 
introduce rusty crayfish into any water body.  In Minnesota, 
it is illegal to sell live crayfish as bait, introduce 
crayfish from one water body to another or to transport live 
rusty crayfish.<p>
	
The good news is that they're tasty.  The harvest of 
rusty crayfish is just beginning in Minnesota and is 
expanding in Wisconsin.<p>
	
To get a copy of the fact sheet, contact MN Sea Grant, 
(218) 726-6191.  For more information about the rusty 
crayfish, contact Jeff Gunderson, (218) 726-8715.

<H3>"Paint the Town" Effort in Need of Paint</H3>
<p>
</Center>
	Paint the Town is an environmental awareness project 
that will take place during Storm Drain Stenciling Week, May 
15-21.  This is when storm  drains throughout Duluth will be 
stenciled with a DON'T DUMP message to discourage people from 
improperly disposing of pesticides, paints, antifreeze and 
used motor oil by dumping them in the street or down  a storm 
drain.  Storm drain water is usually not treated WLSSD, but 
is discharged directly into the St. Louis River or Lake 
Superior.  Improper dumping can contaminate ground water and 
drinking water supplies, and pollute our rivers and lakes.
<p>
	Recycled white spray paint from contributions to WLSSD 
will be used for the stenciling.  There is a shortage.  If 
you would like to donate, please bring your  left-over white 
spray paint to WLSSD before May 15.
<p>
	Paint the Town is sponsored by the St. Louis River 
System Remedial Action Plan.  It is supported by the Board of 
Water and Soil Resources and the MN Extension Service.

<Center><H3>MN Sea Grant's Federal Funding Doubled Due to Ruffe Threat</H3></Center>
<HR>
	Minnesota Sea Grant was recently awarded &#36; 2 million for 
the next three years by the National Sea Grant program for 
scientific research and education to help the public cope with 
the spread of the ruffe, an exotic fish species .  However, 
this effort is now in jeopardy while the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Commerce, State and Justice considers a 
rescission bill that would cut this exotic species research 
funding.<P>

	Since it was first identified in 1987, the Eurasian ruffe 
has become extremely abundant in the Duluth-Superior harbor.  
Estimated at three million strong, the spiny, perchlike little 
fish is now the most numerous fish in the St. Louis River 
estuary, as measured by trawl samples.  They are rapidly 
spreading eastward 180 miles along the south shore of Lake 
Superior towards the lower Great Lakes.<P>

	"It could be the ecodisaster of the 21st Century if ruffe 
get into the lower Great Lakes and escape to rivers and inland 
lakes," said Mike McDonald, Director of MN Sea Grant.   "They 
reproduce quickly and compete with other forage fishes that 
walleye, yellow perch and other sportfishes eat.  In the 
Duluth-Superior harbor, an estimated 70 percent of the fish 
are ruffe, and this could lead to major declines in 
sportfish."<P>

	"I took my daughter down to the harbor to catch her first 
fish and she caught a ruffe," said Carl Richards, aquatic 
ecologist with the Natural Resources Research Institute, 
University of Minnesota, Duluth (UMD).<P>

	"Most of our kids and grandchildren might end up having 
that experience if ruffe spread to inland lakes," said 
McDonald.  "Ruffe aren't big enough to be worthwhile for 
people to eat.  Predator fish prefer less spiny prey.  Ruffe 
are fairly tolerant of warm, productive waters, so they can 
spread inland if given the chance."<P>

	The &#36; 2 million award will be used for research to 
control the spread of the ruffe, to evaluate control 
strategies and to assess the ruffe's ecological impacts.   It 
will also be used to sponsor an international ruffe symposium, 
bringing together researchers from Europe and the U.S.  The 
award effectively doubles Minnesota Sea Grant's annual core 
federal budget.  <P>

	The ruffe is considered a serious threat to commercial 
and sport fishing because it can disrupt the delicate 
predator/prey balance vital to sustaining a healthy fishery.  
Before coming to North America, the ruffe's most recent 
expansion was to Loch Lomond, Scotland, where it may have been responsible 
for dramatic declines in the local perch 
population. <P>

	 Resource managers fear that if allowed to spread to the 
lower Great Lakes where the habitat is more favorable and the 
fisheries more vulnerable, the ruffe could have an even 
greater economic and ecological impact than they have had in 
the Duluth-Superior area. <P> 

	A recent economic analysis commissioned by the Aquatic 
Nuisance Species Task Force estimates that the annual loss of 
income to sport and commercial fishing due to a fully-
developed ruffe population in the Great Lakes could run to 
&#36;120 million.  <P>

	The House version of the 1995 rescission bill did not 
include the exotic species funding cut.  If the full Senate 
Appropriations Committee approves the bill, it will move to 
the Senate floor.  A  House and Senate conference committee 
would then work out any differences between the two bills.  
The bill would require the President's signature to become 
law. <P>

	MN Sea Grant is a federal-state-University of Minnesota 
partnership, with its main office at UMD.  It supports 
research, extension and educational programs related to Lake 
Superior and Minnesota's inland water resources.

<H3>Crazy Bear Designs Aides Zebra Mussel Prevention Efforts</H3>
<p>
</center>
	Zebra Mussels are one of the fastest-spreading harmful 
exotic species in the eastern half of the U.S. today.  To 
help inform people about what they can do to prevent the 
accidental spread of zebra mussels to inland waters, Crazy 
Bear Designs of Ashland, WI, has developed "Invasion:  Zebra 
Mussel," the first in a new line of exotic species T-shirts.  <p>
	
"We're concerned about the spread of exotic species," 
said Frank Gallik, spokesperson for Crazy Bear Designs.  "We 
want to let people know about the harm exotics cause and what 
can be done to prevent their spread." <p>
	
The "Invasion:  Zebra Mussel" T-shirt depicts an endless 
march of zebra mussels spilling from an overturned bait 
bucket.  Their implied destination:  your favorite waterway.  
The back of the shirt depicts news articles about the zebra 
mussel.  More importantly, it gives suggestions on how to 
prevent the spread of exotic aquatic species.  Each shirt 
comes with a "zebra mussel watch" identification card from 
Sea Grant.<p>
	
"Because Crazy Bear Designs feels strongly about this, 
we will donate &#36;1 to Minnesota Sea Grant for every T-shirt 
sold,"  said Gallik.<p>
	
Minnesota Sea Grant, a federal program administered 
through the University of MN, Duluth, has an Exotic Species 
Information Center, and was consulted on the T-shirt design.<p>
	
The Large and X-Large shirts retail for &#36;19, XX-Large 
for &#36;22.  For more information, call (715) 682-9665.  Dealer 
inquiries are welcome.

<p>
	Tourism is an important part of the economy of Duluth, MN.  Since 1980, the Minnesota Sea Grant Program has tracked the visitation at several of Duluths tourist attractions and published in the Duluth and Northeastern Minnesota Visitor Statistics Abstracts.  After 1990, the abstract was no longer published.
<img align=right src="/pubs/T10/dlthmap.gif" border=2>
<H3>Tourism Development</H3>

	Starting in the mid 1980s, the City of Duluth began to upgrade existing tourist attractions and develop new ones.  In particular, the city supported expansion of the Spirit Mountain Ski Area and the Lake Superior Zoo.  New publicly-supported attractions include the William A. Irvin ore boat, the Lake Superior Lakewalk multi-use trail, the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center, Bayfront Festival Park, skywalks and decorative brick street and sidewalk improvements downtown, and major infrastructure improvements in Canal Park to support the development of tourism and entertainment business development. 
<p>
	Hotels, restaurants, recreational services and retail shopping have grown significantly in the Canal Park and Fitger's Mall areas. Fond-du-Luth Gaming Casino operates in downtown Duluth. The North Shore Scenic Railroad is a joint public-private partnership.  New festivals and events are being added to the complement of attractions in Duluth.  The Bayfront Blues Festival, the Port of Duluth Tall Ship Festival, and Taste North Festival were heavily attended in 1994.

<H3>Tourism Growth in Duluth</H3>

	As a result of this development, there has been significant growth in tourism business.  Table 1 shows a steady rise in visitor numbers except for 1992-93 when cold summer weather and flooding problems in other parts of Minnesota cut travel statewide.  In spite of lower visitor numbers in the last two years, tourism spending has continued its steady increase (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table2.html">Table 2</A>) since 1982 reaching an all-time high in 1993 of nearly $110 million.  Similarly, hotel visitor nights (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table3.html">Table 3</A>) have increased; a total of  38% since 1980 and 59% from the 1982 low.  Nineteen-ninety-four figures for Tables 1-3 are not available, however above-average summer weather caused annual visitation to rebound.  Estimates by local hotel and tourist officials indicate that total tourism in Duluth was again at a record level.

<H3>Attraction Visitation</H3>

Visitation figures for various 
attractions (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table4.html">Table: 4</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table5.html"> 5</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table6.html">6</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table7.html"> 7</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table8.html"> 8</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table9.html"> 9</A>, <A HREF="/pubs/T10/table10.html"> 10</A>) provide a varied picture.  Canal Park Marine Museum 
(<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table4.html">Table 4</A>) has been one measure of 
general visitor activity for the city since it is a free attraction.  Recent declines however, may be due in part to other 
nearby free activities, particularly the Lakewalk and festivals and events at Bayfront Park.  There are no measures of visitation to these attractions but both are heavily used by residents and visitors.
<p>
	A large increase in visitors to the Spirit Mountain Ski Area (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table5.html">Table 5</A>) is the result of  expansion and the successful 
promotion of low cost annual ski passes. The Lake Superior Zoo's (<A HREF="/pubs/T10/table6.html">Table 6</A>) increases are partly due to year-round counting begun in 1989 and expansion projects.  The zoo continues construction and expansion projects, which, along with cold weather, were primarily responsible for reduced visitation in 1992-93.  
<p>
	Some attractions have seen a gradual decline in total visitors.  Some feel this is because of  the many new attractions, festivals, and events that compete for visitors' time.  This may be especially true in the peak summer and fall months when many options are available.  It may also indicate that 
attractions must make continual efforts to stay competitive.  Managers must be innovative in finding new markets and aggressive in upgrading the quality and variety of their facilities and services.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

	Overall, there is no doubt about tourism's significance to Duluth.  In addition to economic activity that is produced by attracting visitors, the city's waterfront and its service base have been enhanced by tourism developments.  The enhancements are a matter of pride to local residents.  They have also created a new reputation and image for Duluth , which is looked on by some as a model of a desirable city in which to visit and live.  
<p>
	Tourism can  be an important part of the local economy but good planning is necessary to make it compatible with other community elements.  Residents should not feel that their city is being "taken over" by visitors.  There are limits to how much tourism should expand as a part of the total local economy in order to keep it from becoming perceived negatively by residents.  Maintaining an awareness of, and responding to local attitudes about Duluths tourism industry is important to keep the support for tourism strong within the community.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Business news and comment is published daily, weekly and monthly year after year. So, what is unique about the business news carried by the magazines of Business Magazine Group?                                              Well, for a start, our news concentrates on issues and matters directly concerning the area each magazine is serving.  We try extremely hard not to duplicate news already being adequately covered in both national and trade press.  We know that news such as this serves an excellent purpose.  But its strength is not regional companies, regional areas, regional people - and certainly not regional issues. This, however, is the strength of our editorial service.  And this is our editorial philosophy.
<P>Every month, local business and professional people can read about each other, about each other's companies and practices.  They can read about the area in which many of them live and work.  And they can read about the issues that affect those areas. Included is news about companies, their achievements, their products and their people.  
<P>Every month we are writing about local and regional companies in a completely unashamed way.  We don't edit out names of companies and we don't hide the news of a company's success.  In fact, we want all the news we can get about the massive regional forces that exist within the UK.
<P>Each magazine regularly reviews UK companies of all sizes across a broad spectrum right in their heartland.  However our main aim is to create a platform for SME's.
<P>Our regional presence enables us to keep track of the continuing changing business environment and its effects on the companies in each region so our database of companies is constantly being changed. We estimate there will be 30,000 updates to our database this year to reflect these changes. Indeed, due to the number of changes, the information regarding the circulation in each region is presented as an insert, produced each quarter for all magazines.
<P>Our business magazines are completely dedicated to the provincial and regional angle.  No half-hearted effort here.  Each magazine has an ABC audited figure.  Each regionally-based editor invites comment from many local business and professional people.  We want the relevant regional view by people with whom readers do business. See, meet and socialise - rather than a distant politician, adviser or economist.
<P>By now, you should understand why we are unique. There is no other ABC audited regional group of magazines like us in the UK.  We are the biggest and, every month, we deliver by direct mail 85,000 named executives throughout the UK. This figure increases substantially when including our readership.
<P>In short, we are a group of regional magazines with national quality and independently audited circulation's.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>On the road with LDV</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="van.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>All eyes on the future...LDV drives ahead with the<BR>launch of the new Pilot and Convoy models</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><B>With a bold new range the Birmingham-based van maker is rapidly proving to be the pride of the British automotive manufacturing industry. SHARON SARGENT takes a look at the company that leaves the competition standing.</B>
<P>In three short years LDV has achieved the kind of success that is making it the envy of automotive producers worldwide: maintaining sales growth on home ground, developing strong export markets, doubling production facilities and achieving consistent profit and turnover growth.
<P>It's not a bad result for the Birmingham-based van maker, established only in 1993. Led by chief executive Allan Amey, the company took a long, hard look at itself and its market, and took some positive steps to lay the solid foundations that are now proving crucial in its long term success. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>UNIQUE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Unlike all its major competitors - such as Ford, Mercedes, VW, Renault Fiat, Citroen and Peugeot - LDV is unique because it is able to focus wholly and solely on the van business and van operators. This makes a fundamental difference both to the way the company operates and the way it serves its customer base.
<P>Indeed because the company only makes vans, and its customers depend on these vehicles as working tools, LDV maintains an extremely close customer commitment. The company's foundations have always been based within the policy of providing van operators with the best service in the market and giving them exactly the products they want to buy. The company's ability to manufacture vehicles tailored exactly to customer requirements - for example vans converted for breakdown assistance by the AA or fully equipped mobile workshops for British Gas - makes it the envy of the van making industry.
<P>This specialisation has seen LDV secure a number of new and significant fleet contracts and enjoy a substantial increase in sales to smaller businesses and traders over the last three years - UK registrations grew by 23 per cent in 1994, a further ten per cent in 1995, and in the first four months of 1996 increased by over 20 per cent! 
<P>And pre-tax profits for 1995 of &#163;23.3 million on a &#163;216 million turnover have just been announced - a positive trading performance which underpins LDV's ability to invest in new products, facilities and markets to maintain its forward momentum as the UK van specialist.
<P>Indeed, all eyes are now on the future as LDV reaches the culmination of its three year, &#163;30 million development programme - Project Bulldog - with the launch of the new and highly competitive Pilot and Convoy models.
<P>Designed to replace the popular 200 and 400 van ranges respectively, Pilot and Convoy feature redesigned bodyshells and fittings, completely new cab interiors, engineering improvements for quieter and smoother running and extensive anti-corrosion measures. They form the new face of LDV and are the single most important event for the company since its establishment. 
<P>In typical fashion, their launch has not been achieved without a huge effort on LDV's part to listen to its customers - over the past three years it has carried out the most intensive polling of van users and researched the biggest market proportion of any manufacturer. It found that customers rate its products highly for value for money and practical attributes, thus the renewal programme has driven towards the sensible objective of focusing substantial, but not extravagant, investment into enhancing the total competitiveness of the range. 
<P>And with its entire management team based on one site in Birmingham, and no corporate parent to appease, LDV has an autonomy unique in the automotive manufacturing industry. The company is free to choose its own marketing style, preferred partners and sources of components according to its own detailed knowledge of its customers' needs and preferences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>GROWTH</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>But, as Amey is keen to point out, the launch of the new ranges is not the end of LDV's product renewal programme - it is the beginning. He says: "Right from the start - just three years ago - we set our sights on running a marathon rather than a 100 yard dash so that we'd create a long-term, secure future for our business. We didn't set objectives for spectacular, short term growth. We planned and are achieving the steady, profitable development of a rock solid business - one that is going to be competing and winning for a long time to come.
<P>"As the van specialists we plan to evolve our vehicle ranges continuously to maintain a competitive edge, not only in the UK where we are the strong number two in the sales charts, but also in our overseas markets." 
<P>To assure that edge LDV has adopted a strategy of developing into key overseas markets through working with distributors who have specialist, local marketing knowledge. Already agreements have been signed with Andoria in Poland and AAD in the Republic of South Africa, who both take vans in kits and add local content before marketing them in their own country. As these markets develop they will become the hub for sales into adjoining countries, thus maximising the long term potential for LDV and its partners.
<P>Agreements have also been signed with companies to distribute LDV products in France, Germany Benelux, Spain, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, and the Middle and Far East.
<P>The Birmingham production facilities are certainly equipped to be equal to the challenge that will come with rising export numbers. To meet increasing demand for its vehicles, LDV has been investing heavily in new production facilities and processes over the last three years, doubling production to 400 vans a week. The first major innovation was made in 1994 when the company invested &#163;3 million to completely update its top coat paint facility. State-of-the-art electrostatic robots were installed to spray both the interior and exterior of the bodyshells, and a new medium solid polyester paint process introduced to give a deeper paint lustre and more durable gloss finish. More recently, LDV has embarked on a programme to modernise and maintain the competitive edge of its press shop - one of the largest in Europe. Increased output means that as well as meeting all of its own presswork needs, the company can match the increasing sales generated from a Land Rover presswork contract. 
<P>A new compressed air generation system has been installed to give considerable energy savings and efficiency gains. Also an &#163;8 million, fully automated press line is now on stream, increasing capacity and flexibility allied to consistently higher quality pressed panels. At the heart of this new line are six new drive power presses with a total capacity of almost 4,500 tonnes. 
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="man.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Custom orders...producing special option<br>vehicles</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>The presses - equipped with variable speed drives and electronic encoders - ensure that the line can be operated at optimum flow rates, and to speed the flow of panels between each press LDV has specified a total of nine multi-axis robots. Five of these are the latest Fanuc M-500s specially designed for interpress work - it is the first time they have been used in the UK.
<P>Three hydraulically powered die carts have also been installed to substantially reduce the time taken to change the press tooling and give further gains in productivity. And in an aid to good housekeeping, all scrap metal from the press line is automatically carried away by an underground conveyor and placed in recycling bins outside the press shop. 
<P>Of course, the success of the increased production facilities would not have been possible without the support of a larger workforce - LDV has created some 500 new jobs over the last three years taking employee numbers up to 1,500 today. Not all the jobs created have gone to support the increased output. As a company that is constantly looking forward, last autumn LDV recruited a further 35 design and manufacturing engineers to its technical team to underpin the next phases of its new model programme.
<P>That new model development process had begun in August 1993 with a detailed evaluation of what customers and potential customers regarded as LDV's existing product strengths and weaknesses. This confirmed that LDV's vans compared favourably with competitive products, more than meeting their primary purpose of delivering the goods. Indeed, more and more competitors are now imitating the space-efficient, squared-off load space and the bonneted configuration that have always been the trademarks of the 200 and 400 series. What was needed now was to build upon these strengths and improve standards of quality, style and refinement to match the best of the rest. A major programme of design and engineering improvements, Project Bulldog, was initiated, drawing upon the resources of several world-class design consultancies and managed by LDV's own technical group under technical director John Rae. Once again LDV spoke to its customers first - the research for Bulldog involved hundreds of owners and fleet operators right through from the initial concepts, to the clay model stages, to the finished vehicles. 
<P>The results gathered from all this information have been fed progressively into the project to ensure that the new Pilot and Convoy models really do meet the performance and styling criteria set and endorsed by the customer.
<P>"The new names - Pilot and Convoy - underline the fact that these vehicles have a new character altogether," explains Amey. "We have focused on creating a much stronger, all-round proposition, particularly from the driver's point of view. They feel better, they're a lot quieter, they're more refined, and there's a lot more attention to detail. We have retained LDV's rugged, reliable, fit-for-purpose character...and the new design and anti-corrosion protection has allowed us to address those areas where we knew customers wanted improvements."
<P>For example, the tough new polypropylene front bumper mouldings have separate corner pieces so that the most common kind of accidental damage is easily and inexpensively repaired, and the front end panel structure is also simplified to give improved build and easier repair. 
<P>Servicing access to the power units is enhanced by widened bonnet apertures, and the Pilot has a light, corrosion-proof plastic bonnet. Underpinning a new six-year corrosion and two-year cosmetic warranty is the comprehensive use of zinc-coated steel throughout the new Pilot and Convoy bodyshells.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="guyonpc.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Hi-tech...computer-aided design was used to develop<BR>Pilot and Convoy models</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Driver comfort has been of prime consideration in the redesign - after all many operators spend their whole working day in the cab. Completely new cab trim and equipment have transformed the working conditions for users, for example improved Isringhausen driver's seats incorporate padded head restraints and extra lateral support, and a new LDV signature fabric is used for seats and door trim inserts. Moulded door trims are cleverly formed to act as door pulls and armrests, while a capacious new driver's side door bin can easily swallow bulky items such as soft-drink bottles, sandwiches and clipboards. The stylish and comfortable new steering wheel is smaller in diameter to exploit LDV's standard-fit power steering and new high-quality control stalks add a touch of extra class.
<P>Enhanced year-round comfort and safety comes from a new more powerful state-of-the-art heating and ventilation system, which includes wide window demist vents. Other new interior details include an upgraded radio/cassette player, new moulded/fabric trimmed headlining and improved sun-visors. And drivers' vision has been improved by installing new shape headlamps with 40 per cent more light output, and new wiper arms and linkages which give neater blade parking and a larger swept area.
<P>To add to the comfort, and as part of the overall Bulldog programme, a &#163;1 million, noise, vibration, harshness reduction exercise has been carried out. This has aimed to reduce general in-cab noise level, particularly the boom effects that can occur at Motorway cruising speeds.
<P>Analysis of drive train resonances led to a number of detailed engineering changes to isolate and damp out the causes of boom.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>QUIETNESS</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Combined with new acoustic insulation measures, these changes put Pilot and Convoy on a par for refinement and quietness with the leading competitors in their sectors. 
<P>Amey is confident that this new product range forms the basis of an exciting new era for LDV. And with a major new advertising campaign now launched there is no reason why the name LDV should not become as well-known as Ford, Mercedes or VW. "LDV has arrived and we are here to stay," he says. "Having made a step-change as a company in terms of our product, our service and our national profile, we are going to carry on reinforcing it again and again and again. From the boardroom to the pub. From the major transport depot to the jobbing builder at the end of the street. When the name LDV is mentioned the response will be 'yes I know them...solid company...good products... great service...LDV are the business'. "</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>NATWEST CORPORATE BANKING SERVICES</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Once upon a time, there were many in the business community who would have seen their bankers as anything other than knights on white chargers. But banks are changing, and NatWest intends to be at the forefront with the kind of service that legends are made of. RACHEL THORNTON reports...</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=6>Enchanting banking</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="malc.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Malcolm Thomas, Regional Managing<BR>Director of NatWest Corporate Banking<BR>Services</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Once upon a time, so the fairy tale goes, there was a bank manager who offered an overdraft to a student at 9.30am, a commercial mortgage to a company director at 10.30 and a small business development loan to an entrepreneur at 3pm. Nineties fairy tale banking is slightly different; a student banking officer will arrange a student overdraft, a corporate manager will facilitate a commercial mortgage and small business adviser will discuss a small business loan with the business customer.
<P>Banking has undergone a revolution - gone are the days when customers paid homage to the gods of lending discretion. Customer is finally king and the smart banks have instituted wide scale change to bring their services more in line with nineties consumer requirements. And NatWest most definitely counts itself as one of the smart number...</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>In early 1995 the decision was taken to restructure the high street banking arm of NatWest. Although it was well represented throughout the market there was a considered need to offer a wider choice to retail customers whilst specialising in business sizes. Corporate Business Centres, first introduced in 1986, are dedicated to meeting the needs of corporate customers with typical turnovers of &#163;1million to &#163;250 million. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>SUBORDINATE</FONT> 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The recession was an eye opener for many in the business community and, emerging from recession, businesses are no longer satisfied with a subordinate position in the banking equation. Gearing up to fight overcapacity in the marketplace the banks are selling their services to a customer base with greater service expectations than ever before and which demands broader support in return for long term loyalty. 
<P>Companies are looking to their banks to provide them not only with superlative products but also, in an increasingly competitive business environment, to play a key role as corporate business advisers. 
<P>In response to these demands grew the concept of relationship banking, one which NatWest Corporate Banking Services has adopted as the cornerstone of its whole operation. Three strands reflect the issues that NatWest feels are important to its customers, as Malcolm Thomas, Regional Managing Director, outlines: &quot;Firstly, we are a committed partner who can be relied upon. Secondly, we are consistent in our commitment to the corporate market, and thirdly we are proactive in personally demonstrating to our customers that we understand their business and we value them.&quot; 
<P>To a corporate client, a solid and open relationship with their banking partner is imperative as banking requirements become increasingly sophisticated and their financial problems demand more advanced solutions. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>SUSTAINABLE PROFIT</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>To the bank, a commercial organisation needing sustainable profit for growth, the relationship with its customers would be nothing if not based on mutual understanding, trust and benefit. Where once understanding a business came about through stiff meetings in a manager's office, bankers are increasingly keen to get out to 'the shop floor' both in response to their own wish to see and touch the business, and in response to customers' needs for the banks to understand their operation as well as their financial requirements. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>CRUCIAL</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="guy.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Mike Elliot, Corporate Director of<BR>Southern Devon Corporate Business<BR>Centre, on a site visit with a major<BR>construction client</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Mike Elliott, Corporate Director at Southern Devon Business Centre, explains that the exchange of information is critical if he is to provide the most efficient service: &quot;The two-way exchange of information can be the key factor in enabling the bank to offer the right kind of assistance. In essence, a bank that is kept informed throughout is better able to anticipate customer requirements and respond appropriately. Information is crucial, irrespective of whether it is encouraging or discouraging. There are many finance directors who are happy to keep their bank advised of all positive developments but there is an equal need, of course, for candour in adverse circumstances. Put simply, bad news is generally far more useful than no news.&quot;  
<P>The assigning of a corporate manager to your account marks the start of NatWest's ongoing commitment to sharing your goals. This understanding enables the corporate manager to identify your business requirements and recommend solutions which adapt to changing trading conditions. So what is NatWest doing to ensure the free flow of information between its customers and corporate managers is encouraged? </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>COMMUNICATION</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Initiatives such as pre-advice charges and transparent interest calculations were the first steps, closely followed by formal communication channels to provide customers with information on structural or personnel changes which may affect them. 
<P>In a long term relationship the NatWest corporate manager sees his role as representing your business interests and acting as a gateway to the spectrum of products, services and specialised resources that make up the NatWest Group portfolio. The services corporate clients can harness to gain a competitive edge include specialist corporate financing; the innovative NatWest Bankline Cash Management System for streamlined electronic banking, financial services for international trading and further solutions which straddle payroll and personnel management, insurance and pensions, card services and other vital business functions. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>HEARTLAND</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>At the South Western heart of NatWest Corporate Banking Services is a 100 strong team of highly experienced corporate managers operating from 30 Corporate Business Centres across the region. And NatWest is certainly not one for resting on these laurels for in a programme of constant development and improvement, 30 additional corporate managers have been appointed since 1995 in the South West alone. &quot;NatWest has already initiated a number of positive changes to enhance the service provided to our larger business customers,&quot; says Bill Smith, Corporate Director, Severnside Corporate Business Centre. &quot;The introduction of more corporate managers, increased training and new technology means that the structures and mechanisms are in place to ensure that we respond effectively to the needs of business in the South West. The changes we are making are designed to put responsibility in the hands of the staff closest to our customers.&quot; 
<P>And to those customers, to whom payment is the lifeblood of their business, effective payment management services are at the very top of their list of considerations when selecting a banking partner. A NatWest corporate manager aids customers in selecting the optimum combination of transmission services from the array on offer, tailoring an account access package via branches, cash centres, central processing centres or electronic systems to meet customers' individual needs. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>CLEARANCE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="smith.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Bill Smith, Corporate Director of<BR>Severnside Business Centre</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Chris Stone, a Corporate Manager based in Swindon, explains the flexibility of such a system: &quot;However your customers choose to pay you, we can help. Cash and cheques can be delivered to the branch or local processing centre via a courier and for cash we give same day value wherever it is banked. We provide a comprehensive clearance system for cheques and offer a variety of specialist options for customers with larger volumes or particular collection requirements. And of course, there is the option of collecting payments automatically by direct debit.&quot; 
<P>In making payments NatWest offers BACS to facilitate three day payments to suppliers or staff electronically or alternatively, customers can choose to make payments using a cheque book linked to their account or, where speed is important, CHAPS offers same day guaranteed value payments in the UK. NatWest are confident that its reconciliation services will enable you to keep track of your incoming and outgoing payments however they are made. 
<P>Of course, the service on everyone's lips in this hi-tech age is electronic banking. However Keith Haisman, Head of NatWest's Cash Management team, is quick to point out that NatWest has been hi-tech for decades: &quot;With all the publicity being given to the Internet and surfing the Web, you would think that communications networks are something new. In fact, NatWest has been providing on-line banking services for over 20 years.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>FLEXIBILITY</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>NatWest currently has about 29,000 users of its electronic banking services and it assures those not certain as to whether electronic banking is for them, that the flexibility and comprehensive features of the services guarantee that businesses of all sizes will find benefits to suit them. 
<P>The entry level electronic service designed to help organisations across all sectors improve efficiency, cost control and competitiveness is NatWest Bankline Cash Manager, a system which offers a comprehensive balance and transaction reporting service and incorporates the core elements of security and system administration. Keith Haisman takes up the story: &quot;Last year we started to move our services to a Microsoft&copy; Windows&#153; platform and the take-up has exceeded all our expectations.&quot; One NatWest corporate client who has been benefiting from Cash Manager for some time is David Baker, of Vikoma International Ltd accounts department, who has overseen the reporting of all Vikoma's sterling and foreign currency accounts on the service. He says: &quot;I have instant access to payments going in and out. I use Inter Account Transfers to keep all accounts in credit and move any surplus to deposit. The Bankline ties you in to an unprecedented level of control and efficiency which is now indispensable to us.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>PAYMENT MANAGER</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="pyt.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Working for you - NatWest's Cash Manager</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>This year NatWest has been working with its customers to launch Payment Manager, a brand new service which allows them to make international and domestic payments from their own PC. 
<P>This system makes possible transworld payments in a range of currencies, payable immediately or at a future date - and all from the keyboard at your desk. And for those companies for whom getting the most favourable exchange rate is critical, the Foreign Exchange Rates Viewer provides up-to-the-minute rates at the touch of a button, enabling you to spend your time exploring new ways to improve and develop your business. 
<P>And as your business develops, NatWest sees itself as a tailor of financial solutions to meet your diverse business needs. The Commercial Fixed Rate and Variable Loans are committed facilities with a variety of flexible repayment alternatives such as a low start option if you forecast strong cashflow in the medium term but seek lower payments in the short term. The scheme allows customers to take advantage of fixed rates for up to two months before the funds are required, which is especially appropriate for capital expenditure as the term of the loan can usually be matched to the expected lifespan of the asset purchased. 
<P>NatWest has pioneered many unique and innovative products in response to customer demand including the Committed Funding Line. This is a 365 day committed facility providing a comforting alternative to the standard 'repayable on demand' overdraft facility used to finance working capital. The Corporate Banking team, with its specialised knowledge of supporting major enterprises in complex industrial sectors such as aerospace or railways, is constantly developing new products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>BALANCE SHEET</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>For example, Elevator Finance is a mezzanine finance product that provides borrowing capacity to cash-generating companies whose ability to raise growth finance is constrained by their balance sheet. 
<P>Another arm of the NatWest Group is assisting businesses with their foreign exchange transactions and as many businesses will know - foreign exchange management can appear daunting and confusing. NatWest Market's aim is to help and assist mid-corporates which have significant exposure to the foreign exchange markets. NatWest Markets is the leading corporate and investment banking arm of the NatWest group. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>MAJOR FORCE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Its Treasury business is a major force in the foreign exchange market and is one of the top ten operations worldwide. As part of NatWest Markets' commitment to corporates in the South West it operates a treasury centre based in Bristol. From this base it is linked by real time technology to a global treasury in London so that by instantaneous communications NatWest is continually updated on market information and pricing remains competitive. NatWest Markets will spend as much time with the individual company as necessary to get to know the business thoroughly. Once it understands the exact requirements NatWest will suggest the most appropriate treasury services to meet the customer's needs. 
<P>It is all too aware that anything with the potential to reduce risk and maintain or increase profits is important to today's businesses. This is especially true of foreign exchange movements, which can have significant impact on the bottom line. It is often thought that only companies with easily identifiable currency cash flows are subject to vagaries of exchange rates. This is by no means the case as the influence of exchange rates can extend to all areas of business. To appreciate why this is, it is essential that companies identify the exposures they face. 
<P>The economic health of the region appears to be growing and certainly NatWest has experienced an increase in enquiry levels from businesses looking to expand their international trade activities. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>INTERNATIONAL SERVICES</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>NatWest International Trade and Banking Services (ITBS) provides international banking services to business customers involved in all types of import/export trade, as well as having responsibility for maintaining and developing relationships with overseas banks all around the world. Paul Ramplin, Senior Manager for ITBS explains: &quot;We aim to become the bank of first choice for all our customers engaged in international trade. 
<P>For it is international business to which companies must turn if they want to increase their market share, their turnover, and critically their bottom line.&quot; 
<P>The organisation works with its customers in developing tailor-made solutions that increase their international competitiveness and trading superiority. Among the services offered are low cost, innovative international funds transfers; letter of credit, inward and outward bills, ECGD-backed finance, bonds and guarantees, currency accounts and international trade finance. Many of the South West's largest companies have been built on their ability to buy and sell in overseas markets. International trade is the lifeblood of the economy. So should you consider extending your business from your home market? What is the scope for increased profitability? Will it be worth the effort and how should you go about it? 
<P>&quot;It is important at the very outset to talk to the bank about how to maximise your potential and minimise the additional risks that can arise because your customer is in another market and country,&quot; adds Ramplin. He concludes: &quot;We help our customers to grow their international business effectively and profitably by developing an in-depth understanding of their ongoing needs. 
<P>Trading internationally offers a different challenge and NatWest ITBS can help businesses succeed. What we offer is a powerful combination of capability, innovation and quality across a comprehensive product range at competitive and flexible tariffs.&quot; 
<P>Just as the corporate manager is the gateway to a range of services available through the corporate division, NatWest Corporate Banking Services is the key to a huge spectrum of additional products and ancillary services provided through the NatWest Group, its subsidiaries and associates. The 1995 Pensions Act requires many companies to change their pension arrangements - but how many are clear on exactly what this will entail? NatWest Insurance Services (NWIS), the independent financial advice arm of NatWest which has a specialist service for corporate pensions, recognised the implications of the Act. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>NATIONWIDE PRESENTATIONS</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="paul.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Senior Manager for NatWest International<BR>Banking Services, Paul Ramplin</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>A pilot scheme was set up here in the South West in 1995 by Richard Harrison, who runs the salesforce at NWIS, and Malcolm Thomas, Regional Managing Director of Corporate Banking Services. The changes required by the Act were then highlighted to corporate bankers in a series of nationwide presentations. This gave them sufficient knowledge to raise the matter with clients, which in turn generated considerable interest. A further series of countrywide presentations was set up, this time for the clients, with as many as 100 attending each one. These will continue through the remainder of the year and into 1997. Many of the clients were unaware of the requirements of the Act and, where appropriate, an NWIS representative was able to give an independent review of their pensions arrangements. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>REASSURANCE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>This meant that areas of change could be identified and dealt with, whilst reassurance could be given that other arrangements were perfectly satisfactory. 
<P>Plymouth-based computer software consultants, SAA Consultants, asked NatWest to review its pension arrangements as a result of this process. What SAA was trying to achieve was a pension scheme that was considerably more streamlined and cost effective to run. Val Griffin, administration manager at SAA says: &quot;Our previous arrangements were cumbersome and awkward. We were concerned at the cost of running the scheme and felt sure that we could organise something which would give the company and the members a better deal.&quot; 
<P>The result was a Group Personal Pension plan (where employees have individual contracts with the insurer under a company 'umbrella') with life cover of three times salary and group permanent health insurance. Both the group life and permanent health insurance schemes have guaranteed costs for short periods (two to three years), so that full reviews can be undertaken at appropriate points to check the selected insurers remain the most competitive. 
<P>Val Griffin comment: &quot;NWIS came up with the best terms of all the people we spoke to and really took on board the importance of cost to us. It is good to know that we can review the scheme regularly.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>FLEXIBLE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Wiltshire TEC is another South West client which works with NatWest corporate banking and NWIS. They also have a group plan in place which allows them to be particularly flexible in terms of employee contributions, gives life cover and again, permanent health insurance. David Simpson, financial controller for the TEC says: &quot;NWIS designed a very flexible scheme which gave great confidence to our employees.&quot; 
<P>NatWest's Malcolm Thomas comments: &quot;Sometimes, clients do feel a little suspicious if we recommend they reconsider their pension provision or look more closely at their insurance arrangements. It's not normally a banking area after all. However, the full independent review conducted by the NWIS representative is of great benefit and saves them considerable time as well as, frequently, cost.&quot; NWIS' Richard Harrison echoes this: &quot;Working together means that we can do our best to provide a seamless service for the client.&quot; 
<P>If NatWest Corporate Banking Services could compel its existing and potential customers to do just one thing, it would be to take a fresh look at NatWest and ring the changes. Partnership paves the path ahead and NatWest Corporate Banking Services intends to be your business' gateway to the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../../logor.jpg" ALIGN="right"><IMG SRC="../../title.jpg">
<P><FONT SIZE=6>Change of Gear For Darlington Commercials</FONT>
<P><B><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="recep.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>L to R...General managers Iain Knox<BR>(Washington), Dave Williams<BR>(Darlington), Jim Forster<BR>(Bedlington) and Mike Harrington,<BR>sales manager</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Darlington Commercials' new MD, John Woolnough, is facing the challenges presented by the changing transport industry with confidence as MARK LANE discovered.</B>
<P>The commercial vehicle market has changed dramatically in recent years. One of Volvo's most powerful regional franchises is moving with the times as the North East's traditional industrial base is gradually replaced by a new generation of emerging companies and industries. Darlington Commercials has a long-established reputation for excellence in customer care, a reputation that is sure to grow with the introduction of a new, forward-thinking managing director and his ambitious plans for creating new jobs, strengthening the company's apprentice intake and a market led revamp of its after-sales service. 
<P>None of this would be possible, of course, without the backing of the acknowledged UK market leader, Volvo. Not only does Volvo produce the most technically advanced commercial vehicles on the market, including all its own vehicle parts (in stark contrast to many of its competitors) but it also has a rock solid network second to none in the industry, a network that provides a reassuringly sound all-round service to its customers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>NEW LIFE</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="trucks.jpg"></TD></TR></TABLE>The man handed with the responsibility for modernising the service provided by Darlington Commercials is John Woolnough. The motor trade runs strongly through his veins (his father was the owner of a number of garages) and his background suggests that an untapped potential is likely to be realised. 
<P>Instilling new life into Darlington Commercials is a fresh challenge for John, a challenge which he is clearly relishing. He regards his appointment as an itinerant one and will perform a dual role in which he becomes chairman of sister franchise Duffields of Norwich. 
<P>&quot;I will assess the situation here before making firm plans,&quot; says John. &quot;Darlington Commercials is a well established business with a good reputation - but there is undoubtedly room for improvement. For a start there are increased levels of customer service we can meet. In these efficiency-seeking times, our clients deserve the very best in bumper-to-bumper service - we aim to take ownership of all matters relating to the vehicle leaving them to concentrate on the day-to-day running of their businesses.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P><FONT SIZE=4>LOYALTY</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="mechanic.jpg"></TD></TR></TABLE>John believes that the first step to achieving this goal is to increase the number of staff devoted to the service side of the business. Darlington Commercials has recently started to provide a 24-hour service which will put great strain on its staff resources if it achieves the increase in business that John confidently anticipates. 
<P>The strength of Volvo and its franchises has been traditionally underpinned by its commitment to apprenticeship schemes, the organisation preferring to train people from school age. This approach builds loyalty in employees as they gain a comprehensive knowledge of Volvo's operations right at the start of their careers. The system fosters a feeling of family and encourages total commitment from staff. &quot;We currently have eleven apprentices,&quot; says John Woolnough. &quot;But we want to move closer to the 68 apprentices employed by Duffields because it is the best way in the long-term to produce fitters of the required standards.&quot; 
<P>The pace of change in vehicle technologies requires staff training to be an ongoing process at Darlington Commercials. All technical staff regularly attended courses at Volvo's training headquarters in Warwick. John plans to have more training carried out on-site in the North East as he feels that it is often more effective in workers' own environments. 
<P>Darlington Commercials currently employs 110 but John expects this figure to increase by an approximate 50 per cent over the next few years. &quot;To get more business you have to have more people,&quot; he explains. &quot;We have to increase our capacity because customers rely on us for their livelihood. Trained professional people are your greatest asset.&quot; John plans to change the company structure in order to create expanded career development opportunities for its employees. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>IDEALLY PLACED</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="onetruck.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Darlington Commercials can help companies<BR>establish control over the inherent peaks and<BR>troughs of vehicle costs</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Darlington Commercials currently operates three strategically sited depots in the North East, although the new MD plans to increase this number. As well as its Yarm Industrial Estate headquarters, there are sales and service operations at Bedlington, Northumberland and Washington, the most recently established site. They are ideally placed to provide a fast and efficient service to North East customers. John is looking to bring Darlington Commercials even closer to its customers by introducing smaller sites, no more than 20 miles apart, to facilitate the highest attainable levels of customer service and convenience. 
<P>The Bedlington operation is set to play a more significant role in the company's development as the industrial base widens north of the Tyne. 
<P>The Washington depot also holds great potential. Darlington Commercials' sales department is now based there and the company is fast developing a truck rental business, headed by Jean Brackenridge, which reflects the changing needs of its clients, both current and potential. &quot;What the truck business needs today is total flexibility and rental is the most flexible option for the customer, although not necessarily the cheapest. Rental suits many companies because it takes out uncertainty and provides very clearly-defined costs,&quot; says John. 
<P>The strength and coverage of the Volvo network provides greater assurance for Darlington Commercials' customers beyond this region. The company is backed nationally and internationally by a web of sister distributorships and dealers, operating across Britain, Ireland and the Continent, all dedicated to serving the Volvo operator. This is one of the major benefits of dealing with an international company. 
<P>Darlington Commercials has travelled a steep upward path since its establishment in 1971 as part of the family-owned RG Tait &amp; Sons. Its potential as a North East base was quickly recognised by Volvo and the company became part of the Volvo Trucks group in 1980, absorbing Tait Bedlington in the process. All connections with its founders were severed in 1981 when the two branches collectively became known as Darlington Commercials. In the late 1980s, the new company bridged the gap between the north and south of its territory with the building of the flagship Washington branch, filling the need for local support across its increasingly important central belt. This investment was made at the tail-end of what was a cruel and lingering recession for the transport industry and was, in fact, planned some years previously, when the recession was at its worst; the plan being implemented as soon as confidence in a prolonged recovery could be justified. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>GREAT SADNESS</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Regrettably, John Langan, who played a pivotal role in the development of Darlington Commercials, died in 1994 after loyally and popularly serving the company for 22 years. He is widely acknowledged as the pilot who took the company through the recent recession and ensured it emerged in such great shape. &quot;It was with great sadness that John passed away,&quot; remembers John Woolnough. &quot;His untimely death caused great heartache with the staff, the customers and his fellow associates at Volvo and within the Volvo Distributor network. It does show the sort of business that truck distribution is when you see the reaction of people to such a sad occasion.&quot; 
<P>John Langan's death coincided with a rapidly changing customer base and customer requirements at Darlington Commercials. The core industries of the region, which the company had long supplied, were adversely affected by changes in the modern world economy and the time had come to stand back and reassess Darlington Commercials' standing in the market. Pit closures and the disappearance of other heavy industries had a catastrophic effect upon the traditional haulage industry. 
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="service.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Darlington Commercials is increasing its levels of<BR>customer service</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>The company quickly recognised the new opportunities presented by an upturn in the construction industry and, particularly, the rise of the storage and distribution industries to serve retail customers. There has been a general shortening of links between the manufacturer and retail customer. The heavy commercial vehicle plays a vital part in the distribution chain. This is an area in which John Woolnough anticipates a significant increase in business for Darlington Commercials. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>TRANSITIONAL PERIOD</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>John is well-qualified to oversee this transitional period in the North East transport industry. He served his apprenticeship at Humbers before moving on to Commers, who were great exporters of vehicles at the time. His wide experience there gave him a proper grasp of both the technical and service sides of the commercial vehicle business and he learnt important lessons in the art of taking a lateral approach to problem-solving. He eventually turned full circle by returning to work for his father, whose company had become part of a major motor group. John became a part of an eleven-strong team that had responsibility for 154 garages. In 1973 he decided to make the move into commercial vehicles. &quot;After the petrol crisis that year I felt that the car trade wouldn't be the same again so I took up a post as general manager at Duffields of Norwich, a major Volvo dealer,&quot; recalls John. 
<P>Ten years later he became a director, eventually becoming managing director in 1987. During his time at Duffields, the dealership built an outstanding reputation for a high level of service and commitment to customers and became one of the largest of its kind in Europe. 
<P>The changing economic trends of the region and the growth of new service industries and the attraction of widespread foreign investment has required Darlington Commercials to introduce a fresh approach. Value for money is, of course, a key issue. The capital intensive road haulage and distribution industries, in which competition is fierce and profit margins are slim, requires a variety of flexible finance and service options through hire purchase, buying vehicles outright, contract hire and operating leases etc. Financial planning is of prime importance to clients. Unplanned vehicle downtime can make the difference between profit and loss, and can lead to the loss of a valued distribution contract for instance. Darlington Commercials appreciates that value for money applies from the moment of initial enquiry through to the time that a vehicle is returned as a trade-in against a new truck. The truck manufacturer has to provide more efficient vehicles and services tailored to meet operators' precise needs, to give them an edge in the markets they serve. 
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="making.jpg"></TD></TR></TABLE>Once again, the backing of Volvo is vital to Darlington Commercials' proven ability to meet this important need. The company has created and developed a total transport package which ranges from advice on vehicle specification, through guidance and practical assistance on finance and contract maintenance to driver training and parts and service availability. Whether the customer is an owner/operator with a single Volvo truck or a major account running a large fleet, the same level of service applies. 
<P>Darlington Commercials and Volvo have produced a flexible portfolio of financial service products. These range from simple contract maintenance and finance lease through to operating lease and full contract hire, the latter removing all the risks associated with vehicle ownership, including the cost of maintenance and repairs for a predetermined sum. &quot;We are connected to Volvo's own truck finance house. This gives us the ability to tailor-make a financial package for a customer,&quot; explains John Woolnough. &quot;Volvo has recognised the importance of financial planning and provides a flexibility that our rivals find it hard to compete against. We can help companies establish control over the inherent peaks and troughs of vehicle costs.&quot; 
<P>The overall outlook for the haulage and distribution industry is encouraging. The nature of the business has changed and freight must be moved more efficiently in the modern era. The ambition of John Woolnough and his new team combined with the extensive experience of the Volvo parent operation guarantees that Darlington Commercials has an integral part to play in the resurgence of our region.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>BALFOUR KILPATRICK</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>What do you do if your main markets go stagnant? TIM HUNTER reports on a major company that is successfully reaching out to grab new business.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=6>Strategy sparks strong growth</FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="busb.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Generator busbars, Sizewell 'B' nuclear power station</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Being a well established player in a mature market is not without its challenges, particularly for a company with ambition. For one thing, it can severely limit the opportunities for growth. For another, it can suffer from the fact that shareholders tend to prefer the hare to the tortoise when it comes to corporate performance.
<P>Many large UK companies have found themselves having to deal with this tricky combination, not least those involved in construction and infrastructure development. There are a number of ways to handle this, but one Renfrew-based company has successfully implemented a strategy which, if not unique, is extremely effective.
<P>Balfour Kilpatrick is the electrical contracting arm of construction giant Balfour Beatty, itself a subsidiary of the multinational cable manufacturer BICC. Around the beginning of this decade, recession, combined with the effects of government energy and transport policy, started to produce a degree of stagnation in Balfour Kilpatrick's main markets within the UK, so it began to look elsewhere. Finance director Graeme Taylor explains: &quot;Recognising that the UK would continue to be depressed - the signs are that major capital spend is not likely to pick up before 1998 - we took the decision in 1991 to see if our skills could be exported.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>HISTORY OF OVERSEAS WORK </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>It sounds quite simple when you put it like that, but Taylor's remark needs to be put in context. The company has a wide spread of activities, though always connected with electric power, ranging from power station installations to railway electrification and telecoms. It has been active in overseas markets since 1925, when it carried out an electric installation contract for J&amp;P Coats in Hungary. Therefore, what Taylor is referring to is more a change of emphasis than a radical policy shift, but a brief look at the company's history will help us to understand its significance.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P><FONT SIZE=4>NATIONAL GRID </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The roots of Balfour Kilpatrick can be traced back to 1899, or to 1854 if you consider its earlier incarnation as a plumber. In those days the company was known as James Kilpatrick &amp; Son, electrical contractor, a name that was to remain until 1971, when it was changed to Balfour Kilpatrick following the previous year's merger with BICC. Kilpatrick had got in at the ground floor of the electrical business, just as the industry was beginning its phenomenal expansion. Despite knowing very little about electricity, Kilpatrick was very successful in his enterprise, and by the late 1920s the company he had established was carrying out major works for the new national grid. 
<P>A great deal of Balfour Kilpatrick's growth can be traced to its involvement in such infrastructure projects, and by the time of its assumption into BICC it had a lengthy portfolio of completed projects, ranging from Hunterston power station to a jute mill in Bangladesh and a hydro-electric dam in Iraq. There were also subsidiaries, both in the UK and overseas: the company owned businesses in Australia, South Africa and Jamaica, as well as having several branch offices in the Middle East; the first manufacturing subsidiary, Lounsdale Electric, was set up in Paisley in 1956 to make switch gear. In addition, the concentration on employee skills as a foundation of company strategy was firmly in place, with a new training school opened in 1968. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>GROUP MEMBERSHIP </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Balfour Kilpatrick was already an important player in electrical contracting, perhaps even the foremost in the UK, before it became a part of BICC, but being a member of a huge group brought further enormous benefits. By 1980, the company employed 8,500 people and turnover had reached &#163;140m. Latest figures for the year to 1995 show turnover at &#163;300m, with 3,000 direct hourly paid employees and another 1,300 staff. 
<P>In terms of structure, Balfour Kilpatrick is made up of five operating divisions, reflecting its spread of activities: International; Power Construction; Manufacturing; Cabling; Projects and Installations. 
<P>Projects and Installations deals with electrical works from design to commissioning for power generation, offshore platforms, industrial and commercial applications. While there is a wide variety of projects, the division has suffered from changes in energy infrastructure development, says Taylor: &quot;The dash for gas in the last five or six years has brought a different type of power station, which reduces the involvement of a company like Balfour Kilpatrick. The government's approach to nuclear installation also restricts our areas of opportunity.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>WIDER DIMENSION </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="stat.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Tuen Mun metro system, Hong Kong</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>The picture is not so downbeat for the Power Construction Division. Again it has a wide scope, but it is primarily responsible for the design and construction of overhead power transmission lines, including those for railway electrification. Much of the work comes from regional electricity companies and the national grid, with the higher voltage contracts tending to cluster around the London area. In contrast to Projects and Installations, Power Construction does carry out work overseas, and, to give one example, it is currently looking at a PFI scheme in Pakistan to build a 500kV transmission line. Working overseas adds an important dimension, because regulation in the electricity industry has had a major effect on capital programmes in the UK. For the railway electrification business, the uncertainty surrounding privatisation has curtailed investment to some extent, but in addition to carrying out the electrification of the east coast main line, Balfour Kilpatrick has been sustained in recent years by the biggest single project the division had undertaken at that time. In joint venture with a French company, Balfour Kilpatrick gained a &#163;237m contract to provide the power and electrical installation for the Channel Tunnel. More recently the company has gained an important $320m contract for electrification of the Amtrak's North East Corridor between Newhaven and Boston in America, but we'll come back to that later.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P><FONT SIZE=4>FIBRE OPTIC </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="steel.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Power and control cabling, steel production</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Another increasingly significant part of the division's activity is concerned with telecommunications. Technology advances now permit fibre optic cables to be incorporated into power transmission lines with relative ease, in one instance by replacing the earth wire with an optical fibre ground wire. With deregulation in the telecoms market, the opportunities should be immediately apparent, and Balfour Kilpatrick is carrying out work for Scottish Telecom and Energis, the telecom subsidiary of National Grid. In the US particularly, the new capability holds tremendous potential because it is so cost effective for new networks over such large distances: in comparative terms, using transmission lines can cost around a third the normal cost of a dig and lay type operation. 
<P>Just as Projects and Installations works in the UK market, the International Division operates in a similar fashion overseas. Most of the projects are undertaken through its area offices or joint ventures in Hong Kong, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman, though one-off projects are also carried out where Balfour Kilpatrick does not intend to establish a permanent base. At present, the biggest single market is in Hong Kong, and within that, a huge percentage of the work derives from the construction of Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok airport. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>SUBSEA EXPERTISE </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The final main contracting division, Cabling, handles high, medium and low voltage power and communications links for industrial, railway and civil engineering applications. It works through a number of area offices within the UK, including an undersea cabling branch based at Erith in Kent. Most of the division's work is in the highly specialised niche market of high voltage supertension power lines within the UK, and while it is an extremely cyclical business, there are few competitors. This is particularly true in undersea cabling, and the division has a large portfolio of completed contracts, including the 45km cross channel link in 1985, a subsea installation between Java and Madura, also in the 1980s, and a 1993 contract to link three Morecambe Bay platforms to mainland power. The largest current subsea contract is between the mainland and the Isle of Wight for Southern Electric, and the division benefits from its experience with Hydro Electric in Scotland providing power to the Northern and Western Isles. In recent years this activity has been supplemented with underground fibre optic installations for the growing telecoms market - the division's current work in Aberdeen provides a good example - which helps to offset low points in the business cycle. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>VERTICAL INTEGRATION </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="lines.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>The Channel Tunnel terminal, Cheriton: overhead power<BR>lines are an important niche market</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Clearly, being a part of BICC has many advantages for Balfour Kilpatrick, as does the link with Balfour Beatty. Such vertical integration is a feature of the BICC group, and continues in the structure of Balfour Kilpatrick itself. The company's fifth division is made up of four manufacturing subsidiaries, the first of which, Lounsdale Electric, has already been mentioned. In addition to producing switch gear, the company also installs a new fibre optic product manufactured by BICC Brand-Rex in Glenrothes. The others are Cruickshank and Partners of Inverurie and Sri Lanka, Emform in Kirkby and Painter Brothers in Hereford. Taken together, the four businesses manufacture the hardware to complement Balfour Kilpatrick's contracting operations, including electrical substations, isolated phase bus bar and bus ducts, steel for transmission, communication and railway electrification structures, and Callendar Hamilton bridges. 
<P>The decision to focus more strongly on overseas markets coincided with the appointment of Robert Lundy as managing director. He describes the strategy in more detail: &quot;Our traditional M&amp;E market is very much in its mature phase in the developed countries like the UK, US and western Europe. This limits our opportunities outside this country, particularly when you consider that those markets are already well served by local competitors. There are therefore two ways to deal with this. Firstly, we can look at other parts of the world where there is market growth - Hong Kong is a good example. Back in 1992 when the UK market was literally falling about our ears in terms of volume, we knew that Hong Kong had major growth potential, so we did a survey of the expected volume of business there in our sector, and how long that was going to last. We also looked at the capability of local companies to cope with the work. The result suggested there was 10 years of work, and local competitors would be able to handle only about 30 per cent of that, so there was a clear and immediate need for Hong Kong to bring in outside contractors to cope with the volume. In the event we were perhaps a year adrift against our projections, but we have now exceeded those targets.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P><FONT SIZE=4>LIVE LINE WORKING </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="dish.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>Transmitting tower, Corby</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>&quot;The second tactic is to use the exceptional skills we have in certain niche areas, like railway electrification, where we have a design capability really on the front edge of technology, and large design and build transmission projects such as the one we're currently negotiating in Pakistan. To give another example, in the communications business we have considerable experience in working on live lines with helicopters, which sets us apart from the competition.&quot; 
<P>Balfour Kilpatrick had something of a head start in the US, as Lundy explains: &quot;Our parent company has a very large organisation in America - called Balfour Beatty Inc, based in Atlanta - so that critical mass already existed. On the Amtrak contract we are working hand in glove with Balfour Beatty on a joint venture basis.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>JOINT VENTURE </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>In power and telecoms, Balfour Kilpatrick is developing its American business by establishing a joint venture with a transmission line company. While there is some scope for growth in construction and refurbishment of tranmission lines, telecoms business offers a major opportunity, says Lundy: &quot;There are 30 or 40 utilities in the US all wanting to do their own thing. The beauty of it is that because it's such a vast country, trunk networks are obviously very long, so the utilisation of transmission lines for carrying fibre communications is very cost effective. Because of recent deregulation it's a fairly new phenomenon in being able to see a market there at all, but projections are for considerable growth.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>FAR EAST EXPANSION </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Returning to the traditional business in growing markets, the company's experience in Hong Kong is being repeated in other areas - Balfour Kilpatrick expects recent expansions in the Philippines and Thailand to come to fruition in the course of the next 12 months. 
<P>In addition to targeting niche and emerging markets, there are two other important strands in the Balfour Kilpatrick strategy. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>ANNUAL APPRENTICE INTAKE </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="cable.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>66kV cabling carried out at a chemical plant</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>A recurring theme which can be traced a long way back in the company's history is a concentration on developing employee skills. It's easy to see why, not least because working with high voltage power lines is extremely complex and requires high levels of expertise. That theme continues to the present day - there is an annual apprentice and graduate intake, and there are around 200 apprentices employed at any one time. Lundy is convinced this is a key strength of the business: &quot;I think part of our success can be attributed to the continuation of our apprentice and graduate training, when a lot of our competitors decided they did not wish to incur those costs any more. I believe strongly that is why we have been profitable throughout the recession. In fact it's pleasing to see how the pendulum has swung because we're now finding clients, British Airports Authority is one example, who are insisting contractors must employ their own labour. We directly employ 75 to 80 per cent of our labour, and that is not the case with many of the other major contractors.&quot; 
<P>While a skilled and reliable workforce is the great benefit of this policy, there are other advantages. A number of Balfour Kilpatrick's current senior managers began as graduate or apprentice recruits with the company, Lundy among them. This has been a feature of the business over the years and it promotes continuity and stability, though there can be dangers, as Lundy is aware: &quot;You could say I might be introspective since I've not worked with any other company. But the other side of the coin is that I've been long enough in this market to see that it is very cyclical, which is a strength in being able to project, predict and manage the business.&quot; Lundy has also noticed a market trend which plays into the hands of a large multinational group, namely, customers are tending to demand complete turnkey solutions. For Balfour Kilpatrick, with the construction support of Balfour Beatty and the cable technology of BICC, there are obvious advantages, but the group can also work to increase that capability. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>BR ACQUISITIONS </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>One example of this in action can be demonstrated by Balfour Beatty's bids for former British Rail infrastructure companies. It now owns two of them outright, and one in joint venture with the management, and this has filled a gap in its competence, as Lundy points out: &quot;We were one of two or three major railway companies that had both electrification design and track laying capability. What we didn't have was a particular expertise in railway maintenance or signalling, and buying the BR companies has brought in these skills. We are now able to offer a much broader service to a client, not just in the UK but hopefully worldwide.&quot; The picture is repeated within Balfour Kilpatrick itself, as three of the four manufacturing subsidiaries are also design houses and installation contractors. 
<P>Linked to the benefits of vertical integration in this market environment is the financial strength deriving from being a part of BICC, as Taylor explains: &quot;Bonding is a requirement for businesses carrying out major construction work. In the UK this is usually default bonding which you can get from insurers, where the beneficiaries have to prove something has failed and whose fault it is, but overseas the standard is on-demand bonding, in which the bond can be called in before any fault is established. These bonds have to come from banks, and when it comes to granting bond facilities, banks tend to view them just like overdrafts, so the financial backing of BICC is a significant competitive advantage.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>PLAYING TO STRENGTH </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=0 align=right cellpadding=5><TR ALIGN=left><TD><IMG SRC="bridge.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>132kV substation: the Channel Tunnel was a major source<BR>of business in an otherwise fairly static market</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>Returning to the theme of changing strategy, as can be seen from the comments above, Balfour Kilpatrick has come a long way in the course of altering its business profile, but it has always sought to play to its strengths even when moving into new areas. Confidential figures based on existing and future contracts suggest the strategy has been implemented successfully thus far, showing huge gains for 1996 and the subsequent two years, both in total revenue and the proportion coming from foreign contracts, particularly in the field of Power Construction. Taylor summarises: &quot;We can't just decide one month to go out internationally and have it just happen, and we don't view this as short term. We want to have about a third of our business overseas even after UK business picks up again.&quot; 
<P>Apparently there are those who still think Balfour Kilpatrick is a local Paisley company that does lighting for people's houses. They couldn't be more wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In 1982, when Business in Yorkshire was first published, the economy of this region was very different in terms of variety and geographical spread.
<P>The area's industry, in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, has been under constant and severe pressure to raise productivity in order to remain both competitive and profitable. Some have cut back, whilst a significant proportion have chosen to adopt aggressive sales and marketing policies, utilising all types of media including our own as a cost-effective method of advertising to the right people.
<P>These economic changes have resulted in increased specialisation in both engineering and manufacturing, and have created a climate in which the financial and service sectors have flourished beyond expectation, particularly in West Yorkshire, where Leeds is now regarded as the fastest growing commercial centre outside London, and is dubbed "the financial capital of the north". The city is also known as "the second Whitehall", following the decision by the Department of Health to move its headquarters here.
<P>South Yorkshire has for over 100 years been the centre of steelmaking and engineering. These industries have become more capital intensive. Many companies now cater to the increasing demands of the high technology and offshore sectors.
<P>To the east, the ports of Hull, Immingham and Grimsby represent a vital link to the vast markets of Europe and to the creation of real wealth within our region. Humberside's fishing industry has spawned a thriving food processing sector and the many oil and gas refineries bear the names of the world's leading companies.
<P>Agricultural and its associated industries still dominate in North Yorkshire, where there has been dramatic growth in leisure and tourism which, along with related commercial activity, will continue to have an increasing effect on the region's economy.
<P>All told, Business in Yorkshire covers one of the most geographically and commercially diverse markets in the United Kingdom and is accepted as the region's leading business journal, providing independent reports, news and reviews, features and profiles.
<P>Above all, it provides 'readability' . . . guaranteeing that what goes in, gets noticed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

Occupying a central location within the UK, Yorkshire and Humberside is home to five million people. To the west of the region is the Pennine border, while its eastern coastline stares out at the vast markets of Europe.
<P>The communications and infrastructure of the area are among the best in the country, with links north and south via the M1 and A1 to the national motorway network and the M62 snaking east-west.
<P>The region also boasts two airports: Leeds Bradford and Humberside. Both are growing in stature and are capable of offering air links to the UK's major industrial and financial centres and a host of routes to the business capitals of Europe.

<FONT SIZE=5>What our clients say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I am writing to express my sincere thanks for your support in sponsoring and promoting our Presentation Seminar at Leeds United Football Club.
<BR>It was well worth asking you to design and print the invitation leaflet that went as an insert in the Leeds and Bradford postcode areas in the May issue of Business in Yorkshire. As anticipated, you were able to design a leaflet that really stood out and made an impact.
<BR>The real proof, however, has been the remarkable response. Within 3 days we have received over 200 quality replies, and enquiries keep coming in as I write.
<BR>The decision to use Business in Yorkshire services and promote our event in your magazine has been a complete success and confirms Business in Yorkshire magazines as the premier magazines in our region.
<BR><B>- Ian Riddell, Sales &amp; Marketing Director, Warrens Imaging Labs. Ltd.</B>
<P>Business in Yorkshire has a high and influential readership in the region. This is because - above all - it is a good read, well designed and consistently produces features which reflect the concerns and interests of the local business community.
<BR>Those of our clients which are based in Yorkshire view the magazine as an effective and credible medium through which they can communicate key messages to customers and opinion formers.
<BR><B>- Paul Willis, PR Account Director, Sinclair Mason.</B>
<P>We placed an eye-catching insert, simply promoting our Windows 95 training in four issues of Business in Yorkshire over a period of about nine months. This was extremely cost effective, reached a wide range of companies and elicited a very good response rate. A great many more people now know that KeyStrokes is here and that we can provide just about any software training required.
<BR><B>- Sue Palin, Director, KeyStrokes </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><FONT SIZE=5>What our readers say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Business in Yorkshire is useful to us in keeping us abreast of what is happening in our area and in giving us a feel for how our clients are coping. I do feel from time to time business magazines are too heavily advertising led. Whilst this criticism is more relevant of some of your competitors I personally would like to see more editorial content and perhaps a little less advertorial. The standard of journalism of Business in Yorkshire does, I feel, distinguish it from some of its competitors and we would certainly wish to continue our subscription to it 
<BR><B>- Jonathan Armstrong, Keeble Hawson Solicitors  </B>
<P>You should offer your excellent feature on Franchising, to business editors on some National and Trade magazines, that profess to know about such matters!
<BR><B>- Michael Harber, Fatty Arbuckle's American Diners.  </B>
<P>Business in Yorkshire publishes well-written articles, often on highly topical and thought-provoking issues.
<BR><B>- Suzanne Hart, Managing Director, York Place Services Ltd, Leeds.  </B>
<P>As well as the principal of my own company, David W Brown and Co, I am the Managing Director of Hearing Aids Direct which operate a series of regional companies. I have found your magazines to be of great help in assisting the business to develop and I am anxious to receive all your magazines.
<BR><B>- David W. Brown, Managing Director, Hearing Aids Direct Ltd. </B>
<P>An interesting and well-respected business publication for the region.
<BR><B>- Sue Harper, Public Relations Executive, Pinsent Curtis</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The East Midlands is a region that heads towards the millenium with increased confidence in its strength as a major industrial and commercial centre.
<P>The infrastructure of the region, particularly in terms of communications, is the backbone to its success. The M1, M62, M42 and M69, together with the newly-opened A1-M1 link and the major 'A' classification routes, provide easy access to the four corners of the country, including, of course, the seaports of the east coast. The region is well-serviced in terms of other forms of transport: InterCity trains speed between the major cities of the region and London in less than two hours, flights from East Midlands International Airports make many European destinations little more than an hour away to both passengers and freight. Direct and connecting flights have now made EMIA a gateway to the world. The region's economy was built up primarily on two industries: mining and textiles. Their decline in the latter part of the 20th century, however, has not meant a decline of the region. Engineering has long been associated with the East Midlands, but in some of its forms, has also suffered.
<P>Diversification and the flexibility of the business community has resulted in a wide industrial and commercial base which is now the hallmark of the East Midlands.
<P>Today the electronic, chemical, foodstuff, pharmaceutical, print, automotive, textile, materials handling, precision engineering, construction, heavy engineering, power engineering and tourist industries are all strongly represented in the region.
<P>Inward investment has been attracted from major names, Toyota, Toray, Phoenix and RSK among them. The strengthening of the manufacturing base has also brought an increase in service industries. The region has been careful to maintain its many sites of natural and historical interest, and with them an important tourist trade and quality of life second to none.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As an award-winning national housebuilder, David Wilson Homes applies high standards and quality to every project. The team at Business East Midlands has more than fulfilled our expectations, and carried out its work in an efficient and commendable manner. We are delighted with our feature and hope to work with them in the future.
<BR><B>- Terry Lees, Regional Sales Director (East Midlands) David Wilson Homes </B>
<P>Just a short note to thank you for all your hard work  and assistance in putting together the article on Viking Direct. I am very pleased to advise that we have received numerous enquiries about our new same day service in the East Midlands area and have secured a significant number of new customers as a result of the article.
<BR><B>- Graham Cundick, European Merchandising Director, Viking Direct. </B>
<P>Many thanks for the help that you and your team gave us in the presentation of the article in the May issue of Business East Midlands. The result was excellent and I am sure that it will make the business community and possible suppliers, more aware of our existence.
<BR><B>- Kenneth Bartle, Chief Executive, Stead &amp; Simpson</B>
<P>Business East Midlands is a quality magazine which provides us with an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of Lloyds Private Banking among the East Midlands Business community. The staff at the publication have always delivered a very professional service to us.
<BR><B>- John Franks, Manager, Lloyds Private Banking.   </B>
<P>The development of Hampton, the new town for Peterborough, is obviously of major importance for the entire East Midlands area. Hanson Land recognises and appreciates the role that Business East Midlands magazine plays in informing the regional business community of news about Hampton as the town progresses. We were delighted with the way our last feature appeared and will continue to use BEM to generate interest in Hampton.
<BR><B>- James Hopkins, Managing Director, Hanson Land Limited. </B>

<BR><FONT SIZE=5>What our readers say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We receive many business magazines and must say that Business East Midland's extensive coverage of business news makes the publication of great interest to ourselves and clients, your target audience. The mixed content of news profiles not only helps position the magazine way above its competitors but also ensures the magazine is read widely and extensively. It is increasingly rare and refreshing to deal with a 'title' that is not solely advertorial-driven or motivated. 
<BR><B>- James Pinchbeck, Senior Associate, JAB Marketing Services.</B>
<P>You certainly can spot a good story! Your cover article on Robin Hood's connections with Nottingham and our city's business community led directly to intense interest in the topic from across the English-speaking world! Following a mention on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, articles and leaders in The Times and The Guardian, I have had calls from journalists as far afield as Canada and Australia. Most were reporting quite humorously on the new angle to the Robin Hood legend, but it was a useful opportunity to state that modern Nottingham does have much else to offer the visitor, in terms of commerce, shopping and leisure.
<BR><B>- Simon Wilkinson, Executive Director, Nottingham First.</B>
<P>I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you how much I feel the content and writing have improved in your  magazine have improved over the last few months. I have particularly enjoyed the articles in the family business section. I hope this section remains in the magazine for a long time to come as to my knowledge there is no other source of information of this kind. Thank you for making the magazine so relevant and readable, this helps enormously when one is considering where to place advertising and gives clients a good read while they are waiting in our reception area.
<BR><B>- Sue Stevenson, Partner, Mallard Imaging.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The industrial roots of the West Midlands run deep, with a manufacturing tradition stretching back to the 18th century - a period which saw Birmingham subsequently develop into the 'city of  1001 trades'.
<P>Indeed, the local economy was founded on the enterprise of countless small firms covering every aspect of manufacturing and engineering, from gunmaking to steel fabricating. And while the early 20th century saw the rise of the automotive and heavy engineering sectors - dominated by corporate giants like Rover, Jaguar, IMI and Lucas - so the latter half of the century has seen the rapid rise of the service industries. In particular, Birmingham itself has evolved into a major financial centre, the biggest outside London, with a correspondingly broad range of professional expertise to match.
<P>No less impressive has been the changing face of the second city - now benefiting from world class facilities such as the International Convention Centre and Birmingham Airport, the latter now providing a direct route to New York.
<P>Consequently, the marketing of Birmingham as a major European city and of the West Midlands generally as an attractive area for inward investment continues to reap rich rewards. The new town of Telford, for example, now has the largest concentration of Japanese manufacturing industry in the UK, while in areas like the Black Country, the rejuvenation of large swathes of industrial wasteland has transformed the landscape and boosted investment the process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

<P><IMG SRC="map.gif" align=right>The West Midlands is considered by many as the birth place of the modern industrial society with the first factories being established in the early 18th century. Although the automotive and engineering industries have been very strong, the region has always had a diverse range of industrial and commercial activities. Whereas Birmingham is the best known part of the West Midlands, there are many other economic centres that vary widely in character and include the towns of the Potteries, Coventry, Wolverhampton and the older cities of Lichfield, Hereford and Worcester.
<P>Blessed with an excellent motorway network, communications both within the region and to the rest of the country are first class. Birmingham has a major international Airport with the Eurohub serving all the main European cities.

<FONT SIZE=5>What our clients say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I am writing to express my compliments to you for the company profile that you produced for Sunrise Medical. One of our sister companies in Holland has already asked for an extra 100 copies for their clients, and another in America was so impressed that they have set their associates the task of finding a similar opportunity in California. We would have no hesitation in recommending such an article to other companies in the West Midlands.
<BR><B>- Ian D Burrows, Marketing &amp; Product Development Director, Sunrise Medical. </B>
<P>We have now had a lot of feedback regarding the Roskel Contracts and in particular the reprint article. I am pleased to say that the response both from within the Roskel group, and from customers and suppliers has be extremely positive - so much so that we are now sending the reprints out as part of our normal literature pack.
<BR><B>- Charles Weeks, Sales and Marketing, Roskel Contracts Ltd.</B>
<P>I am writing to express my thanks for the efforts you and your colleagues made to bring together a 28 page supplement focused around Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Partnership Limited and some of our company members. All who have seen it have commented favourably on its content and presentation, and it provided an appropriate context for a number of members to advertise their organisations activities.
<BR>I understand that a number of our members will be seeking copies of the reprinted Supplement. For ourselves we will be using it for promotional purposes with Government, investors and developers, and at appropriate conferences and exhibitions in the UK and Brussels. I am sure that people will find it an easy and accessible source of information about the Partnerships and our activities in Coventry and Warwickshire.

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The North West has long been at the forefront of Britain's industrial and commercial life. Covering an area of 7,343 square kilometres, it has a population of more than six million and is home to 140,000 businesses. It accounts for 10.5 per cent of manufacturing output. The region is larger than many markets in Europe, including Norway, Denmark, Finland and Ireland, and is similar in size to Switzerland and Austria.
<P>Its dependence on traditional industries - textiles and coal mining - is a thing of the past. Today, a diverse range of industries is flourishing in the Region including chemicals, toiletries, motor vehicles and food production. High-tech companies using state-of-the-art technology abound, a strong service sector has been developed and many overseas companions have invested in the North West to provide them with a gateway to Europe. Dark satanic mills have been replaced by superb factory units on greenfield sites. The adaptable workforce has welcomed and risen to the challenge of new technology. The region's infrastructure is second to none, with all parts benefiting from swift access to North/South - East/West motorway links. Expansion of Manchester Airport and development of the Post of Liverpool provide convenient facilities for exporters.
<P>Business North West is the region's oldest established business magazine and has been highlighting the region's successes for more than 25 years.
<P>Through its blend of news, features, area reviews and profiles the magazine provides directors and senior managements in companies across the region with the ideal vehicle through which to reach this influential audience.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

The North West is the second most important regional market in the UK with over six million consumers and 60,000 active businesses. There is a sharp contrast between the major conurbations and sparsely-populated rural areas, providing a wide spectrum of commercial activity. The circulation of the magazines covers the cities of Manchester and Liverpool as well as the business communities in Carlisle, Crewe and Chester, Wrexham and Deeside, Macclesfield and Stockport, Oldham, Rochdale and Bolton, Southport, Preston, Blackpool and Lancaster, Blackburn and Burnley.
<P>Communications are excellent with motorways intersecting the region, electrified main line rail links running from Scotland to London and one of the UK's major international airports at Manchester.</TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Having received the issue featuring Buxton Mineral Water Company this morning I thought I'd drop you a quick line to say how well received it has been.
<BR>The history of Buxton's mineral water is interestingly explained and the advertising, while not overbearing is substantial and of a high calibre. I'm sure that both Buxton and the associated companies will be  delighted
<BR><B>- Mark Schmid - Infoplan International Public Relations  </B>
<P>I am writing to express my thanks for your assistance in formulating our recent advertisement in the Business North West magazine. As you are aware we have recently opened our new branch in Blackburn, and as part of a successful Plc, it was important that we were portrayed in a professional manner.
<BR>The support and advice you gave to us was first class, and all the hard work in designing and arranging the advertisement was done for us!
<BR>The feedback from our customers and prospects has been extremely positive and I have recently secured a large order from a new customer who read our advertisement. This alone has more than paid for the advertisement.
<BR>Once again can I thank you for providing a first class service, from start to finish, I would have no hesitation in recommending you to any prospective customers.
<BR><B>-Mike Robinson, EFT Finance Ltd.</B>
<P>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is delighted to have had several articles published in Business North west during the last year. The reason we chose this publication was because we believe it reaches the right audience for us within the business community of that area.
<BR><B>- Gay Hinton, Press Officer, ICAEW </B>
<P>Regarding a profile on our company. I must say that I am extremely impressed by the ability to identify what the company is all about, the people who work here and the atmosphere. - You certainly hit a nerve as far as I am concerned. If I was writing a biography I could not have written it any better than this brief profile.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I have just read the May edition of Business North West and I feel I must congratulate you on producing a business magazine which is informative and interesting. Such a change from the usual dull and somewhat tedious business magazine.
<BR>You have managed to strike a happy balance of content and thus a good read.
<BR><B>- Caroline Davey, Gordon Clark Publicity Ltd</B>
<P>As a leading Manchester law firm servicing clients primarily in the North West of England, Business North West is of particular relevance to us and our client base. The articles are informative, they deal with local issues, deals, appointments and personalities keeping local business informed of local issues. 
<BR>-<B> Mark Hodge, Glaisyers Glickman Solicitors </B>
<P>We enjoy reading Business North West because it gives us up-to-date information about a wide range of topics in the North West region. The features are of great interest to us.
<BR><B>- Malcolm Horner, Manager, Children's Products/Chemistry Department AMTAC</B>
<P>I am so impressed with Business North West, that not only do I use it to ensure that clients get the proper exposure, but I also use it as a reference point in seeking new clients. In addition to keeping in touch with region's business, I find that many of the articles are of real interest and value

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The South West is the third largest region in the United Kingdom, yet accounts for only 8 per cent of the population with 'population densities' throughout the counties ranging from 127 per sq km in Cornwall to a more crowded 707 per sq km in Avon.
<P>The South West has consistently adapted to the various market changes, maintaining a reputation throughout the years for being a strong, entrepreneurial region.
<P>Professional services dominate many South West towns and cities, with the financial services sector playing a particular important role within today's regional economy.
<P>The past, however, has not been lost and the South West boasts many strong companies that date back to the last century. The stories of such companies provide valuable insights into sound management practices and the various routes to success, with several generations of the founding family invariably remaining at the helm throughout all stages of growth to the present day.
<P>So the South West moves into the 21th century with a strong and enduring combination past and present, where hard work coupled with a sharp commercial focus will ensure its growth and prosperity.
<P>The South West prides itself on quality and high standards in all services and professions, and the many national awards, achievements and accolades collected  by companies and organisations in the region are testimonials to the standards and skills acknowledged within the region, from catering to architecture, from manufacturing to education.
<P>The South West is an area that is ready to meet the challenges that lie ahead, both at home and abroad. It is wise enough to protect its own patch, it is strong enough to compete with the best, and Business South West will continue to play a vital role in this new Euro era, to communicate news and information from authoritative and professional sources, to heighten awareness of current trends and changes, and to encourage and support the region's growth, economy and recognition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

<P><IMG SRC="map.gif" align=right>The area served by Business South West includes Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire as well as the conurbations of South Wales, Swansea, Cardiff and Newport.
<P>The region has throughout its history thrived on its own resources, earlier through its ports and traditional industries and more recently through its recognition and provision for the changing trends in business.
<P>The region now houses some of the finest and most technologically advanced business parks and out-of-town developments with many leading international companies developing their main UK base in the area.
<P>As the South West is blessed with large tracks of unspoilt countryside and magnificent coastline, tourism has been a growth business for a number of years and this has encouraged a large number of service industries to spring up in support.

<FONT SIZE=5>What our clients say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We were delighted to work with Business South West magazine and found the feature idea an excellent way to raise the profile of our business. The scheme was also very easy to operate, Business South West did all the leg work contacting our suppliers (who supported us very well), leaving us free to concentrate on editorial. We have subsequently had many comments on the feature and would certainly recommend it as a way of generating greater awareness of one's organisation.
<BR><B>- Barbara Bennett, Head of Corporate Affairs, NatWest Insurance Services</B>
<P>Since we placed our full page advertisement in Business South West for our Interim Management Service we have been inundated with calls from companies interested in utilising our expert managers. The magazine coverage has taken us into areas of the South West in which we previously had little presence. I cannot emphasise more the effectiveness of this advert in terms of reaching our target market and in addition, we achieved this with relatively small expenditure. As far as we are concerned the readers of the Business South West Magazine are the 'right' people to approach for our service and this has been proved by the sheer number of enquiries we have received.
<br><B>- Mike Ralston, Machiavelli Management Ltd</B>
<P>Filton College has been serving companies in the local area for more than twenty years, continually striving to become number one training provider in the South West. To promote our business courses we decided to use the most effective regional advertising medium around, Business South West magazine.
<BR>From the outset of our feature campaign all the staff have been helpful, efficient and enthusiastic about their product. The feature itself was effective, well written and well supported by our suppliers. As a result, we received the largest number of valid leads yet achieved from the advertising of our business courses.
<BR><B>- Cath Bowden, Filton College</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><FONT SIZE=5>What our readers say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As a Marketing Manager of one of the leading Management Training Consultancies in the South West. I receive a large number of business publications each month. I always make time to read Business South West as it provides useful information and leads. 
<BR>The stories are always relevant to the business community and provide an updated picture of the South West business economy.
<BR>I look forward to speaking to you again soon and receiving your other publications from the other geographical regions covered in the range.
<BR><B>- Tony Evans, Marketing Manager, Insight Consultants Ltd</B>
<P>The magazine not only provided the forum to contact the region's businesses, but the vision to initiate and control the process to the event's greatest benefit.
<BR>Business South West turned a challenge into an opportunity and helped make the Festival of the Sea a tremendous success for all who reacted and realised its potential.
<BR><B>- Paul Venton, Head of PR, International Festival of the Sea  </B>
<P>We subscribe to the magazine primarily to monitor activities of other local organisations, particularly those in the Bristol area, including our competitors. Much of the information contained within the magazine is retained on file for future reference, particularly the Who's Who and Company Profiles
<BR><B>- Tracy Wilson, Marketing Manager, Bond Pearce Solicitors</B>
<P><B>Mr M J Alcott, Director, Neptune Planning Ltd </B>uses Business South West to keep in touch with what is going on in our area by keeping an eye on the competition, and keeping informed of market changes and new products.

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The North East has undergone a period of great change in economic life. Gone are its deep mines and greatly reduced are its heavy engineering and ship-related industries.
<P>In their place has come a new breed of small and medium-sized firms that have more than compensated for the decline in the more traditional industries.
<P>But that is not all. Training has become a more important part of the business life of the region and organisations such as the five Training and Enterprise Councils that operate within the North-East bear witness to this fact. Also the North-East has a wide range of further and higher education establishments ranging from the traditional Universities of Newcastle and Durham to the newer University of Sunderland and the University of Teesside and colleges such as Darlington College of Technology. All of these institutions are breaking new ground in forging links between the education sector and the business sector in the North-East and, in some cases, further afield in Europe and the Far East.
<P>Economic and urban regeneration programmes are helping to restore the confidence of people in areas that for years have been seen as depressed and often depressing areas. Various City Challenge and Urban Development Corporations are breathing new life into areas such as the Newcastle Quayside, parts of Sunderland, Middlesbrough and other parts of the region.
<P>All of this means that there is a feeling of confidence once more starting to show itself in the region. Certainly the recession of the late 1980s has hit the region but not as badly as some parts of the country and so it is starting along the path of recovery from a much stronger position.
<P>Several new Business and Science Parks have recently come on stream to provide much needed space for developing companies and the take up rate on many of these is encouraging and more are on the drawing board. If the example of a certain football club in the region is anything to go by, then the Region's position in the 'Premier League' is assured and there is good potential for richer pickings based on this success!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

The North East is an area blessed with an excellent communications network. The A1(M) opens the North East to the rest of England and Scotland as does the main London-Edinburgh rail line. The A19 runs down the east coast connecting Tyneside  and Wearside to Teesside. The region also boasts two International Airports with daily flights linking the area to Scandinavia and Europe as well as the UK's major industrial and financial centres. 
<P>Tourism is also on the increase with some of the country's most attractive coastlines and beaches and places of historic value, such as Hadrian's Wall, Durham Cathedral and Lindisfarne. 

<P>In the recent past some major multinationals, Nissan and Samsung have set up in the region showing it is ready to meet the challenge of the new millennium.</TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I believe your magazine provides an excellent business profile and image throughout the North East and this was the main reason I chose it for the Lloyds Bank articles. I wanted to express my appreciation for the professionalism with which our requirements were dealt with and to thank you for ensuring smooth transition from draft article into the completed paper. It has been a very good piece of team-work in which your magazine has helped Lloyds Bank put across some important profile and business points. I would like our request to be a regular annual feature and I look forward to working with you again.
<BR><B>- David Holborn, Area Director, Lloyds Bank, Newcastle Upon Tyne</B>
<P>I am writing to thank for the excellent eight page article in Business North East. Everyone in the factory is delighted with the result and I know already from several people that the article is doing a marvellous job in raising our profile in the region. As you know we also had reprints of the article which we handed out as gifts to our visitors during our 50th Anniversary celebrations. This provided us with an opportunity to explain our business in a simple and cost effective way and proved very popular over the weekend of celebrations. 
<BR><B>- Stephen Rose, Communications Department, Glaxo</B>
<P>A short note to thank your colleagues for the excellent outcome of the work you all put into the KP supplement. We were all very pleased with the quality of the publication, including the quality of the adverts.
<P>We have had a number of good reports from the business community as well as our own employees so the booklet is serving its purpose across a wide spectrum of readers and I am delighted with the overall outcome of the project.
<BR><B>- Dr I J Taylor, Human Resource Manager, KP Foods UK, Billingham</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Congratulations on the handsome April issue of Business North East. As far as I know neither the US nor Canada has publications like yours. I have never quite seen your combination of business focus with lively personal stories from the boardroom to the shop floor - and all of it presented very professionally.
<BR>Here at Behavioural Science Technology International we read your BASF Profile with special interest, of course. In our experience, behaviour-based safety is sometimes difficult for editors and writers to grasp on first acquaintance. Therefore we were pleased - and I must say gratefully surprised to find your coverage of the BASF story so insightful and thorough. 
<BR><B>- Thomas R Krause, Behaviour Science Technology International</B> 
<P>There is certainly no doubt in my mind, Business North East is the region's foremost business journal. With its informed insights into local business it proves of genuine interest to its target audience. Punchy, succinct and well-researched editorial provides the ideal reference document for future consultation. The region's market-leader in up-to-the-minute business information.
<BR><B>- Lee Andrews, Director, Solutions Recruitment Specialists, Newcastle upon Tyne</B>
<P>Highlights North East success and companies we make contact with.
<BR><B>- Budget Rent a Car</B>
<P>Brief articles from many companies and very relevant, the right balance. 
<BR><B>- The Torrington Co. Ltd</B>
<P>It is interesting to read about a wide range of industry in the North East.
<BR><B>- The Shark Group Ltd</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Profile</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Scotland has changed almost out of recognition in the last fifteen years both as an economy and as a country.
<P>In common with the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland has been under constant and severe pressure to raise productivity in order to remain both profitable and competitive. Some businesses have cut back, whilst a significant proportion have chosen to adopt aggressive sales and marketing policies, utilising various media as a cost-effective method of advertising to the right people. Glasgow and Edinburgh have both enjoyed a period of renaissance with major new developments occurring within the two cities and Glasgow in particular gaining world renown as a city of great architectural beauty.
<P>Obviously, Scotland is a country and not merely a district of the UK, so it is difficult to speak in general terms. It is a country the size of England but with just over one tenth of the population and its many differing areas each have their own specialist trade and industry. The finest salmon comes from the Shetlands, the greatest whisky from the Highlands and some of the world's most exclusive retailers have their only branch outside London in Glasgow's revitalised shopping centres.
<P>The traditional trades sit alongside the new in all parts of central Scotland. Recently a number of multinationals have chosen to build new factories in Scotland rather than elsewhere within the United Kingdom, signifying Scotland's growing importance within Europe and the rest of the world.
<P>There is a strong financial heritage in Scotland, especially in Edinburgh's new town, and it must be remembered that Scotland has its own currency, printed by three separate banks. Proof again, that Scotland is a country and not a region.
<P>Scotland in Business covers one of the most exciting and economically vibrant areas of the United Kingdom and will mirror this in its coverage. Although the majority of the Scottish population is located within the central belt, the magazine will aim to provide independent reports, news, reviews and profiles on all parts of the country. Wherever the key decision makers are, Scotland in Business will aim to become the country's leading business journal for all of them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Company Reviews</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A comprehensive review provides a company with an opportunity to promote its success, raise its profile or generally convey to the business community the most appropriate and relevant information at any point in time. This can be done in the most cost effective manner by support advertising from your suppliers as they will gain from the exposure in the region of being associated with your activities. 
<P>Many of these reviews are so comprehensive they are replicated as a company brochure which is then used to promote the organisation to a wider field.

Scotland is home to just over five million people and is one of the most exciting and economically vibrant areas of the United Kingdom. The economy has changed out of all recognition in the last 15 years with the development of the oil and electronic industries backed by a strong service sector.
<P>The majority of the population inhabits an area bordered on the West by the Isles and Glasgow, to the East by Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth, from Inverness in the North to Dumfries in the South. 
<P>They are served by four airports at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick, with regular train services to both East and West Coasts. A motorway and trunk  road system connects all major towns and cities to ensure that travel is easy and quick both in and out of the country.</TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Scotland in Business has been an important addition to business publications in Scotland.
<BR>An opportunity to tell the Scottish business community about what we are doing and the opportunity for Scottish companies to do business with us, was one not be missed. 
<BR><B>- David Batty, MD, Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd</B>
<P>DAKS Simpson were delighted with the outcome of the feature in Scotland in Business magazine which was published in the February edition of this extremely important periodical.
<BR>We were stunned by the number of prestigious companies who supported us by placing company advertisements alongside our feature. It was very good to see that other businesses could see the benefit of advertising in such a recognised magazine with an obviously very impressive readership.
<BR>I very much hope Scotland in Business and DAKS Simpson can continue to work together in the very near future.
<BR><B>- Richard Campbell-Walter, Public Relations &amp; Advertising Director, DAKS Simpson Ltd</B>
<P>I have just received my copy of your publication and would like to express how pleased I am with the article published following my interview - the article which, as well as being factually correct, certainly encapsulates and condenses into very readable journalism the positive history of the McGavigan Holdings story.
<BR>To get such good exposure in the Scottish business community from what can only be considered minimum input from ourselves, certainly reflects on the professionalism of your publication.
<BR><B>- Alastair H Munro, Director, John McGavigan Holdings Ltd</B> 
<P>I am writing to say how much I enjoyed the above issues of Scotland in Business, as usual you had a varied number of articles and some in particular were of interest to myself.
<BR>I liked the article by Kenneth Rose - The Consulting Room on Lawyers, a lot of the points raised showed the changing attitude of professionals nowadays.
<BR><B>- Philip H Thompson, MD, Philip Thompson &amp; Partners Consulting Engineers</B> 
<P>We at Scottish Widows Bank do always take particular interest in the magazine. That apart, the feeling is that Scotland in Business has struck the right balance between readability and serious business interest.
<BR>While features on the Banking and Finance sector are likely to have the most relevance for us, the company reviews are always well worth a read from the general business perspective and the news feature invariably has something which catches the eye.
<BR><B>- Rob Goldbourne, Managing Director, Scottish Widows Bank Plc</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><FONT SIZE=5>What our readers say</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Scotland in  Business magazine provides an insight into a wide range of topical issues of relevance to business today. If you want to stay informed, then Scotland in Business should be the top of your reading list.
<BR><B>- Maureen Munro, Marketing Manager, Edinburgh  Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise</B>

<H1>Conserving Resources Through Energy Efficiency</H1></center>

The Energy Center of Wisconsin finds ways to use energy more efficiently. 
By providing research, education, and energy information, the Center is helping 
improve Wisconsin's economy while protecting the environment. We work closely 
with government organizations, businesses, research & development organizations, 
advocacy groups, and Wisconsin's electric and gas utilities to promote energy 
efficiency and demonstrate ideas that benefit both energy producers and energy 
consumers. Whether you need up-to-date information about a high-efficiency 
technology, are wondering how your business can save money through improved 
efficiency, or are simply interested in learning what's going on in the energy 
field, the Energy Center is ready to help.

<P>
The ECW Library provides comprehensive, up-to-date energy information
and an extensive collection of energy-related materials. We go
beyond the traditional services of a library to take a more proactive
role as a point of reference for energy professionals. We explore
alternative databases to find future resources, we pull together
available information, and we let you know what new materials
we acquire.
<P>
We have access to numerous information sources such as:
<UL>
<LI>utility libraries
<LI>national research institutions
<LI>electronic databases 
</UL>

<P>
Our collection of more than 3,000 items includes:

<H2>Literature Searches </H2>

<P>
We conduct extensive literature searches to locate materials.
If we cannot find something within our collection, we try to obtain
it from other sources. Our library staff maintains contacts with
librarians from utilities, the University of Wisconsin system,
and other corporate information centers. We can also search electronic
databases such as EPRInet, Dialog Information Service, and university
library databases worldwide.
<H2>Acquisitions List </H2>

<H1>Workshops</H1>
<P>
Despite advances in the way information is shared--such as through the World Wide Web--
for some kinds of knowledge, nothing can replace person-to-person communication. And one 
of the best ways to bring people together is through workshops.<p>ECW's educational 
workshops:
<UL>
<LI>train people how to use new energy-efficiency technologies
<LI>build partnerships between energy-efficiency stakeholders
<LI>report the results of ECW projects
<LI>create information forums where industry professionals can exchange ideas
</UL>
<P>
We offer our own workshops as well as sponsor those given by other organizations.

The ECW home page is the product of ECW's multitalented <a href="staff.html">staff</a>. Thanks to all who pitched in. <p>To get a handle on the HyperText Markup Language used to create web pages, we used <A HREF="http://slack.lne.com/lemay/theBook/index.html">Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in a Week</A>,
by <CITE>Laura Lemay</CITE> (Sams Publishing, 1995), and <A HREF="http://www.lne.com/Web/">Teach Yourself More Web Publishing with HTML in a Week</A>,
by <CITE>Laura Lemay</CITE> (Sams.net, 1995).
<P>
Many of our icons came from <A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/index.html">Anthony's Icon Library</A>.
<P>None of this would be possible of course without <b><A HREF="http://www.fullfeed.com/">Fullfeed Communications</A></B>, our local internet provider.

<H2><A NAME="Prj2111">Big Chill</A> </H2>

<P>
The overall goal of the Commercial Cooling, or &quot;Big Chill,&quot;
Project was to develop background information for new cooling
technology options and accelerate their adoption. The project's
three main objectives were: to develop a library of cooling-load
information that supports cooling plant technology comparisons
for many different types of buildings; to develop a set of consistent
computer models for simulating available cooling technologies;
and to monitor how different types of cooling technologies perform
in different types of buildings. We have established the cooling-load
library, including information about load and building characteristics
from 45 buildings for up to two years. The computer models have
also been developed.  Seven sites were monitored during the 1992
and 1993 cooling seasons; four sites were continued into the 1994
cooling season.

<H2><A NAME="Prj2132">Energy Management Control Systems</A> </H2>

<P>
This study will investigate the market potential for load-control
strategies in commercial buildings. EMCSs, which use computers
to control loads within a building, can apply a variety of load-reduction
strategies to reduce peak demand. Some of these strategies are
enhanced by special rate structures, such as real-time pricing
or time-of-use rates, that reward customers for controlling their
own peak demand. The new study is designed to quantify the benefits
that could be expected from these control systems by testing the
concept at an office building and a retail store. The study will
develop an understanding of EMCS operation, assess EMCS opportunities
and barriers, determine optimal control strategies, and test for
EMCS performance.

<H2><A NAME="Prj2137">Building Integrated Photovoltaic Systems
(BIPV) </A></H2>

<P>
Photovoltaic (PV) systems have historically been too expensive
for most applications because of their high capital cost. Researchers
in other parts of the country have shown the advantages of constructing
PV panels that also serve as building materials to be integrated
into a structure. These building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV)
systems are much more economical, because only their incremental
capital cost over and above the building materials they replace
need be considered. The Center plans a pre-feasibility study to
determine whether BIPV would be economically attractive in Wisconsin,
given the local solar resource, climate, and energy costs. The
study would include surveying characteristics of available and
&quot;prototype&quot; BIPV materials, identifying various BIPV
case study types from the perspective of total energy performance
(generated electricity, daylight, and thermal gain), and development
of a model to do sensitivity studies of key BIPV variables. Buildings
with BIPV will be modelled and compared to the same buildings
without BIPV, to determine net building energy gain and life-cycle
costs. If the results of the pre-feasibility study are positive,
it may lead to a site-specific feasibility study.

<H2><A NAME="Prj2145">Biopulping </A></H2>

<P>
The Center is funding a large-scale field trial of Biopulping
technology at a Wisconsin pulp mill. Biopulping consists of treating
chips before pulping with a specially selected fungus that eats
the lignin in the wood without disturbing the cellulose. This
fungus is one of hundreds of species growing naturally in Wisconsin's
forests, but it has been chosen because of its dietary preferences.
After the chips have been treated, they sit in a pile for a week
or two to allow the fungus to work, whereupon they are fed into
the mill as usual. The technology has been developed over several
years by the Forest Products Lab and the UW Biotechnology Center,
with funding from an industry consortium. The researchers are
now confident that they have a process that works as a pretreatment
before a mechanical mill. At least on a laboratory scale, they
have measured energy savings up to 30%, with an increase in strength
properties but a slight decrease in brightness. Depending on the
paper being produced and the other components of the pulp, this
process could prove very attractive to a lot of mills. The Center's
study will consist of a 5-ton trial at the Forest Products Lab,
followed by a 50-ton trial at the host mill. A video will be produced
to show the results.

Applications In Industrial Processes</A> </H2>

<P>
The energy costs associated with heating and cooling in the dairy,
meat, and food processing industries are significant. The use
of conventional electric refrigeration systems in these industries
contributes to electric demand during peak periods. A group of
UW--Madison researchers (sponsored by the Center) is investigating
the use of alternative refrigeration and heat pump systems to
reduce the overall energy consumption and demand in processes
in these industries. Economic benefits may accrue to both the
customers and the electric utilities through the installation
of alternative technologies. Environmental benefits due to lowered
emissions from power generation and conventional heating equipment,
and from reduced waste water discharges can be expected as well.
New approaches to heating and cooling may allow industries to
meet new environmental or health-related regulations with less
economic impact than with conventional equipment.
<P>
During the first year of this project, dairy and meat processing
industries were considered. Little potential was seen in the meat
processing industry, however the cheese-making industry was explored

Optimization Service (POS)</A> </H2>

<P>
The Responsible Power Management program includes the <STRONG>Performance
Optimization Service (POS)</STRONG>, a joint effort among the
participating utilities to improve the efficiency of thermal and
motor systems within industrial processes. Specifically, the program
addresses fans, pumps, blowers(turbomachinery), compressed air
and boiler (thermal) systems. By taking an overall look at the
system instead of narrowly focusing on components, such as adjustable
speed drives or energy-efficient motors, potential savings of
20 to 50 percent are sometimes achievable. The primary technical
approach is to closely match the output of the system to the needs
of the process. Rigorous performance testing that goes into the
feasibility study allows the engineer to accurately match machine
output with process needs and allows even risk-averse industrial
end-users to modify systems with confidence. Although <A HREF="compdesc.html#asds">adjustable speed drives</A>
are often considered as part of the feasibility study, often more
cost effective and simple strategies will have a shorter payback.
For instance, at G. Heileman brewing company in La Crosse, trimming
the impeller on a 150 hp pump saved $18,000/yr. at a cost of less
than $9,000 (including the feasibility study). Different facets
of the program include training,case study development , marketing
materials development including write-ups of the case studies,
a POS video, and market research. There is also significant interest
in this project nationally, and the Center is using some DOE funds
through the Motor Challenge program to refine the training, and
develop new marketing materials for use in Wisconsin and nationally.

processes with respect to energy use and analyze potential process
efficiency improvements for selected major industries, (3) estimate
the energy efficiency potential for industrial processes for selected
major industries, estimate the costs of process efficiency improvements,
and analyze alternative approaches to implement improvements by
addressing customer needs, and (4) develop and recommend delivery
mechanisms and approaches to be used in the design of a statewide
industrial process efficiency improvement program. The selected
industries for this project are SIC 2621 (paper mills), 20 (food

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of a proactive,
collaborative partnership between public utilities, libraries,
and other community groups to achieve their respective but overlapping
energy missions. The project involves two main activities: to
promote partnerships through a Center-sponsored workshop for utilities
and their public libraries; and to evaluate the impact of library
materials on patrons' awareness, attitudes, and behaviors related
to energy efficiency. Upon completion of the project, the evaluation
data will be presented in a final report analyzing the survey
instruments and discussing changes in knowledge, attitudes, skills,
and actions resulting from these educational activities. The results
of this project would also assist public libraries with their
own evaluation efforts.

<P>
Grand Avenue middle and high school teachers are developing an
integrated energy education curriculum where energy is the organizing
theme. Grand Avenue is one of the Milwaukee Public Schools currently
implementing MPS' School-to-Work goals. STW, as understood by
MPS, is not vocational education; it is rigorous, comprehensive
and integrated studies organized around themes or focus problems
and it prepares all students for post-secondary education. Typically
STW also involves some hands-on activities that reinforce the
information students learned in the classroom. At Grand Avenue
students will explore energy issues through various projects related
to weatherization efforts as well as utility functioning. In May,
1997 the Grand Avenue Middle School students will be hosting an
energy conference for middle-school students from other schools.

<P>
&quot;Energy Cycles&quot; are stationary bicycle-powered generators
used to demonstrate basic energy concepts and relationships. The
Wisconsin Demand-Side Demonstrations completed a pilot project
that reached over 20,000 people through operation of energy cycles
in five regional environmental education centers lin Wisconsin.
The education lessons created as part of this demonstration project
involved participants in a &quot;legs-on&quot; approach to learning
about energy resources, energy-efficient technologies and lifestyle
choices. The Central Wisconsin Environmental Station coordinated
the project, which included the purchase of equipment, creation
of lesson plans and staff training. The Center seeks to build
on the success of the WDSD pilot energy cycle demonstration program
by re-instituting and expanding this program. The new phase of
this project would expand the number of energy cycles available--as
many as 15-20 total. The new phase also will include tie-ins to
the Center's K-12 Energy Education Program as an educational tool
available to educators around the state.

<P>
Building commissioning is a systematic process to assure that
all facility systems perform as intended and designed for the
needs of building occupants. The benefits of building commissioning
are numerous, but its practice is far from widespread. Wisconsin
Gas Company has initiated a project of its own to demonstrate
the benefits of building commissioning to the design and construction
community in Wisconsin, and prospective building owners. WGC has
asked the Center to participate in this project. The Center is
first conducting market research on the practice of building commissioning
in Wisconsin to determine the need for additional project support.
The Center's market research will establish a marketplace baseline,
identify market barriers, and identify the role of utilities and
other parties in promoting building commissioning. The Center's
contractor will survey the principal groups involved with the
design, construction and management of commercial buildings, namely:
(1) building owners and managers, (2) architects and engineers,
(3) general contractors, and (4) HVAC contractors.

The Center planned, organized and handled logistics for the 1995-1996
commercial and residential energy code training in partnership
with DIHLR. The new code is the largest revision in the history
of Wisconsin codes. The Center has partnered with DIHLR, U.S.
D.O.E., WEB, WED, the PSC, Engineering and Professional Development
at the University, and numerous trade allies to develop modules
on lighting, HVAC, building envelope, and code overview, as well
as break-out sessions on daylighting, building controls, and other
energy efficiency topics. Workshops allowed utilities to share
information on restructuring. Workshops were held in five Wisconsin
locations for design professionals in January, 1996, and in four
locations for code officials in February, 1996. Another training
session was held in May 1996 for design professionals. More training
is likely to be scheduled for early 1997. The entire set of workshops
will reach 1,000 trade allies across the state. If you would like

<P>
Formerly identified as one of the Center's own research projects
(Code 2151), this project is now included under Collaborative
work because of the Center's decision that its lighting research
funds would be used most effectively by joining a national effort.
Often the Center leverages its funds by joining collaborative
projects such as NLPIP. NLPIP was established in 1990 to develop
an independent source of information about different manufacturers'
efficient lighting products. Until then the lack of a comprehensive
source of efficiency information-including brands, models, and
manufacturers-about lighting products resulted in an inability
of users to distinguish between products that work well and similar
products that work poorly. NLPIP provides &quot;Specifier Reports&quot;,
&quot;Lighting Answers&quot;, and relevant lighting workshops
for Center participants.

<H1>Responsible Power Management Program</H1>

ECW's Responsible Power Manangement program is dedicated to improving energy efficiency in 
Wisconsin's businesses and industries through high-efficiency motors and optimized motor systems. For 
some businesses, it's as simple as replacing a burnt-out motor with a money-saving high-efficiency model. 
For more complex motor-driven processes, it may be beneficial to optimize the whole system by using 
different-sized motors, adjusting flow rates, and modifying other components. 
<P>
To learn more about the RPM program and how to replace your old motors with new high-efficiency models, scroll through the <A HREF="hemprogr.html">RPM Brochure</A>. 
<P>
To learn about optimizing industrial processes that use motorized fans, pumps, and blowers, go to the <A 
HREF="posprogr.html">performance optimization page</A>.
<P>
To look at other motors-related sites on the Internet, go to our <A HREF="motolink.html"> Motors Links</A> page. Check back often, as we are always adding new sites to our list.
<P>
We also have <A HREF="rpmarket.html"> marketing materials</A> that show how we promote the RPM program.

<P>
<A NAME="Index">The Responsible Power Management program (RPM) promotes high-efficiency motors (HEMs) and provides the Performance Optimization Service (POS). RPM uses a series of materials to encourage Wisconsin businesses to purchase high-efficiency
motors and improve the efficiency of their motor-driven equipment. RPM shows people how much energy--and money--they can save by using high-efficiency motors. <P>This quick look will show you all the different ways RPM helps Wisconsin businesses conserve energy with high-efficiency motors and motor systems.</A>

<P>
The MotoRater Plus is one tool with many answers. The MotoRater
Plus helps you decide when to repair a motor and when to replace
it with a new, high-efficiency motor. And if you know how much
you pay for electricity and how many hours your motor runs, the
MotoRater Plus will show you how much energy you can save with
high-efficiency motors. The MotoRater Plus will also help you
calculate payback so that you can see how long it will take for
your energy savings to equal the difference in price between a
standard-efficiency motor and high-efficiency motor.
<P>
For a free copy of the MotoRater Plus, <A HREF="#Ordering">contact the Center</A>.

<H2><A NAME="Motorfacts">MotorFacts Form</A></H2>

<P>
You can calculate a high-efficiency motor's payback period using
the MotorFacts worksheet. It helps you calculate
how long it will take for the energy savings of the high-efficiency
motor to pay for the added investment. The MotorFacts sheet also
lets you compare the long-term costs of repairing a motor, purchasing a new standard-efficiency motor, and purchasing a high-efficiency motor.

<H2><A NAME="hybcool">Hybrid Cooling-Analysis </A></H2>

<P>
Hybrid cooling systems-which combine gas-fueled and electrical
components-may have advantages over single-fuel systems with respect
to initial cost, operating costs, or power demand reduction. With
computer simulations, this study looked for the best ways to configure
and operate hybrid commercial-cooling systems. Optimal configurations
were determined using simple payback, net present value, utility
net benefit, and total resource cost tests. Real-world commercial-cooling
data from an earlier Center project helped create performance
models of hybrid systems under different operating scenarios.

<H2><A NAME="bluprnt">Commercial Building Practices in Wisconsin
(Blue Print) </A></H2>

<P>
Commercial buildings account for more than one-sixth of Wisconsin's
energy consumption. Consequently, utilities and state agencies
have implemented incentive programs targeted to this sector. To
evaluate the success of these programs and determine opportunities
for future savings, program planners need systematic data on current
building practices. This study evaluated the usefulness of a time-saving
alternative to owner/occupant surveys and on-site audits: review
of blueprint plans submitted by commercial builders during the
permit process. Center staff tallied the energy-efficiency measures
built into four different sizes of commercial structures between
1986 and 1991. They harvested this information from 48 randomly
selected blueprints and telephone interviews with the project
architects and engineers. The study report discusses the benefits
and limitations of this approach, summarizes what the blueprint
review revealed about Wisconsin building practices, and makes
suggestions for further research.

<H2><A NAME="gascool">Evaluation of Gas-Engine Driven Cooling
Systems </A></H2>

<P>
This study evaluated the load-reducing potential of cooling systems
that are driven by gas engines and that incorporate a variety
of systems for storing energy in cooled substances. The analysis
compared the simple payback of gas-engine driven systems, with
and without storage, to that of electrically driven systems without
storage. Contacts with manufacturers of gas-engine driven chillers
indicated that storage is included in only 5 to 10 percent of
new systems that are installed. The engineering analysis concluded
that the results of the simple-payback comparisons varied widely
depending on such variables as daily cooling-load profile, equipment
cost, and energy costs. In the best-case scenario for Wisconsin,
gas-engine driven systems that include storage have a predicted
payback of about three years. Under most conditions, gas-fired
systems with storage have a faster payback than those without
storage, but electrically driven systems with or without storage
have a faster payback than either type of gas system under current
rate structures. The study concluded that because of competition
from both electric systems and gas systems without storage, gas-engine
driven systems that include storage are not likely to capture
a significant share of the Wisconsin market.

<H2><A NAME="resdlc">Residential Air Conditioner DLC Impact Evaluation
</A></H2>

<P>
Direct load control is the demand-side management tool that utilities
use more than any other to reduce peak demand for power. Several
Wisconsin utilities with electric water heater DLC programs expanded
their programs to include central air conditioners. This project
looked at the cost effectiveness of direct-load control of air
conditioners in the state, through five joint evaluation programs
by five Wisconsin electric and combination utilities. Data were
collected from about 700 sites in 1992 and almost 500 in 1993.
The project also looked at customer comfort, and customer use
of other cooling devices when AC controls are active. A follow-on
study by an ECW student intern examined the potential for commercial
direct load control.

<H2><A NAME="lmscope">Load Management and Commercial Cooling Scoping
Study, Phases 1 &amp; 2 </A></H2>

<P>
Many utilities have or are developing commercial load management
programs to address capacity concerns caused by extreme hot summer
days and system emergencies. To facilitate the development of
these programs, this study identified load management opportunities
in commercial lighting and air conditioning. Phase 1 identified
potential load management strategies and technologies for groceries,
health facilities, offices, retail buildings, schools, and warehouses.
During Phase 2, a computerized screening tool was developed, and
this tool was evaluated using five load management strategies:
thermal energy storage, dimmable ballasts, control of chillers
with EMCS's, DLC of packaged air conditioners, and direct current
lighting systems.

<H2><A NAME="asds">Adjustable Speed Drive Project </A></H2>

<P>
Intended for DSM program planners and managers, the study outlines
the market structure of electric motors and adjustable speed drives
in Wisconsin. The study highlights some of the barriers to utility
drive-power programs, recommends ways in which utilities can improve
their incentive programs, and suggests topics for further research.
For many industrial applications, adjustable-speed drives can
be more efficient than conventional electric motors. Because,
however, of an early history of reliability problems, inappropriate
applications, and poor maintenance, market acceptance for these
devices has been slow. Designed to help correct such impressions
by providing well-documented case studies of ASD applications
in Wisconsin, the project monitored the energy performance and
power-quality characteristics of ASDs. These ASDs were used in
three important Wisconsin applications: pulp and paper, food processing,
and municipal waste water treatment. The project resulted in a
series of documents that cover such topics as ASDs' current state-of-the-art
applications within each industry and a protocol for collecting
information about and assessing the benefits of ASDs.

The system performance and supervisory control of direct-fired
(natural gas) double-effect water-LiBr absorption chillers for
commercial cooling applications is investigated using both computer
simulation and field monitoring data. Two direct-fired double-effect
absorption chillers of 200 and 400 ton capacity at two different
sites were monitored during the 1993 and 1994 cooling seasons
and these data were made available for this research. The transient
simulation program TRNSYS was used to simulate an HVAC system
consisting of a 400 ton direct-fired double-effect absorption
chiller, a chilled and cooling water pumps, a cooling tower, and
a cooling water bypass valve. Optimal supervisory control of the
chiller system was determined, and energy usage under optimal
control was compared to other control strategies.

<H1>Intern Program</H1>

<P>
From its inception, the Center has sponsored interns from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. This program has two aims: to
provide hands-on educational opportunities for students interested
in the utility and energy industries, and to provide the Center
with highly skilled help.
<P>
Many of our interns are graduate students at the Institute
for Environmental Studies. We also recruit
students from the Business School who specialize in marketing and market research, as well as 
engineering students. Most interns have specific engineering, science
or business skills, with some exposure to the energy field. Many
are returning students with several years of work experience. <p>
Our interns generally work part time, and we give priority to students who are
able to make at least a one-year commitment. When appropriate,
we support interns as UW-Madison Project Assistants, which allows them to pay in-state tuition 
and recieve health insurance through the university. 
During the summer, we often employ students on an hourly-basis.
<P>
Interns' responsibilities vary, depending on the skills of the
intern and the current project mix at the Center. Interns have
been involved in literature searches and scoping studies, data
analyses, research of energy-conserving technologies, requests for proposals, and
project proposal development.<HR>

motors (EEMs) and adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) have the potential
to substantially reduce electricity consumption and demand. To
reduce both peak electric demand and customers' energy costs,
utilities have encouraged the purchase of energy-efficient drivepower
options. Utility promotional activities typically incorporate
audits, informational programs, and prescriptive rebates for energy
efficient motors, and generally use custom rebates for ASDs. Several
market barriers, however, reduce the effectiveness of these programs.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Hybrid Cooling</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>
<H1>Optimal Equipment Configurations and Operational Strategies for Hybrid Cooling Systems
</H1> 
In Wisconsin, commercial cooling accounts for a significant fraction of peak electricity demand in the summer. Gas-fired cooling equipment can be an important tool for managing electricity demand, but only if the technology is tailored carefully to the type of cooling load, weather, and utility rate structure applicable to a specific site. Studies indicate that hybrid cooling systems, consisting of both electrically driven and gas-fired components, can offer significant advantages over single-fuel systems when such hybrid systems are configured and controlled properly.

<H2>Objective</H2>
The Center sponsored this study to address several key issues in the optimization of hybrid cooling systems:

<UL>
<LI>How should the installed capacity be divided between the electrical and gas-driven components in a hybrid cooling system?
<LI>Which component-gas-driven or electric-should be dedicated to the base load and which to the peak load?
<li>How do the features of the optimal configuration change in response to assumptions about the present and future costs of equipment, installation, fuel, and maintenance for hybrid cooling systems?
</UL>
This report summarizes the results of an engineering modeling study that determined optimal equipment configurations and control strategies for a sample of hybrid cooling systems. These optimal configurations are given in terms of four objective functions: simple payback, net present value, utility net benefit, and total resource costs (TRC). The systems were modeled with cooling loads, weather data, maintenance costs, and utility rates typical of Wisconsin. The results of the modeling, presented in graphical form, indicate the conditions under which hybrid cooling technology is competitive with single-fuel cooling systems. The study results also provide an objective method for identifying appropriate applications for hybrid cooling systems.

<H2>Findings</H2>
The study provides both general and specific findings.
<H3>General</H3>
The following general conclusions are valid for the conditions examined in this report and for assumptions outlined in the methods section.
&bull;	Hybrid cooling systems show benefits over gas-only systems within a narrow range of conditions, which is bounded at one end by conditions very favorable to gas-only systems and at the other end by conditions very favorable to electric-only systems.
<P>
Assuming availability of both gas and electric power, when conditions are strongly favorable to gas-driven systems, hybrids generally do not out perform gas-only systems. When conditions are strongly favorable to electric-driven systems, neither hybrids nor gas-only cooling systems are attractive.

<UL>
<LI>In the region in which hybrid cooling systems optimize the values of the objective functions, the fraction of the hybrid system installed capacity that was represented by electrical components ranged from 40 to 60 percent-which represents an electrical capacity fraction of 0.4 to 0.6.
However, in some cases, these optima were rather flat, and therefore there were only slight differences in the values of the objective function over a wide range of electric capacity fractions.
<LI>Under the conditions examined in this report, the optimum control strategy for hybrid cooling systems is to use the electrically driven component to meet the base cooling load, and then to use the gas-driven component to meet loads in excess of the maximum capacity of the electric unit. (This is referred to as the "electric first" control strategy.)
<li>Under the conditions examined in this report, the large office load profile paired with electric centrifugal and gas-driven absorption equipment offered a potentially more attractive range of simple-payback periods than gas-only systems.
</UL>
The results of this study suggest that a region of opportunity exists for hybrid systems of this configuration for an equipment first-cost differential up to $50 per ton.
<H3>Specific</H3>
The following specific conclusions, one for each of the four objective functions, apply to the electric-first operating strategy. They are valid for the conditions and assumptions outlined in the method section of this report, and for equipment combinations, load types, and configurations specified in the body of the report.

<H4>Simple Payback</H4>
There is a narrow range of conditions under which hybrid systems offer a better simple payback than gas-only systems. This narrow region is defined by conditions that are most unfavorable for gas-only systems, including moderately large first-cost differentials, large differences in equipment coefficient of performance, and low electrical energy and demand rates.

<H4>Net Present Value</H4>
A balanced installed capacity split and gas-to-electric cost differentials of $80/ton or less provide attractive net present values. For smaller systems (such as rooftop systems), attractive net present values are possible with gas-dominated (electrical fraction of 0.2 or less) installed capacity splits and first cost differentials of less than $100/ton.

<H4>Utility Net Benefit</H4>
Electrical capacity fractions between 0.3 and 0.7 and administrative costs-chiefly monetary rebates and staff time to implement DSM programs-of less than $350/kW provide attractive values of utility net benefit.

<H4>Total Resource Cost</H4>
The study examined large office buildings and medical facilities. Central hybrid systems in large office buildings provide attractive TRCs when they have electrical capacity fractions between 0.3 and 0.7, first cost differentials of less than $200/ton, and administrative costs of less than $100/ton. Large hybrid systems in medical facilities provide attractive TRCs when they have electrical capacity fractions between 0.50 and 0.75, first cost differentials of less than $100/ton, and administrative costs of less than $100/kW.

<H2>Recommendations</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Users of cooling equipment who rely on simple payback as their decision criterion can use the simple-payback period of the gas-only system as a screening criterion.
If the simple payback period of the gas-only system is less than or equal to three years, then it is unlikely that the hybrid system will offer significant benefits. However, if the gas-only system simple payback is greater than three years, then hybrid systems may show comparative advantages.
<LI>Net present values cited in this report reflect a specific set of background conditions and economic assumptions.
For the conditions examined in this report, central chiller systems with a balanced installed capacity split (0.4 to 0.6 electrical capacity fraction) and a first-cost differential of less than $80/ton offer attractive net present values, as do smaller systems with an electrical capacity fraction of 0.2 or less and a first-cost differential of less than $100/ton. End-users who apply net present value as a decision criterion may wish to use the values given in this report as background information rather than as specific guidelines.
<LI>Utilities should examine the potential application of hybrid systems when the value of administrative costs for gas-only systems reaches a range of $150 to $300/ton.
<li>Regulatory agencies that use TRC as a decision criterion may wish to coordinate utility policy on hybrid systems to ensure that utilities do not subsidize hybrid cooling systems whose TRC values are negative.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summaries: ASDs</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1><A NAME="ASD Project">Adjustable-Speed Drives Project Executive Summaries</A></H1>

Adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) can reduce the energy consumed by electrical equipment while simultaneously allowing more precise control over the manufacturing process. Specifically, ASDs allow the speed of a pump, fan, blower, or other device to be matched to varying load requirements. Indeed, in some cases, use of ASDs can result in efficiency gains of 50 percent or more. In appropriate applications, ASDs can also enhance overall process control, decrease ambient equipment noise, and reduce maintenance costs.

<H2><A NAME="ASD Assessment Guide">ASD Assessment Guide</A></H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>

This ASD Assessment Guide provides technical information and decision criteria that utility representatives and their customers can use to identify potentially beneficial applications for ASDs. Issues addressed include the technical differences between the major types of ASDs, their applicability to different kinds of motor loads, and the impact of ASDs on power quality. The guide also describes opportunities for ASD use in three major Wisconsin industrial applications: food processing, pulp and paper production, and wastewater treatment.

<H3>Findings</H3>

The following items are highlights from the full report. Though not a comprehensive selection, they represent important and potentially useful information about the application of adjustable-speed drives. The first four findings are technology related and the last is user related.

<UL>

<LI>The most potentially beneficial applications for ASDs are those that require variable speed and have high annual operating costs.

<LI>Other factors may influence the suitability of ASDs to a particular situation, including the installation environment, available space for new equipment at the site, and performance requirements of the manufacturing process or equipment with respect to speed regulation, control accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.

<LI>The energy saved as a result of ASD use is greatest in applications involving variable-torque loads, such as pumps, fans, and blowers.

<LI>ASDs provide more effective speed control, and often more effective process control, rather than energy savings in certain other types of applications, such as some constant-torque loads.

<LI>Particularly for motors of 200 horsepower or less, pulse-width modulation ASDs are becoming the most popular of the major adjustable-speed drive technologies, largely because they have the least impact on power quality and can drive motors smoothly over a wide range of speeds.

<LI>Concerns about maintenance requirements and reliability strongly influence users' decisions to install ASDs and so limit full market penetration of ASDs.

<li>The perseverance of these concerns places limits on the full market penetration of ASDs.

</UL>

<H3>Recommendations</H3>

To expand the market of ASDs, utilities can:

<UL>

<LI>Relieve customers' concerns about ASDs' maintenance requirements and reliability by providing tangible evidence of the successful use of ASDs in the field and by providing information about the proper application and operation of ASDs

<LI>Emphasize the potential for reduced maintenance and other operating costs, "hands-off" operation of modern ASDs, as well as their potential for significant energy savings

<li>Encourage customers for whom unplanned shutdowns are critical to purchase premium quality ASDs, which tend to be the most reliable of these devices

 <H2><A NAME="ASD Generic Monitoring Plan">ASD Generic Monitoring Plan</A></H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>
This Generic Monitoring Plan provides utility service representatives with guidelines for collecting and evaluating data on ASD performance. The topics addressed by the full report include:
<UL>
<LI>How to determine whether a site is a suitable candidate for ASD monitoring
<LI>Procedures for determining the energy savings that result from using ASDs
<LI>Procedures for determining the power-quality impacts of ASDs
<LI>Impacts of ASDs in addition to energy consumption and power quality
<li>How to document the results of ASD performance monitoring
</UL>
<H3>Key Points</H3>
The following items are highlights culled from the full report. Though not a comprehensive selection, they represent important aspects of the design and implementation of ASD monitoring.
<UL>
<LI>A number of factors influence whether a particular site is suitable for ASD monitoring. The chief decision criterion is whether the data collected in one setting will prove generally applicable to other industries.

For example, performance data on ASDs used to control pumps, fans, and blowers would be generally applicable, because such equipment is used in some fashion in so many industries. In contrast, a site equipped with out-of-production ASDs or one that utilizes electric motors beyond the typical horsepower range found in most industrial setting would not be a good candidate for ASD monitoring.
<LI>The feasibility of a monitoring program depends on the cooperation that can be expected from the personnel at the site and on whether the manufacturing environment and electrical systems are physically suitable. This can be assessed during telephone interviews with facility personnel and during a prequalification visit to the site.
<LI>The choice of a monitoring strategy for assessing the amount of energy saved by using ASDs involves a trade-off between effectiveness and ease of implementation. 

For example, the monitoring methods that produce the best data are also the most complex to implement.
<LI>One of the most important preliminary steps in designing a monitoring plan is the preparation of a schematic (single-line) diagram of the electrical environment in which the ASDs operate.

This diagram will guide the placement of monitoring equipment. The information needed to prepare the schematic can be obtained from electrical blueprints of the facility and through on-site circuit tracing.
<LI>The most important piece of equipment for monitoring the impact of ASDs on power quality at a site is the harmonic analyzer. The single-line diagram will guide placement of the analyzer.
<LI>Performance data on ASDs with respect to energy savings and impact on power quality should be documented by either summary statistics or waveform graphs, depending on the particular quantity measured.

For example, some impacts of ASDs on power quality--the introduction of unwanted voltage "noise," for example--are best represented graphically. In contrast, the percentage change in energy consumption that can result from the use of an ASD to drive a particular application is best represented statistically.
<LI>In the overall monitoring strategy, it is important to include ASD impacts besides those concerning energy consumption and power quality. 

Such auxiliary factors could include decreased ambient equipment noise, fewer equipment overhauls, or enhanced product quality. These factors could affect the decision of a prospective ASD user for whom power quality and energy consumption are not of overriding concern.

<H2><A NAME="ASD Case Studies">ASD Case Studies</A></H2>

<H3>Purpose</H3>

This Case Studies Report is one of a set of four reports on ASDs. It describes the on-site monitoring of ASDs for energy consumption and power-quality impacts in three industrial applications that account for a significant fraction of the electrical power consumed in Wisconsin: food processing, paper manufacturing, and municipal wastewater treatment.

<H3>General Findings</H3>

Several findings apply to all of the facilities that were monitored.

<UL>

<LI>The results of the site monitoring confirm that, in appropriate applications, adjustable-speed drives can lead to significant energy savings. This is especially true for processes that require variable output, such as from air blowers or centrifugal pumps.

<LI>The impacts of ASDs on power quality were minimal.

<LI>User satisfaction with ASD technology was high.

<LI>ASDs enhanced overall system performance.

<li>In specific cases-as the study of the dairy products plant indicated-a very broad scope of monitoring could provide valuable additional information on the total energy savings attributable to ASD use.

</UL>

<H3>Specific Findings</H3>

Each case study also produced findings that apply specifically to the particular application that was investigated.

<H4>Dairy Products Plant</H4>

<UL>

<LI>ASDs increased the operational efficiency of the feedwater pumps, yielding energy savings of about 40 percent.

<LI>The ASDs used to control steam boiler feedwater pumps performed reliably.

<LI>Paper Manufacturing

<LI>The ASDs allow the air supply to the steam boilers to be matched closely to demand, resulting in greater efficiency and fan energy savings of nearly 70 percent.

<li>The ASDs controlling steam boiler air-supply fans performed reliably.

</UL>

<H4>Municipal Wastewater Treatment</H4>

<UL>

<LI>The ASDs provided more precise control of pump head pressure, leading to energy savings of more than 20 percent

<li>ASDs used to control centrifugal and mechanical-screw pumps performed reliably and enhanced overall process control.

</UL>

<H3>Projections</H3>

<UL>

<LI>Results from the dairy-products plant study may also apply to other applications in which centrifugal pumps are used to move fluids, such as chilled water for cooling, water-supply systems, dairies, and bottling operations.

<LI>The paper manufacturing case study suggests that ASD-equipped blower systems can operate significantly more efficiently than constant-speed blowers controlled by mechanical means, such as vanes and dampers.

<LI>These results also may apply to other processes that require continuous air flow, such as industrial drying processes, sludge aeration in the sewage treatment industry, and certain paper manufacturing processes.

<li>The municipal wastewater treatment case study suggests that ASDs can provide significant energy savings in processes that require variable output from centrifugal fluid pumps. Such processes can be found in cooling systems, breweries, dairies, chemical plants, and bottling operations.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Modeling Dairy Farm Systems</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Modeling Dairy Farm Milk Cooling and Water Heating Systems</H1>
This study provides estimates of how specific demand-side management techniques can lower energy usage and costs on dairy farms.
A typical Wisconsin dairy farm devotes about one-half of its electricity for cooling milk and heating water. If these processes were made more efficient, farms could save much of this energy. To find out how to improve these processes, University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers developed a computer model to determine the most efficient heating and cooling configurations for dairy farms of various sizes, as well as predict the overall cost savings for farmers.

<H2>Method</H2>
The researchers monitored the performance of a 20- to 25-year-old refrigeration and heating system that a Wisconsin dairy farm was using. The system was then upgraded with various modern energy-saving equipment and re-evaluated. This information was used to develop-with funding from the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research-a computer model to predict the energy demands of various milk-cooling and water-heating systems. To compute the overall benefits of different options, the simulations consider the combined effects of several variables-farm organization and size, utility rates, various combinations of equipment used, and cost of new installations-on demand for electricity. The model was compared to data from actual installations to confirm accuracy, and then used to develop specific recommendations. These recommendations can help utilities and dairy farmers find mutually beneficial ways to control energy demand, and in doing so avoid or defer the need to build new power plants.

<H2>Energy-Saving Options for Dairy Farms</H2>
The study evaluated the following options for reducing energy costs and peak energy demand on Wisconsin dairy farms:
<UL>
<LI>Heat Recovery
Heat from the milk is recovered as it passes through the refrigeration system. This waste heat is then used for heating water. Heat recovery requires no additional energy and it also increases the efficiency of the compressor by removing heat from the refrigerant.
<LI>Well Water Precooling
Naturally cold well water can help cool milk before it enters the refrigeration system. Precooling typically reduces the refrigerator's energy consumption by 25 to 33 percent and also increases its cooling capacity.
<LI>Ice Banks
Ice banks can shift milk-cooling electric loads to off-peak (and possibly low-rate) periods. A refrigerator builds the ice bank during off-peak hours, and the ice is later used for reduced-load milk cooling during on-peak milking periods.
<LI>Other Measures
A variety of other simple, low-cost procedures can also help improve efficiency. These include eliminating nonessential water heating, using appropriate insulation for hot-water pipes, water heaters, and water tanks, using efficient, properly maintained heating and cooling devices, and carefully managing energy usage.
</UL>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
The computer model was used to evaluate different energy-saving options and their interactions on 60-, 200-, and 400-cow farms. It indicated the following:
<UL>
<LI>In general, the options are most effective on larger farms.
Various equipment configurations and management methods can bring total milk-cooling and water-heating energy savings of 33 percent for a 60-cow farm, 45 percent for a 200-cow farm, and 46 percent for a 400-cow farm.
<LI>Heat recovery and precooling equipment upgrades are generally the most cost-effective options.
<LI>Optimal configurations depend on the size of the farm.
As farm size increases, the proportion of savings from heat recovery decreases while that from precooling increases. For the quantities of milk that small farms produce, all of the recovered heat from milk can be applied to meet water-heating demands. Larger quantities of milk, however, can contain more heat than needed for water heating. Because refrigeration units use energy to remove this excess heat, the value of precoolers increases as farm size increases.
</UL>
<H2>Recommendations</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A 60-cow farm should use heat recovery.
<LI>Larger farms-those with 200 or 400 cows-should use a combination of heat recovery and precooling to provide maximum energy savings. 400-cow farms that choose only one option should select precooling.
<LI>An ice bank is practical only where significant savings can be achieved through subscription to a time-of-day rate schedule, or on larger farms where standard refrigeration is insufficient to meet cooling needs.
<LI>On any farm, milk pipelines should be sized appropriately for the volume of milk they carry because larger pipelines require more energy to clean. For example, 60-cow farms should use two-inch-diameter pipelines rather than three-inch.
<li>Farmers should adopt a variety of simple, low-cost options (such as using optimal thermostat settings and equipment setups) that can significantly lower energy use without requiring significant investment.

<H1>Review of Energy-Efficient Measures in Wisconsin Commercial Construction, 1986-1990</H1>

Recognizing that commercial buildings account for more than one-sixth of the state's energy use, Wisconsin utilities and state agencies have designed and implemented many energy efficiency programs for this sector. These programs include codes and standards as well as incentives for investments above prevailing levels of efficiency.
<P>
Rebate applications and code enforcement provide some understanding of the current market-the degree to which energy efficiency measures are included in new commercial construction. To help evaluate the efficacy of current programs and determine directions for future efforts, however, program planners need more systematically gathered information regarding standard construction practices.
<P>
Several options are available to meet this need, including owner/occupant surveys and on-site audits, both of which are likely to require major resource investments. As part of its overall program of technology studies in support of energy efficiency efforts in the state, the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research undertook this study to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a somewhat less resource-intensive approach, a review of building blueprint plans filed as part of the normal permit process.
<P>
This study describes information on selected energy efficiency measures obtained from a thorough review of 48 blueprints, supplemented-where necessary-by telephone interviews with architects and engineers responsible for those plans. The sample of plans was selected from those filed between 1986 and 1991 to represent statistically four size strata of office buildings and retail space.
<P>
The report discusses the availability of required information, problems encountered, and lessons learned. It also summarizes the findings obtained regarding the use of energy efficient envelope measures, mechanical systems and lighting. A final chapter includes suggestions for further research on this topic, as well as recommendations for consideration by program planners and those responsible for building code modification.
<P>
The remainder of this summary includes several key findings and recommendations, followed by comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.

<H2>Findings</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Some energy efficiency measures appear to be included in new buildings as standard practice.
<BR>
For example, the wall insulation for all but approximately 15 percent of space in each sector (offices, retail space) is planned to exceed the base levels of both the revised ashrae Standard 90.1-1989 and the more stringent California code.
<BR>
Similarly, virtually all of the building plans examined (46 of 48) call for thermal break windows, and most (35) include double-entry vestibules.

<LI>Inclusion or non-inclusion of a second group of measures in building plans appears to be related to building function.
<BR>
For example, the roofing insulation for more than 75 percent of the retail space, but only 40 percent of office buildings planned within the period studied would not meet the revised ashrae Standard 90.1-1989.


<BR>
In the systems area, current Wisconsin practices, as exemplified by the plans studied, provide for cooling units-packaged rooftop units-that substantially exceed the state's minimum efficiency standards (7.8 eer for units with less than 65,000 Btu/hr capacity; 8.2 eer for units of 65,000 Btu/hr capacity or more). The mean level for retail space is greater than 9.5, and that for offices is greater than 9.0. However, while approximately 80 percent of retail space efficiencies also exceed the revised ashrae standard (and the New York code), only about 40 percent of office space efficiencies appear to do so. An additional 20 percent of space in each sector (i.e., 60 percent of office space and 95 percent of retail space) would fail to meet the standards set forth in the California building code.
<BR>
Similarly, only one retail building plan (of 24) incorporates increased daylighting in its design, but nine of 24 office buildings do so; and seven office building plans, but none for retail buildings include use of compact fluorescents.


<LI>Building size is also a determinant of use for some measures.<BR>
Larger buildings are significantly more likely to include air economizers, programmable thermostats and energy management control systems. They also tend to include exhaust air heat recovery and reflective solar glazing more often than smaller buildings.
<LI>Finally, some measures are seldom included in building plans for either offices or retail space.
<BR>For example, only one building plan incorporates the use of external or natural shading, and only one calls for installation of a heat pump.
</UL>

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

The relatively frequent presence of above-standard levels of some energy-efficiency measures, such as roof and wall insulation, indicates that cost-effective opportunities for increased use of energy efficiency measures exist.
<P>
Whether the opportunities observed should be pursued by revising building codes or by continued or increased utility incentives is a policy issue beyond the scope of this study. Nonetheless, it may be possible to suggest certain points for initial consideration.
<P>
Clearly, decision makers should take into account the cost effectiveness of each measure from both the builder's and end user's perspectives, as well as the applicability of each to different building types and building sizes. When measures, such as thermal break windows, are nearly always used, it would appear that both the architectural and engineering community and owners and operators agree on their value and cost-effectiveness without additional subsidies. Such measures should almost certainly be required in state codes. In contrast, measures that appear cost-effective based on engineering estimates, but which have very low penetration may require the use of utility incentives to open up the market and provide case study examples.

<H2>Using Blueprints to Study Current Building Efficiency Practices</H2>

This study provided valuable insights regarding commercial building in Wisconsin, with a relatively small initial investment of resources. At the same time, the method is limited, both as a result of the practical difficulties of identifying, retrieving and reviewing the data and the availability of certain types of information (e.g., detailed mechanical and lighting system plans) within the blueprints themselves. At the very least, future efforts should plan for systematic follow-up interviews with the architects and engineers involved in the projects studied.
<P>
Valuable insights regarding current practice seem likely to emerge from a comparison of the planned buildings with commissioning studies or on-site audits of the completed structures, and the energy bills for those structures. While the level of resources and the calendar time required for such comprehensive efforts are likely to limit their applicability to only the most energy-intensive buildings or building types, the lessons learned may be broadly useful.

<H1>Wisconsin's Statewide Technical and Economic Potential</H1>

<H2>Estimating Wisconsin's Potential for Energy and Demand Savings</H2>
<P>
As part of Wisconsin's integrated resource planning process, the regulatory commission requires Wisconsin's Class A electrical and combination utilities to provide estimates of the potential savings from demand-side management. By consensus, a committee of utility staff, regulatory staff, and intervenors developed the estimation method reported here.
<P>
This report-which was prepared by staff at the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research and submitted to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin-documents the method and the resulting estimates of statewide savings potential over the next 20 years. The estimates are intended to provide reasonableness checks and bounds for evaluating the demand-side plans of Wisconsin's electric utilities. These estimates should also help policy makers understand the limits of, and opportunities for, demand-side management. 
<P>
The results presented in this report reflect a specific set of assumptions and available data; they are not intended for use in making detailed predictions, such as the savings specific technologies could produce. Rather, the value of the report lies in the presentation of the algorithm, which could be used with appropriate data and assumptions to estimate potential in other jurisdictions.

<H2>What is "Potential"?</H2>
<P>
For this analysis, the project defined two types of potential savings.
<P>
Technical potential is the electrical load reduction that results when the most efficient demand-side measures are adopted by the entire eligible population in the base year. It was assumed that these measures are adopted regardless of economics.
<P>
Economic potential is the electrical load reduction that results when the most efficient demand-side measures are adopted by the entire eligible population when it is economical to do so from society's overall perspective. Measures were screened using the Technical Cost Test, as defined under Wisconsin's regulatory process.
<P>
The demand-side measures that were considered in this study can be divided into three broad categories:

<UL>

<LI>Conservation measures, which conserve energy

<LI>Load management measures, which control or shift demand for electricity during peak hours

<li>Fuel switching measures, which eliminate the demand for electricity by switching to other forms of energy (in this study, only natural gas)

</UL>

<H2>Sources of Information Used in Estimating Potential</H2>

The estimates of potential are based on technology information, market saturations, and economic projections that were provided by the participating utilities and by research conducted by Center staff. The technology and saturation information were incorporated into the Wisconsin Demand-side Options Database (<A HREF="../wdod.html">W-DOD</A>). W-DOD provides comparisons between demand-side alternatives and conventional technologies for end uses in the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. It is primarily used for long-term demand-side program planning.

<H2>Results</H2>

The results section of the report includes charts showing the technical and economic demand-side potential for savings in electrical consumption and demand in Wisconsin. The savings are shown for four economic sectors: agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential.
<P>
Technical potential and economic potential are shown for several different scenarios. Technical potential was calculated using four scenarios for the types of DSM measures included: fuel switching only, conservation only, load management only, and all measures together. Economic potential was calculated for several different avoided-cost scenarios.
<P>
Again, we emphasize that the results are dependent on a set of assumptions and available data that are Wisconsin-specific. The primary external value of the report lies in its exposition of the method for estimating demand-side potential. This method could be used with suitable data and assumptions to estimate potential for other locations or for specific building types, technologies, and market segments.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Impact of Res. Gas Furnaces</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Determining the Impact of Residential Gas Furnaces on Utilities with Applications to Other End Uses</H1>
Computer simulations can help utilities evaluate the potentials of new DSM technologies without the expense of monitoring a large number of systems. It is important that simulation programs account for many patterns of energy use for systems such as gas furnaces, air conditioners, or electric water heaters that are used differently in different households. Unlike simulating or monitoring a single average system, multiple-system simulations account for the interaction of many different systems and the resulting impacts on peak demand.

The researcher, Kevin Warren, developed a computer simulation program that realistically models many residential gas furnaces. The program is designed to serve as a tool for estimating the impacts of many DSM technologies and can be applied to other types of systems.

<H2>Computer Model</H2>
A database of monitored gas furnace loads-provided by the Wisconsin Gas Company-along with weather data corresponding to the monitoring period, provided the foundation for the model. The database contains gas consumption rates over five-minute intervals for about 100 homes, and it includes house parameters such as furnace type, floor area, and thermostat settings. Warren verified the model by showing that it reliably predicts the measured loads from house parameters and weather data, and therefore should be an accurate load predictor for any number of houses and weather conditions.

<H2>Simulations</H2>
Warren simulated gas loads and energy use for up to 100,000 houses on a typical peak heating day. His program performed these simulation technologies:
<OL>
<LI>Modeled the loads using temperature-level control, where thermostats are automatically set back at night.
<LI>Estimated the load from a single average home assuming energy-rate control (ERC), which continuously alters furnace output to meet the heating load.
Although most furnaces are incapable of ERC, an easy-to-perform, one-house simulation that assumes ERC can closely reflect the energy loads averaged from multiple houses.
<li>Estimated and compared ERC loads from residential air conditioners of different operating efficiencies.
</OL>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The simulations satisfactorily estimate energy use and demand.
<LI>Temperature-level control
Temperature-level control simulations are necessary for estimating heating-load demand when variables such as thermostat setbacks are included.
<LI>Energy-rate control of heating
Energy-rate control allows a rapid estimation of energy use. A single ERC simulation that is based on average house parameters predicts energy use accurately.
ERC also is adequate for modeling the load's response to changes in the weather but doesn't accurately model the load's response to changes in the home's internal temperature. One source of such temperature changes is programmable thermostats.
<LI>Using simulations for predicting the impacts of specific end-uses on utility peak loads should facilitate future DSM studies.
<LI>Optimum number of simulations
About 1,000 simulations are needed to estimate heating loads and demand. More simulations do not significantly improve the accuracy of the results.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Impact of Distributed Systems</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Impact of Distributed Systems</H1>
One way to reduce energy consumption and peak energy demand is to replace many small systems, such as domestic water heaters, with energy-saving alternatives. Water heating is the second largest residential electricity consumer, and therefore replacement of conventional electric water heaters with electric-backup solar domestic hot water systems (SDHWs) has the potential to reduce energy use significantly. Because SDHWs perform best on hot sunny days--when many utilities are faced with high cooling load peaks--they can be especially effective at easing electric demand during these periods. Furthermore, for such utilities it is unlikely that extreme peak-cooling situations would occur on cloudy days when SDHWs exhibit their highest demands for utility-supplied power.
<P>
This study used a computer simulation model to estimate the impacts of installing up to 4,000 SDHWs under a variety of operating conditions, considering parameters such as changing weather, different thermostat set points and water use patterns, and the thermodynamics of various SDHW technologies. The TRNSYS computer program1 was used in the simulations. TRNSYS also simulated the effects of various DSM control strategies on water-heating loads, such as combinations of preheating water before peak times and lowering set-point temperatures during peak times. The model could be refined by adding data on specific solar technologies, load patterns, and utility demands to estimate more realistic impacts of solar energy systems.

<H2>Conclusions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The  simulation of a single system does not accurately predict peak power demand for the utility and thus is not adequate for making realistic predictions.
<LI>A simulation group size of 400 water heaters is adequate for making good estimations of energy use and power demand; larger numbers of simulations do not significantly improve the estimations.
<LI>Assuming widespread use of SDHWs where the sun provides an average of 60 percent of the energy for heating water, an SDHW reduces peak water heating electricity load by 15 to 20 percent and energy use by 60 percent.
<LI>Under the simulation conditions--a Madison, Wisconsin service area during peak load conditions of August, from 1 pm to 4 pm--the sun provided an average of 90 percent of the energy for heating water, resulting in water-heating peak-load reductions of 15 to 30 percent and energy use reductions of 90 percent. During the highest utility peak, SDHWs reduced the water-heating load by more than 70 percent. These reductions occurred regardless of the shape of the hot-water load.
<li>It is possible to remove all solar water-heating demand from a utility's peak demand, by employing a control strategy through which the system preheats the water before the peak period and lowers the set-point temperature during the peak period.

<H1>A Commercial Direct-Load Control Savings Estimate for Wisconsin</H1>
<P>
Although direct-load control programs are rare in the commercial sector, they could reduce peak summer loads significantly. This report demonstrates a simple way to use existing data to estimate how much of the commercial sector's energy load is available for direct-load control.
<P>
The project explored one of many possible applications for the Center's commercial-cooling load library: a collection of cooling-load estimates that are based on information about load and building characteristics from 45 Wisconsin commercial buildings and that include three years of electrical consumption data. To ensure a homogeneous sample, the research team used only the 36 sites that had rooftop, direct expansion cooling units. The cooling-load estimates were combined with corresponding weather data to create commercial load shapes averaged across the sites. The load shapes show general patterns of commercial energy use for specific day types, building types, and times of day, illustrating how these factors affect commercial cooling loads.
<P>
The load shapes in the report could be used to estimate the impacts of commercial direct-load control. In addition to showing the potential for a 100 percent shed strategy, the report includes load shapes that reflect the cooling load impacts of a 50 percent cycling strategy. The data in the report are in terms that are useful to dsm planners. These terms include part-load ratio, kW/ton, and kW/ft2 of commercial space.
<P>
The report shows that significant commercial loads are available for control during daytime. On the most extreme cooling days, commercial loads approach near 70 percent of capacity, and the total load available to shedding control is near 2.9 kW per 1000 ft2 of commercial building space. This is equivalent to 0.88 kW per ton of installed cooling equipment. Although commercial systems typically operate far below capacity, a small fraction of the load would be available to a 50 percent cycling strategy. The corresponding savings are about 0.8 kW/1000 ft2 or 0.25 kW/ton. There was, however, a large amount of variance in the building loads, suggesting that a targeted load-control program may achieve greater demand savings than the potential determined in this study.

<H1>Tracking Appliance Sales through Customer Interviews: A Pilot
Study</H1>

<P>
Evaluations of utility programs designed to increase the market
penetration of energy-efficient appliances often rely on tracking
the sales of those and competing appliances. The purpose of this
project was to test collecting sales tracking information by gathering
purchase data directly from customers. The data were for five
appliances: refrigerators, water heaters, room air conditioners,
central air conditioners, and forced air furnaces.
<H2>Methods and Objectives</H2>

<P>
A 1993 scoping study (WCDSR, Requirements for a Sales Tracking
System: A Scoping Study, Report No. 115-1) exposed limitations
to the representativeness of sales data that are collected from
retailers and manufacturers. The authors suggested the option
of collecting efficiency information on new purchases directly
from consumers. More specifically, they hypothesized that energy-efficiency
levels and other key characteristics of current appliance sales
could be estimated reliably from brand and model number information
collected from a representative and substantial sample of purchasers.
The critical problems were to determine whether a projectable
sample of recent purchasers could be identified cost-effectively
and whether these customers would be able to provide brand names
and model numbers for their purchases. If so, regular surveys
of random samples of appliance purchasers could provide an ongoing
system for sales tracking. The researchers screened a representative
sample of 4,400 Wisconsin households to identify people who recently
had bought appliances. The researchers then asked purchasers to
provide the brands and model numbers of those appliances and later
used these data to locate efficiency information in industry directories.
The study used two data collection methods:
<UL>
<LI>Telephone surveys
<LI>Surveys, using random-digit dialing, were designed to:
<UL>
<LI>identify purchasers
<LI>request appliance brand names and model numbers
<LI>provide insight into purchase decision making (such as reasons-for-purchase
and models replaced)
<LI>collect demographic information (such as own-or-rent and size-of-household)
</UL>

<LI>On-site visits
<LI>The researchers conducted follow-up visits with a sample of
survey respondents who had purchased refrigerators, water heaters,
or furnaces. These respondents either gave no brand name and model
number or reported a brand name and model number that could not
be traced to efficiency information. The visits were designed
to:
<UL>
<LI>identify sources of difficulty in discovering and reporting
brand names and model numbers
<LI>determine whether there were differences in average efficiency
between households that did and households that didn't provide
brand name and model number information
</UL>

</UL>

<H2>Findings</H2>

<P>
The results support an overall conclusion that customer-based
surveys can be effective for tracking sales of refrigerators and
possibly hot water heaters and furnaces. This approach would not
be effective for room air conditioners or central air conditioners.
<UL>
<LI>The overall success rate-percentage of purchases for which
brand name and model number were obtained and led to efficiency
information in an industry directory-was reasonably successful
for refrigerators, water heaters, and furnaces.
<LI>Sixty-five percent of refrigerator purchasers provided usable
information.
<LI>A smaller, but substantial proportion of water heater purchasers
(40 percent) and furnace purchasers (29 percent) provided usable
information. The low rate of furnace purchases, however, along
with the safety issues related to accessing name plate information
raises, questions as to the feasibility of this method for collecting
information about furnaces.
<LI>The low purchase rates of some appliances and the difficulty
of finding model numbers for others indicate that this method
is not suitable for all appliances.
<LI>The success rate was only 7 percent for room air conditioners
and 8 percent for central air conditioners. The inaccessibility
of name plates compounded by low purchase rates contributed to
the low success rate for these appliances.
<LI>In addition, the following findings support the conclusion
that the approach can provide cost-effective and representative
data.
<LI>The telephone survey produces an acceptable response rate
(71 percent) for Wisconsin households.
<LI>The sampling method provides a representative sample of customers
for the state as a whole.
<LI>In addition, the approach offers the opportunity for oversampling
by utility service territory, location within a territory (such
as urban vs. rural), and sociodemographics.
<LI>The energy efficiency information gathered through the screening
survey does not appear biased as a result of nonresponse.
<LI>The screening survey data on appliance efficiencies appear
to be similar to the data from the on-site visits for the appliances
checked. Because of small sample sizes, however, these results
must be viewed cautiously.
</UL>

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<P>
The pilot test also indicates potential areas for savings in an
ongoing customer survey of appliance purchases. Recommendations
include:
<UL>
<LI>Integrate the approach into other similar projects, such as
appliance saturation surveys.
<LI>A combined survey would distribute the costs across a wider
range of projects and objectives.
<LI>Check the efficiency information during the interview.
<LI>During the pilot study, interviewers collected brand names
and model numbers, but they did not immediately check this information.
It may be more efficient for interviewers to check the information
in appliance directories while on the telephone. Many of these
directories are available electronically, which may permit the
creation of an on-line computer verification system. This would
let interviewers determine immediately if the brand names and
model numbers were valid; if not, interviewers could coach respondents
further regarding reading the name plate or its location .
<LI>Increase the survey period.
<LI>The pilot was conducted in a single short period-approximately
five weeks-and so required a large staff of interviewers. Each
interviewer worked with only a small number of purchasers. It
may be preferable to schedule the calling over an extended period
so fewer interviewers are needed and so each interviewer could
accumulate more experience coaching respondents. This might improve
the success rate for refrigerators, water heaters, and furnaces.
(It is unlikely to improve the rates for central and room air
conditioning because of the inaccessibility of the information
on these units.)
<LI>Increase purchasers' cooperation through incentives.
<LI>Once a purchaser is identified, it is cost-efficient to use
all reasonable means to collect information. It appears that in
most cases the information is available, but some respondents
resist finding it. Some additional incentive-perhaps two to five
dollars-may be useful in increasing the rate at which respondents
provide the data, while maintaining cost-effectiveness compared
to other methods. (Follow-up postcards could offer incentives
to only respondents who refuse to cooperate.)
<LI>Combine the screening process with an on-site visit.
<LI>For room and central air conditioners as well as other devices,
it may be possible to combine the screening process with an on-site
visit. Because the cost of identifying purchasers can be built
into the screening process for many appliances, this information
could be generated inexpensively and used to schedule visits.
Local contractors, auditors, or interviewers could collect the
information. (Again, to reduce costs, integration with other projects
should be considered.)
<LI>Find ways for respondents to access furnace information safely.
<LI>A barrier to gathering furnace information is the location
of the serial-number plate behind a panel on the furnace. Although
this panel is easy to remove, asking respondents to remove it
would result in liability and safety issues. It may worthwhile
to investigate guidelines that could be used to increase safety
and reduce liability associated with such requests. Another strategy
would be to encourage manufacturers to place name plates on the
outside of furnaces.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Commercial Cooling Load Library</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Creating a Commercial Cooling Load Library</H1>

Because commercial cooling has a strong impact on peak loads, planners need complete information about commercial cooling technologies. One way dsm professionals use such information is to perform computer simulations that help planners understand ways the commercial sector can use energy most efficiently. Account representatives can also use simulations to help customers select the most energy-efficient cooling technologies for their particular applications. A previous study, however, identified gaps in the types of cooling technology information available to perform the necessary simulations. To fill these gaps, the Center initiated a project that included three tasks:

<OL>

<LI>Establish a cooling load library for Wisconsin-specific commercial buildings based on previously collected end-use data.

<LI>Develop and enhance computer models of commercial cooling technologies.

<LI>Conduct metered field tests of emerging cooling technologies.

<li>This report describes the method and results of the first task. To make available the cooling plant thermal loads for several building types, the Center developed a library of loads from 47 Milwaukee-area commercial sites. The library makes it easier to compare cooling technologies, test models, and forecast how proposed dsm programs could affect commercial loads. Until the library was developed, one of the stages of a commercial cooling simulation required simulating the load. Using the load library removes one source of potential errors in such simulations and lets researchers easily compare the performance of cooling technologies without having to develop complex building simulations.

</OL>

To create the library, we developed and tested three cooling load estimation models. We compared each model's predictions to measured loads from six sites representing different cooling technologies and building types. We then used the models that were the best predictors to estimate loads for all the sites.

The loads were estimated from electricity end-use data collected in the Wisconsin Electric Power Company's (wepco) Milwaukee-area service territory from 1989 to 1991. These estimates are more realistic than those from simulations because they are based on actual electricity consumption data, with little influence from input assumptions and model algorithms. This report describes how the library was developed, what it contains, and how to use it.

<H2>Cooling Load Estimation Models</H2>

Empirical models are based on actual measurements, so they provide the most accurate estimates. We used measured loads from six sites to develop an empirical regression model that could estimate the loads solely from power consumption and weather. However, the empirical model can be used only at sites where cooling capacity has been measured directly. We needed to develop a more widely applicable model that could approach the accuracy of an empirical model.

The empirical model served as a reference for constructing constant-COP (Coefficient of Performance) and engineering models, which can be applied to any site. The models used wepco's power-consumption data and corresponding weather data to estimate 15-minute cooling loads for 47 commercial cooling plants in the Milwaukee area, including the six measured sites. We evaluated the models by comparing estimated loads for the measured sites to those determined by the empirical model. The three estimation models are described below.

<H3>Constant-COP Model</H3>

The constant-COP model estimated cooling capacity by simply multiplying electricity use by the cooling-plant COP. The result is equivalent to the seasonal COP found in equipment catalogs, but tailored to conditions in Wisconsin.

<H3>Engineering Model</H3>

The engineering (variable-COP) models are more sophisticated-they account for cooling equipment performance variations caused by part-loading and changing weather.

<H3>Chiller Sites</H3>

For the chiller sites, researchers reformulated a performance map based on load, leaving chilled-water temperature, and entering condenser-water temperature to solve for cooling capacity from electricity consumption. The condenser-water and chilled-water temperatures were not available in the wepco database, so the model used a simple correlation based on outdoor wet-bulb temperature to estimate condenser-water temperature variations due to cooling tower staging. The model assumed chilled-water temperature remained constant. For multiple-chiller cooling plants, the model distributed the available power to the individual chillers sequentially and determined the load for each unit separately.

<H2>Direct-Exchange Sites</H2>

For the direct-exchange (dx) sites, the study reformulated a performance map based on loading, outdoor temperature, airflow, and entering-coil conditions to solve for the cooling capacity from electricity consumption. The model assumed that air flow and entering-coil conditions remained constant. For multiple-unit sites, the model assumed that loading was distributed to individual units equally, allowing all the units to be treated as a single plant. 

<H2>Accuracy of the Load Library</H2>

The study used the pertinent engineering models to generate the library. At a 90 percent confidence level, the estimated capacities are within 20 to 30 percent of those measured for dx systems and within 10 to 20 percent of those for chiller sites. These comparisons include the uncertainty of cooling capacity measurements (10 to 20 percent). The results for all of the estimation models appear in the table below.

<H2>Library Availability</H2>

The Center has made the library available on-line so researchers can easily identify sites and study their characteristics and load shapes. Callers can search by building characteristics and can also download graphic files that contain load shapes.

The library contains cooling capacity estimates for 47 sites, including up to two years of data for each site. The library includes 15-minute cooling load files, building characteristics (such as operating hours and year built), and cooling equipment attributes (such as plant type and cooling capacity). An appendix to this report contains summary graphics for each site in the library, highlighting thermal load profiles, electricity load profiles, and cooling energy distributions.

This report was funded in part through a grant from the Oil Overcharge Fund, Wisconsin Energy Bureau, Department of Administration, Madison, Wisconsin and in part by the anr Pipeline Company, Detroit, Michigan.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Agricultural DSM</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Agricultural Demand Side Management Strategies Analysis</H1>

Wisconsin's 31,000 dairy farms consume more than a million megawatt-hours of electricity each year. If a significant portion of this electricity could be conserved, Wisconsin dairy farmers would save millions of dollars a year, helping them remain competitive in today's changing dairy marketplace. This study estimated the amount of electricity that could be saved by using energy-saving devices on dairy farms of varying size.
<P>
For this study--which the Center supported--scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Agricultural Engineering Department1 used computer simulations to determine the characteristics of dairy-sector electric loads and to estimate the total potential for reducing energy consumption through energy-efficient technologies. The study also identified which of the individual technologies that were analyzed would save the most energy if adopted.

<H2>Method</H2>
The researchers used computer models--using the TRNSYS computer program--to simulate and compare dairy farms with either all inefficient equipment (as a baseline) or all efficient equipment. They ran simulations for farms with 30, 60, 200, and 400 cows. The simulated baseline farms had the following equipment:

<UL>
<LI>direct-expansion milk coolers
<LI>electric-resistance water heaters
<LI>standard-size vacuum pumps
<LI>medium-efficiency ventilation fans for barns
<LI>incandescent lighting 
</UL>
<P>The more efficient farms used the following energy-saving options:
<UL>
<LI>heat recovery
<LI>using well water to precool milk
<LI>energy-conserving vacuum pumps
<LI>high-efficiency fans
<li>fluorescent lighting
</UL>
The models assumed that all equipment would operate at standard recommended capacities, except for incandescent lighting, which was assumed to provide 60 percent of the recommended illumination. The models used the standard recommendations of the Milking Machine Manufacturers Council and the Midwest Plan Service (a consortium of universities that provides information related to agricultural engineering). The Milking Machine Manufacturers Council was the source for information about milking systems and the Midwest Plan Service was the source for information about ventilation and lighting levels.
<P>
The models calculated daily and annual electric load curves to determine an energy-consumption range, or "window," for the two types of farms-efficient and inefficient-in each of the farm-size categories. Actual dairy farms should fall somewhere within these windows, depending on how much efficient equipment they use. Wisconsin dairy-farm energy use could then be calculated from market penetration estimates for each energy-efficient option (market penetration tells what percentage of farms in each size category have purchased a given piece of equipment). The energy-saving potential in each size category, therefore, is the difference between the actual energy use of the category and the predicted energy consumption resulting from a hypothetical 100-percent market penetration for all efficient options. This predicted consumption would be at the low end of the energy-consumption window, where all farms use all efficient equipment.

<H2>Energy-Saving Potential of Dairy-Farm Equipment Options</H2>
The researchers used the simulations to estimate how much energy each efficient option can save over its inefficient counterpart in each farm-size category:
 
<UL>
<LI>On a 30-cow farm, replacing inefficient water-heaters with efficient alternatives can save up to 4,900 kwh annually. Efficient lighting saves 3,000 kwh, and efficient ventilation and vacuum pumps each save about 1,700 kwh per year.
<LI>On a 60-cow farm, switching to efficient equipment could potentially save up to 7,800 kwh in water heating, 5,800 kwh in efficient lighting, 3,800 kwh in milk cooling, 2,500 kwh in vacuum pumping, and 2,250 kwh in ventilation annually. 
<LI>On a 200-cow farm, efficient options can save 43,400 kwh per year in lighting,  12,000 kwh in milk cooling, 7,500 kwh in water heating, and 7,200 kwh in vacuum pumping. There are minimal ventilation savings because the model assumes that this and larger farms use naturally ventilated free-stall barns. On such farms, the only potential savings from improved ventilation would be in parlors.
<li>Efficient options on a 400-cow farm can potentially save 81,000 kwh per year in lighting, 23,500 kwh in milk cooling, 17,000 kwh in vacuum pumping, and 12,000 kwh in water heating.
</UL>
<H2>Present and Future Energy-Saving Potential of Wisconsin's Dairy Sector</H2>
Researchers used the computer models to estimate the energy-saving potential of Wisconsin's dairy industry. The models estimated the actual energy consumption of Wisconsin's dairy sector and compared that to a hypothetical scenario in which all dairy farms use all the energy-efficient options that were considered in the simulations.

<H3>Current Dairy Sector Energy Savings Potential</H3>
If market-penetration levels of all of the energy-saving technologies increased to 100 percent, the researchers estimate that Wisconsin's dairy sector could trim 463,200 mwh annually from the present estimated annual electrical consumption of 1,515,800 mwh, a savings of about 30 percent. Water heating modifications offer the largest savings potential on small farms. Lighting offers the highest savings potential on farms with more than 100 cows.

<H3>Future Dairy Sector Energy Savings Potential</H3>
Based on projections the researchers made of market penetration for energy-saving options, the distribution of farms, herd size (an increase), and the total number of cows (a decrease) in Wisconsin's dairy sector, by the year 2004 the total energy consumption will drop to 1,159,000 mwh annually. If market penetration of energy-efficient options were shifted from the projected levels to 100 percent, this projected electric consumption would be 406,500 mwh lower, a reduction of about 35 percent. Farms with more than 100 cows will have the largest energy-saving potential, especially in the lighting category.

<H2>Conclusions and Recommendations</H2>
All the energy-efficient options modeled provide significant savings. Switching to fluorescent lighting generally has the largest energy-saving potential, some of which will be realized as a matter of course when new facilities are constructed. The largest farms have the highest per-farm percent savings. This is especially significant in view of projections showing that Wisconsin's average herd size will increase in the next decade while the number of farms and number of cows will decrease.

<H1>Commercial Cooling and Lighting Load Management:  A Scoping
Study</H1>

<P>
Selecting the most promising load-management option to investigate
for a particular application is a complex task, given the many
strategies and technologies available and under development. To
help utilities develop research programs and pilot studies that
are most likely to lead to a successful, effective application,
the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research supported this scoping
study to identify and evaluate a wide range of load management
strategies and technologies (LMSTs) for managing electric cooling
and lighting demand in grocery stores, health facilities, offices,
retail buildings, schools, and warehouses. This Phase I report
discusses LMSTs and building types to provide utilities and regulatory
agencies with the background they need to identify the most promising
options to investigate. It addresses the technical and economic
issues as well as the needs and concerns of all parties involved
in selecting and implementing a LMST.
<P>
A software package was also developed to help DSM planners further
evaluate the potential of any hypothetical building/LMST scenario.
This Load Management Program Development Tool (PDT), used in conjunction
with the information in the Phase I report, is designed to guide
research programs and pilot studies towards areas that have the
greatest potential for success.
<H2>Findings:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Load Management Strategies and Technologies: Researchers identified
and evaluated over 30 promising LMST categories, both commercially
available and under development. They range from simple lighting
time clocks to sophisticated whole-building lighting and HVAC
control systems.
<LI>Behavioral Barriers: The report identifies behavioral interactions
among decision makers that can influence the success of load-management
programs. Such interactions involve utility customers, building
owners and operators, and tenants. Decisions depend on economics,
availability of information, and abilities to install and operate
equipment.
<LI>Researchable Questions: For most LMSTs, several specific technical,
behavioral, and economic issues have yet to be resolved. The report
provides a list of unanswered researchable questions for specific
LMSTs.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Winter Peak 
</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H1>Consumer Behavior on Winter-Peak Days</H1>

<P>
One way to reduce winter-peak heating demand is to change consumers&#146;
energy-related behavior through a conservation campaign, which
would use public education and incentive programs to induce customers
to reduce their natural gas use on peak heating days. To design
an effective campaign, utilities must first determine which consumer
groups are most amenable to adopting demand-reduction behavior,
as well as which educational and incentive strategies are most
likely to succeed. To investigate these questions, researchers
assembled four focus groups of residential natural-gas customers.
The 41 participants were grouped according to their energy-consumption
habits into four lifestyle categories: <I>value seekers</I>, <I>resource
conservers</I>, <I>lifestyle simplifiers</I>, and <I>pleasure
seekers</I>. The goals of the sessions were to probe the cold-weather
behaviors of each lifestyle group, the motivations for these behaviors,
and explore possible incentives for behavioral change. This report
presents the outcomes of the four focus-group meetings.
<H2>Barriers to Change</H2>

<P>
Most focus-group participants strongly resist making greater efforts
to conserve energy on extremely cold days. The discussions reveal
a variety of behavioral barriers to adopting conservation measures:
<UL>
<LI>It is more difficult to induce energy-efficient behavior than
to induce energy-efficient equipment purchases. Several participants
question the rights of others to dictate behavior within the home.

<LI>Most participants have already made what they consider to
be major efforts to conserve energy. They do not find compelling
reasons to pursue further energy conservation.
<LI>Participants are largely unaware of the peak-demand problem.
They don&#146;t understand why utilities are worried about a few
days during the year rather than the total heating-season consumption.

<LI>Participants generally behave the same on typical and extremely
cold winter days. They prepare their homes for winter; they don&#146;t
make special preparations for particular days. 
<LI>Participants' definitions of extremely cold days generally
bear little relation to utilities&#146; definitions of peak-demand
days. 
<LI>Participants are skeptical about the cooperativeness of their
fellow consumers, and this reduces their own willingness to conserve.
Many say that in the absence of monetary incentives, they would
take steps to conserve only if there were some assurance that
their fellow consumers would follow suit. 
</UL>

<H2>Differences Among Lifestyle Groups</H2>

<P>
A market-segmentation software package categorized participants
into four standard groups:
<DL>
<DT>Value Seekers <DFN>invest time in consumer decisions
and take measures to save energy and money.</DFN>
<DT>Resource Conservers <DFN>are budget conscious and concerned
about the environment. </DFN>
<DT>Lifestyle Simplifiers<DFN> are relatively unconcerned
about comfort, personal control of energy use, convenience, and
appearance of the home.</DFN>
<DT>Pleasure Seekers<DFN> pursue all the benefits of energy
usage, such as comfort, convenience, security, and enhanced appearance.</DFN>

</DL>

<P>
The focus-group discussions revealed that the lifestyle groups
have markedly different heating-season habits:
<UL>
<LI><I>Resource conservers</I> are the most unique group. Most
are knowledgeable about energy conservation and have taken steps
to ensure they are not wasting energy or money. On cold days,
they are creative about finding ways to stay warm without turning
up the heat. <I>Value seekers</I>, <I>lifestyle simplifiers</I>,
and <I>pleasure seekers</I>, however, are all similar in that
comfort is their overriding consideration. These groups differ,
however, in their willingness to modify cold-day habits. 
<LI>Although <I>value seekers</I> want to stay comfortable, they
also want to conserve resources and save money. They will put
on heavier clothing or cover up with a blanket before turning
up the thermostat.
<LI><I>Lifestyle simplifiers</I> are highly resistant to adopting
alternative means of keeping warm. They don&#146;t see the point
of altering their behavior for one or two days of the year, and
they say that they have already taken sufficient measures to conserve
energy.
<LI><I>Pleasure seekers</I> are also highly resistant to taking
energy-conserving measures. They keep their thermostats set higher
than the other three groups, and they prefer to have control over
the thermostat setting. They consider alternative means of keeping
warm bothersome.
</UL>

<H2>Target Behaviors</H2>

<P>
Behavior on extremely cold days may indicate which behaviors to
target for demand reduction:
<UL>
<LI>Many participants stay home on extremely cold days and are
inclined to stay indoors. Less than a quarter of the participants
are physically active on cold days. Half associate cold days with
sedentary activities.
<LI>More than a third of the participants turn up the thermostat
on extremely cold days. 
<LI>In order of decreasing popularity, alternatives to turning
up the thermostat include: wearing warmer clothes, using the oven,
eating hot food, closing drapes, and covering up with a blanket.
Nearly all participants put on warmer clothes on extremely cold
days and fewer than half cover up with a blanket. 
</UL>

<H2>Suggestions for a Conservation Campaign</H2>

<P>
The focus-group results suggest that devising an effective campaign
to reduce peak-day demand for natural gas is possible, although
many barriers remain. Researchers discuss the following considerations
that may help in planning a campaign:
<UL>
<LI>Strong consumer resistance to modifying cold-day behaviors
appears to stem in part from a lack of understanding of the problems
that peaks in demand create for utilities. An effective campaign
may include a timely way to notify customers when a peak-demand
situation exists.
<LI>Utilities might seek to increase the percentage of people
who try other means of keeping warm before turning up the thermostat.
The focus-group findings may help select the alternatives that
people would most likely adopt.
<LI>The differences among lifestyle groups could provide some
guidance in planning a campaign. One strategy would be to reinforce
the <I>resource conservers</I>' existing habits. The greatest
potential reductions in demand occur among the <I>value seekers</I>,
which are interested in saving energy or money, provided they
can maintain comfort. Demand reductions among <I>lifestyle simplifiers</I>
and <I>pleasure seekers</I> would probably be difficult to achieve.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Modeling Customer Behavior Re DLC</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Modeling Customer Behavior as it Relates to Residential Direct Load Control Programs</H1>
<P>
Many utilities use direct load control programs to reduce peak demand for electricity. To make these programs as effective and efficient as possible, however, program managers must understand how customers learn about specific programs and how they decide whether to participate in them. This project examined the behavior and characteristics of customers as related to dlc programs for air conditioning.
<P>
The research investigated a simple decision-making process in which customers become aware of a dlc program, decide whether or not to participate, and, if so, choose between the program's options. We broke the process down and modeled each decision separately. This let us analyze factors associated with each of the steps: awareness, participation, and program choice. Because the primary reason for studying this decision-making process was to provide information that will help program managers fine-tune dlc programs, we also modeled two related factors that affect such programs: free-ridership and load impacts.

<H2>Method and Objective</H2>
Data were collected through surveys of customers from four Wisconsin utilities' service territories. The surveys included both customers who did and didn't participate in dlc programs. We also reviewed each utility's program-marketing material to gather additional information for modeling how customers select program options. The load-impact and free-ridership models incorporated customer-specific load relief in addition to the survey data. We then used this information to develop the variables for the five models.
<P>
All of the variables are listed in the report's appendix. Examples include:

<UL>
<LI>Whether the customer had a health condition that required AC
<LI>Whether customer had participated in earlier DLC programs
<LI>Physical characteristics of the residence
<li>Age of the AC unit
</UL>
The project used statistical models to address the following questions:
<UL>
<LI>Which factors-for example age and marital status-influence whether customers become aware of a DLC program?
<LI>What determines whether customers participate in a DLC program?
<LI>How is load impact related to customer characteristics, demographics, and program design?
<li>What are the characteristics of free riders?
</UL>

<H2>Findings</H2>
The report includes conclusions and recommendations that were developed for the awareness, participation, load-impact, and free-ridership models. The program-choice model did not identify factors that could be used in program design or implementation. The report also presents a marketing mix based on the project findings for target markets, marketing message, promotion channels, and incentives.
<UL>
<LI>Awareness Model
Current marketing methods appear to be reaching an appropriate mix of candidates for dlc programs.
Minor adjustments could improve the effectiveness of telemarketing programs.
<LI>Participation Model
Data on customers' subscriptions to publications or their membership in, or affiliation with, special interest organizations-for example environmental groups-could help program planners target promotional messages to appropriate audiences.
Marketing messages should address the issues that were identified as significant predictors of nonparticipation. These include customers' misgivings about possible discomfort, inconvenience, and the methods by which incentives are paid.
<LI>Load Impact Model
Because load impacts increased as the cumulative temperature/humidity index, connected load, and square footage increased, planners might consider targeting customers with larger homes and larger associated loads.
We found no systematic relationship between behavioral-and-attitudinal variables and load impacts.
<li>The free-ridership model had a low rate of success-19 percent-predicting free-ridership. The model did, however, provide insight into related factors. For example, higher income customers who are interested in energy conservation are less likely to be free riders. Customers who are either unmarried, own dehumidifiers, or sign up for the longest cycle times tend to be free riders.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Gas-Fired Cooling Tech. w TES</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Evaluation of Gas-Fired Cooling Technologies Incorporating Thermal Energy Storage</H1>

This project investigated the potential energy savings of and markets for integrating gas cooling and thermal energy storage--or TES-systems, which store energy as chilled water or ice, into a single cooling system. Gas-engine-driven chillers and TES are two DSM technologies that have been brought together as a potential new dsm technology. When working alone, gas cooling systems-which use natural-gas engines in place of electric motors to drive cooling equipment-can significantly reduce the amount of electricity that cooling systems use. Thermal energy storage both shifts cooling energy use to off-peak periods and-by supplementing the chiller during peak-use times-allows smaller chillers to be specified for a given installation.
<P>
We reviewed previous studies of commercial cooling systems that integrate gas chillers with thermal storage and we contacted four equipment manufacturers to assess the market for this technology. We also used a computer simulation to determine under what conditions the gas chiller/TES combination is economically viable. In our best-case scenario, gas with TES had less favorable economics than did electric with TES. There was no situation in which gas with TES had a payback period that was shorter than both electric with TES and gas chillers without TES. In our best-case scenario, optimally controlled gas with TES was competitive in Wisconsin. This study suggests, however, that gas chillers combined with TES face intense competition from gas chillers without TES and, more strongly, from electric chillers with TES. The literature search, manufacturer survey, and computer analysis revealed that:

<UL>
<LI>Little cooling-technology research has been devoted to gas chillers with thermal storage. We found no case studies and only two detailed computer-based studies. These studies indicate that in terms of customer payback periods, gas chillers with thermal storage have less favorable economics than do competing options such as gas chillers alone or electric chillers with thermal storage.
<LI>Manufacturers indicate that fewer than 10 percent of gas-engine cooling systems sold have a thermal storage component.
<li>Our analysis suggests that although the gas chiller with thermal storage can have, under certain conditions, a shorter payback period than a gas chiller alone, the electric chiller with thermal storage always has a shorter payback than either gas-fired option. In our best-case scenario, in which energy prices and equipment costs are biased in favor of gas-based systems, gas chillers with thermal storage become more competitive, with payback periods of 2.4 to 4.5 years. The electric chiller with thermal storage, however, still remains a slightly more cost-efficient option in the short term.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Meta-Analysis of AC DLC</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Meta-Analysis of Air Conditioner Direct Load Control Programs</H1>
<P>
To find out if widely applicable, typical savings can be determined for different types of air conditioner control programs, we performed a meta-analysis on the results of direct-load control programs for 14 utilities. We examined the estimated savings for various DLC cycle strategies that cycle residential air conditioners on and off to reduce energy demand.
Utilities typically evaluate their DLC programs by estimating how much they have reduced demand for each air conditioner they control. Such estimates can help utilities and regulators design effective DLC programs. These individual estimates, however, are based on small samples and specific conditions, making it hard to judge the relative effectiveness of different strategies. We hoped a meta-analysis of several programs would provide a more broad-based assessment.
<P>
Meta-analysis, a rigorous statistical analysis of the results of several independent studies, combines small, related samples into a larger sample. But meta-analysis doesn't simply average the results together. Instead, the analysis weighs the strength of each result based on how each result was derived, accounts for inconsistencies, and searches for factors that may influence results.
<P>
Our meta-analyses evaluated the results of DLC programs that used 25-, 33-, 50-, 67-, and 100-percent cycling strategies. The cycling percentage refers to the duration that the utility turns air conditioners off during control periods. For example, a 33-percent strategy turns off air conditioners for 20 minutes each hour, 10 minutes each half hour, or five minutes each 15-minute period. This study was designed to calculate a typical, or "combined," kW demand reduction for each air conditioner in each cycling strategy.
 
<H2>Data Availability</H2>
Data essential to a meta-analysis was often unavailable, significantly weakening the study. Much of the demand-reduction data provided by utilities lacked information on standard errors, estimation methods, and sample characteristics. As a result, we had to estimate most of the standard errors, and we could not rigorously analyze the effects of certain variables on program results.

<H2>Findings</H2>
We analyzed the five cycling strategies, using three to seven demand-reduction estimates for each analysis. The results were inconclusive.

<UL>
<LI>The combined demand reductions attributable to the 25-, 33-, 50-, and 67-percent cycling strategies did not differ very much. The combined estimates for all cycling strategies were statistically different from only the combined estimate for the 100-percent strategy.
<LI>As would be expected, 100-percent cycling produced the greatest estimate of demand reduction, while 25-percent cycling produced the smallest estimate. Savings estimates for the other strategies, however, did not follow this pattern-the more severe cycling strategies did not always result in greater demand reductions.
<LI>The reductions ranged from 0.33 to 1.2 kW per residential air conditioner within a 95-percent confidence interval. The 100-percent cycling strategy had a combined demand reduction of 1.9 &plusmn;0.5 kW per air conditioner at a 95-percent confidence interval.
<li>We also tested how estimation method, type of raw data, outdoor temperature, and annual cooling degree days influenced demand reductions. Although we found that these factors had no significant influence on the results, the limited data available makes this finding inconclusive. Additional factors, such as possible sample bias and air conditioner size, could not be tested.
</UL>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>
Ideally, meta-analysis can produce more rigorous results at reduced evaluation costs. A lack of complete and reliable data, however, severely hindered this study. Although there appear to be demand reductions associated with DLC programs, the reduction attributable to a given cycling strategy under given conditions remains unclear.
<P>
The information we attempted to provide would help utilities design more effective DSM strategies. We therefore recommend that utilities adopt reporting standards that would allow rigorous meta-analyses and other assessments to be performed. All evaluations of DSM program impacts should include at least the following information in detail:
<UL>
<LI>Quantitative estimates of program impacts
<LI>Standard errors around estimates
<LI>Methods used to derive estimates
<LI>Sample size, sample characteristics, and data on how the sample was selected
<LI>Characteristics and size of the population from which the sample was selected
<li>Characteristics and size of the population within the utility's service territory

<H1>An Evaluation of Residential Direct-Load Programs in Wisconsin
</H1>

<P>
We evaluated the impact of residential direct load control of
(DLC) programs of five Wisconsin utilities. Quantum Consulting,
Inc. conducted the evaluation.
<P>
We had two primary goals:
<UL>
<LI>To measure residential central air conditioner load impacts
during the control period for selected load cycling and shedding
options
<LI>To estimate paybacks for periods following control
</UL>

<P>
We also had four secondary goals:
<UL>
<LI>To assess customer comfort under various control strategies
<LI>To detect free riders
<LI>To investigate the use of secondary appliances to offset air
conditioner control
<LI>To detect control equipment failure
</UL>

<P>
The evaluation of the residential DLC program relied on three
types of data collected by the utilities:
<UL>
<LI>Load and weather data, monitored every five or 15 minutes
<LI>Customer data, including audit, customer usage strata, and
customer linkage data, and DLC program enrolled in
<LI>Operations schedule and status data
</UL>

<H2>Optimal Impacts</H2>

<P>
Optimal impacts are the impacts that would occur if control equipmentworked
perfectly. Our analysis shows that the greatest optimal impacts
occur, as expected, in the late afternoon and early evening of
the most extreme day when air conditioner use peaks.
<P>
To estimate optimal impacts, we used the duty cycle approach,
which estimates load reductions during control using air conditioner
load data from non-control days. This approach takes into account
the varying intensities with which customers use their air conditioners.
<P>
The relationship between optimal impacts and control strategy
is not linear. For example, the impact of a 50-percent control
strategy is less than half the impact of a 100-percent shedding
strategy.
<H2>Paybacks</H2>

<P>
Our estimates of paybacks show that the significant payback period
typically lasts until the early hours of the day following the
control day.
<P>
The payback model we used estimates paybacks as the difference
between average air conditioner load profile on control days and
the estimated average non-control load profile on control days.
The latter profile is an estimate of the average load profile
that would have been realized on the control days had control
not taken place.
<P>
The payback period associated with a prolonged shedding strategy
is longer than the periods associated with a shorter and intermittent
shedding strategy or a cycling strategy.
<H2>Customer Comfort</H2>

<P>
To assess customer comfort during control, we developed a customer
discomfort index for each customer for the most extreme control
day and a non-control day with a comparable maximum CTHI. The
index is a relative, not absolute, measure of discomfort, with
higher values corresponding to greater levels of discomfort. As
expected, customers are more uncomfortable during control. However,
this analysis does not establish how much more uncomfortable customers
are.
<H2>Free Riders</H2>

<P>
Free riders are DLC program customers who provide little load
reduction during control. A customer with an average duty cycle
of less than 20 percent from 13:00 to 18:00 on the extreme non-control
days was identified as a free rider. The portion of customers
who were free riders ranged from 6.9 percent (Utility E) to 32.1
percent (Utility B).
<H2>Secondary Cooling Appliances</H2>

<P>
To detect the use of a secondary cooling appliance during control,
we subtracted the average residual profile of the most extreme
non-control day from the residual profile of the most extreme
control day. A large difference profile would constitute evidence
of secondary cooling appliance use. However, the differences were
small for all utilities, suggesting few customers used other cooling
equipment during control.
<H2>Control Equipment Failure</H2>

<P>
We based the analysis of control equipment failure on data from
end-use metered sites. We identified two types of control equipment
failure: misclassification, instances when the type of control
that occurred differed from that planned, and malfunctions, instances
when no control occurred.<HR>

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Irrigation Load Management</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Irrigation Load Management in Wisconsin</H1>

Although agriculture uses only about three percent of Wisconsin's electric load, electric irrigation pumps contribute to summer peak demand. To trim these peaks, Wisconsin utilities offer load-shifting and load-reducing incentive programs to farmers. These programs, however, enjoy only limited popularity because they can interfere with farmers' decisions on when and how much to irrigate, thereby increasing the farmers' perceived risk of crop damage. Growers of high-value, water-sensitive crops such as potato are most likely to resist allowing utilities to influence irrigation practices.
<P>
With support from the Center, UW-Madison agricultural engineers investigated ways to make irrigation load-management programs more acceptable to farmers and more effective for utilities. They modeled various combinations of irrigation equipment and management practices. The models showed how to provide enough irrigation to insure crop health under the constraints of load management programs.

<H2>Findings</H2>

Most Wisconsin irrigators use center-pivot irrigation systems. This study shows that combinations of equipment upgrades on cp systems and new irrigation scheduling practices would allow most farmers, including those growing potato, to safely participate in load-shifting programs.
 <P>
The researchers found:
<UL>
<LI>The total amount of energy used is the same regardless of system capacity; high-capacity systems have a higher energy demand but operate fewer hours than lower-capacity systems.
<LI>Low-pressure systems consume less energy overall than high-pressure systems.
<LI>A center-pivot irrigation system with a capacity of 1350 gpm would allow a Wisconsin potato farmer to irrigate effectively under constraints imposed by time-of-day load-control programs. This is because high-capacity systems require less time to irrigate than standard systems, which range from 750 to 1000 gpm capacities. High-capacity systems allow for more flexible irrigation scheduling and a greater ability to adjust to changing irrigation requirements.
<LI>With appropriate irrigation scheduling, a 1000-gpm system would usually be effective under a direct-load control program. During extreme droughts, however, the system would not be able to supply enough water off-peak to keep potatoes healthy.
<LI>A 750-gpm system generally cannot irrigate potatoes successfully under direct-load control. However, this capacity is sufficient for less demanding crops, such as sweet corn, snap beans, field corn, and alfalfa.
</UL>

<H2>Recommendations for Utilities</H2>
<LI>Based on model results, literature reviews, and focus-group discussions, the researchers have the following suggestions for improving irrigation load management:
<UL><LI>Rebates on upgrades and new equipment
Subsidize conversions to low-pressure systems with 1350-gpm capacities. Subsidize pumping plant testing and efficiency upgrading. Provide incentives to encourage high-capacity wells for all new installations.
<LI>DSM programs
<Design direct-load control programs so that the utility can notify customers in advance of a control period. For dlc and time-of-use (tou) programs, shorten the length of the utility-defined peak period (from 12 hours to six or eight hours) to give more customers the ability to participate in the programs.
<LI>Utility-customer communication
Promote and explain the merits of low-pressure, high-capacity systems, and work with irrigators to develop mutually acceptable load-management programs.
<LI>Irrigation scheduling
Work with irrigators to develop and encourage irrigation scheduling practices that minimize overirrigation and make the best use of rainfall and off-peak irrigation. Scheduling protocols should be designed to ensure crop health, even during droughts.
<LI>Transition period
While new load-management programs are being developed, avoid imposing restrictions on irrigating potato, the most sensitive and valuable major crop. Use tou rates rather than dlc during transition periods.

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Reducing Peak Demand with EMCS</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1>Potential for Reducing Peak Demand with Energy Management Control Systems</H1>

Energy-management control systems are computerized devices that control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment. Sophisticated emcss can provide precise, energy-efficient climate control. But they can also be programmed to reduce electric demand during peak periods. Although some emcss in Wisconsin are used to reduce peak electric use, a large untapped potential may exist. In this study, we estimated the size of this potential and examined ways for utilities to use EMCSs in demand-side management programs.
 
<H2>Method</H2>
We surveyed utility customers in offices, retail stores, hospitals, and other commercial buildings to investigate existing emcss, identify factors that affect whether customers participate in load control programs, and analyze various methods for reducing on-peak electric load. We also estimated the statewide potential for reducing commercial peak load with EMCSs.
 
<H2>Load Reduction Potential</H2>
Our on-site technical assessments revealed that few emcss were being used to reduce peak demand and that many were obsolete or under-used. To estimate how much demand could be reduced with emcss in Wisconsin's commercial sector, we extrapolated our data to represent a statewide building sample, although this extrapolation was not rigorous due to small sample sizes.
 <P>
We estimate that emcss in large buildings are reducing Wisconsin's peak electric demand from commercial buildings by an average of four percent. A significant amount of the remaining on-peak commercial electric demand could be economically reduced with generators and a variety of EMCS and related conservation measures:
 
<UL>
<LI>Generators already installed on site: 5 percent
<LI>EMCS control strategies that don't affect customer comfort-preheating water and slowing oversized fans: 5 percent
<LI>EMCS control strategies that reduce customer comfort-duty cycling and shutting off reheats: 11 percent
<li>Conservation measures that optimize EMCSs performance-efficient lighting, window film, and tuning, repair, and upgrading of hvac equipment and controls: 6 percent
</UL> 
An additional 10-percent reduction in peak demand is technically feasible--primarily through conservation measures--but these measures are too costly to justify the demand savings.

<H2>Customer Behavior</H2>
We conducted interviews and focus group meetings with building managers, owners, and operators to assess customer attitudes towards utility programs and EMCSs:
 
<UL>
<LI>Familiarity with EMCSs
Many participants thought thermostats or other simple controls were emcss. As a result, about a third of the customers we visited who reported having an emcs actually didn't have one. Relatively few customers, however, mistakenly reported not having an EMCS.
<LI>Opinions about EMCSs
Customers were suspicious of complexity associated with emcss and reluctant to invest in costly new equipment. Although operations managers recognized that emcss can help maintain comfort, some building owners said emcss would reduce comfort. 
<LI>Willingness to adopt options that sacrifice comfort
With the exception of reducing lighting during peak periods, customers were generally unwilling to trade comfort for financial incentives. 
<LI>Interest in reducing loads
<Most people we contacted were unwilling to participate in some or all phases of this study. This suggests that commercial customers will be reluctant to participate in load-control and conservation programs.
</UL>
<H2>Recommendations for Utilities</H2>
Our results suggest that sites with the greatest potential for load reduction through EMCSs and related measures are office buildings and hospitals that have demands of at least 250 kw and use direct digital HVAC control. We recommend that utilities target these sites, especially those that are planning equipment upgrades. Other strategies that might improve program success are to educate customers on the benefits of emcss, help finance for new equipment, and offer options such as real-time pricing incentives that allow customers to retain control over their equipment.

<H1>Vacuum Pumps for Milking Systems</H1>

<P>
Milking systems used on dairy farms depend on vacuum pumps both
for the milking process itself and for system cleaning. Standard
guidelines for system design call for pump capacities far beyond
what is actually used during normal operation, and it is not uncommon
for installed systems to have capacities that significantly exceed
these guidelines. Reducing vacuum pump capacities to the levels
actually used could save up 500,000 kilowatt-hours per year at
Wisconsin dairies alone. Both US and international standards organizations
are now reviewing their recommendations for the capacities of
vacuum pumps that milking systems use. The center supported work
by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers to examine the
effects of reduced pump capacity. This summary describes work
reported in two papers presented at the 1995 meeting of the National
Mastitis Council, Inc., Effective Reserve and Vacuum Pump Capacity
for Milking and Sizing Vacuum Pumps for Cleaning Milking Systems.
The researchers are continuing their investigations in this area.
<H2>Effective Reserve and Vacuum Pump Capacity for Milking</H2>

<P>
Pump capacity standards are based on the assumption that no milking
system will be operated perfectly. All systems must have enough
reserve capacity to cover the possibility that one milking unit
may fall off a cow during milking (two fallen units are assumed
in larger barns), and that some operators will apply milking cups
carelessly, so that air is admitted to the system. This study
sought to determine the amount of Effective Reserve, or additional
pump capacity, required to maintain acceptable vacuum stability
under such realistic circumstances. It was based on 15 farms in
California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In the first
phase of the study, researchers used air flow meters to vary the
Effective Reserve of vacuum pumps and observed the vacuum stability
that resulted. The paper describes the derivation of formulas
for determining the minimum ER needed to achieve the desired vacuum
stability. In the second phase, the researchers modified milking
systems at the 15 farms to test new pump capacity levels based
on results from phase one. The modifications involved decreasing
ER in every case. Reductions varied from 17 to 190 cubic feet
per minute. On some farms, the modifications also changed the
positions of the systems' vacuum regulators. Although the sample
size-the number of farms-was too small and the study period was
too short to lead to reliable conclusions about the benefits of
the lowered ERs, the farms tested did show a slight but consistent
improvement in performance. The number of cows milked per hour
rose about 4 percent. Mean milk yield per cow per day rose 1 percent.
Somatic cell count decreased 4 percent. The general opinion of
milkers and barn management was that the system changes resulted
in quicker and cleaner milking. The paper makes policy recommendations
and discusses formulas that could be used to determine needed
pump capacity, based on the minimum required ER and other concerns.
The paper also notes that many milking installations could be
improved by moving the vacuum regulator.
<H2>Sizing Vacuum Pumps for Cleaning Milking Systems</H2>

<P>
One of the main reasons for excess capacity in existing milking-system
vacuum pumps is the belief that cleaning these systems requires
more capacity than milking requires. The researchers analyzed
the actual pumping requirements for different aspects of commonly
used cycled-air cleaning systems. The paper details optimal control
strategies that reduce pumping requirements for the cleaning process.
It also presents an equation for determining the minimum capacity
for most milking systems, if they adopt these strategies. The
researchers conclude that with proper system design and control
strategies the vacuum pump capacity required for cleaning is less
than that needed for milking. <HR>

<BODY>

<H1>Development of Models to Predict and Analyze Gas Consumption
</H1>

<P>
Each day, local utilities predict how much natural gas their customers
will use the following day, and notify their suppliers of the
expected consumption. When errors in their prediction exceed certain
limits, the suppliers charge them extra. Current prediction methods
are reasonably accurate, but still lead to small deviations that
cost gas companies money. 
<P>
In this project, Marquette University researchers developed computer
models known as artificial neural networks, which may help local
gas companies improve the accuracy of their daily gas consumption
predictions. This summary describes work reported in the project&#146;s
<CITE>Year One Final Report</CITE> and the <CITE>Year Two, Fall
1994 Final Report</CITE>. The project is continuing.
<H2>Artificial Neural Networks</H2>

<P>
Artificial neural networks are computer programs patterned on
the functioning of a biological model: the interacting groups
of information-processing neurons in the brain that are responsible
for such tasks as recognizing images. 
<P>
Like the brain, artificial neural networks work without being
explicitly programmed. They are able to learn the best way to
solve a problem by trying it over and over, each time comparing
their solution to the correct one and adjusting their method.
Through training with historical data&#151;data known from past
experience&#151;these computer programs can learn to analyze data
and produce the best solution. They can often produce better results
than explicit computer programs. 
<P>
In this project, neural networks were trained to make gas consumption
forecasts based on such input data as average daily temperature,
wind speed, day of the week, and the amount of gas ordered on
previous days as input factors.
<H2>Year One Final Report</H2>

<P>
During the project&#146;s first year, the researchers developed
numerous neural networks and sought to identify the most significant
input factors and those that most accurately predicted consumption.
The first year final report details the development of four different
models that based their predictions on different sets of information.
The number of inputs ranged from 11 to 33. The report explains
the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
<P>
After training the models, the researchers tested each one by
using it to predict daily gas consumption from June 1993 to March
1994. For most of the test period, each model was significantly
more accurate than current methods. But severe cold weather in
January 1994 revealed the inaccuracy of the networks. Further
analysis indicated that the historical data used to train the
networks did not include weather conditions as severe as those
experienced during testing.
<P>
The year one final report also discussed the following topics:
<UL>
<LI>Transferability of networks trained on data from one customer
base to another customer base.
<LI>Classification of individual residential customers by their
home characteristics using the Competitive Learning Neural Network
model.
<LI>Influence of various weather factors on daily gas consumption
by individual residential customers.
<LI>Influence of weather factors on daily gas consumption by categories
of residential customers with various home features.
</UL>

<H2>Year Two, Fall 1994 Final Report</H2>

<P>
During the fall of the project&#146;s second year, the researchers
continued to refine the techniques developed during the first
year. They trained three artificial neural networks (using 17
to 33 inputs) for six additional service territories and used
them to predict gas consumption from September 1994 through December
1994. Two models made more accurate predictions than the utility&#146;s
human gas controllers. The third model consistently under-predicted
gas consumption, indicating further work is needed.
<P>
This report also discusses the researchers&#146; investigation
of new input factors, their reduction of the models&#146; sensitivity
to weather forecasts, their development of dynamic models, and
their improvement of neural network technologies.<HR>

<TITLE>ECW Executive Summary: Market Shapers </TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">

<BODY>

<H1>Market Shapers' Influence on Customer Energy Decisions </H1>

<P>
Companies that influence how customers use energy can have a significant
impact on utility loads. These companies, which we call <I>market
shapers</I>, include contractors, equipment designers, retailers,
engineers, manufacturers, architects, and others who can help
shape customer decisions. For example, if a customer chooses energy-efficient
equipment because of a retailer's recommendation, that retailer
has helped reduce utility loads. We performed this study of market
shapers to help utilities find ways to influence customer energy
use through market shapers. Utilities could target their incentive
and educational programs towards those market shapers who have
the best potential to influence customers in ways that can further
utilities' goals. We focused on market shapers involved in HVAC,
lighting, and building-design decisions in commercial and residential
projects.
<H2>Method</H2>

<P>
We conducted interviews and held focus groups with a variety of
market shapers around the United States to develop a qualitative
picture of their business practices, influence on customer decisions,
and perceptions of utilities and utility programs. Based on this
data, we a developed a survey that we mailed to a sample of the
nation's market shapers. The survey results revealed their strategic
and operational focuses, equipment recommendation patterns, and
utility relationships. It also allowed us to group market shapers
into behavioral segments. We then developed profiles of each business
type and behavioral segment.
<H2>Findings</H2>

<P>
Our business-type profiles indicate that designers and builders
have the most direct and powerful influence on customer energy-related
decisions. Customers frequently rely on their recommendations
and advice when choosing equipment and building designs. Manufacturers
also influence the market, but less directly. They influence the
choices that customers make by determining what equipment is available
in the market and so they may have significant long-term impacts.
<P>
The behavioral segmentation showed that those classified as &quot;influential&quot;
or &quot;complacent&quot; represent the greatest potential for
promoting utilities' goals. Influential market shapers are those
who act as consultants for their customers, and complacent firms
are content with their market position.
<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<P>
To influence new construction projects and commercial renovations,
utilities should offer programs that would appeal to designers
and builders. For utilities that are interested in a specific
market, builders are an especially useful target because they
tend to specialize more than other market shapers.
<P>
To attract builders and designers who are in the influential behavioral
segment, utility programs should offer customized programs that
focus on long-term benefits of energy-efficient equipment and
new technologies. To attract complacent market shapers, programs
should emphasize how energy efficiency can minimize post-installation
work. The programs should also be simple, hassle-free, and aggressively
marketed.
<P>
If utilities want to influence manufacturers, most of whom are
complacent, they should aggressively market simple programs that
don't violate manufacturers' autonomy in product design. One method
might be to fund development of new, energy-efficient designs.

<P>
This report is the result of research conducted with electric
utility customers in Wisconsin. The overall objective of the research
is to explore what customers think are important qualities of
energy service and to develop insight into their views on &quot;fundamental
issues pertaining to electric industry structure.&quot;[<A HREF="foot.html#foot1">Footnote 1</A>]
The research, requested by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
(PSCW), was facilitated and sponsored by the Energy Center of
Wisconsin (the Center) and an ad hoc Restructuring Research Steering
Committee (the RRSC).[<A HREF="foot.html#foot2">Footnote 2</A>]
<P>
Opinion Dynamics Corporation (ODC) conducted focus groups or in-depth
interviews with residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
The purposes of these were to:
<OL>
<LI>Discuss customer experience with and attitude toward their
electric utility
<LI>Understand which of the attributes of electric service are
most important to them
<LI>Discuss awareness of and attitudes toward electric utility
restructuring
<LI>Obtain customers' perceptions of the potential effects of
deregulation on different groups of electric utility customers
</OL>

<P>
ODC conducted 10 focus groups with a total of 95 residential customers
in geographically diverse areas, three focus groups with a total
of 26 small and medium commercial and industrial customers, and
14 in-depth, personal interviews with large commercial and industrial
customers. The focus group and in-depth interview samples were
designed to capture a diversity of customers in geography, demography
and business characteristics (see Table E.1). The focus groups
and in-depth interviews were held between August 22 and September
14, 1995.

research methods useful for identifying and exploring the range

They do not confirm hypotheses or predict the percentage of people
who or organizations that hold a certain opinion or attitude.
<P>
This report is a synthesis of comments from many people. Collectively,
the respondents to this research raised many points and issues.
Individually, respondents were more limited in their knowledge
and in the number of opinions expressed. The information presented
in this executive summary and the complete report should be evaluated
within this context and in light of the qualitative nature of
the research.
<H2><A NAME="Experience_and_Attitudes">Experience with and Attitudes
toward Electric Utility Providers</A></H2>

<P>
Most study participants from all customer classes report being
very satisfied with their electric service. Almost all said they
receive highly reliable, high quality electricity at reasonable
rates. A few of the very largest commercial and industrial participants
are unhappy with the rates they pay, in comparison to their perception
of the cost of serving them.
<P>
Residential, small commercial and industrial, and large commercial
and industrial participants vary in the type and frequency of
interactions with their electric utility.
<P>
Residential focus group participants rarely interact with their
electric utility. Most interaction is limited to the payment of
a monthly bill or an occasional call to report a power outage.
Many said they do not think about their electric service-it is
always there. Low-income participants deal with the utility more
than the average residential participant to arrange for bill payments.
Residential customers also talk with their utility to establish
service, participate in energy-efficiency programs and to call
Diggers Hotline.
<P>
Small commercial and industrial participants interact more frequently
with the electric utility. Like residential customers, they do
not spend a lot of time thinking about electricity because &quot;electricity
is one of those types of things you kind of take for granted.&quot;
Many of these participants notice electricity, and the electric
company, only when they have a problem. Small commercial and industrial
participants described interactions related to power quality and
reliability, customer/public relations and information, construction
and new hookups, landscaping, safety, conservation, and bills.
<P>
Large commercial and large industrial participants have the most
frequent interaction with their electric utility. Some participants
work closely and cooperatively with their electric utility to
address the energy needs of their organization. Some participants
work with their utility very intensively on a project-by-project
basis. Others rely on their utility for expertise and assistance
but interact with them less frequently. A few have very infrequent
interactions. Interactions with utilities also include periodic
discussions of rate options, billing questions, and power supply
or usage problems.
<H2><A NAME="Important_Aspects">Important Aspects of Electric
Service</A></H2>

<P>
Research participants discussed and rated aspects of electric
service that they may find important. Study participants from
all customer classes are consistent in rating price, reliability,
power quality, and response to outages as the top four most important
aspects of electric service. The important aspects of electric
service are outline below, roughly in order of importance to participants.
<P>
The first five items are very important to all classes of customers.

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Price.</STRONG> Most residential and small/medium commercial and industrial
customers rate price as the most important aspect of electric
service. Large commercial and industrial customers rate price
as very important, but some rate reliability as a more important
attribute.

<LI><STRONG>Reliability.</STRONG> Across all customer segments
reliability is very important. Participants report that they are
accustomed to electricity being there when they need it, and that
this is important.
<LI><STRONG>Power quality.</STRONG> All customer segments rate
power quality as important. However, many residential participants
were not familiar with the term or the issues prior to attending
the groups. Once familiarized with the potential effects of power
quality, they rated it as highly important.
<LI><STRONG>Response to outages.</STRONG> All customer segments
find this important. Some include this under the umbrella of reliability.
<LI><STRONG>Customer service.</STRONG> Residential participants
focus on how they are treated and how easy it is to understand
and handle transactions with the utility company. Commercial and
industrial participants focus on technical and individualized
services for their businesses.
</UL>

<P>
Safety was not always rated as important, but not because participants
viewed it as unimportant. Instead, small and medium business participants
viewed safety as so important that it could not possibly be compromised.
Residential participants say they take safety for granted, or
see it as within the purview of the government or the utility
itself.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Safety. </STRONG>Safety is important to participants in all
customer classes. Participants in the urban low-income group were
particularly concerned with safety within their homes. Study participants
considered other items important but these items were either not
as important, or were considered important by a smaller sub-set
of participants in the research.
<LI><STRONG>Environment. </STRONG>Business participants-small, medium, and
large-generally said that environmental protection is within the
purview of government, and that environmental regulations will
not change as a result of competition. The small/medium business
customers also see the environment (like safety) as an area that
cannot be compromised. Residential participants expressed a greater
concern for the environment and tended to rate it as more important
than did members of other study segments.
<LI><STRONG>Conservation programs.</STRONG> Conservation programs are rated
as relatively important by residential and small/medium commercial
and industrial participants. These participants value the information
and rebates available from their electric providers. Some of the
largest commercial and industrial participants do not see these
as important because they have internal energy experts or have
previously used the programs.
<LI><STRONG>Location of provider.</STRONG> Participants in all customer
classes were mixed in their views of the importance of provider
location. All say it is important to have local service representatives
and local response to emergencies. Many say that local corporations
have a greater stake and thus a greater interest in the communities
they serve. However, participants were mixed on the importance
of the location of an electric company's headquarters.
<LI><STRONG>Accessible to all, regardless of income or location</STRONG>.
Most respondents say that electricity is a necessity that should
be available to all, regardless of income or location. Some people
in the medium industrial group said that there are limitations
to accessibility, and that people not using the existing infrastructure
should pay for additions to the infrastructure themselves. Although
providing electricity to all customers, regardless of income was
viewed as important, it was not necessarily viewed as the responsibility
of the utility company, especially in a competitive environment.
</UL>

<P>
Another set of electric utility service attributes were discussed
by some, but not all study participants. These items were not
raised by the moderator or interviewer, and so were not consistently
addressed in all focus groups or in-depth interviews. It is not
possible to assess how participants who were not asked about these
attributes would feel about them, except to note that they were
not foremost in their mind.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Long-term availability.</STRONG> The availability of adequate
electrical supply in the long-term was raised by some large commercial
and large industrial participants. One residential group and one
small/medium business group discussed this within the context
of utility planning.
<LI><STRONG>R&amp;D.</STRONG> Some residential participants say it is important
for electric utilities to conduct research and development on
alternative energy sources and innovative service delivery techniques.
<LI><STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG>. Some large commercial and large industrial
participants think flexibility in rate structures and service
offerings is important.
<LI><STRONG>Choice of providers.</STRONG> Several residential and small/medium
business participants think that having a choice of providers
is important.
<LI><STRONG>Access to the grid.</STRONG> One participant from each customer
segment raised the issue of customers having access to the grid.
The residential and small business participants want customers
to be able to sell wind or solar generated power to utilities.
A large industrial customer wants the ability to wheel power that
his facility generates to other facilities owned by his company.
<LI><STRONG>Landscaping/aesthetics.</STRONG> Some small/medium business
participants discussed the aesthetic effect of power lines on
the environment, or in their area.
<LI><STRONG>Decision-making authority.</STRONG> A couple of small/medium
business participants say it is important to know who has the
power to make decisions that affect customers.

<H2><A NAME="Attitudes_to_Deregulation">Attitudes toward Deregulation
of Electric and Other Industries </A></H2>

<H3>Knowledge of Electric Utility Restructuring</H3>

<P>
Knowledge of electric utility restructuring efforts is limited
in all three customer segments. Most of the commercial and industrial
participants had heard of electric utility restructuring prior
to the interview or focus group, but few could provide substantive
details. Some residential participants had heard of it, but again
substantive knowledge was limited. Most residential participants
had heard nothing about the issue prior to the focus group.
<P>
The lack of knowledge related to electric utility restructuring
has two noticeable consequences. First, most respondents had not
given previous thought to the issue, thus limiting their ability
to be thorough and conclusive in some areas. Second, for most
large commercial and industrial participants this meant they have
not developed plans or strategies for dealing with industry restructuring
(only large commercial and industrial participants were asked
about their plans).
<H3>Deregulation of Other Industries</H3>

<P>
Residential and small/medium commercial and industrial focus group
participants have exposure to various recently deregulated industries.
These focus group participants touched upon telephone, airline,
trucking, banking, and natural gas deregulation. The large commercial
and industrial interviewees tended to be department heads of energy
purchasing and plant operations and limited their discussion to
natural gas deregulation.
<P>
<STRONG>Telephones. </I>Both residential and small/medium commercial
and industrial participants expressed much irritation at long
distance providers for their aggressive marketing efforts. Residential
participants see it as annoying, intrusive, and think that they
are paying for it in their telephone rates. Residential participants
say that telephone deregulation has created a more confusing situation
for them. Some commercial and industrial focus group participants
say that telephone deregulation has brought technological and
service innovation, which they see as positive. Some of the commercial
and industrial participants see an increased &quot;hassle factor.&quot;
Both segments are mixed on what they think telephone deregulation
has done to rates.
<P>
<STRONG>Airlines.</I> Both residential and small/medium business participants
say that airline prices have gone down as a result of deregulation.
However, they say there is a reduction in services, or higher
costs, to smaller cities and rural areas. A few residential participants
are concerned that safety regulations have declined since deregulation.
<P>
<STRONG>Banking. </I>Participants say there is much consolidation in
the banking industry as a result of deregulation. They see this
as resulting in the loss of local providers and services to more
rural areas. Residential participants said that some banks offer
more services than they did before deregulation. Some small/medium
business participants see a reduction in costs. Members of both
customer segments see bank charges for things that had been free,
such as teller services.
<P>
<STRONG>Natural gas. </I>Large commercial and industrial participants
are mixed in their opinions regarding natural gas deregulation.
Some see lower prices and more flexible services as a result of
increased competition in this industry. Others found the process
of deregulation and the resulting industry structure complex and
confusing. These participants say it has not resulted in reduced
prices or better service. The only small/medium business participant
who discussed natural gas deregulation reported a reduction in
price.
<P>
<STRONG>Trucking.</I> Deregulation of the trucking industry was discussed
only among small/medium commercial and industrial participants.
Some participants see lower prices, reduced wages, and consolidation
of the industry as results of deregulation. Participants noted
possible negative effects on the economy and a reduction in services
to smaller cities. One participant said that safety has deteriorated
as a result of deregulation.
<H3>Attitudes toward Competition in the Electric Utility Industry
</H3>

<P>
All study segments discussed their attitudes and opinions regarding
competition in the electric utility industry. Members in each
of the study segments raised a relatively consistent list of potential
benefits from electric competition. The list of concerns had some
consistent items, and other items that were specific to a customer
segment (or segments). Large commercial and industrial participants
listed more benefits from competition than did other segments.
These issues are briefly discussed below. First, the potential
benefits and concerns raised by all customer segments are discussed.
Next, benefits and concerns that were not consistently raised
by all customer segments are discussed.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>A philosophical belief that competition is good.</STRONG>
Among all segments there are members who philosophically believe
that competition is a good thing - either because it eliminates
inefficiencies seen as inherent in monopoly structures, or simply
because it is the American way. This feeling was stronger and
more prevalent among commercial and industrial participants of
all sizes than among residential participants.
<LI><STRONG>Price impacts-short-term.</STRONG> Participants in all segments
are hopeful (but some are skeptical) that if competition occurs
it will lead to lower prices. The very largest commercial and
industrial participants are more certain than others that they
will see this benefit from deregulation. Other large commercial
and large industrial participants are hopeful, but less certain,
that they will receive lower rates. Some residential customers
also see lower rates as a potential benefit of competition. Some
small/medium commercial and industrial participants, as well as
some residential participants, fear &quot;cherry picking&quot;
by competitive providers that will result in higher rates for
smaller consumers.
<LI><STRONG>Price impacts-long-term.</STRONG> All customer segments expressed
concern for the long term effect of deregulation on prices. Residential
participants fear that initially prices will be low, as electric
providers compete for customers. Once consolidation of the industry
occurs, they believe rates will go up. Both the smaller and larger
commercial and industrial participants expressed concern that
under national deregulation there will be a leveling of prices,
possibly resulting in higher overall rates for Wisconsin.
<LI><STRONG>Confusion and skepticism.</STRONG> Some participants
in all customer segments are confused about how competition could
occur. They have difficulty accepting the premise that it could
occur, given the large, existing infrastructure associated with
electrical generation, transmission, and distribution.
<LI><STRONG>Belief that electric industry should be regulated.</STRONG>
Some participants from all three customer segments see benefits
to regulation. Some residential and small/medium business participants
believe electricity should continue to be regulated because it
is a necessity. Most participants believe that aspects of electric
service should continue to be regulated, even if there is a move
toward deregulation.
<LI><STRONG>Increased Complexity.</STRONG> All segments see increased
complexity as a possible result of competition. Although residential
participants did not elaborate on how increased complexity would
manifest itself, some commercial and industrial participants did.
These commercial and industrial participants say that more of
the responsibility for dealing with regulations will fall on the
consumer.
<LI><STRONG>Consolidation of the industry.</STRONG> The possibility
of competition leading to consolidation in the industry was raised
by all study segments. Consolidation of the industry is perceived
as having three potential negative effects. First, it reduces
the amount of competition. Second, large companies are seen as
less local, and therefore taking less interest in the needs of
the community. Third, it could result in a lack of local service
staff.
<LI>Several large commercial and large industrial participants
say that consolidations and mergers could result in a reduction
in the cost of utility operations. A small/medium business customer
said that this may result in the elimination of utility company
jobs, negatively affecting the economy.
<LI><STRONG>Cost cutting measures.</STRONG> All segments raised concerns
regarding possible cost- cutting measures associated with a competitive
environment. Residential participants expressed concern regarding
safety measures and the cost to consumers of some services that
they now perceive as free. Commercial and industrial participants
expressed concern regarding service, such as response to outages
or locally available service representatives.
</UL>

<P>
The remaining potential benefits and concerns were not raised
by all customer segments.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Increased marketing efforts</STRONG>. Small commercial and industrial
participants, and residential participants, are very concerned
that competition will result in large-scale marketing efforts
similar to those of long distance telephone carriers. Residential
participants say it would be more difficult to substantiate electric
providers' claims than those of telephone companies.
<LI><STRONG>Diversification into non-utility ventures.</STRONG> Several
small/medium commercial and industrial participants expressed
concern that electric utilities will expand into non-utility areas.
The businesses raising the issue are concerned about competing
with electric utilities, whom they view as having unfair advantages
given their greater access to capital.
<LI><STRONG>Impacts on rural customers/small customers.</STRONG> Some residential
and small/medium business participants are concerned that people
and business in more rural locations will see a decline in service
or higher rates in a competitive environment.
<LI><STRONG>Reduced safety/environmental control.</STRONG> Some residential
participants are concerned that deregulation will result in reduced
safety and in less environmental protection by electric utility
providers. They see this as a result of fewer regulations or from
cost-cutting measures by electric utilities.
<LI><STRONG>Uncertain outcomes/risky.</STRONG> Many residential participants
are uncertain whether competition would be beneficial to the electric
utility industry. They see deregulation as a potential risk, and
some are suspicious of electric utility motives.
<LI><STRONG>Need education.</STRONG> Residential participants say that they
do not understand electricity issues well. They say it would be
important to have more information if they are to select among
providers.
<LI><STRONG>Satisfaction with the current situation.</STRONG> Some residential
participants say that since things are working well now, they
do not see a need to make the electric industry competitive.
<LI><STRONG>Increased options.</STRONG> Some of the largest commercial and
industrial customers said that competition will result in increased
flexibility in rate and service options to meet their specialized
needs. A few residential participants see the possibility of options
tailored to customer needs.
<LI><STRONG>Increased utility efficiency.</STRONG> Many of the large
commercial and large industrial participants said that competition
will force electricity providers to more efficiently operate their
organizations because they will no longer be guaranteed a rate
of return (profit). They will analyze their work force and eliminate
unnecessary positions and unproductive staff.
<LI><STRONG>Ability to wheel power.</STRONG> For a few large commercial
and industrial participants the ability to transfer self-generated
power (wheel their own electricity) from facility to facility
is seen as another attractive feature of deregulation.
<LI><STRONG>Bundling of purchasing power.</STRONG> Some large commercial
and industrial participants are hopeful that deregulation will
allow them to purchase power for all facilities from a single
provider. They see the ability to &quot;bundle&quot; facilities
giving them increased negotiating power and providing a chance
to balance demand across facilities. They also see benefits in
equalizing costs across facilities and consolidating bill payments.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Perceived_Effects">Perceived Effects of Deregulation
on Different Groups</A></H2>

<P>
Most residential participants and large commercial and industrial
participants were hesitant to hypothesize on the effects of deregulation
on different groups of utility customers. Small/medium commercial
and industrial participants were more forthcoming in their comments.
<P>
Most participants (of all sizes) who did discuss the issue speculated
that larger customers will benefit from deregulation. They see
larger businesses/electricity consumers, who will have negotiating
power, as able to work out better deals with electricity providers.
The largest commercial and industrial participants are relatively
confident that they will see lower rates. The smaller energy users
(among the large commercial and industrial participants) are unsure
of their status in a competitive environment.
<P>
Many participants think that reduced rates to larger customers
will be at the expense of smaller customers. Most small and medium
business participants think that residential customers would end
up paying higher prices after deregulation. Other small/business
participants see themselves as the biggest potential losers in
a deregulated environment. A few residential customers speculate
that rates will decline for all.
<P>
Business focus group participants discussed the probable effects
of deregulation on low-income customers. They are divided in their
assessment of these impacts. Some said that low-income customers
could lose services, or pay higher rates for them. Others said
these customers will be protected from this by government regulations,
even under a competitive scenario. The low-income participants
did not speculate on the effect of competition on them as low-income
customers, but also thought that large business would benefit.

<BODY>

<H1><A NAME="DDE_LINK3">Tracking the HVAC Market for Energy Efficiency
Services</A></H1>

<P>
To help design and evaluate future energy-efficiency programs,
we interviewed 95 contractors in five areas of Wisconsin to establish
a baseline of energy-efficiency services in the residential and
small commercial HVAC market. We explored market structure; services,
products, and practices; utility influence; and training.
<H2>Market Structure</H2>

<P>
The average interviewed HVAC contractor is a small (6-person),
established (25-year), local company that depends on referrals
for business. Over 80 percent of contractor sales are residential.
Contractors have more influence over equipment type and efficiency
in the new residential market and the repair and replacement market,
and less in the new small commercial market.
<H2>Services, Products, and Practices</H2>

<P>
Interviewed contractors generally recommend high-efficiency forced-air
furnaces; statewide, 85 percent of units sold meet or exceed 90
percent efficiency. Most contractors do not recommend high-efficiency
central air conditioning, especially in northern Wisconsin; statewide,
27 percent of units sold meet or exceed 11.0 Seasonal Energy Efficiency
Ratio. Most contractors said the energy savings of high-efficiency
central air conditioning or geothermal heat pumps don&#146;t justify
their additional cost.
<P>
Most interviewed contractors do not offer energy audits, blower-door
tests, advice on insulation and weatherization, or customized
estimates of energy savings. Contractors have mixed opinions of
setback thermostats, whole-house fans, and electronic air filters;
those that recommend them do so selectively. They tend to use
rules of thumb to size equipment, rather than computerized heat
loss calculations.
<P>
Many contractors said that modern buildings are too air-tight,
but few contractors install air-to-air heat exchangers, saying
that other methods are more economical.
<H2>Utility Influence</H2>

<P>
Most HVAC contractors approve of utility education and rebate
programs, although they want utilities to stop recommending high-efficiency
central air conditioning and to avoid selling, installing, or
servicing HVAC equipment.
<H2>Training</H2>

<P>
Technicians learn on the job and are not licensed. Most contractors
said they learn about new technologies through distributors and
manufacturer representatives.
<P>
Based on our results, we make the following recommendations:
<H3>Research</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Research basic products and practices and disseminate cost
and benefit information to HVAC contractors, especially the costs
and benefits of air-to-air heat exchangers.
<LI>Investigate whether sealed-combustion furnaces have a reduced
risk of emitting carbon monoxide.
<LI>To increase participation and reduce scheduling difficulties,
conduct HVAC market tracking studies in the winter.
<LI>Work closely with contractors to understand their perspective
on products, services, and practices.
<LI>Because the HVAC market changes slowly, wait until there is
a reason, such as an education program, to do further market research.
</UL>

<H3>Education</H3>

<UL>
<LI>To foster cooperation with contractors, utilities should consider
staying out of the HVAC installation, repair, and replacement
business.
<LI>Continue to educate residential and small commercial customers
on the benefits of energy efficiency.
<LI>In education programs for HVAC contractors, use the same techniques
and materials throughout the state.

<BODY>

<H1>Market Assessment of New Heat Pump Technologies</H1>

<P>
Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) use the earth for heating and
cooling. During the winter, when the ground is warmer than the
air, heat pumps move heat from the ground into the home. During
the summer, they move heat from the home back into the earth,
providing cooling. GSHPs, which are electrically powered, are
much more efficient than conventional heating devices because
they extract heat from the earth, rather than burning fossil fuels.
<P>
GSHPs have lower operating costs and environmental benefits, such
as decreased greenhouse gas emissions, compared to many alternatives.
Although GSHPs have been successful in Canada and other parts
of the northern U.S., they have not had widespread use in Wisconsin,
partly because of high initial costs and their association with
air-source heat pumps (ASHPs), which performed poorly in northern
climates. A new type of air-source heat pump technology&#151;the
gas-engine heat pump (GEHP), which uses engine heat for supplemental
heating&#151;has performed better.
<P>
This study assesses the potential market in Wisconsin for GSHPs
and GEHPs. We investigated equipment, costs, and successful programs
by conducting in-depth interviews with utilities and heat pump
manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. We focused on identifying
the market for GSHPs in Wisconsin and suggesting ways to overcome
barriers to market growth.
<H2>Equipment</H2>

<P>
There are two kinds of GSHP systems&#151;closed-loop and open-loop.
Closed-loop heat pumps exchange heat with the earth using a buried
loop filled with fluid. Open-loop heat pumps exchange heat with
well water. About half of GSHPs have variable speed operation,
and this is an increasing trend. Most are single package, closed-loop
systems with backup electric resistance heat and built-in supplemental
water heating. Only one manufacturer makes air-source GEHPs. In
general, the equipment has been reliable. 
<H2>Successful Programs Outside Wisconsin</H2>

<P>
Outside Wisconsin, we found that utility GSHP programs have focused
on increasing electric sales and flattening utility load shapes.
Most programs have targeted existing homes with electric resistance
heat or new homes.
<P>
The primary market barriers outside Wisconsin have been high initial
cost and lack of consumer awareness. Many consumers believe that
heat pumps are new, unproven technologies or that they don&#146;t
work in northern climates. Other problems have been low sales
volumes for distributors and lack of training for contractors.
Programs have also had difficulty competing with natural gas because
it is the cheapest alternative. The most important success factors
have been developing infrastructure, using incentives, and increasing
consumer awareness.
<P>
One of the most promising marketing approaches has been mass construction
of loops in subdivisions. Not only does this bring down costs,
but including the cost of the GSHPs in the mortgage provides convenient
30-year financing. To increase sales, some dealers emphasize low
operating costs, even heat, less expensive insurance, and safety
(no chimney or flame). Some utilities have found that installations
in schools and churches interested people in buying heat pumps
for their homes. Although many rebate programs have been successful,
most utilities plan to reduce incentives.
<H2>Wisconsin Programs</H2>

<P>
We found that sales in Wisconsin have been small (only 1000-2000
total installations, mostly of open-loop GSHPs). Wisconsin programs
have focused exclusively on GSHPs, rather than GEHPs. The Wisconsin
programs face most of the barriers that programs in other states
reported. In addition, Wisconsin utility regulations discourage
promotion of GSHPs; regulations don&#146;t distinguish between
electric-resistance heat and electrically driven systems like
heat pumps. Furthermore, the building code requires more insulation
for electrically heated homes.
<P>
Wisconsin distributors face the high cost of keeping inventory,
training staff, small volume, and lack of profitability. Dealers
face a need for special skills, tools, and inventory; difficulty
finding loop contractors; lack of contractor awareness; and lack
of marketing expertise.
<H2>Costs</H2>

<P>
The following table shows the estimated range of incremental equipment
costs, operating cost savings, and paybacks for GSHPs compared
to propane or oil furnaces, and GEHPs compared to natural gas
furnaces.

<P>
Open-loop GSHP systems have the shortest payback, but they can
only be installed where there is a well and adequate drainage.
(Some people also say that using water this way is wasteful.)
Closed-loop systems are more practical, because they can be installed
anywhere, but the paybacks are longer. GEHPs have the longest
payback. Their main advantage is that they don&#146;t face any
regulatory barriers.
<H2>Conclusions</H2>

<P>
Because of long paybacks, the market for air-source GEHPs in Wisconsin
is poor. This study suggests that the best market for GSHPs is
new construction in areas that don&#146;t have natural gas available.
Customers who buy GSHPs tend to be wealthy, energy conscious,
and technically minded. If costs can be lowered, other markets
can be developed. However, in addition to lowering costs, Wisconsin
heat pump programs need to:
<UL>
<LI>Develop market infrastructure.
</UL>

<P>
Educate and work with distributors, dealers, and contractors.
Successful programs outside Wisconsin have promoted heat pumps
to distributors and dealers, trained contractors and loop installers,
established trade organizations, developed quality standards for
loop installations, made deals with loop installers to lower costs,
given sales leads to hand-picked contractors, and distributed
heat pumps directly.
<UL>
<LI>Increase consumer awareness. 
</UL>

<P>
Marketing programs need to overcome the perception that natural
gas is always the best heating alternative. They also need to
distinguish ground-source units from air-source models that have
performed poorly in Wisconsin.
<UL>
<LI>Overcome regulatory barriers. 
</UL>

<P>
Wisconsin&#146;s regulatory policy discourages electric heating.
Because the unregulated cooperatives do not face this barrier,
their service territories make promising markets. The building
code requires more insulation for electrically heated homes, but
a clause in the building code that credits renewable energy sources
(ILHR 22.21) may offset this requirement.

<H1>Tracking the Building Market for Energy Efficiency Services
</H1>

<P>
To help design and evaluate future energy-efficiency programs,
we interviewed 100 contractors in five areas of Wisconsin to establish
a baseline of energy-efficiency services in the residential and
small commercial building and remodeling markets. Using in-depth
interviews&#151;a qualitative research method&#151;we explored
market structure; services, products, and practices; utility influence;
and training.
<H2>Market Structure</H2>

<P>
The average interviewed building or remodeling contractor is a
small (10-person), established (19-year), local company that depends
on referrals for business and works primarily (80 percent of sales)
in the residential sector. Both remodelers and builders coordinate
the work of subcontractors, such as HVAC and insulation contractors,
and often share decision making with them.
<H2>Services, Products, and Practices</H2>

<P>
Most interviewed contractors do not offer energy audits, blower-door
tests, advice on insulation and weatherization, or customized
estimates of energy savings, preferring to focus their businesses
on construction, rather than comprehensive energy services.
<P>
Energy trusses and house wrap have gained wide-spread acceptance
in many areas of the state, although contractors have mixed opinions
of them. They also have mixed opinions of setback thermostats,
whole-house fans, and electronic air filters&#151;recommending
them only selectively. Interviewed contractors generally recommend
high-efficiency forced-air furnaces, but do not recommend high-efficiency
central air conditioning or geothermal heat pumps.
<P>
Standard building practice for most contractors is 2X6 construction,
fiberglass batt wall insulation and double-glazed windows. Contractors
said that following building codes will ensure an energy-efficient
building, while also saying that most customers prefer to spend
extra money on aesthetics rather than energy efficiency. Although
many contractors said that modern buildings are too air-tight,
few contractors install air-to-air heat exchangers, saying that
other methods are more economical.
<H2>Utility Influence</H2>

<P>
Most contractors approve of utility education and rebate programs
and want utilities to continue offering blower-door tests and
energy audits.
<H2>Training</H2>

<P>
Carpenters typically learn on the job. Contractors said they receive
training and education through suppliers; manufacturers; trade
association magazines, seminars, and conferences; and home product
shows.
<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<P>
Based on our results, we make the following recommendations:
<H3>Research</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Research the costs and benefits of products and practices
and disseminate this information to contractors, especially the
costs and benefits of air-to-air heat exchangers, house wrap,
and energy trusses.
<LI>To increase contractor participation and reduce scheduling
problems, conduct market tracking studies in the winter.
<LI>Work closely with builders and remodelers to understand their
perspectives on products, services, and practices.
<LI>Because the building market changes slowly, wait to do further
market research until there is reason to believe that the market
has changed, such as an education program.
</UL>

<H3>Education</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Continue to educate contractors and related subcontractors
on the benefits of energy-efficiency.
<LI>Continue to educate residential and small commercial customers
on the benefits of energy efficiency.
<LI>In contractor education programs, use the same techniques and
materials throughout the state.

<H1>Estimating Wisconsin Residential Space Heating Loads</H1>

<P>
Utilities across the country require comprehensive information
about how their customers use energy so that they can plan strategically
for load-building programs, peak-reduction programs, and a competitive
position in a market-driven environment. An extensive end-use
metering program can provide such information, but this method
of data collection is expensive and time consuming. 
<P>
In this study we obtained information about the energy-consumption
patterns of Wisconsin residential heating appliances&#151;both
gas and electric&#151;without performing end-use metering. To
achieve this, we used engineering models to estimate load profiles
and energy-consumption patterns for homes equipped with gas or
electric heating appliances.
<H2>Computer Modeling</H2>

<P>
We used the EPRI Simplified Program for Residential Energy engineering
model (ESPRE)&#151;developed by the Electric Power Research Institute&#151;to
estimate residential heating load shapes and energy consumption.
Using the physical characteristics of a prototype house, appropriate
Typical Meteorological Year weather data, and a heating system&#146;s
engineering specifications as inputs, ESPRE predicted hourly heating
loads. We used ESPRE to model a variety of residential electric
heating systems and standard gas furnaces. We also designed a
series of controlled experiments that used ESPRE to isolate the
individual impacts of heating system type, house size, thermostat
settings, weather, and insulation standards. These experiments
involved varying one factor at a time and studying how load and
energy consumption changed as a result.
<P>
We used survey and audit data from Dairyland Power Cooperative
and Wisconsin Gas Company to provide the foundation for creating
a variety of simulated &#147;prototype&#148; houses to represent
groups of houses within these utilities&#146; service territories.
Prototypes were located in Eau Claire, La Crosse, and Milwaukee.
We verified the prototypes by comparing the ESPRE estimates of
gas consumption with measurements of actual daily gas consumption.

<H2>Results</H2>

<P>
ESPRE was able to provide reliable data that extends beyond simple
comparisons of heating systems. The major conclusions based on
ESPRE&#146;s predictions were:
<UL>
<LI>Whether heated with gas or electricity, two-story houses consume
less energy for heating than single-story houses of the same square
footage. This is because the second story provides additional
overhead insulation for the first floor.
<LI>For gas- and electric-heated homes, setting thermostats back
by five degrees (from 70&#176; F to 65&#176; F) have a significant
impact on the magnitude and timing of demand peaks. However, such
conservation-oriented setback strategies only save four to seven
percent on overall energy consumption.
<LI>Houses built in accordance with Wisconsin&#146;s new (1987)
insulation standards for electric-heated structures consume up
to 27 percent less energy than a typical existing house. Those
that meet the less stringent gas-heated insulation standards save
up to 14 percent. Demand peaks are also reduced in houses built
to the new standards. These estimates assume that new houses will
fully meet the State&#146;s new codes. If actual construction
doesn&#146;t meet these specifications, then actual energy consumption
would consistently exceed ESPRE&#146;s estimates.
<LI>Ground-source heat pumps use 54 percent less electricity overall
than electric furnaces. 
</UL>

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<P>
With data describing any population of houses, our results could
be weighted to represent that population, or a given set of house
characteristics. One could also use ESPRE or another model to
generate new results by using the methodology in this study to
analyze a different population.
<P>
This research was hindered by a scarcity of specific data on residential
customers. To facilitate future studies using engineering modeling
(such as ESPRE) in place of end-use metering, utilities should
obtain comprehensive data describing their customers. This information
should include:
<UL>
<LI>Type of heating or cooling appliances
<LI>Heating appliance capacity and connected load
<LI>Supplemental heating system use
<LI>Number of space conditioning zones in the house
<LI>Thermostat set points and schedules for each zone
<LI>Size of conditioned space
<LI>Presence or absence of a basement or attic
<LI>Thermal characteristics (R-values) of the walls, windows,
ceilings, and roof
<LI>Exact year house was constructed

<BODY>

<H1>Tracking the Insulation Market for Energy Efficiency Services</H1>

<P>
To help design and evaluate future energy-efficiency programs,
we interviewed 44 contractors in five areas of Wisconsin to establish
a baseline of energy-efficiency services in the residential and
small commercial insulation market. Using in-depth interviews&#151;a
qualitative research method&#151;we explored market structure;
services, products, and practices; utility influence; and training.
<H2>Market Structure</H2>

<P>
Insulation contractors tend to specialize in one of two markets&#151;new
construction or retrofit. Among interviewed contractors, new construction
contractors are larger and cover a larger service territory than
retrofit contractors. Their size gives them a significant advantage
in buying materials, making the new construction market very competitive
and price sensitive. A new construction contractor views the builder
as the customer and typically does all their insulation work,
which is generally limited to installing wall and ceiling insulation.
New construction contractors have little input into specified
Rvalues.
<P>
Retrofit contractors, besides being smaller and more local, have
more direct contact with the actual customer (that is, the owner
of the home or building). This allows retrofit contractors to
have much more input into decisions, such as the R-value of installed
insulation. Although most of their work consists of insulating
attics and ceilings, many interviewed retrofit contractors also
offer minor repair and replacement services, such as repairing
attic vents and installing new windows. Though still important,
price is less critical in the retrofit market, and many contractors
market their quality, experience, and sometimes, comprehensive
services.
<H2>Services, Products, and Practices</H2>

<P>
Most interviewed contractors concentrate on installing wall and
ceiling insulation that meets or just exceeds building codes.
Beyond insulation, contractors are concerned with proper ventilation
to prevent excessive attic heat and moisture build up inside the
home. Many contractors said that buildings today are &#147;tight.&#148;

<P>
Most contractors do not offer comprehensive energy services, such
as energy audits, blower-door tests, weatherization, energy savings
estimates, or carbon monoxide detection. The exception was the
Milwaukee area, where many retrofit contractors offer weatherization
services that are close to comprehensive.
<P>
Normal insulation practices are R-38 to R-40 insulation in ceilings,
R-13 insulation in 2X4 walls, and R-19 insulation in 2X6 walls.
A few contractors use new insulation products, such as InsulSafe
III and Blow-In-Blanket, but acceptance is not widespread. Expandable
foam insulation is used selectively (for example, to seal around
chimneys), but cost, practical difficulties, and concern about
damage to doors and windows due to over-expansion of the foam
limits its application. 
<P>
Contractors define super insulation in different ways, but few
install it, citing high costs. Few install basement floor insulation,
for similar reasons; they also say that this is the concrete contractor&#146;s
responsibility. All contractors install vapor barriers to comply
with building codes, but many contractors are concerned that vapor
barriers make a building too &#147;tight.&#148; 
<H2>Utility Influence</H2>

<P>
Utilities have some influence on increasing the average R-value
of insulation. Utility programs, especially low-income programs,
also generate business for retrofit contractors. Most contractors
approve of utility education and rebate programs and want utilities
to continue offering blower-door tests and energy audits.
<H2>Training</H2>

<P>
Insulation contractors typically learn on the job. Contractors
said they receive training and education through manufacturers
and utility seminars.
<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<P>
Based on our results, we make the following recommendations:
<H3>Research</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Research the costs and benefits of products and practices
and disseminate this information to contractors, especially the
costs and benefits of blower-door services.
<LI>To increase contractor participation and reduce scheduling
problems, conduct market tracking studies in the winter.
<LI>Work closely with insulation contractors to understand their
perspectives on products, services, and practices.
<LI>Because the insulation market changes slowly, wait to do further
market research until there is reason to believe that the market
has changed, such as an education program.
</UL>

<H3>Education</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Continue to educate residential and small commercial customers
on the benefits of proper insulation and weatherization.
<LI>In contractor education programs, use the same techniques
and materials throughout the state.

<H1>Central Wisconsin Study</H1>

<H3>A survey of Central Wisconsin residents and businesses<BR>
on their attitudes toward energy efficiency</H3>

<P>
Central Wisconsin boasts several strong environmental and energy
efficiency organizations. In addition, residents have been exposed
to extensive discussions of energy issues as a result of hearings
convened to discuss enhanced transmission facilities in that area.
<P>
On the basis of residents&#146; testimony, the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin (PSC) hypothesized that customers living
in Central Wisconsin are particularly sensitive to information
about energy efficiency and renewables, and would be knowledgeable,
motivated, and inclined toward conservation activities. If residents
of an area were more aware of conservation issues and held a more
fully developed conservation ethic, the PSC said, those citizens
would be more likely to take advantage of conservation opportunities.
Thus, awareness and propensity would indicate a high conservation
potential and a likelihood of success of programs targeted to
the conservation-sensitive area.
<P>
The PSC granted permission to upgrade the transmission infrastructure,
but also suggested a two-phase research project. First, determine
whether the propensity of Central Wisconsin customers to support
energy conservation and renewables is indeed higher than found
elsewhere in the state. Second, if it is found to be higher, develop
and test appropriate programs to take advantage of that propensity.
This report describes the first phase of the project.
<H2>Method</H2>

<P>
To test the hypothesis that residents of Central Wisconsin &#147;test
area&#148;&#151;parts of Outagamie, Portage, Waupaca, Winnebago,
and Waushara counties&#151;are more likely than residents of other
areas of Wisconsin to support energy conservation, we designed
and implemented a detailed survey of energy-related attitudes,
beliefs, motivations, and knowledge with residential customers
in the test area and in a comparison area. We also explored related
factors among smaller samples of businesses in the two areas.
Representative samples of approximately 300 residential customers
from each area participated in a telephone survey. Matched nonprobability
samples of 30 small to medium-sized businesses from each area
participated in a shorter telephone survey.
<P>
We developed the comparison sample through geodemographic analysis
to selected areas of Wisconsin that were similar in certain respects
to the target area in Central Wisconsin. The two samples were
similar with regard to respondent age, income, education, population
density, home ownership, and other factors. The two groups also
had similar appliance holdings and electricity consumption.
<H2>Results</H2>

<P>
As expected, the test sample was more likely than the comparison
sample to recall having heard about transmission issues and about
energy conservation. More members of the test sample also reported
being active in environmental organizations and having participated
in utility programs. However, increased program participation
appears to be a result of greater program availability in the
test area. Participants in utility programs (and thus, test area
respondents) were also more likely to have had a home energy audit.
<P>
The survey results suggest that test area respondents do not have
strong and consistent differences on other indicators of propensity
toward energy conservation and renewables. They appear no more
willing than comparison area respondents to pay &#147;green&#148;
rates, prefer &#147;green&#148; solutions to energy supply problems,
conserve home energy, be aware of solar technologies, or hold
other related attitudes probed by the survey. Our analyses of
commercial respondents and of the infrastructure for energy efficiency
and renewables also failed to identify significant differences
between the test and comparison areas.
<P>
We conclude that based on our surveys, the general populations
of the two areas do not systematically differ in their propensity
toward energy efficiency; the test area is no stronger a candidate
for energy-efficiency programs than other similar communities
in Wisconsin.<HR>

<H1>Fungus Invades Wisconsin Paper Mill</H1>

<H4>Demonstration of &quot;biopulping&quot; will document energy
savings</H4>

<ADDRESS>
by Jeremy Kohler 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Turning wood chips to paper is no simple matter, but apparently,
even a fungus can do it. Or at least it can help a paper mill
do it with less energy. That&#146;s what the Center hopes to demonstrate
this fall with a fungal field test in a Wisconsin paper mill.
<P>
In &#147;mechanical&#148; mills papermaking usually begins by
feeding wood chips into a large electric grinder. What comes out
is a gooey pulp that will eventually become paper. But grinding
the wood just right to preserve the long fibers of cellulose that
make paper strong takes a lot of electricity.
<P>
A new technology that could help save some of this energy comes
from an unlikely source: a common fungus inhabiting Wisconsin&#146;s
forests, called <I>Ceriporiopsis subvermispora</I>, that has a
natural ability to digest wood without breaking up the cellulose.
Scientists have found a way to use this fungus&#151;in a process
called biopulping&#151;that could help mills turn out better paper
at a lower cost.
<P>
&#147;Besides saving energy, biopulping also makes the paper stronger,&#148;
says Center project manager Dave Shipley, who is coordinating
the Center-sponsored demonstration. Laboratory and pilot-scale
tests show that if you let the fungus grow on wood chips prior
to grinding, the grinder won&#146;t have to work as hard and can
produce a high-quality pulp with extra long cellulose fibers.
The fungus also removes &#147;pitch,&#148; an unwanted component
of the wood.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="masood.jpg" ALIGN="CENTER"><P>
Moldy wood chips in the hands of<BR> Masood Akhtar at the Forest Products<BR>
Laboratory could mean big energy<BR> savings at paper mills.
</CENTER>
<P>
Biopulping is being developed at the USDA Forest Products Laboratory
(FPL) in Madison. It is a project of the Biopulping Consortium,
which includes FPL, the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology
Center, the University of Minnesota, and members of the pulp and
paper industry.  
<P>
&#147;Biopulping could cut a grinder&#146;s electricity consumption
by about 30 percent,&#148; says Masood Akhtar, the UW-Madison
scientist leading the project at FPL. Along with environmental
benefits, Akhtar says, that could mean big long-term savings for
paper mills. 
<P>
Consolidated Papers, Inc., has agreed to host the demonstration
at its Biron plant, where it will grind 50 tons of fungus-treated
chips into pulp. This full-scale experiment will allow researchers
to document the energy savings and fine-tune the process while
demonstrating how biopulping might work in an industrial setting.

<P>
FPL scientists will collect samples of the pulp for analysis.
Shipley notes that because biopulping appears to produce a high-quality
pulp that&#146;s good for making strong paper, it has the potential
to reduce the need for more expensive pulps&#151;produced by <I>kraft</I>
processes&#151;which require heavier use of chemicals to preserve
the cellulose fibers.
<P>
&#147;Non-kraft mills, such as thermomechanical, chemimechanical,
and sulfite mills, may be able to use this technology in its present
form,&#148; Shipley says. In the future, he adds, biopulping could
be modified&#151;perhaps by using different species of fungi&#151;to
also work in kraft mills. 
<P>
The Center is producing a video based on the demonstration to
help explain biopulping and present the technology to the paper
industry nationally. The demonstration should be completed this
fall; watch future issues of <I>E2</I> for the results.<br>

<TITLE>ECW: Responsible Power Management</TITLE> 
</HEAD> 
<BODY> 
<H1>Performance Optimization</H1> 
ECW's Responsible Power Management Program provides a performance optimization service (POS) that 
is designed to help people find ways to improve the efficiency of their industrial fan, pump, and blower 
systems that use motors 75 horsepower and up. We first identify sites that are good candidates for 
economical equipment upgrades. Then we bring in engineers to determine precisely what is needed. 
Finally, if upgrades are warranted, we make changes at the site. Our goal is to perform equipment upgrades 
at at least six pilot sites around Wisconsin by December 1996. POS offers a three-day technical training 
course, geared toward engineers and consulting engineers, and a one day course that trains utility 
representatives and trade allies how to identify promising POS sites. There is national interest in this 
project, and the Center is working with DOE through the Motor Challenge program to refine the training 
and develop new marketing materials for use in Wisconsin and nationally. 
<P> 
<H2>REACHING FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE </H2> 
Get the most from your motor-driven system with Responsible Power Management's Performance 
Optimization Service 
<P> 
<H3>Get The Most From Your Motor-Driven System</H3> 
If your plant is like most industrial facilities in Wisconsin, motor systems are responsible for up to 70 
percent of your electric consumption. Whether they are powered by standard-efficiency or high-efficiency 
motors, these systems are not operating at peak performance unless they precisely match the demands of 
your production line, cooling system, or other processes.
<P> 
Fine-tuning or upgrading an inefficient motor-driven system can usually save enough on utility bills to pay 
for the upgrades within a year or two--and that's not all. It can also reduce maintenance, reduce downtime, 
and make your equipment last longer. Performance Optimization Service can help you realize these 
benefits by optimizing the performance of your systems that use motor-driven fans, pumps, and blowers. 
POS engineers test your system's inputs and outputs to develop a detailed picture of its operating 
conditions. Then they recommend economically sound options that fit the unique needs of your facility. 
<P> 
POS provides real-world solutions--strategies that fit individual needs, not generic treatments. 
<P> 
<H3>Is POS Right For Your Facility?</H3> 
Even in today's high-tech plants, imperfections in design, installation, and operation can reduce the 
performance of your fan, pump, and blower systems. Often, these imperfections appear after operations 
begin, due to changes in production processes, schedules, or equipment. 
<P> 
A POS-trained utility representative or distributor can determine how your systems can benefit from POS 
by conducting a simple screening. You can also perform a screening yourself. Performance Optimization 
Service is most appropriate for facilities that have at least one motor system that operates at least 4,000 
hours a year (two shifts) and uses motors that total 75 horsepower or more. Smaller equipment installed in 
parallel or in series totaling at least 75 horsepower may also be good POS candidates.
<P> 
If your facility meets these requirements, look for typical indicators of POS opportunities: 
<BR> 
<UL><LI>Excessive emissions or waste <BR> 
<LI>High noise or vibration levels <BR> 
<LI>Not enough flow from a fan, pump, or blower system <BR> 
<LI>Too much flow from a fan, pump, or blower system <BR> 
<LI>Inadequate control <BR> 
<LI>Bypasses, spillage, or leaks <BR> 
<LI>Production bottlenecks <BR> 
<LI>Nuisance breakdowns of fans, pumps, or blowers <BR> 
<LI>Pressure pulsations in pipes or ductwork <BR> 
<LI>High reject rate or other product quality problems
</UL>
<P> 
All these problems can result from poor energy efficiency. You may be able to solve them by boosting 
efficiency through POS. And POS may also be able to help if you want to increase production at your 
facility. 
<P> 
<H3>Start The Process At No Cost To You</H3> 
<BR> 
The POS program is structured to let you investigate opportunities for improved performance without 
spending a dime, and offers independent engineering expertise at every step of the way. The process begins 
with a free site visit from a POS-trained professional who will gather the basic information needed to 
assess the benefits of a full POS study. The representative will then review the information with a POS 
engineer to determine whether it's worthwhile to go further in the POS process. The next step is a more 
detailed site review by a POS-accredited engineering specialist to identify how POS can enhance your 
system's performance. Finally, if your facility appears likely to benefit, you'll have the option to invest in a 
full <B>feasibility study</B>. When the study is complete, POS engineers will provide a detailed report 
that outlines a technical and economic analysis of cost-saving options and productivity improvement 
measures. In many cases, the report will include several options that involve different amounts of financial 
investment. 
<P> 
<H3>POS Video</H3> 
RPM has produced a short video that explains the advantages and the technical basis of performance 
optimization. If you'd like a free copy of <A HREF="electron.html#video">any RPM video</A>, call the 
Energy Center of Wisconsin's Responsible Power Management Program at 1-800-55-WI-RPM (1-800-559- 
4776). Or you can <A HREF="electron.html#Ordering">order</A> a video by email. 
<P> 
<H3>POS Gets Results</H3> 
<I>I'm really happy with the results of our POS feasibility study. We'll save a minimum of $25,000 a 
year.</I>
<BR> 
--Dan Schaller, plant engineer, G. Heileman Brewing Company.
<P> 
Through the POS program, G. Heileman improved the efficiency of its cooling system. Before the study, 
engineers had suspected the system wasn't operating at its peak. But they wanted to have a thorough 
assessment of the system before considering any changes.
<P> 
A POS feasibility study, with its comprehensive on-site analyses of actual operating conditions, was 
exactly what G. Heileman needed. The study showed that trimming a pump's impeller--rather than 
purchasing new equipment--could improve performance dramatically. This low-cost measure paid for itself 
in a short six months. 
<P> 
To find out more about how G. Heileman Brewing Company and other Wisconsin firms are benefiting 
from POS, ask for a copy of POS case studies from your utility representative or from the RPM program at 
1-800-55-WI-RPM (1-800-559-4776). 
<P> 
<H3>RPM Performance Optimization Service--Saving Energy With a Statewide Effort</H3> 
Performance Optimization Service is one component of the Energy Center of Wisconsin's <A 
HREF="rpm.html">Responsible Power Management program</A>. Cooperating with Wisconsin 
utilities, government organizations, and public-advocacy and business groups, RPM works to make energy 
efficiency an easy choice for industrial and commercial motor users. Through RPM, Wisconsin businesses 
are conserving energy. This helps delay the building of new power plants--and protects the environment, 
too.
<P> 
You can learn more about RPM's Performance Optimization Service by calling your local utility 
representative or the RPM program at 1-800-55-WI-RPM (1-800-559-4776).

<H1>Conserving Energy with High-Efficiency Motors</H1>

<H3>Get the most from your energy dollar with Responsible Power
Management&#174;</H3>

<P>
In industrial and commercial facilities, motors are responsible for as much as 75 percent of a building's 
electric consumption. Some 40-hp motors alone use as much as $8100 a year in electricity. But that's a 
standard-efficiency motor. A high-efficiency motor could reduce the cost of running that one motor by 
$500 per year. With a high-efficiency motor, your company could save $7500 over the motor's 15-year 
life. And with Responsible Power Management, it's easy to see all of the benefitsthat come with choosing 
high-efficiency motors.
<P>
RPM wants you, and all of Wisconsin's businesses, to save energy with high-efficiency motors. We give 
you information on the advantages of high-efficiency motors so that you can become a part of this effort to 
conserve energy in Wisconsin. Each time you buy a high-efficiency motor, you bring RPM closer to its 
most ambitious goal--80 percent of Wisconsin businesses using high-efficiency motors by 1997.
<H2>Energy efficiency made easier</H2>
<P>
More and more industrial and commercial facilities are switching to high-efficiency motors each year. 
RPM makes it easy for you to see the long-term benefits of energy efficiency. With RPM's tools you can 
see solid numbers that demonstrate the energy savings of high-efficiency motors, decide between repairing 
and replacing your motors, and choose the motor that will work the best for your situation.
<H2>More motors to choose from </H2>
<P>
Improvements in motor design, materials, manufacturing, and calibration have created a new generation of 
motors that are as much as 10 percent more efficient than standard motors. What's more, because high-
efficiency motors have more copper than standard motors, they are more durable. Using high-efficiency 
motors not only saves energy, it reduces your maintenance costs and downtime.
<P>
When it's time to replace a motor, you need to do it right away, with minimal downtime. Fortunately, most 
Wisconsin motor distributors now stock high-efficiency motors that are directly interchangeable with 
standard motors.
<P>
High-efficiency motors are now available from your Wisconsin distributor
as
<UL>
<LI>replacements for worn-out or failed motors
<LI>upgrades
<LI>original components of new equipment
</UL>

<H2>Quick motor decisions </H2>
<P>
When a motor fails, you can either repair the motor or replace it with a new motor. The cost of running a 
motor should be part of your equation when you're deciding between repairing and replacing a motor. In 
some cases, repairing a motor reduces its energy efficiency. This means that choosing to repair a motor 
may increase your energy costs.
<P>
PRM has developed a tool, called the <b>MotoRater Plus</b>, that can help you determine when to repair 
a motor and when to replace it with a new high-efficiency motor. Using MotoRater and other information 
from RPM, you can work with your motor distributor to make the decision that saves you the most.

<H2>High-efficiency motors pay off</H2>
<P>
Not only does the MotoRater Plus help you decide between repairing and replacing a motor, it also gives 
you solid numbers on how much energy you can save with high-efficiency motors. Keep the MotoRater 
Plus on hand to review your energy savings whenever you're planning to purchase a new motor.
<P>
You can also calculate a high-efficiency motor's payback period using the <b>MotorFacts</b> worksheet. 
It lets you calculate how long it will take for the energy savings of the high-efficiency motor to pay for its 
extra cost.
<P>
<b>MotorMaster</b> software is yet another way for you to get detailed information on the benefits of 
high-efficiency motors. Distributed by the U.S. Department of Energy, MotorMaster can calculate savings 
and payback based on your specific motor situation.
<H2>Responsible Power Management - Saving Energy Statewide</H2>
<P>
RPM, in cooperation with Wisconsin utilities, government organizations, and public-advocacy and 
business groups, is working to make energy efficiency an easy choice for industrial and commercial motor 
users. Through RPM, Wisconsin businesses are conserving energy. This helps delay the building of new 
power plants--and protects the environment, too.
<P>
You can learn more about high-efficiency motors and the tools RPM offers by calling your local utility or 
your RPM-participating motor dealer. You can also call the RPM program at <b>1-800-55-WI-RPM</b>

Public Opinion on Restructuring<BR>
10/12/95<BR>
ECW
<P>
--For Immediate Release--
<H1>Public Gains a Voice in the Debate Over Utility Regulation
</H1>

<H3>New report reveals public opinion on the rules governing electric
utilities</H3>

<P>
In the often heated debate among utilities and various advocacy
groups over how to change the way Wisconsin&#146;s utilities are
regulated, those most affected by the changes&#151;-the general
public&#151;-have been left out of the loop. But a new report
released by the Energy Center of Wisconsin is making those voices
heard loud and clear.
<P>
&#147;The study results show rich and diverse viewpoints coming
from the general public,&#148; says Mark Hanson, director of the
Center, a nonprofit energy-efficiency research organization that
was established by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin&#146;s
utilities, and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. &#147;Utility
customers have a lot to say about the advantages and disadvantages
of electric utility restructuring.&#148;
<P>
Although Wisconsin is considering revising the way it regulates
electric utilities, little information has been publicly available
on what people think about utility services and the potential
effects of utility deregulation. To provide this information for
the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, utilities, and anyone
interested in the restructuring debate, the Center conducted a
series of focus groups and in-depth interviews with members of
the general public. 
<P>
&#147;There are a lot of people making decisions on this issue,
and this report is a major source of public opinion for them,&#148;
says Ralph Prahl, Coordinator of Demand-Side Management Evaluation
and Research for the PSCW. He notes that groups in other states
who are facing similar questions about restructuring will be interested
in the results.
<P>
The study involved 13 focus groups and 14 in-depth interviews
with residential, commercial, and industrial customers around
Wisconsin. In all, 135 people participated, 95 of whom were residential
electric utility customers. Focus group results are always qualitative&#151;-they
do not show what percentage of the population has a particular
opinion. They can, however, illustrate the range of opinions that
are out there.
<P>
&#147;Although this wasn&#146;t a public opinion poll,&#148; says
Scott Pigg, a Center project manager who helped oversee the focus
group study, &#147;I think it gives us a good initial sense of
how the public feels about restructuring.&#148;
<P>
To generate in-depth discussions, focus-group moderators didn&#146;t
ask participants simply whether they favor or oppose restructuring.
Instead, they asked them to discuss experiences with their electric
utilities; what utility services they value most; what they know
of regulation and possible deregulation; how they feel about deregulation
in the telephone, cable television, and natural gas utility industries;
and what electric utility deregulation might mean for them and
other urban, rural, or business customers.
<P>
&#147;The public is not well aware of restructuring, but once
focus group participants got talking about the issues, they had
many insightful discussions,&#148; says Center project manager
John Peloza. &#147;Although participants expressed broad satisfaction
with their electric utility services, there was a wide range of
opinions on restructuring.&#148; 
<P>
Peloza also notes that people should review the report carefully
and then draw their own conclusions. <A HREF="exsums/index.html#Restructuring_Focus_Groups">Further information on the report.</A>

<P>
--For Immediate Release--
<P>
Perhaps you&#146;ve watched an office building at night, all of
its windows blazing until the cleaning crew gradually turns off
the lights a room at a time. Turning off those lights sooner could
save significant amounts of energy. In some buildings, that work
is done automatically. Devices called occupancy sensors switch
lights on when someone enters a room and then off not long after
they leave.
<P>
But, according to Madison Gas and Electric&#146;s Bob Criscione,
these and other energysaving devices such as modern florescent
lights aren&#146;t installed in new buildings nearly often enough.
One reason, he says, is that the people who design buildings often
aren&#146;t aware of the availability or the advantages of such
energy savers.
<P>
&#147;Not many architects know much as they would like to about
these technologies,&#148; Criscione says, &#147;which isn&#146;t
surprising since they tend to be generalists.&#148;
<P>
That, however, is starting to change. The American Institute of
Architects-Wisconsin (formerly the Wisconsin Society of Architects)
is working with the Wisconsin Center for DemandSide Research to
find ways to share information about energysaving technologies
with practicing architects and engineers. The Center is a nonprofit
organization that conducts research into ways to control the demand
for energy.
<P>
A first step was a &#147;Lighting Technologies&#148; workshop
the two organizations hosted September 21. Here more than 50 Wisconsin
architects and engineers learned not just about specific energysaving
lighting devices, but about sources of more information as well.
&#147;They are very interested in learning about and using these
kinds of devices,&#148; Criscione says.
<P>
The Center will host a second workshop--Designs for Productivity
and Profit--on Thursday, May 5 at the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee.
<P>
It is important, says Rich Hackner, a program manager at the Wisconsin
Center for DemandSide Research, to help people install energyefficient
devices when buildings are constructed rather than depend on retrofitting
them.
<P>
&#147;When you have to discard working devices for ones that are
more efficient, you can double your initial costs,&#148; Hackner
says. &#147;Installing the most costefficient equipment at the
start means you can save more money.&#148;

WCDSR (now ECW)
<P>
--For Immediate Release--
<P>
Wisconsin utilities and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
have won the 1994 DA/DSM <I>Monitor</I> Innovation Award for their
creation of the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research. These
awards, known as the &#147;Innies,&#148; are bestowed upon electric
and gas utilities and the companies that supply them for outstanding
contributions in the fields of distribution automation and demand-side
management.
<P>
Demand-side management--or DSM--concentrates on finding ways to
conserve energy or alter patterns of energy use. Such management
saves utility customers money. Customers save cash immediately
when they conserve energy or participate in utility incentive
programs. In the long-run they save when their rates stay low
because utilities are able to defer building new power plants.
<P>
 The Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research has two primary
functions. It conducts and coordinates DSM research. And it shares
DSM information through workshops, publications, a library and
a database.
<P>
&#147;This award recognizes that Wisconsin utilities and regulators
have voluntarily worked together to create a new model of research
and technology-transfer organization that reduces energy costs
for Wisconsin residents,&#148; says Shel Feldman, the Center&#146;s
executive director.
<P>
Before the Center was founded in 1990, Feldman says, utilities
and regulators in Wisconsin conducted completely independent DSM
research projects. Because the different firms weren&#146;t working
together, research results were often redundant, incompatible
or contradictory, which sometimes led to lengthy adversarial hearings.
To remedy these problems, the Center was formed as a nonpartisan
source of DSM energy information.

Efficient Irrigation<BR>
1/5/94<BR>
WCDSR (now ECW)
<P>
--For Immediate Release--
<P>
Wisconsin has an opportunity to capture a larger share of the
processed-vegetable market. Canneries--a major purchaser of Wisconsin's
crops--need vegetables to be delivered gradually so that everything
is processed while fresh. The state's sandy soil gives farmers
more control of the growing cycle by letting them vary--through
irrigation--the amount of water plants receive. This helps farmers
set their harvest dates.
<P>
But if Wisconsin farmers are going to compete with their out-of-state
counterparts, they have to irrigate efficiently. About 10 percent
of the average Wisconsin crop farm's expenses is for electricity
that powers irrigation systems. Wisconsin farmers could cut these
energy costs in half, University of Wisconsin-Madison agricultural
engineering professor Douglas Reinemann says.
<P>
Most farmers, however, are reluctant to risk under-irrigating,
since a small decrease in crop quality can reduce a farm's income
25 to 30 percent. &quot;If the crop is water-deficient, the value
is reduced considerably more than the cost of electricity to over-irrigate,&quot;
Reinemann explains.
<P>
Working with graduate student Rob Weileman, Reinemann is using
computer models to develop irrigation techniques and equipment
that preserve crop quality, yet save energy. This research is
sponsored by the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research, a
non-profit organization based in Madison that conducts research
into ways to use energy more efficiently. The research is partially
funded by Wisconsin Demand-Side Demonstrations, Inc.
<P>
One important step in the irrigation research, Reinemann says,
is to understand the relationship between the speed at which water
is applied to the ground and the speed at which it is lost through
evapotranspiration, which is the combination of evaporation and
transpiration from plant leaves.
<P>
The farmer has to balance the risk of wasting money on over-watering
against the risk of accidentally under-irrigating caused when
evapotranspiration rates are higher than predicted. Irrigating
fields slowly makes it harder to judge the proper irrigation rate.
&quot;But if you put in energy-conserving equipment, your application
rate actually can increase,&quot; Reinemann explains. &quot;The
faster you apply water, the less chance you have of running a
deficit.&quot;
<P>
The time of day at which farmers irrigate is also important to
saving money, he says. In many areas, electricity is cheaper in
the evening and at night. Reinemann and Weileman are using computer
models and data from Wisconsin farms to compare the times farmers
irrigate to the times when electricity costs are lowest. Although
farmers may irrigate around the clock during periods of drought,
there are other times when they could cut energy costs by simply
irrigating at a different time of day.
<P>
The researchers' computer models take into account such factors
as the efficiency of equipment, the time of day that farmers irrigate,
the cost of electricity at different times and utility incentive
programs.

<H1>Load Management Program Development Tool</H1>

<H3>Program for DOS computer</H3>

<P>
The Load Management Program Development Tool (PDT) is an easy-to-use
computerized questionnaire that evaluates electric cooling and
lighting load management strategies and technologies (LMSTs) to
help researchers plan their investigations. PDT steps beyond traditional
utility benefit/cost analyses by considering other relevant, noneconomic
issues such as customer acceptance, externalities, technical issues,
demand-side impact, and utility issues. Developed with support
from the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research, the tool is
designed to help utilities and regulatory agencies select electric
load management studies and pilot projects that are most likely
to be successful. 
<P>
PDT is simple, flexible, and largely self explanatory; it does
not require extensive computer knowledge. You begin by envisioning
any hypothetical building/LMST scenario (direct-load control in
a small retail building, for example), create a name (such as
DLC-retail), and then simply add that name to PDT&#146;s list
of <I>runs</I>. Each run represents a specific building type/LMST
pairing. You then select those runs from the list that you wish
to compare and answer the PDT questionnaire for each selected
run. Although the questionnaire is identical for every run, you
answer differently depending on the building/technology scenario
being considered. Each run, therefore, will effectively consist
of a unique pattern of answers, and PDT will rank the runs according
to these patterns. The rankings are designed to show which scenarios
are most promising for further study.
<P>
PDT is meant to be used as a supplementary research tool to help
plan research strategies &#150; it does not provide bottom-line
evaluations of load management options. Because PDT is a new,
relatively untested program, it is important to understand how
the results are generated before interpreting the value of those
results. This user manual describes how to use PDT and how it
works. It also shows how one might interpret its results, based
on a sample analysis.<HR>

<H1>W-DOD: The Wisconsin Demand-Side Options Database</H1>

<P>
A demand-side option is a choice a utility customer makes that
influences how much energy that customer uses. That choice usually
involves an &quot;end-use&quot; technology, such as a fluorescent
light bulb. Through W-DOD, you can quickly get reliable data on
end uses, sales of electricity for particular end-uses, and how
much an end-use contributes to peak demand.
<P>
W-DOD provides unbiased information on more than 220 currently
available end-use technologies. W-DOD helps you estimate savings,
conduct first-cut technology screening, and compare impacts across
technologies and end uses. W-DOD focuses on Wisconsin but offers
any utility or state valuable information.
<P>
W-DOD brings together information from the following sources:
<UL>
<LI>Wisconsin Public Service Commission plan filings
<LI>Wisconsin utility forecasting documents
<LI>utilities from outside Wisconsin
<LI>industry reports
</UL>

<P>
W-DOD links three databases that cover end-uses, sales profiles,
and peak demands, including:
<UL>
<LI>fuel types
<UL>
<LI>electricity
<LI>natural gas
</UL>

<LI>sectors
<UL>
<LI>residential: single and multi-family
<LI>agricultural: dairy and irrigation, other farms
<LI>commercial: segmented by building type
<LI>industrial: segmented by SIC code
</UL>

</UL>

<H3>End uses</H3>

<P>
For each end use, W-DOD establishes a base-case technology and
energy-saving options, then compares them. For each option, the
database describes
<UL>
<LI>installed cost
<LI>incremental cost
<LI>maintenance cost
<LI>lifetime
<LI>annual energy demand (kWh/yr)
<LI>energy savings
<LI>eligible population
<LI>current market penetration
</UL>

<P>
Many records provide a high, low, and best estimate for each value.
<P>
Look at a <A HREF="wdoduses.html">list of the end uses and DSM options</A>
currently included in W-DOD.
<P>
Look at an <A HREF="wdodrec.html">example</A> showing the contents
of the W-DOD record for one end-use technology option--compact fluorescent lamps.
<H3>Sales profiles</H3>

<P>
W-DOD shows the total sales of electricity by end use for each
sector, to help you determine an upper bound for a proposed program's
likely savings.
<H3>Peak demands</H3>

<P>
W-DOD displays information on electric demand by end use for the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. This can help
you assess the impact on peak loads of programs in a specific
end use and market segment.
<H3>Use the data with confidence</H3>

<P>
A Database Approval Group that includes experts from utilities,
the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, and ECW periodically
reviews the technology information for each sector. The group
also calls in manufacturers, other utility departments, and other
experts.
<P>
For end-use data, quality codes from one to five show the confidence
placed by the Database Approval Group on the estimates of energy
use, costs, and savings. A one means the estimates are based on
measured data from a sample designed to be representative. A five
means the estimates represent an educated guess. In addition,
each technology lists references, so you can judge how credible
the information is and how well it applies to your service territory.
<H3>Searching and downloading are easy and flexible</H3>

<P>
The database provides an easy-to-use online form that lets you
define your search as narrowly as you need. For example, you can
look for all technology options for space heating in an entire
sector, or you can narrow your search to find how a gas absorption
heat pump can affect energy use in a single family home.
<P>
You can download search results in Paradox and ASCII formats.
Load shapes for most base cases are available in Compass/Reload
format.
<P>
To call W-DOD, you'll need to use an IBM compatible computer with
PC Anywhere and a 9600 baud or faster modem.
<H3>Other databases also available with one phone call</H3>

<H4>Online catalog of library materials</H4>

<P>
When you call W-DOD, you'll also be able to look through the <A href="library.html">ECW Library</A>
catalog. The catalog lists more than 2,000 items, including monographs,
videos, papers, promotional materials, and journals.
<H4>Library of Commercial Cooling Loads</H4>

<P>
You can avoid having to run costly building simulations by requesting
data from the Center's library of cooling plant thermal loads.
You can search the characteristics of several types of commercial
buildings and can download load shapes in TIF format. To receive
the 15-minute cooling load data, you'll need to request a disk
from the Center. These cooling loads form part of the Center's
<A HREF="curdesc.html#Prj2111">Commercial Cooling Project</A>.
<H3>Licensing</H3>

<P>
Online access to W-DOD is available at no cost to Center members.
All others pay an initial license fee, then an annual fee.
<P>
The database is copyrighted. When you register, you'll need to
sign an agreement requiring that the database be used exclusively
by the license holder and not copied or distributed without permission.
Consultants working for Wisconsin utilities or state agencies
will be licensed to use it exclusively for that client.
<P>
Once you're registered, you'll receive instructions, the phone
number of the database, and your log-on name and password.
<H3>Statewide Technical and Economic Potential included with W-DOD
license</H3>

<P>
When you register to use W-DOD, you'll receive the <A HREF="exsums/index.html#STEP">Wisconsin Statewide Technical and Economic Potential report</A>.
This substantial report estimates the effects DSM programs could
achieve without economic restraints (the technical potential),
then sorts these estimates according to a societal benefit/cost
ratio (the economic potential). This information supplements W-DOD
by providing a more complex picture of DSM effects.

<I>Solar Today</I>, July/August 1996, p. 18-20.
<P>
Describes the PowerGuard roof tile made by PowerLight Corp.  The
PV panel sits on styrofoam insulation (R-10) on top of the roofing
membrane of a commercial building, thus protecting the membrane
from wear and weather.  By replacing roofing materials, the BIPV
approach avoids 15 to 35 percent of system costs; the layer of
styrofoam insulation provides an additional cost saving.

<P>
A summary of the Arthur D. Little study on BIPV.  The study found
that modules mounted on commercial roofs, with southern orientation
and latitude tilt, provide 35 percent more than curtainwall systems,
and 50 percent more during summer peak hours.  Nationally, the
threshold payback period required for significant market penetration
is four to five years.  Barriers to BIPV implementation include
the structure of commercial electric rates, lack of net metering
for residential customers, and lack of consideration of non-traditional
utility benefits, such as externalities, avoided transmission
and distribution costs, and capacity credits.

Describes a prototype house in Massachusetts built as part of
the PV:BONUS program.  The 4-bedroom, 3-bath, 2530 ft2 house was
factory-built in New Jersey by Fully Independent Residential Solar
Technology (FIRST).  It features passive solar design, ground
source cooling and preheating of ventilation air (with the Earth
Tube), and a 1920 watt grid-connected PV system built into the
roof.  The house cost $185,000 including $16,000 for the PV system,
which includes 16 modules, 8 batteries and power handling equipment.
 A comparable site-built house was $220,000.

<P>
The solar industry has long envisioned the integration of solar
photovoltaic (PV) panels into building design as an elegant way
to deliver electrical energy to buildings. The appeal of integrating
PV into building materials is that the structure itself becomes
an energy producer, providing some or all of the building's electrical
energy requirements. The cost of the PV panels is at least partially
offset by the savings realized from not purchasing the building
materials that the PV replaces. When PV power generation is combined
with high performance building products and conservation strategies,
fully sustainable building energy designs become possible. A fundamental
obstacle to the direct use of PV as a building product has been
that most module design philosophy has focused exclusively on
PV as a power generation source, rather than as a building material
capable of generating power. This has resulted in PV modules that
adequately serve energy production needs for remote power and
grid-connected systems, but are clumsy for use as building components.
What is needed are PV products designed to serve as both building
materials and power generation sources.

<LI> &#147;The Building Integration of Photovoltaics,&#148;
Strong, S.J. (Solar Design Associates, Inc., Harvard, MA; Erb,
E.R. pp. 30-34.
<P>
There are many advantages to the building integration of PV systems.
An architecturally clean, well-integrated system significantly
increases acceptance on the part of design professionals, building
owners and the public. In addition, building-integrated PV components
displace conventional building materials and labor, reducing the
installed cost of the PV system. With reduced installation costs,
improved aesthetics and all the benefits of distributed generation,
building-integrated PV systems are prime candidates for early
market penetration. Product development is proceeding in three
general areas: Integral roof modules; roofing tiles and shingles;
and integral modules for vertical facades. This paper addresses
the direct integration of PV elements into residential and commercial
buildings using built examples from the US, Europe and Japan.

<P>
<LI> &#147;Passive Benefits of Building Integrated Amorphous
Silicon Photovoltaics,&#148; A Paradis, Advanced Photovoltaic
System, Inc., Princeton, NJ, pp. 69-74.
<P>
Utilization of photovoltaics in conjunction with passive solar
design strategies greatly increases the benefits derived from
the inherent performance characteristics of the devices. Due to
the energetic utilization of the incident solar radiation and
the use of existing building systems (frame, panels, seals, etc.)
the previous cost performance ratio, with respect to the energy
conversion rate and the area relation ($/ft.2), will assume values
which are commensurate with existing building technologies and
are competitive in the building sector on a cost/value ratio with
other high efficiency glazing products. The function of photovoltaic
glass can be positively configured using traditional passive design
techniques to achieve near term if not immediate commercial viability.

Facade,&#148; Ossenbrink, H.A. (European Commission, Ispra (Italy));
Rigolini, L.; Chehab, O.; Venne, O. van der. pp. 770-773.
<P>
A large photovoltaic facade was retrofitted to an industrial building
complex of the Joint Research Centre. Amorphous Silicon technology
was chosen to cover the maximum possible area at a minimum of
costs. The a-Si Substrates are laminated within a double-glass
facade element. Total area of the facade is 770 m{sup 2}, probably
the largest PV facade presently in operation. Total power output
fed into the grid is approximately 25 kWp after stabilization.
Emphasis was put on the architectural design and the visualization
of the function of the system to a wider public by an interactive
user-display.

<LI> &#147;High Efficiency PV Roof Tiles with Static Concentrators,&#148;
S Bowden SR Wenham, MR Dickinson and MA Green, p. 774-777.
<P>
The use of static concentrators for rooftop PV modules provides
a level of concentration sufficient for significant cost reductions.
 The concentrator design involved two shallow troughs of silvered
plastic that reflect light toward bifacial solar cells.  A glass
plate covers the module and acts as rooftop material.  A prototype
1 kw array has been found to be 16 percent efficient, while reducing
the solar cell area four times.  Concentrator designs were created
with computer ray tracing, prototypes were manufactured and tested,
and a pilot production line has been set up at the University
of New South Wales.

<P>
In an attempt to promote the widespread introduction of photovoltaic
power generation systems, it is necessary to achieve utility sales
price-equivalent power generation costs through implemented system
cost reduction. For this purpose, photovoltaic modules integrated
with construction materials will be developed so that photovoltaic
power generation module costs and installation work expenses can
be substantially reduced by including them in the materials and
general construction work costs. The three types of modules integrated
with construction materials are: (1) photovoltaic modules integrating
with roofing materials; (2) photovoltaic modules integrated will
wall materials; and (3) photovoltaic flexible modules applicable
for construction materials.

<P>
Five contract teams are developing photovoltaic (PV) products
that will have a significant impact on building-integrated PV
systems. The product lines that these teams are pursuing include
roofing materials, building facade materials, PV integrated into
modular homes, ac-PV modules, and utility-dispatchable PV systems.
The objective of these efforts is to develop product and market
opportunities that can provide for the introduction of PV into
the buildings market sector at higher allowable installed systems
costs than conventional ground- or roof-mounted systems. Each
of the teams has a unique approach, and synergistic opportunities
among teams are beginning to emerge. This paper reviews the product
and market development efforts of these teams and describes the
links between the product efforts and parallel analytical work
to develop PV as a demand-side management option.

Developed by Flachglas Solartechnik of Cologne, Germany, the Optisol
window design incorporates PV cells attached to the glass, between
the panes of a multi-pane window.  Standard opaque silicon cells
are used, thus blocking out some light.  Light permeability can
be adjusted by changing the arrangement or density of cells on
the windows to match specific situations.  More than 15 buildings
in Europe have been equipped with Optisol windows, the largest

An integrated photovoltaic system for buildings has many advantages.
To realize building integration of photovoltaics, the authors
have initially designed a PV module integrated with a metal curtain
wall. PV modules are installed as spandrel panels and consist
of long and slender PV sub-modules. These sub-modules have an
encapsulated structure consisting of: glass, EVA, solar cells,
EVA, aluminum base plate. The authors also present initial PV
performance data from the experimental wall. In this wall, almost
the same maximum P{sub max} of 64 W/m{sup 2} was obtained and
the module temperature was approximately 10 C lower compared with
conventional superstrate-type PV modules which have 1.3 times
the solar cells of this module. Moreover, aesthetic requirements
for this module are discussed in this paper.

The authors have started to develop low cost photovoltaic modules
integrated with roofing materials for wooden houses. They made
a concept of the design for the modules using amorphous silicon
solar cells and produced test modules that consist of untempered
surface glass, solar cells, waterproof sheet, heat insulating
materials and base frames. They have primarily tested the distributed
pressure resistance as a building component. When applying a load
from the front surface side of the modules, a 3.6 mm deflection
at the center of the specimen under 300 kg/m{sup 2} load was observed,
which is equivalent to a snowfall of 1.2 meters. As a result,
they have finally confirmed that modules have enough structural
strength to be used as a roof panel. They also tested the impact
resistance of untempered surface glass by the testing method in
JIS3212. In this test, cracks could not be seen from a height
of 75 cm.

<P>
The designs and structures of a photovoltaic module to be installed
in a curtain wall were examined with the object of sharply reducing
PV power generation costs. As for the design, solar cells of different
colors were produced and an opinion survey of designers and other
construction-related persons was conducted. Renderings based on
color solar cells were prepared using computer graphics. In general,
the output of cells decreases for colors other than shades of
dark blue. However, there is a good possibility that greater importance
will be put on design, including color and surface condition,
than on output. In this case, the market share may expand and
as a result, the cost may drop. As for the structure, various
materials that can be used for a building-material-integrated-module
were investigated and methods to install PV modules into building
materials were examined. Moreover, experimental module samples
fitted with stainless steel sheets and aluminum-sash frames were
made.

Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is one of eleven utilities participating
in the first phase of the US Environmental Protection Agency's
(EPA) Photovoltaic Demand Side Management (PV-DSM) Program coordinated
by Ascension Technology Inc. (ATI). An extensive effort was made
by PG and E to install the nominal 10-kWac EPA Photovoltaic (PV)
system on a customer's building. Problems arose related to permitting,
code compliance, roofing materials, and solar access. As a result,
the design was modified slightly and the system was installed
on a PG and E-owned building in December 1993. Viability of roof-mounted
PV will require that the system installation be fully code compliant,
straightforward and routine. This paper identifies issues and
suggests solutions regarding the installation of utility-grade

Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (ECD) and United Solar Systems

modules that can replace conventional roofing materials and be
economically and aesthetically integrated into residential and
commercial buildings. The modules will be fabricated from high-efficiency
multi-junction a-Si alloy solar cells developed by ECD and United
Solar. These cells are produced on thin, flexible, stainless steel
substrates. Two types of products 1 ft by 10 ft overlapping PV
shingles and 1.3 ft by 20 ft PV roof panels are being developed
by United Solar and ECD, respectively. United Solar's shingle
type design uses a roof mounting procedures similar to those used
with conventional asphalt shingles, while ECD's PV panel uses
mounting procedures conforming to metal roof systems. Thus, they
can be installed on roof sheathings, replacing ordinary shingles
or metal roofing panels, on a standard wood roof construction.

An extensive utilization of photovoltaics for future electricity
generation and for hybrid generation of electricity and thermal
energy is possible, when PV-panels are designed to become a part
of the building envelope itself. Large areas are available, since
roofs and facades are perfectly suited for solar energy conversion.
Atlantis Energy Ltd. has developed special PV-generators which
fulfill at the same time the functions and requirements of conventional
building elements. In the context of different R and D projects
funded by the Swiss government to implement a series of typical
building integrated photovoltaic systems, Atlantis Energy Ltd
was entrusted to design and build various hybrid building integrated
PV-power plants, four of which are described in this paper.

<LI> &#147;Optimizing Roof-integrated Photovoltaics: A Case
Study of the PowerGuard Roofing Tile,&#148; Dinwoodie, T.L. (PowerLight
Corp., Berkeley, CA; Shugar, D.S. pp. 1004-1007.
<P>
This paper describes the development and implementation of a building-integrated
photovoltaic (PV) roofing tile system that provides grid-connected
electric power to buildings. The PV roofing tile system, together
with waterproof membrane, insulation, and electrical interconnection,
is called PowerGuard{trademark}. PowerGuard is one of the first
PV roofing systems for flat and moderately-sloped commercial buildings
that replaces conventional roof materials without requiring membrane
penetrations and mechanical fastening to building structures.
When evaluated as a PV system, the building integration reduces
the cost of a PowerGuard system by 14% to 26% rather than incurring
a structural mounting cost of 18% to 22 % to conventionally fasten
the system. Data are reported from a 3.0 kW PowerGuard prototype
operating in Folsom, California. PowerLight Corporation supplied
the system using large-area amorphous silicon modules manufactured
by Advanced Photovoltaic Systems, Inc. Performance data indicates
the system is exceeding contractual requirements. Sensitivity
analysis, based upon performance, installed costs, and supplier
data, indicates (1) a marginal economic advantage to tilting the
PV array; (2) a marginal economic impact of increased PV efficiency;
and (3) economies-of-scale which make PowerGuard systems economical
today for commercial customers in sunny areas who pay high electricity
rates.

There are some aspects of PV systems which must be carefully considered
in the detail design stage. These are a consequence of the nature
of the PV conversion (i.e. that the efficiency reduces with increasing
temperature), of the requirements of the building envelope (i.e.
weatherability) and safety requirements (i.e. high voltage DC
systems). This paper reports on a program to design, test and
commercialize a system within these constraints. The concept was
tested in full scale prototype in the indoor solar simulator at
the University in Cardiff, both for operational performance and
for durability and weatherability. A first installation has just
been completed in Oxford UK.

In the Netherlands, building integrated PV roofs were tested in
a testing lab for safety, durability, watertightness and moisture
regulation, fire resistance, and noise protection.  The roof design
tested consisted of an aluminum framework holding laminated PV
modules, similar to a greenhouse roof.  Results indicate that
the design can be guaranteed for more than five years, and a lifetime
of more than 10 years is feasible.   PV roofs are fire resistant.
 Water infiltration must be controlled at the seams between modules,
and moisture under the panels must be controlled with air-tight
construction.  Further tests are planned for electrical safety.

peak output of the system was 2.24 kW, or 75 percent of the nominal
module rating.  Night-time power purchases ranged from 400 to
700 kWh per month, with lower use in the summer.  Summer air conditioning
increased daytime power purchases.

types of buildings it has been further demonstrated: pleasing
architectural appearance of PV-installations; the techno-economical
viability of the cogeneration of electric and thermal energy;
the cost reduction potential of building integrated PV-systems;
the improved and favorable energy pay-back time for the photovoltaic

BIPV design should take into account building power demand and
use.  The design process must also involve a team with both architectural

This paper presents the findings from the EC DG XII research project
to test a PV facade for thermal and energy outputs under UK climate
conditions.  The module design consisted of high efficiency mono-crystalline
cells between two panes of clear glass, bonded together with resin.
 The cells were spaced to allow some light to penetrate the glass,
with heat recovery in the gap behind the glass.  Cell efficiency
was found to drop linearly with temperature increases, at 0.145
W / &#186;C, thus falling from 15.8% at 25 &#186;C to 12% at 80
&#186;C, or from 32 to 24 watts output per module.  Heat recovery
significantly increases system efficiency.  The combined heat
and power efficiency in the winter was 33.2% compared to 11.7%
electrical efficiency.

&#147;One of the earliest publications which looked at this emerging
technology, this is a library of information on realised and planned
PV in buildings projects.  Projects are presented visually with
at least  one illustration and usually other drawings or close-ups
showing particular features.  A brief text accompanies each one,
in four languages.  The multi-lingual theme is continued in the
technical section at the back of the book, which considers in
more detail than the Greenpeace booklet the PV system and its
components.&#148;

&#147;This book is the result of the international design competition
which served to attract the attention of the architectural community
to PV.  The volume is filled with the winning ideas from the competition
in pictorial form.  These ideas have come from both professional
architects and students.&#148;

&#147;This booklet, published by Greenpeace to kick off their
new solar campaign, serves as and introduction to using PV in
commercial buildings.  It is primarily aimed at architects, their
clients and building owners and developers.  Its intention is
to show the varied and versatile uses to which PV cladding can
be put, as well as highlighting its contribution to reducing CO2
emissions.  It discusses environmental issues, the solar resource
electricity supply and demand, compatibility of materials, case
studies of existing buildings and some basic technical information
on PV technology.&#148;

&#147;This maxibrochure looks at the potential impact photovoltaic
(PV) technology could have, in a European context, for generating
electricity in the future. It looks at common methods of implementation
including rural electrification, grid connection, etc. and the
technologies which are now in use. These include PV cells, PV
modules and arrays, batteries, battery charge controls and inverters.
Other issues considered are system performance and sizing, economics
and future trends. As with all maxibrochures the topic is illustrated
with case studies. In this case 18 installations throughout Europe
have been featured.&#148;

<P>
&#147;To begin to achieve the potential for BIPV systems, research
is needed to define the appropriate match of PV systems to energy
end-uses in the commercial building sector.  This report presents
preliminary findings for a technical assessment of several alternate
paths to integrate PV with building energy systems.&#148;  The
findings discuss using DC output directly for HVAC applications.

In a study for NREL, Arthur D. Little used computer modeling to
determine optimum BIPV configurations based on building design,
location, building function (residence, office, retail), and type
of system.  The study also discussed barriers to market acceptance
of BIPV systems.  Peak pricing must be available for commercial
users, creating a higher value for daytime generation by PV. 
Other benefits of PV systems, such as environmental externality
benefits, deferred costs from transmission and distribution, and
capacity credits should be included in cost accounting.  For residential
systems with low daytime demand, net metering must be available
at a retail rate.  The study determined that the threshold payback
period required for significant market penetration of BIPV systems
is four to five years.  Current cost-effective niche markets for
BIPV systems include strained areas of the utility grid or selected
sloped glazing and skylight systems where premium materials credits
are combined with optimal PV performance.

Photovoltaic (solar electric) modules are clean, safe and efficient
devices that have long been considered a logical material for
use in buildings. Recent technological advances have made PVs
suitable for direct integration into building construction. PV
module size, cost, appearance and reliability have advanced to
the point where they can function within the architectural parameters
of conventional building materials. A building essentially provides
free land and structural support for a PV module, and the module
in turn displaces standard building components. This report identifies
the highest-value applications for PVs in buildings. These systems
should be the first markets for BIPV products in the commercial
buildings, and should remain an important high-end market for
the foreseeable future.

Under this four-year PV:BONUS Program, ECD and United Solar are
developing and demonstrating two new lightweight flexible building
integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) modules specifically designed as
exact replacements for conventional asphalt shingles and standing
seam metal roofing. These modules can be economically and aesthetically
integrated into new residential and commercial buildings, and
address the even larger roofing replacement market. The modules
are designed to be installed by roofing contractors without special
training which minimizes the installation and balance of system
costs. The modules will be fabricated from high-efficiency, multiple-junction
a-Si alloy solar cells developed by ECD and United Solar. Under
the Phase I Program, which ended in March 1994, we developed two
different concept designs for rooftop PV modules: (1) the United
Solar overlapping (asphalt shingle replacement) shingle-type modules
and (2) the ECD metal roof-type modules. We also developed a plan
for fabricating, testing and demonstrating these modules. Candidate
demonstration sites for our rooftop PV modules were identified
and preliminary engineering designs for these demonstrations were
developed; a marketing study plan was also developed. The major
objectives of the Phase II Program, which started in June 1994
was (1) to develop, test, and qualify these new rooftop modules;
(2) to develop mechanical and electrical engineering specifications
for the demonstration projects; and (3) to develop a marketing/commercialization
plan.

<H1>Sample Record from W-DOD End Use Database</H1>
<P>
The records for each technology included in the W-DOD end-use
database contain a large amount of information, so it's not feasable to 
present an actual record as a scanned image. Instead, we describe the contents
of a sample record below.

<H2><A NAME="Components">Components of a Record</A></H2>

<P>
Each record has the components listed below. Under each component
you will find the sample data along with some explanation, as needed.
If you have any questions, please <A HREF="wdod.html#Orderingplace">contact ECW</A>.

Each record has descriptive information in its header block, as
shown below. This example is for compact fluorescent lamps used
in single family homes in the residential sector.

<P>
Version (of W-DOD): #1.06<BR>
End Use: Lighting<BR>
Technology: Compact Fluorescent Lamps<BR>
Segment: Single Family<BR>
Vintage: -- (applies to base technologies only: indicates if baseline
figures are for &quot;new&quot; or &quot;existing&quot; stock)
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Base">Base ID#</A></H2>

<P>
Each base-case technology is identified by a Base ID number. Each
record then includes the Base ID number for the base-case technology
that might be replaced or improved by the technical option being
considered. For example, the base-case technology for the Compact Fluorescent
Lamp, LT-01, is a standard incandescent bulb, LT-B01-SF.
<P>
Base ID#: LT-B01-SF

<H2><A NAME="Scenario">Scenario Estimate</A></H2>

<P>
For each technology, data are provided for three different scenarios:
a &quot;best&quot; estimate, a high estimate, and a low estimate. The best estimate represents the most likely value, while the
high and low estimates provide a likely range.
<P>
For each of the three estimates for each data item, we provide
a Data Quality Code, which indicates the confidence we place on
the value provided.  It ranges from 1 (based on measured data)
to 5 (based on the best estimate of an advisory committee).  In
the example below, the Data Quality Code is indicated in parentheses
after the value, for example:  $10/unit (DQC=2).
