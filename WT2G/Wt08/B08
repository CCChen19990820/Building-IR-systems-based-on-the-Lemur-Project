<p>
Editor's Foreword: This FAQ is geared at improving the performance of
watercooled VWs based on the Golf Chassis (A1-A3: Golf I/Rabbit, Golf
II &amp; III, Sciroccos, Corrados, Jettas, Ventos, Convertibles) using
predominantly the "1600 type" and larger 4 cylinder engine block and
the new VR6 2.8/2.9l engine. Because of this FAQ's origine, most
improvements are aimed at the US/Canadian market. The above cars also
share many components with Dashers/Passats/Fox's (e.g., engines),
though they differ in many other aspects such as suspension and
exhaust system. Some of these cars may actually have more in common
with Audis.

<p>
Performance improvements encompasses a wide field of subjects, most
commonly referred to in the context of increasing power and improving
handling. This FAQ intends to go beyond these traditional meanings and
include changes that improve upon the stock design. Performance often
is achieved at the expense of something else often not mentioned with
the advertised component such as fuel consumption, harsher ride or
noise. This FAQ intends to reveal some of these as well.

<p>
One of the things to keep in mind is cost. In some cases the
improvements will costs as much as a new stock part from VW, but in
other cases it costs more. Generally you will never recover the cost
of these improvements. Unlike real estate, most cars are not
investments and therefore the reason for spending money is for pure
pleasure. For that reason, you need to make a decision on whether it
is worth it to you for the amount of time you want to keep the car.
Also, it makes little sense to buy the most expensive suspension
system if your engine is about to blow. Fix the rest first perhaps
with better components.

<p>
Not covered in this FAQ are the engines/fuel systems available outside
North America such as engines less than 1500 cc and carburetors/monothrottle 
FI systems.

<p>
Another good thing to keep in mind is: "Speed costs money, how fast
can you afford to go?" [?]


<p>
Q:I want to go faster? Where should I start?
A:Yourself. Most people only utilizes a small portion of their car's
  capabilities, and often do not know how the car handles under
  emergency conditions. Almost EVERYONE can benefit by taking a
  performance "Driving School" from one of the local clubs (e.g.
  SCCA, ~1/2 day, inexpensive, fun) or from a performance driving
  school (e.g. Skip Barber, Bob Bondurant, etc, expensive, fun). It
  is probably the biggest single improvement you can make and it's a
  skill you take with you no matter what car you are driving.. In
  every day driving it may make the difference between an accident
  and avoiding one!

<p>
  The next question you need to ask yourself is *why* you want to
  improve your car's performance. Do you want to impress your
  friends? Do you want to blow away other cars on the street? Do you
  want to compete, and if so, what type of competition? There are all
  kinds of car competitions:  Autocross, road racing, rally,
  concours, drag race, and so on?

<p>
  Will you be using this car for your daily commute or will it be
  purely used for competitions?  Depending on what you want to do,
  you may want to follow a very different path to enhance
  performance.

<p>
  What runs well on a track may not be acceptable or barely drivable
  for a street car (clearance, noise, hard ride, rough idle, bent
  rims,  the law...). Additionally, if you want to race in a club,
  cars are categorized depending on their power and handling, and to
  what extent they have been modified.

<p>
  For example, it may be better to leave your car stock than to make
  certain modifications.  Most classing structures allow only certain
  modifications, and if you do somethign else, you'll be bumped to
  the next category.  For instance, in SCCA Solo II autocrossing,
  Stock-category cars must run on rims that are the same size as the
  originals.  If you go with a wider rim, you will have to run in the
  Street Prepared category.  There, you would also have to lower and
  stiffen your car and replace your entire intake system in order to
  be competitive.


<p>
Q:I'm interested in eventually changing from autox to obtain the SCCA
  Competition license on and do some amateur weekend racing?.
A:I'd suggest starting out in a Stock vehicle. An option, if you
  really intend to eventually go road racing, is to look for an
  inexpensive road racing vehicle like a Vee or an IT car, and run it
  as an autocrosser while learning; then when you're ready for SCCA
  racing school, you should already have a reliable, well understood
  vehicle in your possession. Note that it's *very* hard to learn to
  drive in a formula car.  People just starting in driving
  competitions should be in two-seat sedan-type cars -- things happen
  more slowly, and they can take passengers and ride as passengers
  with better drivers. Note that formula racing is also a lot more
  expensive.

<p>
Q:What type of car racing are available (for normal mortals) in the
  US?<BR>
A:The SCCA defined several types of racing, open to the "public":

<p>
  Solo I is a high speed event, using cars prepared to road racing
  safety standards; it covers both hill climbs and race track based
  events.  Solo I (and Solo II) are time trials; there is no wheel-towheel 
  action involved.

<p>
  Solo II is a moderate speed event; it corresponds roughly to what
  other clubs call autocross. Safety equipment is not mandated,
  except for roll bars in heavily prepared convertibles (stock
  convertibles do not require roll bars in Solo II.)


<p>
Q:What is autocross (Solo II)?<BR>
A:Autocrossing (or, Solo II) is timed racing in a controlled
  situation where the agility of your car, and your ability as a
  driver, are more important than raw horsepower. Autox courses are
  usually setup in large parking lots with orange traffic cones.
  Unless the course is pretty long, only one car is allowed on the
  course at any time, which means that there's no possibility of
  going fender-to-fender with another car. Cars are classed, either
  by the local group (if they're independent) or by the Sports Car
  Club of America (SCCA), according to their level of vehicle
  preparation/modification called categories (Stock, Street Prepared,
  Prepared and Modified, or S, SP, P, M) and by their performance
  characteristics, i.e., class. There are 9 stock classes from SS
  (Super Stock) down to H Stock, SP and M go from A-E, but P goes AF.


<p>
  There is a category that some SCCA regions are using called SM or
  Street Modified (aka "Open Street Prepared" in some regions). This
  is for cars that do not fit in Street Prepared but are not
  competitive for Prepared class. (Note that this is not a nationally
  recognized class).

<p>
  Stock class was originally intended to be a place for novice autoxers 
  to  "run what they bring", and many local clubs have special
  classes for novice competitors to compete in for their first year.
  The current situation for the Stock Category is that it has become
  BY FAR the most intense competition, followed by either Street
  Prepared or Modified (depending whether you look nationally or
  regionally).

<p>
  The two other categories are Prepared (mostly race-prepped
  production cars) and Modified (open wheel cars and production cars
  with major engine transplants, etc.). The preparation allowances
  for Stock Category are somewhat more liberal than one might guess:
  any front swaybar may be used, and adjustable suspensions are not
  required to be adjusted to factory specs. As an example, the VW GTI
  that I run typically is set to 2.25 degrees negative camber and
  3/16" toe out at the front. In addition, you need autocross tires
  to be really competitive, and these tires are worthless for any
  street use. Most serious competitors in Stock Category buy a second
  set of wheels and mount autocross tires. The above notwithstanding,
  autocross competition is amazingly challenging and fun, as long as
  you understand that you won't be winning any trophies until you get
  some "seat time". I highly recommend the activity.

<p>
  At the beginning of the autox season most clubs also hold novice
  driver and performance driving schools which teach you the basics
  (how to follow the course, how cars are  staged on the grid, how to
  be a course worker, safety issues, etc.).  All you need to compete
  in most places is a street-legal car that can pass a basic safety
  inspection and a valid drivers license; you're required to wear a
  helmet (Snell 75 or ANSI Z90.1b (1979) approved) when you race, but
  there are usually loaner helmets available for you to borrow when
  you're first getting started.

<p>
  There's an Internet-based group of autox-ers called "Team.Net" (the
  "dot" is pronounced) who have a mailing list and an ftp archive to
  promote discussion of autox-related issues.
  Send email to "autox-request@autox.team.net" or in case of failure,
  use autox-request@triumph.cs.utah.edu (the former hoosier address
  has been decommissioned) to be added to the list. Their URL for WWW
  access is: http://triumph.cs.utah.edu/team.net.html. They also have
  a fairly extensive set of archives, pictures and mpeg movies.

<p>
  Also, call the SCCA ((303) 694-7222) and ask for the Solo II
  contact person in your region; they should provide you this
  person's phone number, and you can call this person to find out
  when events are scheduled.

<p>
Q:What are the allowable mods for each auto-x category?
A:There are four major auto-x categories: Stock, Street Prepared,
  Prepared and Modified. It is relatively important to avoid
  spreading the misconception that the four categories are a linear
  progression -- they're not.  Modified is not for "production based
  cars that have been modified beyond Prepared allowances," because
  that suggests that Prepared is beyond SP, and Mod is beyond
  Prepared.  It's not so.  It's better to think that there are two
  progressions -- Stock -&gt; SP -&gt; Mod, and Stock -&gt; Prepared -&gt; Mod.
  I generally phrase the Modified description as "two for productionbased 
  cars that only barely resemble their original configuration."

<p>
Stock:<BR>
  Cars must run "as specified by the manufacturer," with the
  exception of specific allowances. These allowances include
  [jay.mitchell]:<BR>
1.The use of any front swaybar.<BR>
2.Any suspension adjustment IF the manufacturer makes provision for
  adjustment for non-competition purposes.
3.Any shock absorber that is does not change suspension geometry or
  alter the range of travel (i.e., must use original mounting
  position).  I [jay.mitchell] use Konis on my A2 VWs, and the
  Nationals-winning cars have all used Konis as well.
4.An aftermarket steering wheel within 1" total diameter of the stock
  wheel. Wheels with airbags may not be changed, and cars made after
  model year 1990 must retain the stock steering wheel.  &lt;Note: this
  allowance may be withdrawn soon&gt;.<BR>
5.Road wheels of the stock diameter and width with offset within +/-
  1/4" of stock. This means that wheels with 6mm less offset than
  stock are allowed, resulting in a track width increase of 1/2"
  For example, it allows wheels with 32mm offset on 8V GTIs and
  Jettas (stock is 14x6 with 38mm offset), widening the track by a
  total of 1/2".<BR>
6.Any brake lining material.<BR>
7.Certain engine "blueprinting" practices, although these are rapidly
  being phased out. Balancing and blueprinting is only allowed if
  done by the parts-bin technique; no machining is allowed. Cars
  model year '92 and newer may not overbore/balance, and all cars
  starting in 1/1/95 this is not allowed.
8.The use of any DOT-legal "street" tire. The hot setups are BFG COmp
  T/A R1s or Yokohama A008RSIIs, and these tires are stickier than
  pure racing rain tires were five years ago! [Jonathan Dove]:
9.Ignition timing must be within factory setting
10Can change the exhaust system behind catalytic converter (if
  equipped) or exhaust manifold.<BR>
11Allows the use of bolt in roll cages.

<p>
  Other than the above modifications, you have to leave your car
  pretty much as it was manufactured in Stock, including the original
  driver's seat, body trim (you could add non-aerodynamic appearance
  bits, but you could NOT remove original trim), battery location and
  size, except for loose  items, such as the jack and spare tire
  which may be removed.

<A NAME="4"><H2>Street Prepared:</H2></A>

<p>
(Basically the same as stock except for these)

<p>
Street Prepared was originally intended as an incremental step beyond
Stock prep levels. As it now stands, a really competitive Street
Prepared car may neither be street legal nor practical for street use.
(Note that older cars are subject to less stringent EPA/NHTSA
regulations and therefore may be street legal in SP class). Tires must
still be DOT legal. In addition to Stock allowances, Street Prepared
allows the following:

<p>
1.Replacement  or  modification of stock springs. Replacement  springs
  must  be  of the same type (coil, leaf, or torsion bar) and  in  the
  same  location,  as original, but the rate, free  length,  and  coil
  diameter may vary from stock.

<p>
2.Installation of camber plates in strut suspensions.

<p>
3.Installation  of  body stressbars. There are strict  limitations  on
  the  type  of "strut brace" that may be installed, but some  of  the
  most common ones (Neuspeed front bars, for example) are legal.

<p>
4.The use of any wheel size and/or offset.

<p>
5 The  use of any intake and/or exhaust system that will attach to the
  original,  unmodified engine, i.e., the cylinder  head  may  not  be
  mcahined or drilled to accept a non-stock manifold.

<p>
6 The alteration or removal of emission control devices.

<p>
7 The  installation  of  any fully padded and upholstered  driver  and
  front passenger seat.

<p>
8 The installation of any steering wheel.

<p>
9 The use of a limited slip differential with the same factory ratio.

<p>
10The  use  of any flywheel, clutch, pressure plate, etc.,  that  will
  bolt to the stock crankshaft.

<p>
11The  use of any ignition system, including a crank fire system on  a
  car not originally so equipped.

<p>
12Ignition timing can be set outside factory specs.

<A NAME="5"><H2>Prepared:</H2></A>

<p>
Prepared Category is structured around SCCA club racing preparation
allowances for Production and GT class race cars. Prepared cars
typically have all interior trim removed (not allowed in Stock or
Street Prepared), roll cages, full racing suspensions, highly modified
engines, and they can run on racing slicks. A list of allowances would
be far too long to itemize here, and you have to have both a Solo II
rulebook and the General Competition Rules to determine the legality
of any particular modification to a car.

<p>
  The following was supplied by Richard Welty:
  Production is a road race class; although stagnant for many years,
  there is now change occuring here.  the cars in production are
  substantially<BR>
  different from their road-going cousins.

<p>
  GT: these are generally tube framed cars with sheet metal that
  resembles a road going car; there are 5 classes, GT-1 through GT-5.
  GT-1 contains corvettes, camaros, etc., and GT-5 contains things
  like Minis, and there are various cars in between.

<p>
  Sports Racers: these are single-seat, closed fendered, special
  purpose race cars.  there are a number of subclasses which are
  quite different from each other: Sports 2000, C Sports Racer, D
  Sports Racer, Spec Racer, Shelby Can Am, and so forth...

<p>
  Formula Cars: these are the single seat, open fendered, special
  purpose race cars. like sports racers, there is a lot of variation
  in the subclasses, which include: Formula V (based on air cooled VW
  parts), Formula 440 (based on 2 stroke motors and CVTs), Formula
  Ford (based on 1600cc Ford motors), Formula Continental (a
  conglomeration of various older winged Formula cars), and Formula
  Atlantic.

<p>
  Showroom Stock: a class where theoretically stock vehicles of
  recent vintage come together and do experiments in clever,
  difficult to detect cheating.  Supposed to be cheap, but ends up
  being expensive.

<p>
  A more elaborate entry by Bob April: SCCA has a form of racing,
  Showroom Stock, that purports to be exactly that. Outside of a roll
  cage, fire extinguisher, and competition harness, the car is
  supposed to be dead stock.  Even the adjustments (such as front
  wheel camber) must be set to factory specs.  Cars must be
  relatively new.  In my experience (some years back) 1/3 of the cars
  were legal, 1/3 had fudges which probably didn't matter, and 1/3
  cheated like hell.  You can be in the first third (I was) and still
  have fun.  You get to race at places you see on TV (Watkins Glen,
  Road America, etc.) I drove the car to the track, put numbers on
  with contact paper, and had a ball.  In circa 50 races I had to get
  the car towed from the track three times (one head gasket, one
  destroyed clutch, one large hole in engine block with rod sticking
  out), although I also once drove an X1/9 back 400 miles in 3rd gear
  (only), towing a small trailer with race tires and tools.  The
  driver must join SCCA, have a routine physical, and have a helmet,
  firesuit, and gloves.  Figure $1000-$2000 to prepare car and
  driver.  Major maintenance costs are tires and bodywork, and you
  have some control over the latter.  Totalling the car is rare, but
  it happens.  Getting hurt is much rarer, but it happens.  You go
  through two weekends (schools) of supervised practice and mock
  races and get to enter Regional races.  Successfully complete these
  and you get to enter National races.  Once you have the license,
  you can show up in a Formula Atlantic (the worst safety flaw in the
  whole thing).

<p>
  Improved Touring: a class where battered, rusty sedans built
  between 1968 and about 5 years ago come to trade paint.  Everybody
  is sure that the guy who just beat him is cheating, but nobody can
  afford to post the tear down bond. loads of fun, actually, but
  watch out for Volvos from Hell.

<p>
  Improved Touring allows for  typical (wheels, bars, etc.) mods.
  The drawback is you'll work on the car, and not learn racing nearly
  as fast.  Be like a Formula 1 driver; just show up and drive.  For
  more info, call SCCA.  If you can't find the number, you don't have
  the proper attitude to do this; it takes a _lot_ of perseverance.

<p>
  American Sedan: Big bore version of Improved Touring; Five liter
  Mustangs, Camaros, and Firebirds trade paint.



<A NAME="6"><H2>Modified</H2></A>

<p>
Modified Category has five classes, including three intended primarily
for open wheel race cars and two for production based cars that have
been modified beyond Prepared allowances. In this class, the sky is
the limit (almost). In my region, we have two Datsun Z cars with Chevy
V8s and a heavily turbocharged Miata in Modified, as well as a
fiberglass GT-40 lookalike kit car. Popular Modified cars include
Formula Fords, Formula Vees, and F440s.

<p>
The SCCA publishes the Solo I and II Rules in a book that costs about
$10 (for nonmembers, less if you are a member). The rules are updated
annually and the current year's rules are available beginning in
January. The above descriptions are general and NOT comprehensive: if
you are contemplating modifications to your car for Solo competition,
I strongly recommend that you buy a rulebook. Happy conehunting!

Q:What are the some of the performance driving schools?
A:Some testimonials from Ed Priest:

<p>
  If you can afford it go to a Track Time driving school. Cost approx
  $500 for two days of instruction and time on the racing track of
  your choice. You learn a lot and it's a hell of a good time. I've
  gone twice at Road America and am going to take the class at Laguna
  Saca this fall.

<p>
  The cost is a lot less expensive then Skip Barber and the rest
  because you drive your own car - which is what I wanted anyway.
  It's really good to find out what your own car feels like and does
  at the limit. The good news is that most of the insurance companies
  cover you during the class for no extra charge.

<p>
  Comment from Mark Sirota:

<p>
  I've taken both TrackTime and the BMW/Skip Barber Advanced Driving
  School. I took TrackTime in 1988 and Skippy in 1987, so things may
  have changed -- but I think the two-day BMW/Skippy street-driving
  school is probably the best for anyone who has never done any real
  racing.  It's currently $975, but worth every penny (and if it
  saves you from one accident, it paid itself off).  Next time you
  buy a car, spend a thousand less on the car and a thousand more on
  the driver.  And you can take the gains with you into every car you
  drive.

<p>
  TrackTime and similar schools are great fun, and you can learn
  things, but not the sort of things that Skippy teaches.  Skippy is
  much more applicable knowledge, and just as much fun.  Courses
  taught on real racetracks are a blast, but are really only relevant
  if you're gonna be racing on real racetracks.

Q:Will performance equipment void my car warrantee?
A:It depends on what and how extensive you modify your car and
  whether the parts are street legal. It also depends on what
  country/province/state you live in. In the USA, car warrantees are
  not automatically voided if you use street legal (i.e., approved by
  the applicable authorities such as the EPA/CARB/NHTSA) components.
  For example, changing to Bilstein shocks will not void your
  warrantee and neither will changing your muffler to a Leistritz or
  Gillette muffler. Things become a bit more difficult with engine
  modifications.Your warranty is not voided unless the dealer can
  prove that your modification caused whatever damage your car has.
  However, it may be extremely difficult to convince them to do so,
  and more than likely they will not want to help you.

<STRONG>CHEMICALS</STRONG>

<p>
Q:What is Rain-X? Does it work?<BR>
A:It's a chemical to treat your windshield to repell water. Above
  certain speeds raindrops will just slide off the windshield making
  wipers almost redundant. This product is used on airplanes. Peoples
  experiences vary with this product. It works well on some
  windshields or types of glass (most VWs seem ok) not too well on
  others (for example, it will have no effect on headlights).  In all
  situations, it will only last for a couple of thousand miles.  Some
  have reported that it forms a haze on the wildshield. I believe
  that part of the trick to apply this product right is to start with
  a very clean windshield (use alcohol as a final degreaser), at
  temperature (18C or 70F) and use extremely clean soft non greasy
  cotton cloth.


<p>
Q:Can and should I use synthetic motor oils?
A:First have a look at the archive on this.  In short, synthetic
  motor oils are superior in all respect to mineral based oils.
  However, with regular oils being very good already, the chances of
  you experiencing engine failure because of oil viscosity breakdown
  or other factors have become extremely rare under normal driving
  conditions. Usually, the rest of the cars wears out first.

<p>
  However, under higher stress conditions, synthetic oils will
  provide you with better protection.  Because of their better flow
  properties, synthetics are also better at start up, better in
  colder climates, and consequently provide a bit more power
  (measurable, possibly not noticable).

<p>
  If you use a transverse engined car at a track for speed events (as
  opposed to a parking lot autocross), you may actually be in a
  corner long enough to slosh oil clean away from the pickup, with
  possible bad results (please don't ask how I know: [Editor: I did
  ask Bob April, and he managed to push a rod through his engine
  block. The failure was traced to inadequate lubrication due to hard
  acceleration. He was using Castrol 20W50 in his race prepped
  Scirocco]).  The real solution is to get a baffled oil pan, but
  synthetic oils will do better than dino oils in this situation.

<p>
  One of the major concerns with synthetic oils is compatibility with
  seals. The newer cars definitely have seals which are compatible,
  with older cars this is less certain. The general recommendation
  with oil change intervals is to remain with the car's
  recommendations. With current VWs this is every 7500 miles or 12
  000 km.

<p>
  The extra cost of synthetic oils is negligable  when compared to
  other vehicle operating costs including fuel, insurance,
  maintenance, and depreciation. Mobil claims that the superior
  engine protection, and reduced strain on  batteries and starters,
  synthetic oils will easily pay for itself over  the life of the
  car.


<p>
Q:Is synthetic oil compatible with other oils.
A:Here is a blurb from Mobil, and it is probably true for most other
  synthetic oil.

<p>
                Compatibility With Other Oils

<p>
  Mobil 1 is fully compatible with conventional oils.  The two types
  can be mixed with no adverse effects.  Mixing, however, will reduce
  the level of benefits Mobil 1 offers.
       Precautions for Mixing with other Sythetic Oils

<p>
  Mobil 1 should not be mixed with any other synthetic products or
  oil concentrates.  The chemistries could be incompatible which can
  lead to a dangerous reduction in lubricant performance.  When
  switching from other synthetics to Mobil 1, it is recommmended to
  flush the engine first with a conventional oil prior to the change.

<STRONG>REFERENCE MATERIAL</STRONG>

<p>
A nice contribution by Bob April [Edited]:

<p>
The following books have been worthwhile to me.  In general, they are
like a college education; after you have read them you will be better
positioned to make specific decisions.

<p>
"Volkswagen Water-Cooled, Front-Drive Performance Book" Greg Raven,
Available from US mailorder houses. Probably the most relevant book
for Water Cooled VWs. Note that Greg is on the net at
greg.ihr@kaiwan.com

<p>
"How to Make Your Car Handle", Fred Puhn.  Explains the basics of car
dynamics, why you would want to make certain modifications, and how to
do some of them. [Ed: This book is pretty old by now and except for
the "theoretical" issues, which are very good, may be a bit outdated.
There is however another book available by the same name but different
author that is more up to date. I have seen copies at better
bookstores and Auto parts "supermarkets"].

<p>
"Performance Handling, How to Make Your Car Handle, Techniques for the
1990s", Don Alexander, Motor Books International, Osceola, Wisconsion,
1991, ISBN # 0-87938-418-2. This book seems to be a modern day version
of the Fred Puhn's book though it lacks some of the "do-it-yourself"
procedures (e.g., how to adjust toe, how to make the tool).

<p>
"Prepare to Win", "Tune to Win", Carroll Smith.  After reading
"Prepare to Win" you will know how to modify your chassis safely, i.e.
why banging bolts in place with a hammer is bad, and what to do
instead.  You will also learn to recognize quality performance parts
as compared to cheap junk.  "Tune to Win" is the postgraduate follow
up to the Puhn book.  I never would have considered accelerating a
rear wheel drive car to get out of an oversteer situation.  Learn why
a Formula V race car has a rear roll bar where your car has an
_anti_roll bar.

<p>
"Racing Engine Preparation", Waddell Wilson and Steve Smith.  Old, and
discusses V-8s, but there's a lot of stuff you can use.  Waddell's
engines have been around Daytona many thousands of times.

<p>
"Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management", Charles Probst.
Incredibly clear descriptions of the systems, way too conservative in
describing and valuing modifications.

<p>
"Brake Handbook", Fred Puhn.  If you're going to do more than change
fluid and pads.

<STRONG>ENGINE</STRONG>

<p>
Q:How can I get more power out my VW?<BR>
A:Buy a VW with a VR6 engine :-&gt;. It's an FAQ that's worthy of a
  book, and that's probably where you should start. After you go
  through this FAQ to give you some general idea, look at the info
  archive under power upgrades:

<p>
  http://www.cis.ohio-<BR>
  state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/autos/vw/performance-faq/faq.html

<p>
  The actual archives are mirrored at a variety of locations also
  mentioned in that FAQ.


<p>
Following are a couple of old known modification which are easy &amp;
relatively inexpensive that will increase the power of the car. In
general, the older the car the more room for improvement. Newer VWs
have much less room for easy improvements because many of  the
components are already near optimal.<BR>
One easy upgrade path for older VWs is therefore to look at newer VW
(Audi) models, see what they did, and see if you can swap parts. For
example, older VWs have the restrictive exhaust systems, swapping it
with a large diameter one from a newer model (if possible) or using
the catalytic converter from an SLC will help.
Also be aware when buying "performance" components on their true
benefit. Usually the top horse power gain is quoted while ignoring the
rest of the power band.  Your car may have more top end (high RPMs)
while sacrificing power at the low end (low rpms) which is where most
street driving occurs. The over all effect may therefore be that the
car may actually feel slower off the line, but be great when passing
another car.

<p>
So first decide where you want to improve, then research whether the
component in question really achieves that. Also select performance
parts that fit in the stock position over those that do not. This is
probably more true for suspension components than engine components,
but is a good general rule to follow. Parts that deviate too much may
require extensive modifications, sacrifice reliability, make more
noise, or may even render you car unsafe.

<p>
In general: Reduce the exhaust backpressure (performance exhaust)
Advance the timing (recurved distributors, chips...) Improve
breathability (K&amp;N Filter, head port, throttle body, compressor) Add a
hotter cam Enlarge the engine (change head, pistons, crank) Replace
the engine with a more powerful one.

<p>
All cars: Use a K&amp;N Filtercharger air filter element (some will argue
whether this makes any difference). High end improves a bit. Corrados:
3 HP gain at top. Replacing the airbox with a filter at the end of the
air intake also provides some additional gain (but you'll also hear
more engine noise...).

<p>
Use synthetic oils (motor and transmission).

<p>
<STRONG>83-84 GTI:</STRONG><BR>
  Change throttle body with a bigger one (Audi?).

<p>
  [From Peter Tong]: You can get one from a later Audi 5000 of the
  aerodynamic body style.  I think 82 and up.  Another good donor car
  is the '85 Golf or a Golf that had CIS-lambda.  You have to
  seal/cap off a vacuum line coming off it, and in almost all cases
  transfer your throttle linkage from your '84 TB to the new TB.
  Just make sure that the newer throttle body has a screw adjustment
  for the idle speed.  You also want to purchase a really small l
  screw driver/flat bladed screwdriver bit to adjust the idle.  On
  the 84s the idle adjustment was a hex that was easily adjusted on
  the newer TBs its a screw and with the TB mounted on your current
  manifold its harder to adjust the idle.  You also want to make a
  plate to put between the new TB and your old manifold to smooth
  airflow (your 84 manifold has a TB opening  that doesn't match the
  newer larger TB).  Buy an old style TB gasket, and a newer style
  gasket, perhaps new 6mm allen bucket bolts to attach it,  and make
  the plate to go between it.  If you want a plate cheap just send me
  $5 and I'll send you my old one (I had my intake manifold ported
  and the opening opened up).<BR>
  BTW, even with a Fox manifold the TB is good for at most 4hp.


<p>
84-87 Scirocco (US):<BR>
  For the JH 1.8 big-valve engine, use a dual-outlet exhaust manifold
  from any early car up to '81, get the short TT's downpipe (retain
  cat) for 10 HP, with a 17% gain at 4200 rpm and more torque
  Optionally: replace exhaust system from the cat back (US$150) &amp;
  factory VW g-grind camshaft (Autotech, $99)

<p>
  [From Peter Tong]: What is the difference between the TT downpipe
  and the downpipe that come stock with the dual outlet manifold on
  earlier cars?

<p>
  The length is different.  The diameter is smaller.  The bends are
  slightly more abrupt in most cases (some aftermarket replacement
  downpipes aren't mandrel bent even with inner side radius' slightly
  pinched in).  On most of the earlier cars with cats the stock
  downpipes mated before the cat with a flexpipe.  The flexpipe
  doesn't hurt flow much but is of smaller diameter. Also the
  position of the collector on the stock pipe is such that it would
  help at higher rpm - the problem is the dp diameter is too small to
  support the flow at that rpm (this is from my experience).  In the
  end count on the stock dp getting really restrictive around 115hp.
  When I first put my 2.0 in and was really revving it - the back
  pressure from the stock dp combo was so much that I blew a nickel
  sized hole it it!  This happened even though I was running a 2"
  exhaust and supertrapp rear of the cat.  Kind of funny but it
  happened to seak out the weakest pt on my stock dp and took it out.
  The stock dps also have two welding methods that I've seen holding
  the  exhaust manifold flange mating surface.  One uses a small
  metal "brace" the other type is just welded to the pipe.  The TT
  downpipe is nicely made and has worked well on my car.  It is stiff
  in many ways compared with the stock system, and tends to transmit
  more vibrations than the stock system (perhaps due to the
  stiffness).  The collector joins about 2.5-3" before the cat and is
  2" diameter pipe.  Tubing is mandrel bent and the angles aren't
  quite as severe as on the stock dp.  Also you eliminate the
  flexpipe with the TT cat dp.  What did it do?  When I installed it
<UL>
  <LI> the midrange really improved. Top end also to a lesser degree.

</UL>
<p>
  As for actual #s for what they did on my car:
       40-60 in 3rd gear: 4.6s before and 4.3 after.  This tests 3k
  to 4.5k rpm.<BR>
       50-70 in 4th gear: 7.9s before and 7.5 after.  3rd is 1.29 and
  4th is .91.<BR>
       r&amp;p is 3.89.

<p>
  So you can see it improved the midrange by about a 6% average. Is
  it worth $115?  It is I guess - it depends on if you are a geek
  like I am at trying to extract as much out of your engine as
  possible.  As it is that pipe, the G-grind and the TT adjust cam
  sprocket are the only aftermarket items that were necessary for me
  to purchase.  Oh BTW, fuel economy should improve slightly as well.

<p>
Fox:<BR>
  Remove exhaust restrictor (see also further and EuroCar: April 89,
  Aug. 89, Dec. 89, Apr. 90, Aug. 90)

<p>
90-92 Passat (4 Cyl):<BR>
  Remove air-intake restrictor, APS Chip, cam. APS chip for
  automatics that is supposed to do wonders for low end and shift
  points. Applicable to all cars with 9A engine (inc. 16V GLI).

<p>
85-92 8VGolfs/Jettas:<BR>
  The biggest gain can be had with a better down pipe and exhaust
  system.

<p>
<STRONG>85 GTI:</STRONG><BR>
  Change ignition map by cutting wire #11?? on the ignition control
  unit and grounding #3 (which was connected to #11). Yields 2 HP
  additional, torque peak occurring at a lower rpm. See also 85-87
  GTI for additional power.

<p>
85-87 GTI: KE-Jetronics:<BR>
  Advance ignition idle timing to 12 degrees BTDC or until knock.
  (factory specifies 6 degrees +/- 2). Gains 5-8 HP with &gt;= 92 octane
  fuel, very noticeable at the low end. Note, it may reduce the life
  of your catalytic converter.

<p>
<STRONG>90-92 16V GTI/GLI:</STRONG><BR>
  Motronic Power chips from Autothority &amp; APS.

<p>
Corrado G60:<BR>
  Stage 1, 2 &amp; 3 chips/packages from APS &amp; Autothority (&amp; others).
  Stage 1/P-Chip: Chip swap, improves low end by torque 18%, high end
<PRE>
        by        ~5%. Gas consumption improves but you do need Super
        Unleaded.      One of the BEST improvements you can make to
        this car.
  Stage 2:  Pulley change, chip &amp; fuel pressur regulator (AT) or
        exhaust (APS) =&gt; Power boosted to 180 (APS) or 200 (AT).
        Noisy, too powerful for the car, APS is more drivable,
        AT's not CARB approved. Gas consumption near stock.
</PRE>
<p>
  Stage 3: Like Stage 2 but with a cam, affects mostly high end.

<p>
  Remove cold air snorkel (too restrictive) =&gt; 1-2 HP gain at the top
        end (Note: WAY too noisy).

<p>
  Use Neuspeeds Generation 2 system. It solves the airleak created by
<PRE>
        the idle stabilizer valve. This mod seems to work with most
        of the above mods as well and provides better boost under all
        conditions.

  Power chips available from both APS &amp; AutoThority &amp; others.

<p>
  Stage I/P-chip: Gain of 7-10 HP at the top end. Most people
<PRE>
        reported little or no gain. Some have complained that AT's
        chip seems to produce knock.
</PRE>

<p>
  Replace throttle body w/o internal air ramp (10% more airflow).
<PRE>
        This is nothing more than the European progressive TBody. It
        does make the low end a tad weaker, which, combined with
        other enhancements will make the car less jumpy.
</PRE>

<p>
  K&amp;N P-Flow filter. APS recommends the above 3 combined to produce
        the best effect  to produce an additional 30 HP.

<p>
  Remove cold air snorkels (too restrictive). Their technical name is
        "Helmholtz resonator", and it's indeed a sort of muffler.

<p>
  Get a new set of cams, such as those from Schrick. Note: Mostly
        improves the top end.

<p>
  Use VW Motorsport's Variable Inlet Manifold (VSR). See archive on
<PRE>
        this. An alleged gain of 30-50 HP at 3000 rpm! Expensive
        (2300US$), but chances are that certain shops may produce a
        low cost immitation.
</PRE>

<p>
  Buy a turbo charger kit. VW is about to release a Van called the
<PRE>
        Sharan that uses a 250Bhp Turbo VR6. Other turbos on the Vr6
        have produced around 300Bhp making the car virtually
        unmanagable.
</PRE>

<p>
  There are a few 3.1 liter conversions available. Not enough info on
        that as yet.

<p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably LOTS MORE...<BR>
Caveat: Most of the above are merely small fixes that do not require
replacement of a major engine component such as the cam or the exhaust
system, which is usually the next step towards major engine
improvements. Those enhancements require a lot more work and expertise
to install.

<p>
Caveat II: Most of the above improvements are approved by the air
resource boards for street legal use, but some are not (Stage II,
Corrado). Before you install any equipment, make sure that you
understand the full implications. Tampering with pollution control
equipment is a serious crime, punishable with a 20 000 US$ fine in
many states of the USA.

<p>
Q:What's a K&amp;N air filter?<BR>
A:It's a washable (i.e., reusable) air filter made out of an oiled
  cloth like material over a wire mesh matrix. It is supposed to let
  through more air while retaining the same filtering capabilities.
  More air =&gt; more power, especially at higher rpms.

<p>
  In practice however, the reviews have been mixed. Hot VWs (Dec 92)
  reported a 3-5 HP gain on the high end in a Jetta. Others have
  reported no difference or even a slight degrade in performance. My
  *speculation* is that some cars require to see some vacuum to get
  the right amount of fuel, kind-a like a choke (e.g., carbureted
  cars). The same is true with some FI cars (measure vacuum) while
  other FI cars measure air flow. By the way, a 3-5 HP difference is
  within normal daily variance of an engine because of external
  factors such as gas quality, viscosity of the oil, ambient temp,
  etc. You can probably gain as much from pumping up your tires
  harder to reduce rolling resistance (but increase wear).

<p>
  From Mark Sirota: I put a used K&amp;N on a flowbench against a couple
  of other filters, including both types of Bosch filters.  The used
  K&amp;N flowed FAR better than anything else I tried -- by a very
  significant difference.  So the K&amp;N filter alone is definitely an
  improvement, *if* the air filter is the most restrictive element in
  the system.  I have no idea if that's true.


<p>
Q:How do I service a K&amp;N air filter?<BR>
A:You can buy the K&amp;N chemicals (cleaner and reoiler) or you can use
  a detergent called Formula 409 (used for cleaning kitchens in the
  US) to save some money (the K&amp;N cleaner is rumored to be the same
  as Formula 409). You should always use their oil though. Also do
  not rinse the filter in hot water. It'll shrink the cloth.

<p>
Q:How do I keep my engine cool?<BR>
A:Keeping your engine sufficiently cool is needed for all the obvious
  reasons.  VW engines like to run hot, and are more efficient that
  way. However, under high stress or race conditions, the factory
  system may not be sufficient. If you run too hot your power is
  reduced due to engine knock.<BR>
  There are several ways to aleviate this problem: 1) Increase heat
  transfer with a different cooling fluid or wetting agent. 2)
  Increase the cooling capicity of your car with a larger radiator.
  The reason why I do not mention changing the thermostat to a lower
  temp one  is because it merely reduces the average operating temp
  (which may be too high), but does not change cooling capacity. In
  extreme conditions the temp rating on the thermostat is not going
  to matter because they will all be fully open. It is however a good
  idea to make sure that your thermostat still is capable of opening
  fully at the intended temp.

<p>
Q:How can I improve heat transfer/what are alternative coolant
  fluids?<BR>
A:Redline sells a "wetting" agent calleed "Water Wetter" as an
  additive that improves heat transfer. It comes in two forms solid
  (discontinued), which contains phosphates, and liquid w/o
  phosphates (OK). People who have used it can't tell any difference
  under normal driving conditions, but it does make a difference if
  the problem is that hot spots in the cooling system are causing
  localized boiling

<p>
  Under normal street use you will not see any change because the
  thermostat is regulating the temp. It's only when you exceed the
  capacity of your system and the thermostat is all the way open that
  the wetting agent will have an effect. The wetting agent is
  supposed to improve heat transfer by reducing surface tension. This
  is important near the head where the coolant my locally boil. The
  little gas bubbles however impede heat transfer, which in turn may
  lead to knocking and reduced engine performance. Redline claims it
  can reduce engine temp by as much as 30F (depending on the antifreeze
  /water ratio, for a 50% mix it's closer to 10F I think). The
  performance shop I bought it from said that its good insurance when
  your car is put under heavy duty (stuck in traffic on a hot day,
  making a desert run, autocross).

<p>
  Another issue  is that glycol raises the boiling point, but reduces
  heat capacity.  With Water Wetter, you can hopefully use less
  glycol, resulting in higher heat capacity.  You want to use as
  little glycol as you can while still avoiding boiling (and still
  getting enough lubrication for the water pump, which glycol
  provides).

<p>
  Note: In certain old high mileage cars, the Water Wetter  scavenges
  out some of the contamination in the cooling passages and  holds
  them in suspension in a way that resembles motor oil.  The stuff
  even "feels" like oil.  Redline said this was quite harmless
  otherwise, and I shouldn't have any problems with hoses or the
  like.  They said because it only happens in a few cars, they didn't
  feel justified in  putting out a warning notice (especially if it
  causes owners of cars with REAL problems to ignore it).

<p>
  An other alternative described in European Car (Oct 91) is to use
  !pure! propylene glycol that has a higher boiling point than
  ethylene glycol though worse heat transfer properties.
  [borowski@hpspkla.spk.HP.com] The higher power VW engines have a
  problem with pinging under heavy load. This is due to the coolant
  boiling inside the head. Coolant vapor is a very poor heat
  conductor. This loss of cooling causes hot spots to form on the
  combustion chamber side of the head, causing pinging. The propylene
  glycol does not boil, and this cools the hot spots better. Thus,
  pinging is avoided, and more power is available if the timing is
  set to take advantage of the reduced chance for pinging. The
  cooling system is NOT pressurized, but vented to boil residual
  moisture away (which lowers the boiling pt). A kit to make the
  switch is available from: MECA Cooling Company [See the first
  general FAQ for address]

<p>
Q:Do "Split Fire" (= name of a plug sold in the US, not a type of
  plug) plugs live up to their advertised claims?
A:Responses from the net &amp; tests by TT indicate: NO, they are
  actually worse than the recommended Bosch plugs. Note that VW
  recommends the use of tri- cathode Bosch plugs for some of their
  cars...so this split-fire idea is rather "old". Apparently it's
  covered with Techtonics "Amazing Dyno Stories: Parts to get and
  parts to forget".

<p>
  There's an article in the August 1994 issue of EC where they talk
  about ignition systems and specialty spark plugs. They interviewed
  Dr. Chris Jacobs of Jacobs Electronics. The gist of the article is
  that, cars with weak ignition systems get the most benifit form
  these special spark plugs (SplitFire, V-groove, etc.) However, the
  same cars perform better with stock plugs and an improved ignition
  system  than with the specialty plugs and the stock system. [Ed's
  Note] Most newer VWs have a pretty efficient ignition system, and
  may see little or no benefit from such plugs or an enhanced
  ignition system by Jacobs.


<p>
Q:What net wisdom exists on exhaust systems?
A:Gilette: Good balance for street and autocross &amp; last LONG. Some
  will debate that this is the best (stainless). OEM supplier to VW.
  Leistritz: Good balance for street and autocross. Galvanized. Note:
  Stock on VR6 Corrado &amp; Passats.

<p>
  Supertrapps: GREAT for road racing and autocrossing but way too
  loud for everyday life (rgolen@UMASSD.EDU)

<p>
  OEM: More recent VW mufflers have improved to the point that little
  can be done to improve them in street legal performance or
  durability. Also keep in mind that VW now offers lifetime warrantee
  on their replacement mufflers.

  Remus makes some interesting exhausts with dual cat-converters.
  Expensive though. Remus mufflers are easthetically pleasing and
  almost too nice to use as mufflers. Remus is much better known in
  Europe than the USA.

<p>
  Borla: Insufficient data. I believe New Dimensions is using their
  final muffler.

<p>
  Some of the performance shops now also make their own exhaust
  systems [e.g., EuroSport, Techtonics, AutoTech, Velocity Tuning]
  with galvanized or steel tubing and 3rd party mufflers such as
  DynoMax. The quality of these systems vary, and it's therefore hard
  to make a sweeping generalization. Some work well, others don't.
  Check around before you buy.

<p>
  Unless you drive a beater and don't really care, avoid Midas. Their
  mufflers are cheap, reduce power, don't always fit right and they
  only offer a life time warrantee on the mufflers and not on the
  tubes (which are expensive, and the first to go).

Q:Removing the restrictor in a VW Fox to get more power?
A:There is a steel doughnut going right before the cat.  This stock
  doughnut has a two inch (approx) hole in the center for the exhaust
  to flow thru.  It can be replaced with a doughnut with a 2 1/2"
  (approx) hole to make the exhaust breathe a bit easier.  Not a
  significant power increase, mind you. [mgm@royko.Chicago.COM (Marty

Q:What is the relationship between torque and horsepower?
A:

<p>
     RPM * torque(ft-lb)<BR>
HP=   ----------------------<BR>
     5252<BR>
  Anyone have the metric version? I am too lazy (i.e., kW = Nm * RPM
  / 60?)

<p>
Q:Should I remove the catalytic converter?
A:Not if you want to remain street legal, and unlike in the early
  70's, these devices have improved so much that the loss because of
  it has become minimal or in some cases removing the cat will rob
  you of power. Note: The Catalytic converter on the SLC is rumored
  to be one of the most free flowing of any VW, and will provide
  gains when used on a Passat (or possibly other cars). New
  Dimensions is toying around with this.

<p>
  Note: In the US there is 20 000 US$ fine for messing around with
  emmissions control equipment. Of course the chance of being caught
  is rather minimal.

<p>
Q:Are the performance chips interchangeable between cars with similar
  engines, e.g., VR6 Corrado and Passat?
A:NO, Almost all the chips are different, even within one model. For
  example, the 92-early 93 US Corrado VR6s have compatible CPUs and
  chips, but are not compatible with later (distributerless) VR6
  Corrados. The chips are ordered by the box number on the CPU and
  are not interchangable.

<p>
Q:Which performance chips are recommended for VWs?
A:See the archives on Performance improvements as well as the Wired
  article. The two most trusted companies for VWs chip makers are
  Neuspeed and AutoThority. There are some disputes that one is
  better than the other, but it's mostly a matter of compromises. In
  regards to SuperChips, their reputation has been tainted by some
  questionable claims and 300$ improvements that had nothing to do
  with reprogramming the chip (you get back the stock chip!). AMS is
  also trying to enter this market, but so far there is insufficient
  data on this.

Q:How can I improve night visibility/increase light output?
A:It all depends what you are starting from, and in what country you
  live. USA: Sealed beam units till 84 required, "aerodynamic"
  allowed thereafter but must still conform to a rather pointed
  spread. 3 DOT nipples for alignment required. Canada: Same as USA.
  Northern Canada has slightly different regulations. Europe: Sealed
  beams forbidden. Light is more evenly distributed. Some countries
  require yellow lights, and different settings for city, highway and
  hi-beam lights.

<p>
  Beware that whatever you do, you must NOT blind on coming traffic.
  Some of the suggestions below are actually illegal for street use
  in the US. However, judging from the large number of misaligned
  lights in the US, your "illegal" mods will be less blinding than a
  normal but badly aligned set of lights. However, oncoming traffic
  may automatically assume that you are blinding when they see more
  than 2 lights on at once (+ it may be illegal in some
  states/driving conditions). EuroCar had several articles on
  lighting in 91/92.

<p>
  To improve visibility, try the following:
<UL>
  <LI> Align your headlights. See Bentley or your local code for specs.
  I   usually go a tad higher than the specs w/o blinding.
  <LI> Change to halogen lights (yes, some of the sealed beam units are
  not even   halogen).<BR>
  <LI> Clean the inside of your non-sealed beam units with some alcohol
  on   some cotton/rag at the end of a wire/stick. (Pretty tricky.)
  <LI> Add fog lights (very wide, low, but not far reaching). Set up
  correctly,   fog lights DO NOT blind, per definition. Don't buy
  generic brands, but   minimally go for Bosch, Hella, Cibie and
  others.<BR>
  <LI> Add driving lights (narrow and far reaching). Set up according to
  specs   these DO blind, however, they can often be set up lower so
  that blinding   can be almost entirely eliminated. - Change to one
  of the non-sealed aftermarket units, which are usually the
  European style lamps.<BR>
  <LI> Change to the equivalent European "aero-style" units (e.g., A2
  Jetta).   These are available from a number of sources and have
  much better beam   characteristics than DOT approved lamps provide.
  Your ability to use them   will be a function of the level of
  detail your state motor vehicle   inspection requires. In NJ, they
  have to come out to pass inspection [Tom   Coradeschi].
  <LI> Change to poly ellipsoidal, high-energy, "DE" lights. This is the
  newest   technology in lighting technology, more commonly found on
  newer BMWs   (though BMW uses an arc lamp rather than halogen).
  EuroCar had several   articles about these in 91/92.
  <LI> Change the wattage of your bulbs. This is actually not always a
  good solution   because your lenses may crack because of heat buildup, 
  moisture accumulates faster, wiring may not be able to carry
  the load, may blind, may not fit in all non-sealed units [According
  to Andy, you cannot not put higher wattage lightbulbs into the
  stock North American light lenses.

</UL>
<p>
  [Unverified...jan]   The 70/90 Watt versions of the H4 can be
  bought at off-road places such as   Competition Limited, (313) 464-
  1458 according to Dilmore.   There are also 45/100W versions of the
  standard 45/65W lamps. Some lamps require you to trim a metal tab
  that would normally prevent their use for street cars.

<p>
  From Michael R. Kim: I've got 80W low beams on H4, and haven't had
  any problems being pulled over.  I drive with friends a lot, and
  ever since installing the lights, I've asked them about glare, for
  fear of getting a ticket.  They told me that since I've angled them
  down just a tad, they don't notice any more glare than a car with
  factory lighting.  Mind you, if you've ever seen one of those Ford
  F150 trucks, with their lighting, you'd question about proper light
  angling.  I've had the lights in now for almost 5 months now, and
  have yet to even get a flick of the high beams from someone else
  for blinding them with 80 W beams.  I would definetly recommend
  upgrading lights, it can do wonders for your driving, but PLEASE
  double check your alignment and light pattern before going off to
  test how well they work.


<p>
<STRONG>TRANSMISSION</STRONG>

<p>
Q:Should I change to a racing clutch?<BR>
A:In most cases a racing clutch ("4 puck") is really not needed for
  street or Autocross uses. VW clutches can easily handle well above
  stock power. For example, a 16V 210 mm GTi clutch is good to 160
  bhp. Furthermore, racing clutches are very harsh (like, all or
  nothing) and much stiffer to depress. One of the more agreeable
  changes is to use a stronger pressure plate with a stock clutch
  disc.

<p>
Q:What transmission fluid should I use (manual cars)? Why is it
  important for racing?<BR>
A:If you use a transverse engined car at a track for speed events (as
  opposed to a parking lot autocross), you may actually be in a
  corner long enough to slosh oil clean away from the pickup, with
  possible bad results (please don't ask how I know).  The real
  solution is to get a baffled oil pan, but synthetic oils will do
  better than dino oils in this situation.

<p>
  As far as I know, most/all water cooled VW transmissions require
  gear fluid with an API rating of GL-4 (MIL-2105). The recommended
  GEAR viscosity hovers around 80W, 75W-80 or 75W-90 Note that 75W-80
  GEAR oil is equivalent to 10W30 MOTOR oil, but it is NOT
  recommended to use motor oil in gear boxes, even though some
  Japanese cars do so any way (has to do with shear strength). GL-5
  oil is made to lubricate gears (like in a differential) and may
  cause premature wear on brass synchros.
  NOTE that GL-5 is recommended for the *differential* on some
  AUTOMATIC VWs and on some manual transmissions. However most VW
  *Manual* transmissions need GL-4. Check your user manual or VW.
  Quality of the gear oil makes a HUGE difference in shifting. I have
  personally tried Castrol (HORRIBLE), SWEPCO (Better), VW gear oil
  (good, I suspect that they use a synthetic in some cars), and
  Redline MTL (best so far). Others seem happy with Mobil 1,
  Synthoil, Spectro, etc. How these oil affect transmission life is
  unknown to me. Note that MTL is rated 75W80, while their newer
  product MT90 has a rating of 75W90 which may be closer to the
  required viscosity of your transmission.
  VW also sells synthetic transmission oil (at US$20/liter) which is
  probably one of the best oils to get.
  Most VW transmissions use somewhere around 2-2.5 liters of oil.
  Before you drain, make sure you have something to catch the oil (an
  old jumbo coffee can is perfect). Open the side fill hole first,
  because you'll have to fill it up to either the fill hole or
  BEYOND. You'll therefore either have a little bit leak out or 1/2
  liter gush out. To drain (the rest), unscrew 17 mm allen plug at
  the bottom of transmission. To fill, either unscrew speedometer
  cable or use the fill hole on the side. Some VWs require the level
  of the oil to be just so that some drips out of the fill hole,
  others (some A2 Golfs/Jettas) require an additional 1/2 liter on
  top of that. That's why it's a good idea to catch the old stuff and
  check the fill hole first.<BR>
  [NOTE: Some VW User's Manuals apparently do recommend GL-5 in some
  transmissions, so check first! blu@cellar.org seems to be doing ok
  with Redline GL-5 after 100kmiles in his car. However, Peter Tong
  had bad experiences with GL5: he could not get out of 3rd gear with
  GL-5 oil.]<BR>
  [NOTE: One recent posting by (Paul Keller) blames his transmission
  failure on MTL, and claims that Redline recommends MT90 only for
  VWs. At this point it is unclear to me whether MTL is to blame, and
  whether using MT90 would have made much of a difference. Keep in
  mind that he is one of two so far which blame Redline out of many
  who have had no problems so far.]<BR>
  TIP: Glue a small round magnet on the outside of the drain plug.
  They can be bought cheaply at electronics stores, and it will
  attract metal particles that may damage the transmission. Older VWs
  used to have magnetic drain plugs, but VW stopped using them for
  some reason.<BR>
  Some newer VW trannys now have this magnet BUILT in permanently.

<p>
Q:What's the difference between the normal wheel bearing grease and
  Spectro SPL grease?<BR>
A:The front bearings on VW's tend to take a lot more abuse than on
  other makes, so many people recommend that you use a synthetic like
  Spectro to help them last longer. However, there also seems to be
  some confusion on the matter: most normal drivers are easily able
  to get 100K mi. out of their front bearings. This is in contrast to
  racers, who may have to change bearings every race or two, and to
  GM products, which are supposed to have new bearings every 50K mi.

<STRONG>BRAKES</STRONG>

<p>
How to improve/vented/cross drilled/pads

<p>
Q:What and why vented rotors?<BR>
A:Braking converts motion into heat. Heat needs to be dissipated. The
  faster you can dissipate heat the better you can stop, and less
  fade. Vented rotors essentially have two parallel "discs" with an
  airspace in between to increase cooling. Many of the Kesley-Hayes
  non-vented front rotors can be replaced with vented ones and
  thinner pads without replacing calipers for a slight gain in
  braking power.

<p>
Q:Why cross drilled rotors?<BR>
A:Braking produces gasses, and cross drilling give the gasses a way
  to escape, thereby increasing contact pressure. In addition, a
  cross-drilled rotor now has more surface area, and thus cools down
  more quickly. Personally [Jan] I do not advice cross drilled rotors
  because of the increased likelihood of cracking. DO NOT CROSS DRILL
  ROTORS YOURSELF. It's usually done on an NC machine at calculated
  positions followed by stress relieving.

<p>
  The comments from people on driller rotors are that they improve
  braking under competitive situations, but only provide a marginal
  benefit under normal street use.  The also feel more uneven when
  you brake (esp. the slotted ones) and are also noisier (they
  "humm"). Note that cross drilling is actually banned for certain
  competitive events, so check before you invest. Cross drilled
  rotors will also wear out your pads in a big hurry.

<p>
  Another alternative to x-drilling rotors is to buy slotted or
  grooved rotors and pads.

<p>
Q:Is it worthwhile changing my rear drums to disc brakes?
A:For normal purposes: NO. For racing and other purposes, maybe.
  Considering the high cost of this swap and considering that only
  30% of all braking power comes from the rear, it is usually not
  worth the effort. Concentrate on the fronts instead.

<p>
Q:What are the benefits of steel braided brake lines?
A:The reports I have received is that it improves brake feel
  marginally (less expansion of the tubes) but that the steel is also
  subject to more corrosion.<BR>
  [According to Volney.Spalding@Corp.Sun.COM]: They are not
  recommended for street use. Reason: Lines are rigid and will not
  flex with the body as it turns and reacts to road imperfections--
  rubber hoses will. As a result, the lines can often get pinched and
  fail. Stainless lines are OK in racing applications because race
  cars are subject to constant inspections/bleeding/maintenance. If
  there is an alignment problem it will likely be discovered. Most
  people probably are not as disciplined in street applications
  making the this mod impractical. In addition, most steel braided
  brake lines do not pass the DOT tests and therefore technically
  illegal for street use.

<p>
Q:What pads should I use?<BR>
A:See the discussion in the technical FAQ and also in the archives.
  It is important to realize that "race pads" (e.g., Ferrodo, to some
  degree, REPCO Metal Masters) only work well when HOT, and are
  therefore not well suited for calm city driving. You WILL slide
  through your first intersection in the morning with these pads.
  Mintex SilverLine pads are between Repco MMs and stock pads. They
  may work fine for some cars, but I personally missed the initial
  bite too much in my G60 that I switched back to stock pads.

<p>
  Note that the company that makes both Repco and Mintex pads is
  currently in the process of reformulating their compounds.

<STRONG>TIRES/RIMS/SUSPENSION</STRONG>

<p>
Q:I want to improve the handling of my VW? Where should I start?
A:Start reading back issues of EuroCar &amp; VW Performance books. It all
  depends what you want and for what purpose (street, autocross,
  etc). In general people follow the following road to better
  handling: Tires and rims, shocks, sway bars,stress bars.

<p>
Tires &amp; Rims:<BR>
<HR>

<p>
  Probably the biggest single improvement you can make is by changing
  the stock tires, and in some cases the stock rims. It all depends
  how much money you have, and what you have as stock equipment. If
  you want to keep your original rims go to a stickier tire in the
  stock size. Next step up is a wider tire with a lower aspect ratio
  for the same rim, e.g., 165/80-13 to 175/70-13 (this is called plus
<STRONG>ZERO).</STRONG><BR>
  To make a more significant impact, you will have to change rims
  (but be aware that it may put you into a different auto-x
  category). Generally, you go with larger rims (in diameter) with
  lower profile tires (=&gt; less tire flex =&gt; better handling) and also
  with wider rims (=&gt; more sidewall rigidity) and wider tires (=&gt;
  larger contact patch on dry roads, more hydroplaning on wet). Most
  FWD VWs are made to be run with tires around 1816 mm circumference,
  so each time you go to another combination you try to stay within a
  few percent of this circumference so that your gear ratios and
  speedometer readings remain the same. Odd as it may seem, rims are
  still measured in inches eventhough the rest of the car is
  metric...<BR>
  The upgrade gategories are called PLUS ONE, PLUS TWO, PLUS THREE,
  and so on, with each "+" referring to an additional inch in rim
  diameter starting from a 13" rim as a base. Note therefore that
  many of the VWs you buy nowadays are already  at +1 or +2.

  Going from 165/80-13 to 205/50-15 will make an enormous difference,
  however going from 195/50-15 to 205/50-15 will provide less of an
  improvement (see other FAQ). There are also additional factors to
  take into account. The first is that tires can only be fitted on
  rims with certain rim width limts and secondly, there is a limit on
  how wide a rim AND tire will fit on your car to avoid rubbing with
  the struts/shocks and fenders. The last is that you also need to
  get a rim with the correct offset. These are all explained further
  below:  Also keep in mind that for certain competitive events,
  changing to different size rims may put you in a different class.

TIP: [From Roy Kao] DON'T SKIMP OUT ON CHEAPER TIRES!!  An investment
in good mags is useless with cheap tires.

Q:What is rim offset? [D="EinpressTiefe" or "ET" Value]
A:The distance between the rim's center line and its mounting
  surface. From the picture below it should be obvious why it's
  important to retain proper offset when you change rims: tire not
  centered properly affecting drivability (negative roll radius
  changes), bearing load, rubbing on the struts or wheel arches, etc.

<p>
Q:What is the proper tire inflation for my car for performance
  driving?<BR>
A:For performance driving things are a bit differently from normal
  inflation pressures because there the aim is to reduce tire flex
  and to adjust the over all handling characteristics of the car.
  Generally, in an autocross or a ralley you will be running at a
  much higher pressure than normal. One of the old tests is to put
  chalk marks on the side of the tires, go around the track, and
  check how much the tire has "rolled" under (i.e., how much flex
  caused you to scuff the sides of the tires).Note -- this only works
  on "street" tires.  The sidewalls on competition tires are just too
  stiff for the chalk technique to work -- you need to use a
  pyrometer and a stopwatch.

<p>
  where@maple.circa.ufl.edu on chalk:<BR>
  Typically speaking, If you run street tires when you autoX, you'll
  want to bump the pressures up from what you run on the street, but
  ONLY for the time you're racing. When your racing day is done,
  bleed the pressures back down to reasonable street pressures, and
  drive home.

<p>
  Many of the autoXers I've talked with run "race tires" while they
  race. They bring them in the trunk and take them home in the trunk,
  and only run them around the track. WHY? because these guys run
  racing slicks, and everyone knows that racing slicks will KILL you
  if you run them on the street and it decides to rain. If that is
  not enough, you can be written a citation by the police for running
  "bald<BR>
  tires" if you are caught running slicks on the road...

<p>
  Ok, now if you're still not sure how much pressure to run in your
  street tires, ask someone who has a nice (professional looking)
  AutoX car out at the track. There's some sort of formula relating
  to a set of chalk marks that you make on your tires. You "chalk the
  tires, make a run, and analyze the chalk marks". If you find
  someone who has raced several times, they'll usually be nice enough
  to explain it to you, and help you out.

<p>
  Contrary to what some may think, If you are just starting out
  autoXing, the veterans are actually VERY willing to help you out
  and explain things like tire pressures and driving techniques. Most
  of them would talk your head off if you wanted to listen that long,
  they're a really friendly bunch from what i've found. The rationale
  for explaining things to novices is to shorten the time that it
  takes to get the car tweaked, so that you can spend more time
  behind the wheel perfecting your driving technique. Afterall, it's
  driving technique that really makes the difference, They'll tell
  you that. :)

<p>
  fisk@cvdv99.mayo.edu (Tom Fisk | 751 Siebens | 6-4261):
  OK...there are several ways to determine proper tire pressures for
  autocross. The scientific way says that you run a few circuits and
  then check your tire temperatures.  The temperatures should be even
  from the outside, middle, and inside of the tires.  If the tire is
  warmer in the middle, then your tires are OVER-inflated.  Warmer on
  the edges means that they are UNDER-inflated.  If you get variation
  from one side to the other, than that means you could adjust  your
  camber (+ camber if the inside is warmer than the outside) and visaversa.


<p>
  For novice drivers in FWD cars on street tires, I would recommend
  starting at 40-45psi in the front and 30 in the rear.  With
  experience, this will change.  Novices need a little more up front
  than experienced drivers, because they always turn the wheel too
  far and never unwind properly on the way out of a corner.

<p>
Q:What are examples of proper tire inflation autoX?
A:Examples of pressures used:

<p>
  [Jeffrey M. Mayzurk] On my DSP Scirocco (2300 lb, 55/45
  distribution), I usually run with the fronts at around 38 and the
  rears at 30. This is plenty of pressure to keep the tires from
  rolling over, and I like theway it handles.

<p>
  jstulen@eis.dofasco.ca (James Stulen):
  I run an 84 Rabbit GTI (ok, it's not quite an SLC) with some mods,
  on  185/60/14 RE71S tires.  I use 36-38 in the front, some time as
  high as 40 if  they're scrubbing to much.  I use 26-30 in the back,
  any more and they just  don't 'work', very tail happy then.

<p>
  On the '87 GTI 16V with 218 or 206-compound BFG Comp T/A R1's, I
  ran 36 in front and 22 in back.  Note that these tires require MUCH
  lower pressure than street tires.


<p>
Q:How can adjust over/under-steer behavior of my car?
A:From Jeffrey M. Mayzurk and also the APS catalog:

<PRE>
More Understeer                      More Oversteer
(less oversteer)                     (less understeer)

decrease front tire pressure        increase front tire pressure
raise rear tire pressure            lower rear tire pressure
increase front swaybar diameter     increase rear swaybar diameter
decrease rear swaybar diameter      decrease front swaybar diameter
less front camber                   more front camber
increase rear camber                decrease rear camber
increase front shock stiffness      increase rear shock stiffness
decrease rear shock stiffness       decrease front shock stiffness
</PRE>

<p>
  (Note: 'camber' above refers to NEGATIVE camber.)

<p>
  BIG NOTE: The above refers to conventional wisdom. HOWEVER, A1 &amp; A2
  VWs benefit tremendously from a thicker front sway bar to reduce
  understeer due to camber changes. See the section on sway bars!


<p>
Q:My VW lifts its rear inner wheel in sharp turns. Is this normal?
A:Yes, all VWs do this. [From drbob27@aol.com (Drbob27)]
  The reason VWs do this is that VW minimizes front wheel drive
  understeer by making the rear roll stiffness much greater than the
  front.  When the car rolls, the back is so resistant it picks up
  the inside rear.  The sway bars (actually the ratio of front/rear
  roll stiffness from bars and springs) CAUSES the wheel to lift.
  Porsche 911s used to lift the inside front for the same reason
  (reversed).  It's one of the reasons people hold VWs in high esteem
  as responsive, while similar cars are cited for understeer. I used
  to race a Scirocco Showroom Stock.  In a corner, the mark of a
  truly excellent turn was to pick up the inside rear smoothly to 4-6
  inches and hold it there steadily through the turn.  Less
  competence showed if the wheel bobbed up and down.

<p>
Q:Are VW rims interchangeable?<BR>
A:Most VW rims are interchangeable, and it may provide for an
  inexpensive upgrade from you stock steel rims to used stock alloy
  rims of an other VW. The exception are the Corrado G60 and the SLC
  which both require a rim with minimum 15" diameter; the Jetta
  GLI/GTX 16V (and I think Passat)  require a minimum 14" rim, while
  all other VWs will take 13" rims.<BR>
  VW uses five distinct bolt patterns:<BR>
  5/180mm (?)  Early air-cooled<BR>
  4/130mmLate air-cooled<BR>
  5/130mm (?)  Transporter/Vanagon<BR>
  4/100mmWater-cooled<BR>
  4/100mmWater-cooled<BR>
  5/100mmVR6 models

<p>
  The standard rims will also work on any car with a 4-bolt 100mm
  hub.  These include Honda (some models), BMW (3-series, 2002...),
  Omni GLH, Mazda (Miata and possibly others), and any Audi 4-bolts
  before they switched to 108mm.

<p>
  NOTE: Check OFFSET and center opening before attempting swaps! VW
  hubs *MUST*BE*HUB-CENTRIC*. This means that the hub opening of the
  wheel must fit the wheel hub snugly enough to center the wheel.
<STRONG>THIS IS IMPORTANT!</STRONG>

<p>
  Note: The center hole of a Honda rim is too small to fit on some
  VWs, and the offset is wrong.

<p>
Q:What are the current preferred tire choices for VWs?
A:It depends on what you want from a tire...Performance? Long Life?
  Good dry cornering? Wet weather handling? Snow Tires? Race? There
  is no single tire that will give you everything.

<p>
  This list is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but just a very
  brief summary of people's top choices. It's primarily geared
  towards watercooled FWD VWs, and therefore may not be applicable to
  other types of cars.  For more info see the very lengthy

Comment from Mark Sirota:

<PRE>
     &gt;From: chrub@CAM.ORG (Chuck Rubin)
     &gt; Looking for some advice on tires for use in Autocross (Solo2)
     in Canada
     &gt; competition on my 1990 Corrado.  My friends are using Toyos,
     Yokos and
     &gt; RE71s on their CRX's and Civics but noone is racing a Corrado.
     My car's
     &gt; got Eibach springs and a Neuspeed rear antisway so it's quite
     stiff.

     The short answer is that what works well for one car generally
     seems to work well for other similar cars -- so since your
     friends are driving other front-drive sedan-type cars and their
     tires work well, they'll probably work well on your car too.

     Out here, the BFGoodrich Comp T/A R1 230-compound seems to be the
     tire to have.  That's officially the road racing compound, but
     this past week at the National Championships in Salina, I pretty
     much decided that they're all around better than the 226
     autocross compound, except perhaps on very short courses or in
     very cold weather.  The next choices are the BFG 226-compound, or
     the Yoko A008RSII.  I know that the Toyo is a very popular tire
     in Canada, but almost nobody uses it here.  It just can't hold a
     candle to the BFG and Yoko.  I don't know if you get a different
     version of it, or a different version of the Yoko and BFG, or
     what...

     Since your car is stiff, another possibility is the Hoosier
     Autocrosser. This is a very lightweight bias-ply tire, which has
     tread and is DOT- approved.  However, don't even think about
     using it on the street.  It is not very puncture-resistant (not
     much better than a slick), and won't last long.  It only works
     well on cars with good camber control (stiffening a production
     car is often good enough), and with wide wheels.  It drives
     *very* differently, being bias-ply -- you need large slip angles,
     but the thing really sticks in sweepers.  It's not as hot in
     transients.  You need much more steering lock and a lot more
     faith in the car, as well as the aforementioned stiff suspension
     and wide wheels.  The incredibly light weight also helps in the
     power department and on bumps.  I don't know if it is available
     in Canada, but you can try calling Tom Reichel at Mid-Atlantic
     Motorsport in Maryland.  Tell him I sent you.  His number is +1
     410 825 6003.

     I used to run my GTI and 914 on BFG's, and now run the Formula
     Ford on Hoosier slicks.

     Note from Ed: Check with the club's regulations on which tire
     sizes are acceptable for the group you want to run in. Often, to
     run in an auto-x stock class you need to stick with the stock
     sized rims, however you may change the tire sizes. In that case
     you want to get the widest and least tall tire (i.e., lowest
     aspect ratio) that fits. If you are allowed to change rims, then
     you want to get the rims with the smallest diameter but widest
     that will fit (top speed is not important in auto-x) with the
     widest and least tall tire. This will lower your center of
     gravity but also provide you with a better acceleration.
     Naturally, for street use and other types of racing you other
     wheel and tire combinations may be needed.
</PRE>

<p>
  It's also a good idea to have your tires shaven a bit to smooth out
  the outer shoulder.

<p>
  Another issue to consider with racing tires is what rim and tire
  size to get. For example, in stock auto-x class you have to use the
  same rim size as OEM, but you are free to use any size tire that
  will fit. For auto-x it is therefore recommended to get the
  smallest diameter tire that you can find. This will lower he car
  and provides a bit more low end torque on the road, tires that heat
  up quicker, less wheel/tire weight because top speed is not an
  issue. If you are racing in SP class, then the smallest (but widest
  rim) that will fit with the appropriate tires is what you want.


<p>
Q:What are "standard" (factory) tire sizes for my VW?
A:The following tires sizes (see the r.a FAQ for how to read these)
  result in equivalent circumferences and standard on most passenger
  VWs over the years. The implication of this list is that in
  principle (if you have clearance!) you could upgrade your tire/rims
  by traversing this list! The whole aim with changing to different
  tire sizes is to stay within a reasonable margin of the original
  tire diameter.

<p>
Q:How can I tell the characteristics of a tire by just looking at it?
A:This is not easy, but there are a few things you can tell just by
  looking at the tread pattern. Most performance dry street tires
  will have lots of big solid blocks (or almost no pattern at all,
  such as in slick racing tires, see A008). On some tires these
  blocks vary in size and that's mostly done to reduce certain noise
  harmonics. Directional or assymetric tires will have block patterns
  that are oriented in a particular way and that differ accross the
  width of the tire (typically you can infer the tire's direction of
  rotation on these tires, e.g., the new line of P0, RE71).

<p>
  To make these tires more drivable on wet roads, you will see one or
  more big channels along the circumference to funnel water away.
  Goodyear now markets this technology heavily, though Continental
  now claims they invented it first.

<p>
  To make tires behave under slippery conditions (snow, mud, ice),
  they will have small squigly cuts called "brushes" within the major
  tire blocks. (Obviously I am neglecting the tire compound here that
  is probably more important than the tread pattern).

<p>
  Most quality tires are made from a "segmented mold" which means
  that you will see mold marks running accross the width of the tread
  (othogonal to the direction of rotation). "Budget" tires still use
  old style molds where you have the whole tire made in two halves
  and you will see a mold line running along in the center of the
  tread.

<p>
  The shape of tires also differs between manufacturers. Some tires
  have a square cross section: |__| (e.g., Pirelli P600) while others
  use more rounding towards the tread: (__) (e.g., Michelin MXV).
  It's unclear which is better. The square profiles assumes that the
  tire is stiff enough not to flex too much, while the rounder
  profile assume that the tire will roll sideways under hard
  cornering and therefore these tires often have tread patterns on
  the side of the tires. It's unclear which works better in reality
  (though the above two examples should be used for comparison).


<p>
Q:Will wider tires help my performance?
A:There is no straight answer! There are really three main factors
  that determine handling (disregarding suspension changes for now):
<OL>
  <LI> Frictional coefficient between the tire and the road, 2) Contact
  patch size and geometry, 3) Tire sidewall stiffness. If you keep
  the frictional coefficient constant as well, you have two
  parameters to play with: Width and Sidewall stiffness. Wider tires
  will change the contact patch from an oval to a more elongated
  oval, which generally improves handling, but increases steering
  effort, and makes the car more prone to aquaplaning (hydroplaning)
  in wet weather and in snow it never gets to through the snow. In
  snow conditions the best way to go is small rims (13" for A1 &amp; A2)
  with a 165-175/70/13 tire on it.

</OL>
<p>
  However, another, perhaps more important factor is sidewall
  stiffness. The stiffer the sidewall, the less the tire will flex
  sideways which improves turning, transients, steering accuracy
  Therefore going from a 175/70-13 tire to a "plus 1" 185/60-14 or a
  "plus 2" 195/50-15 tire will elongate the contact patch, reduce the
  sidewall height ==&gt; increase side wall stiffness and therefore
  improve handling. However changing from 185/60 to a 195/60 may or
  may not do much good: The contact patch is more favorable but the
  sidewall is also increased in height ==&gt; more flex. Test by VW and
  EuroCar have shown that an A2 GTI with 185/60 tires handles about
  the same as one with 205/55. Note that they were using the same car
  for this test, with the same suspension. (VW sold the A2 GTIs with
  wider tires purely for looks and customer demand despite the fact
  that it did little or no good in handling). To make use of wider
  and lower profile tires the suspension needs to be matched to the
  tires.

<p>
  But there is more to it as well! Tires, even within one type &amp;
  size, may have different sidewall stiffness (e.g. HR vs VR), and
  compound! A softer compound will grip better, but wear faster..
  Wider rims make a big difference due to a better lateral support,
  effectively increasing sidewall stiffness. NEVER use 5.5" on a
  185/60 or wider tire; the wider the better, at least within reason.
  A 7" rim would probably be ideal for a 195/50R15 tire for the
  street.

<p>
  From Roy Kao: wider tires may make a marginal improvement in
  transient cornering responses, but how often do you make
  radicalattitude changes on the street?

<p>
  In summary [From Mark S]:<BR>
  Cost: worse<BR>
  Ride quality: worse<BR>
  Tramlining: worse<BR>
  Handling quickness: better<BR>
  Handling limits: better<BR>
  Safety in standing water, mud, or snow: worse
  Looks: better (imho)<BR>
  Steering feel: probably worse<BR>
  Braking: can't say for sure<BR>
  Power application: probably worse

<p>
  A lot of the above depend on tire choice, too.  Note that choice of
  tire will have a much much larger effect than changing wheel size
  on handling. Alignment also has a huge effect, as does tire
  pressure.


<p>
Q:What is a performance alignment?<BR>
A:A performance alignment means a  little more toe out than stock,
  for better turn in, and more negative camber than stock, for
  obvious reasons. I wouldn't recommend it.  Unless you plan to
  devote you life to autocross (and people do) you will not notice
  the  difference.

<p>
  This will however result in much quicker street tire wear so you
  will have to balance this with your desire for autocross. I would
  suggest getting everything else right before you start worrying
  about alignment though. However, call Eurotire for details about
  having a car aligned to Andy King's specs.  The mild neg. camber
  does not show up much on the tire edges.

<p>
  Note from Jan: this needs work. A performance set up can be
  achieved w/o sacrificing tire wear by increasing caster angle,
  which unfortunately is not adjustable on most VWs.

<p>
  See also the archives on alignment.

<p>
Q:What does toe-in, caster and camber mean and how do they affect the
  car's handling?<BR>
A:This is borrowed from the "alignment" archive:

<p>
<STRONG>CAMBER:</STRONG>

<p>
  The camber angle is the angle a tire makes with respect to a
  vertical line.

<p>
  Positive Camber = Tops of tires point outward. If you look at the
  front of the car you'd see:

<PRE>
                                        V
      FRONTAL VIEW             __  ( )  W ( )  __
                     Tire      \ \ ---------- / / Tire
                                --            --
</PRE>

<p>
  Too much positive camber ==&gt; Tires wear on the OUTside (away from
  the car) more than the inside.

<p>
  Negative Camber = Tops of tires point inward.
  Too much negative camber ==&gt; Tires wear on the INside more than the
  outside.

<p>
  Camber affects directional stability and tire wear. A difference
  between the front wheel camber settings will cause your car to pull
  to one side. I also believe it will cause torque steering to become
  more noticable. It is therefore very important to keep camber for
  BOTH tires as close as possible.

<p>
  Your car will also perform differently with different camber
  settings. For street use, follow manufacturer's setting, for race
  use, use more negative camber (basically so that the inboard tire
  will be flat on the road in sharp curves). Naturally, more negative
  camber will wear the insides of the  tires quicker.

<p>
  Note however that the terminology used is often very confusing,
  here is a sample (for either a GTI or Scirocco I think):

<p>
  &gt;--&lt;<BR>
  [Jan]<BR>
  &gt; Camber = -.17 to 0.83 Degrees; which seems to imply that they
  want  &gt; positive camber (tops pointing AWAY). That doesn't sound
  right.<BR>
  &gt; To make matter worse, in Greg Raven's book, when he talks about
  &gt; 2.5 Degree Camber he means NEGATIVE camber = /   \. Can someone
  please help<BR>
  &gt; me out with this one?

<p>
  [Mark]<BR>
  Right.  Negative camber helps cornering power and turn-in.  The
  reason that they recommend positive camber is to ensure understeer
  for the "average" driver.  At the end of last season, I had settled
  on about 2.2 degrees negative camber while I was autocrossing.
  &gt;--&lt;

<p>
  The rear camber is not normally adjustable on most FWD VWs.


<p>
<STRONG>TOE:</STRONG>

<p>
  Toe = distance between the front of the tires and their rears.
        Sometimes express by an angle instead.


<p>
  (Negative Toe) = Toe OUT = distance between the front of the tires
  &gt; rears If you were to look from the TOP:

<PRE>
                           Front
                       ================== Bumper
     TOP VIEW           __            __
               Tire     \ \          / / Tire
                         --          --
</PRE>

<p>
  (Positive Toe) = Toe IN = distance between the front of the tires &lt;
  rears

<p>
  Unlike the camber settings, the individual toe of each front wheel
  is not as critical (because of the steering mechanism), but the
  TOTAL toe is (Toe = distance rear - distance front of tire).
  Usually only one side is adjustable, which then results in the
  "crooked" steering wheel problem.

<p>
  For the rear wheels the individual toes are however important. If
  that's off, your car will be driving "side ways". But you do not
  have to worry about it because the rear toe is not adjustable on
  most watercooled FWD VWs (w/o special equipment).

<p>
  Too much toe in or toe out will also wear your tires prematurely.
  The wear pattern is called "feathering" and it will show up as  a
  slanted wear or zig-zag accross the tread of your tires. If you
  were to take a cross section, you'd see something like (a bit
  exagerated due to the limitations of this format):
<HR>
<PRE>
<STRONG>TIRE CROSS SECTION      / |_/ |_/ |_/ |_/ |</STRONG>
                              |                 |
</PRE>

<p>
  Also here things get a bit confusing:
  &gt;--&lt;<BR>
  [Jan]<BR>
  &gt; The specs for Toe are even more confusing: -15'+10' = -.25 + .17
  Degrees.<BR>
  &gt; I assume the "+" is used instead of a "+/-" which results in:
  &gt; -.25 to -.08 degrees, a slight toe in, which is more what I'd
  &gt; expect. (Greg Raven however recommends 1/8 inch [yes, inch] of
  toe OUT).

<p>
  [Mark]<BR>
  Right.  So negative is toe-in.  The only car on the market today
  that comes from the factory with toe-out is the Acura NSX.  Toe-out
  also helps turn-in, but does increase tire wear and gives the car a
  little bump steer.  It may also wander a bit on the highway.  I was
  running 1/8" (yes, inch) of toe-out during the autocross season,
  but now I'm running zero toe.

<p>
  The reason that toe is often given in inches is because it's much
  easier to measure that way.<BR>
  &gt;--&lt;

<p>
<STRONG>CASTER:</STRONG>

<p>
  Caster = The angle your wheels pivot about wrt to the vertical when
  you steer (= the angle of front struts/shocks wrt to the
  vertical?).<BR>
<PRE>
                   __

<p>
  Affects of caster: It keeps the wheels running in a straight line
  and causes them to straighten when coming out of a turn. Increasing
  caster also provides  better handling w/o the tire wear.

<p>
  Too much caster causes hard steering, too little causes your car to
  wander. Caster settings do not affect tire wear.

<p>
  If you look at a car from the side, caster is the angle the front
  strut makes with a vertical line, similar to the fork on a bicycle.
  When you turn, the axis of rotation of the wheels is not
  perpendicular to the road, but rather at an angle:

                                     --             --
</PRE>


<p>
  The result is that the tires "brace" themselves against the cars
  sideways movement ==&gt; better cornering! I believe this is one of
  the reasons why a Corrado SLC (with &gt; 3 degrees of caster) feels
  more stable in a straight line, and corners better than a  G60
  (with ~1 degree of caster) if you ignore the softer springs and
  shocks of the SLC.

<p>
  Caster angles are not easily adjustable on most A1-A3 VWs.  So if
  some shop tells you they did, question their abilities... Note:
  Still under investigation! By changing the subframe to that used on
  an SLC, a greater caster angle can be achieved. More drastic
  changes involves moving the shock towers.


<A NAME="11"><H4>Shocks:</H4></A>

<p>
VW shocks don't last very long (30-50k miles).  The OEM shocks are
from Sachs or Boge (note: they merged in 1994) and similar to the Boge
ProGas shocks. Stiffer shocks reduce roll, improve handling but also
make the ride harsher. Most competition &amp; longer lasting shocks are
called "gas shocks" because they contain a gas filled chamber that
keeps the shock oil under pressure. This pressurization prevents
cavitation and foaming which increase wear and reduces the shock's
effectiveness.

<p>
A compromise to using stuff shocks is to use adjustable shocks. Most
popular competition oriented shock brands are: Koni &amp; Bilstein
(debatable which is better), then Tokico.

<p>
From M.SirotA: For non-competition, I'd rank them Bilstein, Sachs,
Boge, Koni, KYB (initial quality problems), Tokico (harsh).

<p>
A note from ND's BBS: We have had many problems with Tokico and do not
sell them anymore except for some of the jap cars. They use to have
the worst warranty claim problems. They had a plating problem on the
shafts and would turn down warranties saying customers were using vise
grips on the shafts. Now I have seen what vice grip marks look like as
we do get idiots who do that but these were a manufacturer defect. So
we decided not to sell them anymore. Koni, Bilstein, Sachs and Boge
have very good warranty procedures and we will continue to offer them
to our customers.

<p>
[Note: Tokico Illuminas have reliability problems and a particularly
painful failure mode, but the non-adjustables are probably fine.]

<p>
From M.SirotA:  Koni makes three types of shocks:  Red, Sport Yellow,
and Sport/SS.  The Reds are the softest, Yellow are next, and Sport/SS
is the stiffest.  The "SS" stands for "Showroom Stock", as in the
racing category.  The Sport/SS shocks are usually also yellow.
Bilstein makes at least two:  The HD (Heavy Duty), the Sport and the
Race.  The Sport is the stiffer one.  To complicate matters further,
not all versions are available for all applications, at least not off
the shelf.  And old shocks can be revalved, or new custom ones can be
made.

<p>
As with engine modifications that can be measured on a dyno,
suspension is very subjective as what may give you the best lap time
at the race track may make you VW slower on a bumpy mountain road.
That is why each persons driving habits and location of most of their
driving is so important to a proper selection. Many VW owners
autocross in addition to regular street use and they may sacrafice
comfort to have a better handling car on the track.

<A NAME="13"><H4>Sway bars: (Anti-roll bars)</H4></A>

<p>
Reduce side to side roll. Essentially they increase the spring rate
when you turn, but leave the bilateral compression rates unchanged.
This also means that ride comfort is hardly affected, in general a winwin 
situation. Most newer VW have sway bars, but aftermarket ones are
stiffer (thicker) and are attached better. I personally prefer sway
bars that mount in almost stock positions (e.g., VW, Neuspeed,
AutoTech) because they are easy to install and do not require major
modifications. There are other bars made by H&amp;H and Suspension
techniques that have gained some following. The general recommendation
is to change the rear sway bar first to reduce oversteer, or to
replace them both simultaneously. More recent sentiment has shown that
for certain cars (Corrados) the front camber changes are significant
and a front roll bar is the first to change rather then the rear.
Always keep in mind the racing regulations in this regards.

<p>
From M. Sirota:<BR>
  Conventional wisdom says that this is a good thing.  A bigger rear
  sway bar will move the handling more towards oversteer, and will
  also help in putting the power down on the way out of corners
  because it will help to keep the inside front tire planted.
  However, empirical evidence for A1 &amp; A2 VWs shows that a big front
  sway bar helps quite a bit, probably because it pays big dividends
  in limiting camber change.  A big rear bar might do the same, but
  I've never tried it since I only raced my VW in Stock category, and
  it wasn't legal to change the rear bar. In short, on an A1 or A2 VW
  in Stock-category autocrossing (where you are not allowed to change
  the rear bar), run as big a front bar as you can find.

<p>
  [At a later date he adds]: Talk with any SCCA Solo II autocrosser
  who runs a VW successfully in the Stock category.  In Stock, you
  can play with the front bar but not with the rear -- and the secret
  is to run as much front bar as you can.  Makes the car MUCH MUCH
  MUCH faster, *and* easier to drive.  It's a big win.  This is a
  well-known fact. If you're not racing, or you're racing someplace
  where it's also okay to change the rear bar, then I can't offer any
  particular advice -- except that you need more roll stiffness than
  VW provides, for sure.

<p>
  In an ideal world, we'd only have one sway bar, and it would be in
  the rear for a FWD car.  However, in reality, we almost always use
  two.  If you could change everything else (suspension type, pickup
  points, spring rates, damper rates, geometry, corner weights,
  ackerman, roll centers, CG positions, and a host of other things)
  you might be able to design a perfect system where a rear bar only
  would be a good thing.  However, this is generally impossible on
  production cars, and so we end up using two bars just so that we
  can reduce roll without completely screwing up the handling
  balance.  As a side note, I use both bars on my Formula Ford, too.
  I find that even though I can tune it to be neutral with just one
  bar, it feels much better in transients with two, probably because
  the roll *rate* is more similar at both ends that way.  And I think
  they use bars at both ends even on Formula One cars.



<A NAME="14"><H4>Stress bars:</H4></A>

<p>
Stress bars reduce body flex by connecting either the top of the free
standing shock towers, or by connecting the mounting points of the "A"
arms. A1 VWs are in most need of a lower front stress bar, while all
A1 &amp; A2 VWs could benefit from an upper strut tower stress bar.  (A2
cars have a lower subframe and therefore do not need a lower stress
bar).

<p>
The advantage in installation of Neuspeed stress bars over the
Autotech bars is that you are not required to work on the inside of
the wheel well.  The Neuspeed bar comes with these "nutserts" that
essentially create a thread in the shock tower to bolt the bar to. The
Autotech bars, as I recall, require you to put nuts on the bolts from
the inside of the wheel well (they do claim to be a more positive
structural connection, which may be so).  The Neuspeed bars have also
been superb quality and finish-wise.

<p>
Sporttuning tip from AutoTech: One warning sign of excessive chassis
flex is stress cracking of paint around the upper front strut towers.
This may eventually lead to the shock towers breaking through.
Stressbars can eliviate this problem while also reducing chassis
movement.

<p>
The rear upper shock tower stress bar is mostly for *extreme* race
purposes. Robert Collins (see archives) argues that the rear stress
bar is pure hype.

<p>
The effect of a stress bar is somewhat subtle, and does not always
translate in a significant performance gains. Both the lower and upper
front sway bar have subtle effects. The cars feels "calmer" there seem
to be fewer vibration transmitted, and the car feels more confident in
turns.


<A NAME="15"><H4>Springs:</H4></A>

<p>
Springs don't normally wear out. However, there are competition
oriented springs that usually also lower the car or progressive rate
springs that offer a soft ride for normal cruizing but non-linearly
stiffen up as they are compressed.

<p>
One of the things to keep in mind is that springs and shocks need to
be matched to some degree or ride may suffer. Most engineers are
probably familiar with the equations of a spring and damper
combination. Depending on the selected spring and damping constant
(and mass) the combination will either be underdamped, overdamped, or
oscilatory. Using sport shocks with stock springs may not always be
the best combination, nor may sport springs with soft shocks.



<p>
Sporttuning Tip from AutoTech: Do not cut or heat sag springs to
reduce ride height because it does not increase spring rate increasing
the chance of bottoming out and the chance to damage the chassis. The
problems associated with these modifications include broken strut
housings, misalignments, and broken windshield due to body twist. Heat
sagging also causes the spring material to become brittle reducing the
life of the spring. Stayaway from bargain springs that use substandard
wires.

<p>
  **WARNING**: Suspension changes will affect the way your car
handles, especially under emergency maneuvers. Therefore it is highly
advised that you familiarize yourself with your car before you use it
in normal traffic conditions. Taking a performance oriented driving
class sponsored by one of the car clubs is therefore highly advised.

<p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;THIS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED/REWRITTEN A BIT. SUGGESTIONS? KEEP it
short....

<A NAME="16"><H2>BODY/INTERIOR</H2></A>

<p>
Q:How can I make my car quieter? What kind of sound insulation is
  available?<BR>
A:There are a variety of products available on the market that you
  either glue on the car's inner body panells or spray into cavities.
  These products are available from either car audio stores, or
  electronic stores. Do shop around because price varies alot.

<p>
  The effects of this insulation varies with the type of material
  used and how and where it was installed. Generally, the more you
  cover up, sometimes even doubling up in certain areas, the greater
  reduction in noise. It will also improve the sound quality of your
  car due to the fact you have lowered the resonance frequency.

<p>
  VWs generally produce most of their noise in the engine
  compartment, followed by the entire exhaust system, the wheel wells
  (rear), and after that it's probably a toss up whether your doors
  or your roof makes the most noise. For the more recent models, VW
  actually did a fairly good job at insulating the car, however,
  there is always room for improvement.

<p>
  Start with the easily accessible areas that have bare sheet metal,
  and that sound "tinny" when struck. Most people start by insulating
  the trunk floor, rear wheel wells, the spare wheel well, and
  underneath the rear seat. Those areas are right above the muffler
  or the wheels with little or no insulation. In my Corrado G60, I
  noticed a reduction in buzzing coming from the rear. The car is now
  noticeably quieter in the rear versus the front, while previously
  it was about the same. Some have reported results up to 10 dBa
  reduction, which is rather significant (a 3dB reduction = 1/2 the
  noise).

<p>
  If you are more ambitious, go underneath the carpets as well.
  However, depending on the model of the car, VW probably beat you to
  it already and it's unclear whether it'll make much of a
  difference.

<p>
  The next areas to treat are harder. If your car does not have foam
  underneath the hood, add it. Next try insulating the fire wall, but
  be aware that that area gets very hot and you need suitable
  materials for that area.

<p>
  The top is  like a bloody drum, in some respects, and anything done
  here to deaden it or change the harmonic frequency helps. Note that
  the foam insulation that vw uses deteriorates after a period of
  time, especially the headliner.

<p>
  Cut the mats to size, than pull of the adhesive cover and stick it
  to the body panel. Some products require a heat gun (hair dryer
  works too) to establish a firm bond, or to get the material
  sufficiently pliable. Some apply additional glue, such as 3M "Spray
  99 adhesive" to get a good bond.

<p>
  Probably the most popular product in the USA is that made by
  Dynamat. Other brand names are AccuMat by Scoshe Industries, and
  Damping Putty which you squeeze into cavities that buzz. Both
  Dynamat and AccuMat sell a variety of types, the thin sheets are
  generally for covering body panels, the thicker for under carpets,
  and a high temp mat/foam sheet that can be used in the engine
  compartment. Other brand names are: Kentamat, Sonex, a foam
  padding, designed much like  the walls of an anechoic chamber,
  available in various thicknesses and densities, and used to deaden
  or absorb sound in rooms, chambers, or instrument areas.

<p>
  Dynamat is some kind of asphalt sheet with glue on one side, while
  AccuMat is made out of latex and the thicker ones out of foam. Some
  speculate that Dynamat is nothing more than Bitumen roofing paper,
  and therefore any dense material would work. Some have had limited
  success with using asphalt roofing material such as "Elastophene
  Flam" which is an SBF membrane roofing material (it's black, heavy,
  fireproof, 1/8" thick and relatively cheap) or simple vinyl floor
  tyles which the AccuMat thin product resembles.

<p>
  I have used the thin sheets from both Dynamat and Accumat, and they
  both have pros and cons. Accumat costs more, adheres better but
  does not dampen as well. Dynamat does not adhere well at all
  (unless you use a heat gun or spray on adhesive), dampen better
  than Accumat (subjective opinion) but out of the box, Dynamat
  STINKS majorly. Applying this fresh dynamat over a surface that get
  hot (i.e., above the exhaust system) will noticeable smell up your
  car. The problem goes away over time, but it's better if you leave
  the sheets to bake and air out in the sun for a couple of weeks.
  Dynamat does sell a low oder version, but that's even more
  expensive and smaller than their regular sheets.

<p>
Q: Is moving my battery to the trunk a good idea? What effect will it
  have?<BR>
A:[From Jeff Mayzurk]: Yeah, it's a great idea. I did it in my
  Scirocco and was very pleased with the results. Before you do it,
  though, take your car to a local truck stop (or any other certified
  scale) and get the weight for both axles, and then compare
  afterwards so you can figure out how much of a difference it made.

<p>
  In Greg Raven's "Water-Cooled, Front-Drive Performance Handbook,"
  he discusses the effects  of moving the battery on weight
  distribution. In his example, moving the forty pound battery (mine
  weighs 38 lbs.) to the rear moves the center of gravity back only
  1.9 inches, but has a much larger effect on weight distribution.

<p>
  In my car, I bought a $10 plastic battery box, about 20 feet of 2-
  ga wire, and a few battery terminals. It's mounted right behind the
  rear seat on the passenger side, and is grounded at the right-rear
  seatbelt mount (underneath the cushion). I ran the positive cable
  along the doorsill, underneath the carpet, through a grommet in the
  firewall, and to the alternator. After adding additional enginechassis 
  ground cables, I've had absolutely no problems with
  charging.

<p>
  Holes can be drilled through the floor of the trunk inside of the
  battery box between the battery box wall and the battery.  Make
  sure nothing is in the way below the floor of the trunk when you
  drill the holes.

<p>
  If you know your car extremely well, you will notice the difference
  right away -- I did. You have the be really sensitive to your car's
  behavior in transitions, but the difference is there. My car rides
  better and dives less under braking. Handling feels just slightly
  more neutral overall, but traction under full throttle in low gears
  is more of a problem now. (This is the only drawback I can think
  of, and is definitely something to consider if you have a very
  light car with a strong motor.)

<p>
  By the way, make sure you have some provision for holding the
  battery down in the event of a rollover. If your car ever gets
  upside down (god forbid), you don't want that forty-pound weight
  flying around in the cockpit.

<p>
  NOTE: Relocating the battery may put you in a different auto-x
  category!

<p>
                Commonly Asked Questions

<p>
Radar Questions:

<p>
Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?

<OL>
  <LI> In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,
    Quebec, Newfoundland, and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They
    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.

  <LI> Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?

  <LI> Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on.

  <LI> What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?

  <LI> VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance
    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system.

  <LI> What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it?

  <LI> Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a
    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low
    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use
    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:
    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they
    are used (or else, don't speed.)

  <LI> Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?

  <LI> Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.
    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.

</OL>
<p>
Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:

<p>
Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?

<OL>
  <LI> Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',
    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into
    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing
    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning.

</OL>
<p>
    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car
    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels.

<p>
Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?

<OL>
  <LI> When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop
   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle
   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.

  <LI> What does heel-and-toe mean?

  <LI> Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while
   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle.

</OL>
<p>
   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing
   the same thing.

<p>
Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?

<OL>
  <LI> While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of
   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with
   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up.

</OL>
<p>
   The procedure is as follows:<BR>
   (0) declutch<BR>
   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral<BR>
   (2) engage clutch<BR>
   (3) match revs<BR>
   (4) declutch<BR>
   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear
   (6) engage clutch

<p>
   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.
   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.
   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at
   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition.

<p>
Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?

<OL>
  <LI> In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and
  <LI> almost never.

</OL>
<p>
   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times
   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road &amp; Track number to a Car &amp; Driver number is quite
   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*
   major) part of the equation.

<p>
   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically
   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.

<p>
   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'
   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page.

<p>
Q: According to my physics class, you can't ever accelerate or corner at
   more than 1.0G.  Is this true?

<OL>
  <LI> the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume
   that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable, none of which
   are the case with tires &amp; pavement.

</OL>
<p>
   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  The
   mechanisms by which tires grip pavement are not well understood, but
   are clearly not those described by the "Introduction to Physics"
   formula.

<p>
   A better model for tire grip is offered in _Race Car Vehicle Dynamics_,
   William and Douglas Milliken, Society of Automotive Engineers, 1995.
   In this model, mu, the constant coefficient of friction, is replaced
   by a lateral (xy plane) force coefficient, whose value may vary depending
   on the vertical (z axis) force being applied, and on other conditions.
   For a modern Formula 1 race tire, the lateral force coefficient may
   be as high as 1.8 for light loading in the z axis.  See chapter two
   of this fine book for an exhaustive discussion of tire behaviour
   in extreme conditions.

Misc. Questions:

Q:  What does &lt;name or acronym&gt; stand for?

<OL>
  <LI> Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked
    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names
    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER
    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.

Q:  Does VW own Porsche?

<OL>
  <LI> No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and
    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,
    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some
    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may
    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this
    is only speculation at this time.<BR>

                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions
</PRE>


<p>
Tire Questions:

<p>
Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?

<OL>
  <LI> Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the
    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually
    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the
    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire
    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel
    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'
    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like
    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed
    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly
    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common
    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to
<STRONG>150MPH.)</STRONG>

</OL>
<p>
    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed
    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find
    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load
    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous
    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is
    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum
    per-tire loads:

<p>
    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157
    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125

<p>
    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.

<p>
    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire
    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation
    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application
    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters
    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of
    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For
    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference
    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at
    all.

<p>
    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.

<p>
    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating
    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)

<p>
    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,
    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded
    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is
    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they
    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are
    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.

<p>
Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put
    normal tires on the car?

<OL>
  <LI> Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.
    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible
    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them
    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that
    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)
    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your
    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly
    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,
    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard
    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear
    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.

  <LI> Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side
    of my car?

  <LI> Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many
    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a
    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others
    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping
    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before
    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.

  <LI> How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the
    car should I put them on?

  <LI> In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't
    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow
    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there
    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear
    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car
    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car
    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,
    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the
    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes
    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.

</OL>
<p>
Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:

<p>
Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits
    in this Q&amp;A posting?

<OL>
  <LI> Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between
    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless
    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please
    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.

</OL>
<p>
Safety Equipment:

<p>
Q:  Do airbags really work?

<OL>
  <LI> Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much
    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than
    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than
    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend
    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the
    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but
    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention
    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.

</OL>
<p>
Brake Questions:

<p>
Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas
    always wants to do this.

<OL>
  <LI> No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing
    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors
    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped
    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or
    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas
    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical
    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,
    or badly grooved.

  <LI> They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is
    this really a good idea?

  <LI> It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade
    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of
    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases
    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more
    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they
    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.

</OL>
<p>
    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA
    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I
    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to
    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a
    car with an automatic to take the test.

<p>
Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?

<OL>
  <LI> Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to
    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake
    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type
    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The
    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry
    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling
    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest
    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better
    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling
    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see
    the next Q&amp;A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that
    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific
    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly
    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_
    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for
    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out
    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid
    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.

  <LI> What about DOT-5 brake fluids?

  <LI> This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks
    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone
    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and
    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound
    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in
    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any
    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend
    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where
    most of the corrosion occurs.

</OL>
<p>
    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to
    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the
    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.

<p>
    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are
    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which
    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they
    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they
    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable
    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense
    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not
    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the
    economics are questionable for street use.

<p>
    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard
    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably
    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little
    information at this time.

<p>
Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs
    more.  Is it worth it?

<OL>
  <LI> This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will
    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer
    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally
    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does
    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),
    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques
    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.

</OL>
<p>
    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the
    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able
    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several
    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is
    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence
    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed
    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and
    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original
    equipment or OE-equivalent components.

<p>
    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking
    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the
    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS
    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a
    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could
    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is
    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as
    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are
    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system
    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this
    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;
    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform
    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on
    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes
    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,
    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this
    eventuality.

<p>
    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves
    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are
    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release
    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off
    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.
    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.

<p>
    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical
    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on
    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.
    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an
    ABS system in your car.

<p>
    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential
    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the
    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder
    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master
    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for
    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5
    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of
    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system
    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid
    becomes very important.

<p>
Q:  What about this threshold braking business?

<OL>
  <LI> [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&amp;A, but recent
    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers
    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is
    needed here -- rpw]

</OL>
<p>
    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high
    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab
    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much
    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate
    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but
    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold
    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn
    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake
    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the
    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.
    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're
    not very near the threshold.

<p>
    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just
    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on
    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very
    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better
    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS
    take over.

<p>
    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of
    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with
    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed
    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now
    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the
    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.
    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing
    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique
    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to
    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you
    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must
    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least
    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that
    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.
    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective
    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if
    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at
    the pedal will be sufficient.

<p>
Gas Questions:

<p>
Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?

<OL>
  <LI> Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the
    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.
    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your
    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car
    needs.

  <LI> My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?

  <LI> It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,
    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase
    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded
    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,
    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not
    actually require leaded gasoline.

  <LI> Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?

  <LI> Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use
    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.
    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl
    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs
    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.

</OL>
<p>
    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes
    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's
    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider
    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol
    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected
    cars.

<p>
    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with
    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that
    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain
    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything
    in your gas tank.

<p>
    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are
    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work
    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,
    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,
    once every six months, is highly recommended.

<p>
Q:  What about detergent gasolines?

<OL>
  <LI> The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW
    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this
    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test
    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such
    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.
    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean
    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.

<p>
Lubrication Questions:

<p>
Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?

<OL>
  <LI> There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter
    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer
    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are
    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine
    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels
    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,
    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.

</OL>
<p>
    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either
    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by
    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly
    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile
    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the
    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;
    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity
    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually
    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What
    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity
    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast
    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the
    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.

<p>
    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not
    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all
    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the
    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has
    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils
    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,
    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.

<p>
Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?

<OL>
  <LI> Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out
    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure
    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on
    your wallet at all times.

  <LI> Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?

  <LI> Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have
    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based
    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the
    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,
    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET
    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight
    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term
    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are
    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the
    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes
    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners
    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of
    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50
    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as
    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are
    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.

</OL>
<p>
    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.

<p>
Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?

<OL>
  <LI> Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,
    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by
    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to
    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your
    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change
    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty
    as conventional oils.

</OL>
<p>
    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter
    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very
    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.

<p>
Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.
    How often should I change my oil?

<OL>
  <LI> It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)
    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs
    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,
    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you
    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up
    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,
    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are
    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car
    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change
    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,
    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out
    of storage.

</OL>
<p>
Misc. Questions:

<p>
Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they
    break.  What's the story?

<OL>
  <LI> It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,
    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but
    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.
    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.

</OL>
<p>
    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the
    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent
    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if
    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time
    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have
    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,
    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage
    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water
    pump can be a costly mistake.)

<p>
Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it
    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?

<OL>
  <LI> For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the
    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression
    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are
    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance
    oriented vehicles.

  <LI> I heard that Audis take off and run into things; it's called
    "Unintended Acceleration".  What causes it?

  <LI> This was studied extensively by  the National Highway, Transportation,
    and Safety Administration; their final report concluded that unintended
    acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle
    in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence.
    The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the
    vehicle operator is probably the cause (pedal misapplication being
    a euphemism for "stepped on the throttle pedal instead of the brake
    pedal".)

</OL>
<p>
    Unintended accleration was not restricted to Audi 5000s with
    automatic transmissions, although they got the most publicity.
    Cars from many other manufacturers had cases reported.

 Basic Q:  How often does the Oxygen sensor need to be replaced?  What are
 the common indicators of a bad O sensor?

<p>
Funny you should ask, I had the rare urge last night to spruce up
the oxy-sensor file with some of Tim's comments...
This is what I added:

<HR>

<A NAME="1"><H2>OXYGEN SENSOR</H2></A>

<p>
Original Archive Name: oxysensor<BR>
ND BBS Archive Name: OXYSENS.TXT


<p>
Here are a collection of notes on the oxygen sensor, what it does,
how to replace it, how to diagnose some related problems, how to turn of
the red light that comes on after 30/60k miles.

<p>
Briefly, your oxy sensor (aka Lambda sensor) sniffs your exhausts
for oxygen content, and feeds back this value in the form of
a voltage to the car's ECU. The ECU in turn adjusts the fuel
delivery to meet the desired fuel to air mixture value.
This is also why this is called a closed loop or feedback system.
Just like in the BMW commercials, VWs tune themselves, and have been
for quite some time...

<p>
Oxysensors wear out, and if they do, it usually result in a rough idle,
poor engine performance and higher fuel consumptions.
Besides these annoying side effects they may also cause your
catalytic converter to burn up or loosen up.
A broken up catalytic converter sounds like a couple
of coins rattling in a coffee can. I call it the death rattle.
You do not want this to happen, because the cat conv., depending on
the car, may cost up to US$1000 to replace, and in many states
like CA it is illegal to buy a used one.
Some just gut it with a crow bar (the ceramic honey comb is surprisingly
strong), but that's very illegal (US$20 000 fine if caught) and will result
in more pollution.<BR>
Newer cars actually expect the slight cat back pressure and
therefore end up running *worse* with the cat gutted.

<p>
To remind users that the oxysensor may be on its final snifs,
VW installed a little box that contains an odometer that trips
a little switch at either 30 or 60k miles.
The older cars with non-heated sensors have to be changed around 30k,
the newer cars use a heated sensor at a different location thereby
lengthening their useful life to 60k miles.

<p>
Many just reset that odometer to save money w/o replacing the sensor,
and instead burn up the cat costing 10x more.
There are ways to check whether the oxy sensor is still good
(it depends on your driving, they may last much longer, see Bentley and
below), but if you want to be sure, replace it when needed.

<p>
VW uses different styles of oxy-sensors, from the 1 wire (cheap), 3 wire
(2 are used to heat the sensor at start) up to the 5 wires used in
the Corrados. Naturally, each wire adds about 40US$ to the cost, and
some claim you can use a 1 or 3 wire sensor instead of a 3 or 5 wire
respectively if you do not care for cold running behavior.
I would not advice it, but if you drive a beater and have no cash...

<p>
It's a good idea to use a bit of anti-seize on the oxy-sensor
threads before installation, but don't let any of it touch the
sensor because the paste contains lead. Similarly, keep products containing
Si away from the sensor. It's a very sensitive piece of equipment.

<H1><STRONG>BRAKE FLUID: THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM</STRONG>
</H1>
<p>
       One of the more interesting topics of discussion around the race
tracks the past few years has been the controversy over the choice of brake
fluid, specifically silicone or the more conventional polyglycol fluid,
(known at the race tracks as DOT 3,4 &amp; 5.) Since the discussion usually ends
up being by opinion, and since opinions are worth exactly what you say for
them, I have decided to supply you with some interesting factual data about
each to allow you to make up your own mind. (I'll also make it clear as to my
preference and why.) A hydraulic brake system will not operate without brake
fluid. To a large degree tthe level at which the brake system does operate is
dependant on the choice of fluid. Among other things, the more important
elements of brake fluid are high boiling points, consistent viscosity and
good lubricating ability. All brake fluids commonly used in automobiles sold
in the United States, are regulated by the department of transportation
(DOT). The can will have a number such as DOT 3, which refers to the DOT test
designation that the fluid meets. Please note, the number disgnation does not
imply a rating for comparison between the fluids. (Refer to table for minimum
boiling points.)


<p>
<STRONG>DOT MINIMUM BOILING POINTS</STRONG>
<STRONG>DRY BOILING POINT                          WET BOILING</STRONG>
<STRONG>POINT</STRONG><BR>
<PRE>
<STRONG>DOT 3           401 F</STRONG>
                                                 284 F
        DOT 4           446 F
                                                 311 F
        DOT 5           500 F
                                                 356 F

       Both the DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids are normally polyglycol base fluids.
</PRE>
<p>
Polyglycol fluids are hygroscopic, which means they absorb moisture. As the
amount of mooisture absorbed increases, the point at which the brake fluid
boils, decreases. In a well sealed brake system these fluids will require
changing approximately every 1-2 years, depending on the severity of use.
Unfortunately, racers have access to a variety of aftermarket master
cylinders which do not have diaphragms that tightly seal the brake fluid from
the air. Use of these types of master cylinders should be avoided, since the
moisture in the air will be assimilated by the brake fluid immediately. This
is why you should never buy brake fluid by the gallon, because once you have
used the quart you needed to freshen your system the moisture in the air
inside the can will ruin the remaining fluid in the can. It is for this same
reason you should never reuse fluid removed from your system. Once your
system has been filled, re-place the cap immediately to avoid affecting fresh
fluid.

<p>
       Never get any fluid in your brake system unless you are absolutely
sure as to what it is. Petroleum products, such as oil and transmission fluid
can quickly destroy the seals and cause major brake failure. Some import cars
do not use fluids compatible with those used in this country. For instance,
Rolls Royce uses aircraft mineral fluid in the brake system that would
quickly destroy your brakes, so it is not even safe to assume that if it says
brake fluid, its OK. Always look for a DOT number. DOT 3 and 4 can be mixed,
but DOT 5 should never be mixed with any other fluid. Both DOT 3 and DOT 4
fluids will attack paint. Since most race car owners pride themselves on the
appearance of their cars, this would sound like the "kiss of death" for these
brake fluids, but let's not jump to conclusions until we finish exploring all
the facts. If brake fluid is spilled onto the paint, flushing with water and
quickly wiping up the mess will not result in any damage. This should not be
any problem fro a race as a bundle of clean rags is standard equipment.

<p>
             DOT 5 fluid uses silicone as its base. Silicone has none of the
problems we have described above because it is not hygroscopic so it does not
absorb moisture. Also, it does not attack paint, so spillage is no problem.
Unfortunately, it does have some major drawbacks. First, it is extremely
expensive often costing 5-10 times as much as polyglycol fluids. Secondly,
and more importantly, the compressiblity of silicone fluid is very unstable
throughout the temperature range encountered in normal usage. As the
temperature increases, the pedal travel necessary to compress the fluid
changes, resulting in unpredictable pedal height.

<p>
               Altitude also affects the compressiblity of the fluid further
compunding the problem of pedal travel. This would not be such a problem
except for the fact that as we discussed in an earlier article, we must not
only be able to develop pressure in a brake system, we must also be able to
remove that pressure. In the case of silicone fluid, the expansiveness can be
so severe that when you take your foot off the brake, residual pressure could
remain high enough to cause brake drag that would cause further heating of
the fluid and therefore further expansion, therefore more excessive drag that
would end up locking the entire brake system, rendering the auto unable to be
moved.<BR>
It is for this reason race teams that have experimented with silicone fluid
long ago found they could not use it.

<p>
              Another characteristic of the fluid is if you experienced
excessive sponginess in your pedal after the car is used for a while, then
you know the most likely cause. What you may not know if that you may be
tremendously shortenin the life of your brake pads due to excessive dragging.
The other factor that has come to light recently is silicone brake fluid
affects the seals found in standard brake systems.

<p>
              Ethylene propylene rubber seems to loose its durometer
(hardness) when exposed to silicone fluid. This results in a change in the
size and an increase in the wear rate of all rubber components in the system.
To further complicate the problem, if your system has the master cylinder
mounted under the floorboard and you don't have a two pound residual valve
(see last issue) present, you may have trouble identifying  the problem due
to the absence of this most important valve.

<p>
               Street rodders are avid users of silicone brake fluid,
primaril because of the expensive paint jobs they have on their cars.
Unfortunately, since many of their brake systems are composed of components
off of other vehicles, the additional problem of the wrong brake fluid makes
many of these cars very unsafe.<BR>
                In essence, the point of this entire article is that although
both types of fluids have advantages and disadvantages, the bottom line is
that the disadvantages of silicone brake fluid render it unacceptable as a
safe and reliable alternative to polyglycol fluids under all conditions. On
the other hand, although DOT 3 and 4 fluids have problems, these problems are
controllable given reasonable care and maintenance. We all have a tendency to
take the pedal travel of our brake pedal for granted, but I want to assure
you that there is no fear any worse than the fear of stepping on the pedal
and finding nothing there. Consistent even pedal travel is extremely
important to safe stopping distances. It is even more important to giving a
race car a consistent, repeatable feel to the pedal, so the driver knows he
can depend on maximum performance.

<p>
                Whther you own a race car or a street rod, or in fact, any
car, this article offers some critical information for safety's sake. The
next time you see a bottle of brake fluid on sale for $2.90 you may want to
ask yourself is what you are buying truly will handle your intended use. What
may be OK to stop your passenger car at 55mph, probably has no place in a
race car at 125mph.

According to my Bently book, the info given in "Check mode test functions"
(MFA switch to position 1, ignition on, press and hold mode select button in,
ignition off, then back on) is as follow (up to August, 1990, pp 91.10-91.11):

<p>
The differences from above for Aug. 1990 thru 1992 model year:

<p>
Engine map code--   026 (G60)  or 039 (VR6)

Check mode test function "5" is "Overrun cut-off vacuum (mbar)"-- 320(G60) or
   220 (VR6)

The 1993 model year and after documentation doesn't seem to list the two
sets of values, but refers to a procedure like the above but using the
odometer reset button instead which then lists the following:

&lt;&lt;question about door handle breaking&gt;&gt;


<p>
Oddly enough, my driver's side handle broke (internally, not externally) about
2 months ago.  What was really sad was that the service techs were't smart
enough to transfer the old lock cylinder from the broken handle to the replacem
nt.  When I went to pick up the car, they handed me 2 new keys and explained
that they fit the new door handle, so I'd have to use one key to open the
driver's door, then use the original key for the ignition.  After I asked why
they hadn't transferred the old lock cylinder from the broken door handle to
the new one (or set the new cylinder to the same key code as the old one), they
took the car back into the garage and transferred the cylinder.  I refused to
pay for any labor charges for the 2nd go around and since I have an extended
warranty, the whole thing only cost me the $50 deductible.

<STRONG>CORRADO SERVICE AND TECHNICAL INFO</STRONG>

<p>
By: John Anderson (From MOTOR, February 1990, Vol. 173,No. 2)
<HR>

<p>
     Well, was I rummaging through some old mags getting thrown
out at engineering and what should be on the cover of the
February 1990 issue of MOTOR but a color cutaway of everyones
favorite supercharging device.  Now the mag is dedicated to
auto service technicians and presents a lenghty discussion of
potential problems so I thought I'd describe the major points.
The article also babbles about Fords T-bird blower which I'll
leave out.<BR>
     Prime directive for servicing is cleanliness plus hose and clamp
maintenance.  Air filter clean and intake tract free of debris.
VW says make sure absolutely no leaks on the intake side which will
suck in dust and kill the unit, with scroll/displacer tolerance a
tenth of a millimeter, this is of prime importance.
     Leaks will cause whistling sounds, after inspecting the plumbing
do the basics, good spark, hardy fuel pressure (? pump fails often
thanks VW), tight vacuum lines, etc.  The G60 uses a bypass valve
mechanically linked to the throttle valve to reroute uneeded boost
back into the supercharger at low rpm, reducing parasitic drag.  As
the throttle opens, the valve closes off the return line to the
G-lader and the engine gets full intercooled boost (11.64 psi).  When
the throttle closes, the bypass opens, at idle the G60 gets all the
boost blown back into it's intake.  In the case of low boost, check
the bypass valve adjustment (factory set, consult a manual) minimum
must be 8.73 psi, if everything else is in order and you can't get
8.73 psi, REPLACE THE G60.  VW says don't bypass the valve for more
low end oomph, if its closed all the time, the engine would be really
jumpy and get poor mileage (sticking or seals defective a possible
problem?)<BR>
     Furthermore the Idle Stabilizer Valve (ISV) performs another
function on the G60, at max boost it opens bleeding excess pressure
back into the intake side of the G60 as well.  The SAME THING OCCURS
WHEN THE KNOCK SENSOR DETECTS DETONATION (or other sounds?) AND THE
DIGIFANT SYSTEM CAN'T COMPENSATE BY RETARDING TIMING ALONE!!  Essentially
a wastegate in function at full boost the ISV also maintains even performance
between different vehicles preventing one Corrado from being faster
than another.  OBVIOSLY A ROUGH IDLE COULD RESULT IF THE ISV GETS STUCK
<STRONG>CLOSED ALSO OVERBOOSTING THE SYSTEM (SLIGHTLY BUT NEVER OVER THE 14.55</STRONG>
psi MAX WITH FACTORY PULLEY RATIOS).  VW claims you'd never see a stuck
ISV, new plunger design blah, blah, blah, etc.  (Funny I think the '90
Passat of my mom's uses the new style valve, not the rotating one and it
did get stuck once, but I could be wrong about it's type).  NOW FOR REAL
INTERESTING STUFF, the DIGIFANT SYSTEM CONTROLS THE ISV BY READING THE
<STRONG>ENGINE LOAD AND BOOST PRESSURE WITH ITS OWN SENSOR (UP THERE ON THE BLACK</STRONG>
<STRONG>BOX, WE'VE ALL SEEN IT) THE SENSOR REPLACES THE AIRFLOW METER AND IT HAS</STRONG>
!!!NO TEST PROCEDURE!!! (mag insults VW's confidence in a snide manner).
It further notes the line from pressure sensor to manifold is a speciffic
lenght (1.0 meter) and must be so because you can screw up performance
by installing a different length as the pulsations of air in the hose
(harmonics) would hit the sensor out of phase and cause problems. Specifically
ECU out of phase readings will make improper engine adjustments and cause
drop in perfromance!!  Now I had noticed Bentley specifically tells you
this hose must be replaced with the proper one from VW (why they simply
didn't mention the length requirement is beyond me) furthermore a guy
at the local garage told me they had been having trouble with the hose
leaking after time and said replacement might solve some problems which
I did not but now will do, maybe there was a TSB on this, I glanced over
my list briefly and didn't see one but am note sure.
     Anyway the article goes on to tell you that oil changes are fairly
important and that one should always note that if the oil feed line needs
replacement it is a very special and particular size.  Furthermore it says
rebuilding will not ever be possible and parts including the small inner
driving belt will not be available.  Goes on to say service is quite simple.
The cutaway dwawings are really cool as is a series of pictures showing
how the scroll charger compresses air.<BR>
    Well if this info has been noted anywhere before, I'm sorry for the
inconvenience, if not I suggest every G60 owner try to find a copy and
give it a look.  Again the article is in MOTOR, February 1990, Vol. 173,
No. 2.  The article really gives a number of good ideas IMHO.

<A NAME="1"><H2>VW TIMING COMPARISONS</H2></A>

<p>
Last update: Oct 21, 1994

<p>
The idea of this data base came from Peter Tong, however his original
data base got lost when he graduated.<BR>
This is also an amateur way to finally measure performance changes,
and for me personally, a way to check whether something went wrong
with my cars over time.

<p>
How it works: Measure how long it takes to reach the following speeds
from a coasting start on a flat road in the following gears:

<p>
3rd: 40-60 mph<BR>
4th: 40-60 mph<BR>
3rd: 50-70 mph<BR>
4th: 50-70 mph

<p>
Repeat these test several times after you perform your upgrades on the same
road under similar conditions (same ambient temp, car warmed up, same
tire inflation, same gas tank level).<BR>
Obviously, the higher speeds must be performed where it is legal to do
so, and out of the way of general traffic ;-&gt;

<p>
I have found that there is about a 10% error in these measurements.
I have also collected other data.<BR>
As Peter explains below, these tests are "healthier" than a 0-60 mph
spurt as it stresses your car components less.
Furthermore, 0-60 times also depend on the quality of your tires, while

I pretty much just find myself as flat a freeway stretch as possible, then
try to get onto it between the "waves" of cars that come so that I have room.
I get into the gear I want to test, pull out my trusty casio, flick it to
stopwatch, get up to the speed I want to test from (40 or 50) and while
holding that speed absolutely punch the gas while at the same instant hitting
my stopwatch, then the moment the car goes through the target mph I hit the
watch and then let off.  I usually do runs in both directions just to make sure
the times are accurate (depends on the flatness factor).  This is pretty
much how I measured progress on my previous car an '83 GTI and how I currently
test my 82.  I used to do 0-60 but found traction problems usually skewed the
times depending on the quality of the launch.  This is not to mention the
stress a "drop the clutch" launch does to the downpipe studs - esp if you
don't have the techtonics front mount - and to the CV joints, (the whole
drive train).  On my 83 GTI I usually did 40-60 in 4th (6.8 stock, and 5.5
with std tricks) and occasionally 30-50 in 3rd.  On the 82 I do 40-60 in
3rd and 50-70 in 4th.  I got the 50-70 in 4th from reading David Kennedy's
response to Neil Martin's critical letter concerning the Lurching towards
Success II article in VW &amp; Porsche - there Kennedy quotes a time of 7.2
seconds from 50-70 in 5th (.91) which in my car is the same thing in 4th
since my 4th is .91.  Since I modeled my car after his, I can see I have
a ways to go.  Our cars are pretty much the same except that this guy has
a ported and polished head and Schrick 280 last time I heard.  My
convertible (thanks to the 80 kg top) weighs in at 250 lbs more than his
lightweight 84 GTI though.  Recently I heard from Mecca Coolant company that
he was using their Mecca Coolant along with an Oettinger modified
head gasket to run his 84 GTI with 11.5:1 or some higher than normal
compression ratio.  Supposedly he is writing an article about it that should
come out soon in EC.


<p>
Regarding your car being "stock", stock for you means modified for me, since
most all the mods I've done have just brought my car's engine up to your 1990
"stock" level. In fact, your 2.0 16V in stock trim may put out slightly
more hp than my 2.0 8V (134&gt;130).  I liked the rpm range for the 40-60
test in 3rd because it tests from 3000 to 4500 rpm on even the wide
ratio trannies.  I think this is a balance between high rpm power (highway) and
low end grunt (for in-town throttle response).  Oh well, just my $.02 hope it
answered your question.

Jan, your SLC should do around 3.7-3.9 seconds or so - based on 2 other
SLC owner's figures (sample =2 isn't that reliable but still).  Those
are in 3rd gear also = 1.30 ratio.  Not sure if the timing is even
adjustable on those cars due to the motronic - On the Audi 80s it isn't
hardly adjustable at all.  I'd just make sure that whatever the computer
uses to measure the vacuum (load) is feeding the correct signal to the
black box.  I also test both ways to average out the times....

<A NAME="1"><H4>US Corrado G60 EPROM chip specs</H4></A>

<p>
The G60 ECU is based on the Motorolla MC68HC11 cpu.
It's an 8 bit cpu that runs at 2MHz. It's roughly based on
the 6800 cpu, but with lots of extra things on board, from
what I can remember from the data sheet.
The program is stored in an EPROM that's quite easy to replace.

<p>
The EPROM chip only stores information on variable type settings,
the real code is usually someplace else in the car.
Also, the real code usually has default
settings that override any variable settings that might be too
far out of range.<BR>
This is probably there to protect VW and
control people like AutoThority and APS (Neuspeed).

<p>
[Jim Berilla / jb@falstaff.MAE.cwru.edu]
It appears that the code is the same in both [AutoTh vs OEM] chips.
The major difference is some tables of numbers.
Another difference is that AutoThority added a copyright
notice in the EPROM data.  (The Bosch chip has no copyright notice,
neither on the label, nor in the EPROM data.)  A few other bytes were
changed, I suspect to make the checksum come out right.

<A NAME="2"><H4>Desciption:</H4></A>

<p>
The chips used by VW [for the G60] are standard off the shelf stuff.
They have used several suppliers of the blanks, and they
have also switched to faster chips over the years.
The chips seem to be interchangable, though it is probably
better to go with the newer and faster chip.
Because AA &amp; APS make no distinction between any of the G60
performance chips, it is reasonably safe to assume that they
all store the same type of info in the same locations.

<p>
Essentially, they are 256K generic EPROMs.
There are a total of 28 pins, 14 on each side (DIP).

<p>
See EuroCar (1990 or 1991) on how to gain access to the ECU
and the chip. Always disconnect the battery AND ground
yourself to the base of the ECU to avoid electrostatic dammage.

<p>
Anyone with an EPROM unit can download the info from these
chips back them up onto a floppy.


<A NAME="3"><H4>Newer/Faster chips:</H4></A>
On the top there is a silver sticker (over the window)
and presumably it's Bosch/VWs number for the chip:

<p>
1 267 356 351<BR>
27C256-20

<p>
Than on the top of the actual chip it says:

<p>
Texas Instruments Logo<BR>
B 57 995<BR>
<STRONG>LDP8918</STRONG>

<p>
On the bottom side it says:

<p>
JL27C256D/074851<BR>
<STRONG>SINGAPORE 18</STRONG>

<p>
You have to look at the JL27C256 number, I was told that the
JL27 identifies it as a generic chip and the 256 is simply
the chip size, yes 256K. Commonly available. Used in the later
1990 G60's.


<A NAME="4"><H4>Older/Slower Chips:</H4></A>

<p>
Silver Sticker:<BR>
1 267 356 189<BR>
LD27256-25

<p>
Top:<BR>
Intel Logo<BR>
857604<BR>
S7804<BR>
U910178MS

<p>
Bottom:<BR>
<STRONG>7851312TBC</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>PHILIPPINES HP08</STRONG>

<p>
Harder to find. Less energy efficient than the above. Used in the
early 1990 G60's.


<A NAME="5"><H4>VR6 Chips</H4></A>

<p>
The chip used by APS for the VR6 has the following numbers:
dpi 89136N<BR>
M27512 F1

<p>
It looks like a 512k EPROM, though I am not sure what speed it is.

<p>

<p>
The Digifant I have in my '88 Jetta has two processors in it:
an Intel 8039, and a Motorola SC 80984. The Intel is
connected to a 2764 EPROM. I have not heard about the Motorola
beast, but I guess it is a processor, as it has a 4MHz quartz
attached to it and has a UV vindow on it, just like other
Motorola microcontrollers.

<p>
The serial output goes to a simple light, and it flashes the
code out. You get to that mode by grounding that output
when you turn on the ignition. (It must be I/O line).
That feature was installed on '89 California cars. You can
find the detailed wiring and codes in the Bentley manual.
When I took apart my Digifant control box, I noticed, that
the output pin for the test light was wired up, but I had
no wires and connectors in the cable hooking up the box to
the engine and other parts of the car.

<p>
There is no aftermarket chip available for the Digifant controllers,
and I would guess, the reason being the dual processor architecture.
(Generally there is no way to read out code/data from programable
Motorola microcontrollers.)

<p>
If anyone knows more about the Digifant controller or the
Motorola processor, I would like to hear about it!

        For some reason I blew up my controll unit (digifant 1). I had
to buy a new one from the dealer $700. I then went to fix the old one,
and found the two Opamp (tlc.....) to be blow. That fixed the problem.
So if your car smokes every time you step on the gas it is probably the
opamps amplifing the oxygen sensor signal. They are about $5 from
Newark. I now have the new brain (still under warranty) for sale. Also I
would be willing to sell the power chip from Autotech (Stage 1).

chip $160<BR>
Brain $375<BR>
Both $500

&gt;I have a question for you...how did you figure out what was
&gt;wrong with G60 ECU?

<p>
Well It ran fine. By this I mean that it kept it's idle, it idled high
when cold and normal when warm... So I knew that the brain still
controlled the engine, but it just ran rich (black smoke and black
residue on bumper). So I knew that the information to the ECU was
somehow 'distorted'. I checked all my sensors mainly the O2 sensor and
all was fine. So the amplification of one of the input signals was off.
A opamp is used to amplify a signal. Should the opamp fail, the signal
will still make it to the uprocessor, but it will not be amplified - in
fact it will be decreased in power. There are two opamps in the brain
that have a very high input impedence 10^12 Ohms. This means that the
opamp will not degrade the signal by 'sucking' up any current like
normal opamps. These high impedence opamps are used only when dealing
with extremly low current signals, such as most automotive sensors.
        The only draw back to these high impedence opamps is that they
are very, very, very static sensitive. By just touching one (if you are
not grounded) you run the risc of blowing one.
        All in all just replace all the opamps that start with TlC....,
which are these high impedence op amps. You can order them from NeWark.
If the ECU is blown such that it does not work at all, no more idle,
then the uProcessor may be blown. No help there, since the software is
embedded in these. So just replacing the uP will not fix it, you would
also need an uP programmer (hardware) and the software that goes in
them.<BR>
Hope this helps, if you need more information please Email, I will be
glad to give any electrical help.<BR>

Thank you, I have...

<p>
&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what timing maps have to do with anything.  Since most
&gt;&gt;functions are stored as lookup table in memory all you really need
&gt;&gt;to do is locate the tables and play with the numbers (in small deltas)
&gt;&gt;until you get what you want.  An example is A/F ratio tables and
&gt;&gt;multipliers.  Most Superchips merely run the engine richer than
&gt;&gt;stoich or at least richer than the original calibration allowed.
&gt;&gt;Another thing to play with is the top speed fuel cut-out calibration.
&gt;&gt;This is usually just a number in memory that can be altered to suit
&gt;&gt;the driver's needs.

<p>
&gt;	Gee, if anyone is really interested, I have dissassembled G-60 EPROMS,
&gt;it isn't all that interesting to look at unless you know Motorolla 68HC11 code.
&gt;I have a 68HC11 assembler too, but as someone else stated, you need an
&gt;emulator and a chassis dyno to get very far. The $250 isn't for the chip,
&gt;it's for the time to write the software, which in this instance is labor
&gt;intensive and time consuming. The program that runs the engine doesn't
&gt;look too complicated, and the lookup tables aren't that huge, but without
&gt;the right tools you'd be playing a massive guessing game.

<p>
A simulator or emulator will work.  Motorola has free software for the
HC11 on their BBS.  Access to a code profiler and a logic analyzer would
help also.  A dyno is not needed.  We use dynos here to arrive at
the baseline numbers.  The calibration community further tweaks those
numbers by driving the car and calibrating by feel (and emission tests!)
and calculations involving torque and BHP.  If it sounds emperical, well
it is...  A dyno will only give you numbers that may or may not prove
out under real driving conditions.

<p>
Last update: July 25, 1995: Split into G60, GTI &amp; VR6 archives.

<p>
I collected a bunch of info on engine power upgrades for the
US versions of the 1990-1992 Corrado G60.
The power upgrades for the SLC and other cars are now stored in another
archive..

<p>
In the NA, the only car available with a G60 equiped engine
is the Corrado. In other parts of the world, a Passat G60, a
Golf G60 and a Polo G40 are also available.
VW Motor Sport also makes a G70, available for an outrageous price.
It is unclear whether the mods described here will directly
work for the other cars. The principle will be the same, but
the parts/ECU may be different.

<p>
The main problem with the G60 Corrado is its weak low end,
which most of these upgrades address.

<p>
I have also included personal impressions of these upgrades.
This is not meant as an advertisement. I have NO affiliation
with any of the listed sources.

<p>
HOW THE CHIP WORKS (G60 &amp; VR6)<BR>
<HR>

<p>
There are several shops that sell performance upgrades in the US
(and probably Europe as well).<BR>
One is by AutoThority (AT, in VA) the other by Automotive Perf. Systems
(APS, in CA).<BR>
They both offer roughly the same packages, each of which boost
the power, though they use slightly different methods.
AutoThority also sells its chips (for less) thru AutoTech (CA)
and APS thru PlainWrap (for less) and others.

<p>
Note, there are also other chips available, such as from Advanced
Motor Sport solutions and Superchips. However, I have virtually
no testimonials about either of these, I cannot comment on their
efficacy.

<p>
Essentially what the chips do is to "recurve" the ignition
curves and fuel maps.<BR>
According to an article in Wired magazine, the German chips
are generally programmed for smooth city driving while more
aggressive at the top end.<BR>
(see http://www.wired.com/Etext/2.05/features/silicon.hot.rod.html)
By advancing the ignition up to knock point you increase
power, most notably low end torque.<BR>
The result is ca 20% more low end torque and 10% more max power.
The penalty is that you have to use high octane gas, i.e.,
92 US CLC Octane (R+M/2).<BR>
Note that there is quite a debate now which chip is better.
According to a few sources, the AT chips are more delicately
tuned, while the APS chips are less radical.
APS also uses the same chip for their Stage II system while
AT offers different chips for each application.
AT also claims that they tune their chips along the entire range,
while APS concentrates more on the top end.
See the torque curves below for a comparison.

<p>
One of the things to keep in mind is that the chips are upgraded
from time to time and some of the initial comments may not be
true anymore...

<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that the chips are not interchangeable
with other cars or even between model years. The maps are the same,
but the microcode in the chips are different.


<A NAME="2"><H2>HOW THE G60 PULLEY WORKS</H2></A>

<p>
The smaller G60 pulley makes the supercharger spin faster,
meaning that it will pump more air &amp; gas mixture into your cylinders,
and therefore providing more power.<BR>
According to Aaron, both the APS &amp; AutoThority pulley will spin
the G60 at around 13000 at the stock redline which is within
factory specifications. He recommended not to go any higher.

<p>
The downside is that the supercharger spins faster and therefore
more likely to wear out sooner.<BR>
However, here in the USA &amp; Canada, speeds are limited to 65 mph
or 100 kmh, so generally people do not run at German autobahn
speeds for a long time.<BR>
Since the G60 is made to run at German autobahn speeds it is
therefore reasonably "safe" to make it spin faster for the
slower driving habbits in the US.<BR>
All pulley upgrades from reputable companies however ensure that
you remain within factory specs at maximum engine speed
(the original pulley only spins the G60 at 70% of its max).

<p>
You CAN buy smaller pulleys without the chips and the upgraded
fuel regulators.<BR>
This is a BAD idea because it causes the engine to run too lean
which apparently may damage them (don't ask me why).

    As for G-60 performance package  the neuspeed pulley is the
proper size for reliability and performance it spins in the
factory 13,000 range. Autotechs kit is Autothority's kit the
pulley is  a copy of the Neuspeed size. We have dyno tested a
lot of G-60 packages, we only sell the Neuspeed package it works
great and it is legal. As for the G-60 cat failures we have seen
 4 fail  3 were stock car just barely under the 70,000 mile
warrantee the last failure was a 88,000 mile car with Neuspeed
everything this one was out of warrantee , boy sure hard to
blame Neuspeed when the only failure we have seen out last the
stock cars. Cat failure are highest in 1.8 16v golf and Jetta's
&lt;at least that is what we see&gt;. G-60 supercharger failures, we
are about to replace our first one next month  the car has
80,000 miles on it and has been Neuspeed stg2 since new. The
blower  had an extra small pulley (2.0 pulley) for a limited
time and was over revved to end it's quite life , also was been
running NOS like a bad drug habit. I get lots of calls for G-60
units but most are for used ones that failed with stock pulleys
in the 70 -80k range.

<A NAME="3"><H2>HOW THE G60 CAM WORKS</H2></A>

<p>
The CAM upgrade provides a bit more overlap (I think) and lift
which benefits mostly the upper end.


<A NAME="4"><H2>OVERVIEW: G60</H2></A>

<p>
Autothority claims the following for his kits [From Chuck Actor]:
(All data and prices subject to change, no guarantee that any of this
is correct).

<p>
Stage I: Just a chip.<BR>
175 HP for $375<BR>
CARB (EPA) approved, so I guess they don't pollute that much.

<p>
Stage II: Different chip, ~68 mm blower pulley and Bosch high pressure
fuel regulator 0 280 160 263.<BR>
201 HP for $595


<p>
Stage III: As II (though different) &amp; a CAM
217 HP for $795<BR>
Note that you can buy the CAM separately for about 100$ from AutoTech,
and it has virtually the same specs as the more pricey APS one.

<p>
Note from Jan: I kind-a dispute the above figures...
Stage I = 20% more torque at 2000 rpm (!!!), 11 more peak Hp.
Stage II= 175 Hp peak.

<p>
Autothority will refund you the difference in $$$ if you upgrade
from Stage I to Stage II, after you send in the original chip.


<p>
APS claims to have the following:

<p>
PChip: 	Chip swap<BR>
+11Hp for 250US$<BR>
CARB approved

<p>
Stage 2: Chip swap (same as the above), smaller pulley, thermostat
         &amp; muffler<BR>
190Hp at 595 US$<BR>
CARB approved

<p>
G60 CAM: A performance CAM that'll add more power at the top end.
199US$<BR>
CARB approved

<p>
See couple of the past issues of EuroCar (=VW&amp;P). There are
several articles + installations there, or call the above places, &amp; they'll
fax/send you the specs.

<p>
Which kit is better? Hard to say. Some say that the APS method is more
driveable but less power and noisier [ND, Hamill], while others
prefere the AT set up [Ron Wood].<BR>
After reading the Bosch FI handbook, AT seems to follow the text
almost to the letter.

<p>
Other recommended upgrades are:

<p>
Use a K&amp;N filter and remove the "funnel tube" in the air box because
it restrict air flow.<BR>
(it slides right out the front of the air box, after you take the whole
box out first).<BR>
I [Jan] removed the funnel, the car seemed a tad more responsive BUT also
made the G60 wailing noise alot more apparent.
As you rev up to 3500 you get an eerie and loud woooOOOOOOUUUUUUOOOOooo.
I put the funnel back in.

<p>
Note that the later G60s are "tricked out" a whole lot more
(according to Mike Potter a Timmons VW in Long Beach) and produce about 10%
more power than their earlier versions (he tested both at APS's
dyno).<BR>
Among the changes are a larger crank pulley, effectively spinning
the G60 and all other things faster!


<A NAME="5"><H2>TORQUE CURVES</H2></A>

<p>
The following data was inferred from the torque graphs supplied by
AutoThority (yes, I just eye-balled the values, but the resulting graphs
are fairly close to theirs).<BR>
The data is in ft/lbs, and it show, (US) G60 Stock, Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3,
and SLC Stock, SLC + AT Chip (SAT) and SLC + APS (SAP).

<p>
Note that I have no idea on the accuracy (or reliability)
of any of these measurements.

<p>
Using some smoothing, interpolation &amp; making up some points,
I got the following curves:

<p>
G60:	Torque = 48.127 + 5.57E-2 x RPM - 7.19E-6 x RPM^2
AA1:	Torque = 52.964 + 5.76E-2 x RPM - 7.42E-6 x RPM^2
AA2:	Torque = 37.879 + 9.03E-2 x RPM - 1.22E-5 x RPM^2
AA3:	Torque = 32.821 + 9.23E-2 x RPM - 1.19E-5 x RPM^2
SLC:	Torque = 63.750 + 4.43E-2 x RPM - 1.62E-7 x RPM^2 - 7.21E-10 x RPM^3
SAT:	Torque = 68.374 + 3.55E-2 x RPM + 3.68E-6 x RPM^2 - 1.12E-9  x RPM^3

<p>
All the data fitted with 96% or better Pierson Correlation Coeff.
(Better fit with 3rd degree equation)

<A NAME="7"><H2>AT STAGE I (G60)</H2></A>

<p>
&gt;From jan@ug.eds.com:

<p>
I have Autotech's Stage 1 chip, and am quite happy with it.

<p>
The car feels alot better at the low end, and pulls almost frighteningly
at freeway speeds [Caveat: After driving an SLC, it's still
quite a way off]

<p>
I used Stage 1 because the car is still in warrantee, and it's
an easy and almost invisible (to a mechanic) change.

<p>
Added Benefit: My gas mileage actually improved a bit because
I can stay in lower gears longer.

<p>
If there is one upgrade to get, this is it.

|&gt; I installed the Autothority stage one chip in my Corrado a couple

|&gt; in top end power.

<p>
I've been considering a chip modification like this and would
appreciate opinions on this and other, similar products. I understand
a company called Neuspeed has a chip modification available
for Corrados.<BR>
Does anyone have experience with that product to share? I'm likely
to wind up with one or the other and would like some comparison
(even if subjective and second-hand) before I plunk down my money.
Also....

<p>
|&gt;<BR>
|&gt; Installation was straightforward, but not really easy.
|&gt; It's a very tight fit to get the ECU out and back into
|&gt; to the car, but patience works.<BR>
|&gt;

<p>
Any other (more specific) hints and gotchas?

<p>
|&gt; The very low end (1000 rpm) is a little bit better, but
|&gt; soon above that, power comes on much quicker than before.
|&gt; At medium range, e.g. highway range (the car turns ~2500 rpm
|&gt; at 55mph) throttle responce has improved alot.
|&gt; The high end is scary (my wife drove it and
|&gt; commented "this is dangerous").<BR>
|&gt;

<p>
Is there any change to the maximum speed imposed by the rev-limiter?
Is the rev-limiter less abrupt in its behavior?

<p>
|&gt; On the down side, I can see why VW opted with the "detuned"
|&gt; version, and why they think 160 Hp is about the limit on FWD.
|&gt; From a standing start, the wheels spin, steering is a bit
|&gt; of a handful because of it. 4WD or traction control is
|&gt; definately needed.<BR>
|&gt;

<p>
Do you experience torque-steer? In what way does the steering
become a handful?

<p>
|&gt; So far, I am happy with the swap.<BR>
|&gt; The low end was really bothering me.

!explain why it well down on torque compared with the equivalent Golf.
!We only have the 16V &amp; G60 versions of the Corrado here. There is no
!basic 8V version, unlike the truly pathetic Calibra - maybe there
!should be ?  BTW, I've seen ads in the UK for G60 mods giving 195bhp
!by a chip change, for c.300 pounds. Other current mods include smaller
!G-lader pulley &amp; uprated bearings to increase pressure (it spins

<p>
        The Neuspeed kit brings the G-60 up to 185 hp through the use
of exhaust modifications, smaller supercharger pulley, and a micro-fueler
addition to the fuel-injection. They also include a 180 deg thermostat and
fan switch. Seems like a pretty complete kit. I don't think I would want to
take the G-lader apart to upgrade the bearings. Neuspeed seems to feel they
aren't pushing the supercharger into the danger zone with their kit.
        Seems as though the Corrado would be a waste of car with the basic
8v motor. I think a 2.0 liter 16v would be viable if VW brought this motor
up in power a bit more. I would think they could comfortably get 150-170hp
without the use of superchargers etc. Oh well, the VR6 is here now....

What you describe sounds like a product called Glyptol.  It is
painted onto potentiometers and other adjustable electronic parts
so the technician can tell if someone's been fiddling with the
unit.  You should be able to get it at better electronic shops.
By the way, acetone thins it.

Once again, I hate to sound like Autothority salesman, but they are working
on one now.  But it's on their low prority list.  Our last VW club meeting
was held there, and they gave us the tour of their place, and explained
to us what they were doing.  It was very interesting.

Subject: G60 chip

<p>
Hi Trevor,

<p>
My name is Jurgen, I thought I'd mail direct since I can't seem to post.  I
have a '90 G60 and put the auto-thority stage-I chip in this summer. So far I
have had absolutely nothing but grins from this product. A fellow I work with
has an identical car to mine (sans chip) so he keeps me honest as to my
perceived gain in performance. The biggest single improvement is bottom end
torque and the higher rev limiter allows for nice 6500rpm shifts (I haven't
tested the 7500 limit). Needless to say I can beat the stock Corrado every
time.  The only thing it's costing me so far is a little more fuel consumption.
I had originally considered getting the stage-II but was scared off by one of
the VW shops, which has seen two G60's with blown motors due to the Neuspeed
stage-II kit which uses the same smaller super charger pulley. I think the
stage-II kit's just creates too much boost at high rpm to keep the motor
reliable, then again I have no idea just how hard those guys were pushing it.
I purchased the Autothority chip for $250 and installed it myself in 1/2 hr,
probably the cheapest and easiest performance mod on the market (IMHO).

&gt;From: C Hapeman &lt;cjh@garage.att.com&gt;

<p>
I looked into things a couple of months ago.  Neuspeed was cheaper at $250,
AutoAuthority was $325, if I remember.  I called both companies up: Neuspeed
appeared very arrogant on the phone and AutoAthority was nice.  Asking for
brochures on the product, Neuspeed said our's is best just talk to those who
use us, AutoAuthority sent a letter with estimated hp and torque increases etc.
You can find their numbers in any issue of European Car.

<p>
AutoAuthority offers an upgrade policy, if you buy Stage I and later purchase
stage II you can return Stage I for a rebate thing.  I would look closely
before going with Stage II, the G-Pully change is somewhat drastic and may
effect long term engine wear.  I believe AutoAuthority also has a 30 day money
back guarantee, not sure about Neuspeed.

<p>
Stage I basically changes the gas/air mixture and some other twiks, they demand
that you run on only 92 or 93 and higher octane gas.  I believe this is way VW
didn't put the changes in the stock car, they didn't want G60's dieing at 70K
because drivers were trying to get by with cheaper gas.  Some people I talked
to said if you already use the right gas go with the upgraded chip, it will
make the car run cleaner and all in all be better for the car.

<p>
As a conclusion I couldn't get a feel for which companies' chips were better.
They do basically the same thing so my bet is they are for all intensive
purposes the same.  BTW, I'm waiting for the spring and will get the
AutoAuthority Stage I and test it out, if the change is not what I want I'll
give it back within the 30 day limit.


<p>
Please let me know what you find or get back to me with further questions.

Eventhough I am the most recent person to install Stage II and most of the
messages here are chronologically, I decided to put this one up front
because it includes installation hints:

Subject: [W] Corrado Stage II (AA)

<p>
Well, I finally got around to installing an AA Stage II kit
on my Corrado G60.<BR>
The procedure was relatively simple, I did not need any special
tools.

<p>
I first did the pulley, figuring this would be the worst.
First I removed the air filter box w/o any problems.
Then I loosened the G60 pulley bolt by giving my wrench a
slight tap. The inertia of the belt kept the pulley from moving.
Later I discovered that the original pulley had two holes
on the inner flange, presumably to immobilize it.

<p>
Next came the belt.<BR>
VW uses a special tool that looks like a squarish version of a
small C-clamp to compress the alternator pulley to release
tension on the serpentine belt.<BR>
I used a 18inch adjustable C-clamp on a slightly different location
without any problems.<BR>
First remove the belt from the idler pulley and then you can pull it
off the G60 pulley.

<p>
To remove the pulley, I gently used a flat crow bar to slide it off.

<p>
The new pulley did not fit at first because of the coating on the
hole. I used some sandpaper to clean it out and coated it with oil.
Next I probably made a mistake but I had to tap the pulley with a
rubber hammer onto the G60 axle.<BR>
It may be unhealthy for those bearings...next time use a long
screw to simple press it in.<BR>
The final 1/2" or so I used the original screw to press the pulley
in.<BR>
I used a very small dab of loctite on the bolt to make sure it
wont fly off.

<p>
Then I reinstalled the belt.

<p>
The fuel regulator was next. It's on the passenger side of the
FI rail. Two screws, two tubes is all it takes. Some fuel leaked
out, so be careful.<BR>
The new one looks exactly like the original.

<p>
Then finally came the chip. That's easy, and I have done it a couple
times by now.<BR>
The whole process took me about 2 hours of steady work, 1/2 of which
is spent with the ECU.

<p>
Next came the test drive, after making sure that no fuel was spraying
all over the place.

<p>
The car has gained significant power...
The low end is very improved, not quite like the VR6 but almost.
Midrange is about the same as the VR6, and the top end is
feels more than the VR6.<BR>
However, that's not all that good for several reasons.
First of all, I think it's too much power for FWD w/o traction control.
When accelating in first (from a coast) the wheels will just
start spinning around 4000 rpms. Same with 2nd gear (and I am
not talking about popping the clutch at high revs).

<p>
The second problem is noise.<BR>
The G60 drone is alot more noticable. At lower rpms
it's just a low VVVVVOOOOO, at high rpms it's more like
an F15 taking of.<BR>
It makes you want to avoid the higher rpms!
On the other hand, I end up staying in lower gears longer
because there is so much more pull.<BR>
What I used to do in one gear I can now do in the next
higher (stay in 3 rd instead of switching to 2nd).
So to get the same effect as before you do not have to rev the engine
as much.

<p>
Before the installation, pulling in 5th from 60 to 80 mph took
about 9.9 secs, now about 8.5 secs.<BR>
I did not get a chance to measure the 3rd gear time from
40-60 (Peter! was about 4.6 +/-.15 stock) because I dropped the
stopwatch between the seats.<BR>
I do get significant variances in these measurements though...

<p>
As far as engine temp, normal driving did not seem to have affected
it all that much.<BR>
Consumption seems a bit down (1 or 2 mpg) wrt Stage I, but then you also tend
to use the available power more readily (which probably dumps
a ton fuel).

<p>
All in all, it did make the car more responsive, though noisier.

&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; The car has gained significant power...
&gt;&gt; The low end is very improved, not quite like the VR6 but almost.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;   But the question is...<BR>
&gt; Was it worth it??

<p>
Worth is cost vs benefit.<BR>
Let me first answere the cost:

<p>
&gt; What was the cost??

<p>
I was previously driving a Stage I kit, and the upgrade only cost 150
US$ WITH tax because of the sale at AutoTech.
So I am certainly willing to experiment for 150US$.

<p>
The benefit is a much more driveable and powerful car, actually,
it's a bit too powerful.<BR>
It's also more noisy, which is a bit annoying, and I am a bit concerned
at higher rpms. It also uses more gas and provides the opportunity
to really suck up alot of gas, though on my sedate commute on
the highway last night (except for a couple of spurts), I was
getting 29 mpg @ 65-70mph. If you drive like a bat out of hell,
you get closer to 19 mpg.<BR>
All changes are easy to do, and easily reversable.

<p>
The car now produces my former stock peak torque value around 2000 rpms
(was 4000 rpms), so there is no need to keep the revs up as high
as before.<BR>
The new torque peak still occurs around 4000 rpms, but 210 or so
ft/lbs vs ~160.<BR>
This all means alot less footwork in the traditional LA yo-yo type of
traffic.

<p>
Both Stage I &amp; II are smoother and more gradual in power
delivery than the stock chip (the stock chip has several small
dips in torque output).

<p>
So to answere your question whether it was worth it...it's
really too early.<BR>
I am not 100% satisfied as yet. Just would like to reduce the noise
a bit. Perhaps Dynamat would help.

<p>
Before you go out and buy one of these upgrades, several people
(Chris Lagatuta at New Dimensions, John Hamlin) have commented that the
APS kit is better and more drivable though it produces less power.
That kit is however alot more invasive as more hardware changes
are needed (thermostat, couple switches, exhaust, etc.).
The AA mods look totally stock.

<p>
If you are thinking of an SLC vs a G60 + kit, the SLC still wins
easily.


<p>
&gt; Could we periodic updates from you on this as well??

<p>
Sure.

<HR>

<p>
&gt; I just saw your second response to Trevor.
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I'd still be interested in hearing your thoughts on
&gt; Stage I vs. Stage II though (i.e. knowing what you do now, would you go
&gt; right to Stage II, or stay with Stage I for day to day driveability...)
&gt;<BR>
&gt; -Jeff

<p>
I am debating this myself right now...<BR>
If it weren't for the increased noise and vibrations I'd probably
stay with Stage II.<BR>
However, because of those issues, I am not sure at this point.
The high end is almost scary...almost uncontrollable.
Perhaps the APS set up is better, I'll see if I can negotiate
something with them.

<p>
The car is alot more drivable with Stage II, the low end is
alot better than the Stage I.<BR>
Stage I is a definite improvement over the stock chips,
though still a bit lacking in low end, and the
Stock chip is absolutely a bear to drive after S I.
I'd say start with Stage I, that's an absolute minimum...
Besides, you get a full refund with both places
(AA &amp; APS) when you upgrade to S II or III.

<p>
The problem is that my wife has an SLC, and going between the two
(before SII) is a big jump...I often forget what car I am in
and sometimes want to do things I can do in the SLC but not in the
G60. Still, the SLC is by far the better car. If VW ever decides
to drop the VR6 into the new Cabr. I may get that instead.
The new cab is absolutely adorable (I was involved in a pre-production
evaluation).

&gt;I'm getting a 90 Corrado in the next week, and would like to know the
&gt;differance between the Stage I kit and the Stage II kit.  Stage I is just a
&gt;chip right?  What is stage II, does it completely destroy your warranty?
&gt;Someone posted that Stage II gives a 7.4 sec 0-60 time, what does Stage I
&gt;do for 0-60?  Any and all info appreciated.

<p>
        Stage I is a chip upgrade, AutoThority's Stage II is a smaller
G-60 pulley, high pressure fuel regulator, and chip. Neuspeed's Stage II
is a pulley, Gillet exhaust, fuel enrichment system, and lower temp
fan switch and thermostat. Neuspeed also has a chip upgrade, called the
P-chip.<BR>
        Stage I from either company gives better driveability with an
average 5.5 hp gain. It won't make that much 0-60 difference. Stage II
provides dramatic differences in acceleration and response, and could
conceivably wreck your warrenty if you blow the motor. I have found
that the engine seems to handle the extra power rather effortlessly,
with no radical behavior differences or temperature anomalies.

        I have heard of knock problems also with
the AutoThority Stage II. I have also heard of problems with the Neuspeed
Stage II, things like unburnt fuel coming out in flames from the tailpipe
when deccelerating. It's hard to know who to believe. The Neuspeed kit
fools the the computer into thinking it's in a cold start mode,
which will deliver more fuel but seems hokey. I think the chip is the
better approach. I also plan on doing the cam, and the AutoThority folks
said they would custom tune my chip for it. They also have exhaust and
their own cam design coming in the future. I should have the kit installed
next weekend, then I'll have firsthand knowledge of what the heck this
thing is going to do to my engine (hopefully not blow it up). If it seems
dissapointing I can always return it in 30 days.
        One thing I am really itching to do is upgrade the motor to
a 2 liter. That would erradicate all torque deficiency in one fell swoop.
It would cost some bucks though, but I would still be way under what a
new VR6 Corrado goes for.<BR>

In reply to jhamill@BBN.COM (John Hamill):

<p>
|&gt;	I think an all out race between a SLC and Stage II equipped
|&gt;G-60 would be an interesting one, I would probably also need a
|&gt;mild cam to keep the power up above 5000rpm, then I might be
|&gt;able to beat it. But I would take the sweet sound of the SLC over
|&gt;my droning supercharger anyday. Also, to anyone considering doing
|&gt;the Stage II conversion, keep in mind that since you are installing
|&gt;a smaller pulley on the supercharger, the droning sound gets even
|&gt;louder.<BR>
|&gt;<BR>
|&gt;jh

<p>
I would disagree with John. I have a G-60 w/an AT Stage II kit and I would
tell you that it emits a much more aggressive tone when you put your foot down.
When the stock G-60 used to sound a bit strained the AT II "growls".

<p>
I would encourage EVERYONE with a G-60 to upgrade to the AutoThority Stage II
kit. I have seen no drop in MPG or rise in oil consumption. I have found that
I buy more gas because I love to drive the car. My smile has gotten twice as
big too. I would say that the only adverse affect of getting this kit is that
my wallet is $575 lighter (plus installation costs). Do it!

<p>
While I'm at it I'll plug the Neuspeed 25mm front sway bar.
It fixes the body roll of the stock G-60 and shows you what the
definition of "cornering power" is!

<p>
I will admit to lusting after the shifter and the revised spring &amp;
bushing rates of the VR6 Corrado...<BR>

My car does not knock. If I put shit gas in it I'd bet it would though! The wear

is a bit tougher to quantify. Every production engine is under-stressed for long

&gt;Anyway, the timing and injection stuff can be modified by purchasing a new
&gt;Digifant (Bosch) chip from Autothority in Virginia.  Although it requires 92
&gt;octane gasoline, it does improve the performance of the engine -- and they've
&gt;reworked the throttle curve a bit to make it "feel" peppier.
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You also get about 15-20% better gas mileage, as a bonus.  And you'll still
&gt;pass inspection, no problem.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;They also have another chip that works in conjunction with a smaller pulley
&gt;to improve horsepower very considerably -- without radically reworking the
&gt;wiring the way the APS upgrade does.  Just replace the pulley and chip and
&gt;go.  Don't have any experience with it, though.
&gt;

<p>
The second kit that Dave is talking about here also includes a fuel regulator
from Porsche 944s.  Couple of my friends have this stage II kit in their, and
compared to my girl friend's stock Corrado, it's just unbelievable.  There
is so much torque available at low rpms, and the power delivery is very
smooth and progressive.  They used Varicom, a car performance measuring
computer, to test 0-60, and the result was 7.1 or 7.2 sec with skinny stock
tires doing lots of wheel spin.  On autothority's dyno, the horsepower
increased to about 190bhp.  So, If I had a Corrado, this stage II kit would
be the first thing on the option list.

I'm following up to a slightly incorrect article; sorry about that.

<p>
Anyway, the timing and injection stuff can be modified by purchasing a new
Digifant (Bosch) chip from Autothority in Virginia.  Although it requires 92
octane gasoline, it does improve the performance of the engine -- and they've
reworked the throttle curve a bit to make it "feel" peppier.

<p>
You also get about 15-20% better gas mileage, as a bonus.  And you'll still
pass inspection, no problem.

<p>
They also have another chip that works in conjunction with a smaller pulley to
improve horsepower very considerably -- without radically reworking the wiring
the way the APS upgrade does.  Just replace the pulley and chip and go.  Don't
have any experience with it, though.

        Well, I went and installed the AutoThority Stage II kit in my
Corrado this weekend. I bought and installed this kit with some
reservations and visions of my supercharger self destructing, or
maybe a piston flying through the hood...
        I did the installation at my dad's garage with several VW
technicians watching me every step of the way (they only get to
do oil changes on Corrado's at this point of their product life)
so watching someone rip apart the Digifant computer was interesting to
them. The AutoThority kit is fairly easy to install if you have a
fully equipped garage at hand, even if you don't the only thing you
need to do it is an air impact wrench. You must be careful and take
your time, you're playing with an expensive motor and delicate things.
I got the kit installed in two hours, one hour going to changing the
chip, the other to changing the supercharger pulley and fuel regulator.
        Impressions: well all I can say is, VR6's WATCH OUT! The car
will launch explosively in all gears now at almost all rpms. The
increase in supercharger speed means that the car responds at low
rpm much, much better. It is much easier to get out in traffic now
without having to floor it and wait for the rpms to come up.
        On the highway, the engine seems to have to labor much less
with the cruise control when going up hills. The engine has more power
whether the boost is on or not, due to the higher fuel delivery and
advanced timing. It feels a lot more like driving the VR6. The big
mushy spot from 1/4 to about 3/4 of the way down on the gas pedal
is pretty much eliminated. My highway gas mileage actually went up
with this kit, my city mileage still remains the same (about 20).

<p>
        Benefits:

<p>
        Throttle response immediate<BR>
        Gas mileage went up to 30.6 on highway
        More farhvergnugen<BR>
        Fairly easy to install<BR>
        Car is just as docile and well behaved when driven
        normally.<BR>
        Fewer parts to install than APS's stage II
        Kit is based on the chip, not an add-on analog
        fuel enrichment system like Neuspeed's.

<p>
        Non-benefits

<p>
        Probably destroyed any notion of a warrenty
        G-60 spinning faster - noisier, might wear out faster
        Temptation to accelerate like a bat out of hell
        Might wear out engine mounts faster, also the seat
        backs are taking more of a strain holding you up
        from the high g-forces.<BR>
        Doesn't include an exhaust upgrade

<p>
        If anyone has more specific questions, feel free to email me.
BTW, I bought the kit from AutoTech, not AutoThority itself, because
AutoTech has a 10% off sale on them right now. I called AutoThority
and they seemed psyched to support the kit, and I told them I was
thinking of using Neuspeed's supercharger cam, they said fine,
let us know and we will send you a chip tuned for the cam.
They are working on an exhaust upgrade also.

        No, haven't heard any knock. The engine temp has remained the
same also. The car is so much more responsive, it's great. All
complaints about lack of response that I had with it are gone.
The cooling system seems to be under no more of a strain at all.
I would say that the lower temp thermostat and fan switch Neuspeed
provides in his kit are largely unneccessary. When I drove my Corrado
hard before I installed Stage II, the oil temp would hit the 220's. I
haven't seen it go higher yet. What's really amazing is that your
highway gas mileage goes up noticably. To maintain 65 mph requires a
bare touch on the gas pedal.<BR>

        I was told by a VW technician that as soon as I installed
stage 1 I had already voided the warrenty by opening the computer
box, hence my decision to go for stage II. Of course, hiding a
chip change is a lot easier than a pulley, although my engine
still looks very stock to anyone not knowing what to look for.
        I have been using natural oil, 10-40 and 20-50 up to
the present (Quaker State), and will probably switch to Mobil-1
soon. My roommate used that slick stuff in his last oil change
and said it made a difference to his engine. I don't think I
need to use it if I switch to synthetic.
        It's pretty amazing that with the extra 30 hp my engine
temps still seem the same as before. I highly recommend this
kit - go for it!<BR>

        I made backups of all my chips, the original VW chip, the

easy if you have access to a Data I/O or something similiar.
        Have you played with the suspension yet?

<p>
In rec.autos.vw you write:

<p>
&gt; Has anyone bought one of them? What is the differnece between them,
&gt; and what do you get with them?

<p>
I sold a couple of used stage one's before (as a retailer), basically stage one
contains only a chip, but stage two contains a chip and a bunch of hardwares
like pulley, mufflers, themostate, etc..

<p>
&gt; The Stage II kit supposedly includes a 'smaller belt' for the super-charger
&gt; to make it spin faster. What would this do to it? Any horror stories from
&gt; anyone?o

<p>
I have heard horror stories about stage II kits overheated the charger and blew
up the engine. I only recommend chips + cams + exhuast but not the stage 2 kit.
The stage 2 kit is very lumpy when it doesn't blow up. :)

<p>
&gt; Cost/dealers and horsepower gains would be great if you could list them.

<p>
the stage one chip is excellent, it gives a solid 11hp gain, and a 33% increase
in low-end torque (where a gain is needed most). A new Authority could cost
over $300 CND for a dealer.

<p>
A Neuspeed cam promises 15hp, and is a very mild cam, cost about $300 also

<p>
A stage II Autothority promises 27hp, and it would cost well over $1200.

<p>
A Neuspeed stage II also gives out 27hp, and it is about $800.

<p>
Frankly, I don't know whether Neuspeed or Autot. is better, I used to think
Autot. was better, but some people told me that Neuspeeds are just as good if
not better.

<p>
Hope it helps...

Howdy. My car is running well, if a bit roughly lately, I think it just
needs a little Techron or new plugs. Still puts down the power like a
stock G(utless)-60 could never dream to. No problems. Never burns oil.
(I just switched to Mobil 1) I think the valves might be getting a teensy
bit louder but this might be my imagination. (Or I need a tune-up.) It
does ping a slight bit at 3/4 throttle but now I'm being picky.

<p>
My transmission is getting harder to shift but it wasn't a joy to begin
with so I suspect that this might be wear &amp; tear on the synchros.

<p>
My luck isn't so good...It just seems to be a dent magnet lately. 8^(

I have sat in but never driven a VR6 Corrado yet.

&gt;I am interested in fitting Bosch electronic injectors in my VW 8V head
&gt;which currently has those skinny CIS injectors.  Why?  I want (need!) to
&gt;run a Haltech F5 injecton system to try and fix some severe fuel delivery
&gt;problems.

<p>
&gt;This was due to the supplimental injected fuel
&gt;trying to turn the relatively sharp corner from the throttle body into #3
&gt;&amp; #4 (the manifold was designed as a dry flow manifold and thus did not
&gt;account for the momentum effects of fuel droplets).

<p>
Electromotive makes a nice setup that includes direct ignition that
looks like it would do exactly what you want.  I'm planning on using a
TEC-II system with direct ignition on my 88 Civic (will most likely be
using an Aerodyne Aerocharger).  I never really liked the injection
system on my Motronic 16v Golf or Digifant II G60.  The VR6 Motronic
with a MAF sensor is a nice setup except for the distributor and the
fact that it's non-sequential.  On my old G60 I managed to melt a
piston down somehow so I took the opertunity to bore it to 82mm with
Techtonics pistons, 144mm oiler rods, 16v flywheel, clutch, 2Y gearbox
with rod linkage, 260/420 cam, 68mm blower pulley and the 944 Turbo
fuel pressure regulater.  Tip for any of you G60 owners who think $500
or whatever is a bit much for a pulley and a pressure regulator.  I
had machine shop make a duplicate of a friends Neuspeed pulley for
$50, and the regulators Bosch part # is 0 280 160 263 from a 944 Turbo
and cost me $85 can.  The cam was from Autotech and is the same as
APS's for half the price ($99).  The chip I suppose you ought to buy
since it is software, but I have an Eprom burner... California Imports
sells the G60 stage III kits for a little over 8 bills and the same
stuff cost me about $250, surely someone is making quite a tidy profit
here.  After all was said and done, the car was ok but I don't think
supercharging is the answer.  If I was going to spend that much
time/effort etc. on a Corrado again I would do a 2L 16v with
aftermarket injection/ignition, and an Aerodyne turbo.  And I would
keep the 02A gearbox, add the later style spacers and the VR6 balance
weight b/c it has more favorable ratios for a done up motor.  As to
your original question, the Bosch injectors fit on the 16v head so my
guess is they would fit on your 8v head, but if not, a digifant head
shouldn't be hard to come by... :)  Shawn @ Ron's Parts had an Audi
Turbo manifold on his G60 Cabrio which is supposed to make a Big
difference in top end breathing which you might want to look into.
They seem to be all the rage around here but I've never tried one out
myself...anyone have any opinions or flowbench figures on this setup?

My own Autothority experience:

<p>
Just two days ago, I installed an Autothority Stage II kit in my '90
G60. This kit consists of pulley, chip and uprated fuel pressure
regulator. Before that, I had a Stage I, which is a chip only.

<p>
Stage I was better than stock in every way. Started better, ran
better, better fuel economy, better power, but perhaps most of all,
much improved smoothness and quicker throttle response. The only
downside is that according to Autothority, you can't use &lt; 92 octane
gas. I didn't before, anyway.

<p>
If Stage I was noticeable yet subtle, like a bit of ginger perhaps,
Stage II was more like a nose full of cayenne. The engine feels and
sounds entirely different. Whereas G60 and G60 Stage I are pretty
quick, G60 Stage II feels like it could outsprint most cars. Brutal, a
bit dangerous, and oh so sexy. Hold onto that wheel when you tromp the
gas! ;-)

<p>
More sound coming from the engine, especially at highway speeds, but
IMO the sound has more character than it did before.

<p>
We'll see what I have to say about the sound after I take a little
road trip, which I'm doing soon.

<p>
One person I've talked to says Stage III (same as above + cam) makes
all the difference in the high end. Another says it's not worth
it.

        I can give some contrast on both the AutoThority and APS G-60 kits
since I've installed both. They both work quite well, the AutoThority kit
giving a little more power at the price of some driveability. The APS kit
delivers smoother power, but is more involved to install. Installing the
APS kit requires some cutting of the engine wiring harness, whereas the
AutoThority kit does not. Both kits make a lot of power. One thing
annoying and a feature at the same time is that the Gillet exhaust
upgrade that comes with the APS kit is good for 7 hp, but it drones
quite badly at some RPM ranges and makes the interior noisy.

Sounds like this guy Keith I talked to there once.  He tried to tell

hung up.

<p>
&gt;See this month's copy of _Wired_ for good article on this.   Based on that
&gt;article, Autothority is a bunch of f****** competent computer hackers.  They
&gt;have 3 different upgrades for G60s.  I've been considering it, would love to
&gt;hear from any who have them.  My concern is throttle response in mid-range,
&gt;rather than top end.

<p>
The Autothority Stage 2 kit will give you all the midrange you have been
hoping for.  Throttle response is great.  The true hackers are the guys
at Neuspeed who try to richen up the mixture by screwing with the cold
start valve and don't think that there is any advantage to ajusting the
timing etc...  Autothority went about the modifications the smart way.
The reprogrammed the computer to remap the fuel and timing curves.  Why
hack some kinda enrichment circuit when you can intelligently modify what
is already there.  If VW was to build the G60 like it was supposed to run
they would have done it like Autothority.

&gt; Then again, I'm not quite clear as to what exactly the P-Chip does
&gt; and it may be that it's not affected by other engine mods.

<p>
I'd be real curious to what Neuspeed says.  From their catalog, the
only thing I can tell it does is increase the rev-limiter.  Which in my
opinion is a waste.  If you look at the dyno curves from Autothority,
the horsepower begins to fall off between 5500 and 6000 RPM even with
the Stage 3 kit.  This can be verified by driving impression.  Peak
torque on the modified motor is still around 4000 or 4500.  So if
you shift anywhere near the new redline (7400?) the motor is way
down on horsepower and the drop in revs will still be above the peak
torque.  IMOH this isn't the way to go fast.  According to Autothority
the drop in power above 5500 is due to the lack in flow of the stock
head and intake.  The said their tests with different exhausts and
air cleaners gave them maybe 5 more HP.  They felt the costs didn't
oyt weigh the benefits.....Of course that doesn't mean I'm not
looking at a P-flow filter and Gillet exhaust.

&gt;I find your comment about the Gillet exhaust unusual. Gillet is amoung the
&gt;quietest of the performance exhaust systems. As well as having a well
&gt;deserved reputation for durabillity. Is the system on your G60 a one or two
&gt;muffler system? I have the Gillet on my '86 GTI, and really like the sound
&gt;levels. The only time I get a "droning" is a great sounding growl at full
&gt;throttle :-)

<p>
        The G-60 has completely different noise and sound dynamics than
a normally aspirated Golf. The Gillet in combination with the extra noise
from the supercharger which spins at a higher speed with Stage II does
create a drone at about 3000 rpm. You're right in that the sound from the
muffler is still quiet with the Gillet, but the Gillet kit replaces the
big resonator just behind the rear muffler in the G-60. The resonator
VW installed stock actually does its job quite well. The Gillet kit is
two piece, it provides a center resonator and center rear muffler to
replace the big resonator. G-60's don't "growl" under any circumstances,
they just make more supercharger noise as you rev it up.

Hello,<BR>
  I saw a post on the net awhile back summarizing the performance mods
available for the Corrado.  I am in the process (waiting for the kit to
arrive by mail) of installing an Autothority Stage III kit on my 90
Corrado.  Thought somebody out there may be interested.

<p>
The stage three kit consists of a new chip (different than stages I &amp;II),
a new smaller blower pulley, a 944 fuel pressure regualtor (higher
pressure, boost sensative?) and a new cam.  I am purchasing it through
a local shop for $760 (list $795).  The installation supposebly will take
4 hours (stage 2 takes three hours est.).  I decided to have a local german
car place do the install as I don't have an impact wrench to remove the
blower pulley and the cam change (only 1 hour?) doesn't sound like fun to me.

<p>
Anyway, Paul at Autothority (I call him Paul after sitting on the phone
with him for a good half hour) claims the following for his kits:

<p>
Stage I: Just a chip.<BR>
175 HP for $375

<p>
Stage II: Different chip, blower pulley and fuel pressure regulator.
201 HP for $595

<p>
Stage III: As outlined above.<BR>
217 HP for $795

<p>
I should have my first reaction in a couple of days.  He claims a G60 w/
stage III will run circles around the VR6.  I guess with almost 40 more
HP it should.  According to Autothority Stage III really only helps at
5,000 RPM and up.  I figured with the cam change it's a good time for a
new timing belt (I have 30K miles on my car). Should be nice for
autocrossing.

<p>
Autothority's test mule has 13K (according to Paul) very hard miles on it
with no breakage.  They clain no failures in any of the installations to
date.  They say there should be minimal loss of reliability.  They said
I'll be using a lot less throttle in normal driving.

<p>
If anyone out there is interested I'll post my driving impressions.  BTW
I helped install an Autothority stage II kit in a 944 Turbo and the results
were fantastic.  The kit took less than 1-1/2 hours to install.  The car is
a blast to drive.  With over 300 HP on tap it's great.  That's one kit
that I can very highly reccomend.

<p>
If anyone out there wants to call Autothority, there more than happy to
spend time talking to you, there number is: (703) 323-0919.

Jan,

<p>
I'm still trying to work out some bugs before I post my responce about
the stage 3 conversion I did.  But FYI,  I was a little pissed at first
because of the bad chip they sent me but they did Fed X one next day
Sat. delivery to me with no questions asked.  More than likely the guys
who installed it put it in backwards and nuked it.  So not much to say
there.  Initially the car would hesitate badly between 4,000-5,000 RPM
when under full throttle in 3 or 4th gear.  I called Autothority about it
and was told if it happens at a consistent RPM then they would modify the
chip for my at no charge to correct this leaning (that's what I thought it
was) condition.  Well, I tried the easy thing, two cans of fuel injector
cleaner, and it went away.  So throw in a can regularly.  The car pulls
very strong.  For my boring driving, flat Florida roads, it could still
use some more power.  I'm spoiled by my dad's stage 2 944 turbo with
maybe 310hp.  217 doesn't cut it in comparison.  But to put it in
perspective.  On curvy roads, best I can does is on ramps and parking lots,
it hauls ass!  I have to admit I still favor the rush of the turbos over
the gradual build of the supercharger.  Although the car seems to really
take off over 4500.  There is also a kick at 3500 RPM.  Above 5000 it's
making serious horsepower.  There is a flat spot in the power between 4000
and 5000 RPM.  I talked to Autothority about this and they say it is due to
the cam and they can't get rid of this.  For anything but straight line WOT
acceleration, it's not noticable.  The car would be great for Autocrossing
with a little suspension work.  Right now the car hesitates a little when
it is first started and for the first 10 seconds or so when you start it
cold.  I'm going to talk to Autothority about this.  I don't know if the
car uses a seperate cold start injector or if the computer richens up the
mixture.  No big deal.  You just blip the throttle when it's cold to clear
it up.  But it's worth looking in to.  I plan on going to the dealer and
driving a new VR6 so I can make some better comparisons.  I'm also going to
drive a stock G60 after work to see the difference. It's easy to forget
how it ran before.  Also the mileage went down alot but it could be my
binary throttle operation.  I'll keep you posted.

<p>
I just got back from driving a stock G60 and I was a little dissapointed.
Either my car isn't running up to par or 60 more HP doesn't make a huge
difference.  My lowend is definetely better.  If you step on the gas when
the revs are down in a stock G60 it just sits there.  Mine takes off.
Overall it's faster but not by quantum leaps.  What really stands out is
the 5000-6000 RPM flat spot.  I might downgrade to stage 2 but I'm undecided
as of now.  I'll try a VR6 for comparison.  Side by side in a drag race
I didn't waste him like I thought I could.  In a hundered yards or so
its hard to tell.  It all depends on who wants to launch harder.

<p>
I guess I'm still happy.  My car is still over $10,000 cheaper than a new
VR6.  I wish someone else had a modified car around here to compare with.

Anyone else had this problem?  I use Mobil 1 in my Corrado (stage 3) due to the

I recently had the opportunity to race a friends Mitsubishi Turbo (Eagle Talon
clone).  The Talons are known to be very quick.  I don't remember the 0-60 but
the car has 195hp.  Anyway my car is a 90 Corrado with a stage 3 kit from
Autothority (210+ hp claimed...190-200  maybe).  We went from 0 to about 85mph
and the cars were almost dead even.  We also played on the freeway from 60 to
115 they're pretty close.  I'd like to think I had a slight edge but it's
hard to tell.  When you drive the two cars, the Mitsubishi feels faster.

<p>
The Corrado has been a blast to drive with the Autothority kit.  I could never
go back and drive a stock one.  I find myself driving the car much faster now.
The drivability is great.  The mileage (mainly due to my driving) has dropped
from 25-26 average to a little over 19 mpg.

<p>
For those who are curious, the top speed is 130 mph.  This has been checked
a couple of times.  I know..."But my stock Corrado does 125...." At least mine
did.  The peak power of the engine is at 6000 RPM after that it falls off
rapidly.  Peak fun zone 4,000-6,000 RPM.  If you look at the Corrado, 130 mph
falls right about 6,000 RPM.  Can't go any faster when the power is dropping off.
But I can get up there faster than stock, although the most fun is between 60
and 80 mph in 3rd gear.

        Neuspeed doesn't even claim that much power with their

to read way above what everyone else gets. You can probably count on
around 190-200hp with stage III, if you also upgrade the exhaust, which
AutoThority's kit doesn't provide. Neuspeed sells a Gillet middle pipe
and muffler for $300, but this exhaust makes the car drone at highway
speeds quite badly. The real soulution? Sell the car and buy a SLC!
        When I still had my G-60 I had every trick that could be bolted
to it, and was making probably 200-205hp. I didn't think the engine
was strained at all, but the car itself couldn't really handle that
much power well. You really need traction control with that much power
or the car becomes unstable.<BR>

I have the Autothority Stage 3 kit in my 90.  I'd reccomend it.  The only
negative I have is the mileage.  But then again, the way I drive it's not
that bad.  Average around 20-21.  Made one trip of 185 miles in just under
2 hours an got 17 mpg.  Sorry I used to have a sprint turbo (40+ mpg).
Double check the timing after install to make sure it's right on and
keep good clean plugs in the car.  As far as wheel spin goes, I have no
problems.  I use 205 Michellin XGTs on 15x7 rims.  The car can spin them
but you really have to get into it.  Personally I find the VW CV joints
and tranny a little to fragile for smokin' the tires. You will notice the
car losses HP above 5500 RPM.  This is due to the cam and the breathing
of the stock head.  So don't expect your top speed to go up.  You'll just
get there quicker.  Keep me informed how it works for you.  I'm very
interested.  Some people claim tire smoking performance but I've been
underwhelmed in some respects.  I'm going to try a lower temp thermostat
and fan temp gauge to see if I can cool the motor down.  It doesn't run
much hotter than stock, but even stock the oil temp is too high for my
liking.  I agree with Jan, the gearing does suck.

<p>
FYI:  for those interested,  a late model Golf or Jetta cooling fan will
work in the Corrado.  The Corrado fan is $250 and a used Golf fan is
$65-$75.  The blades are different (wont interchange) but the fan is
a straight bolt in and seems to work as good or better than the stock
fan.

&gt;2 hours an got 17 mpg.  Sorry I used to have a sprint turbo (40+ mpg).
&gt;Double check the timing after install to make sure it's right on and

&gt;problems.  I use 205 Michellin XGTs on 15x7 rims.  The car can spin them

<p>
        Interesting. I still used to get 27-29 mpg with my 90 Corrado
with Stage III and a Gillet exhaust, KN airfilter. My city mileage did drop
3-4 mpg though. I'm still convinced AutoThority tries to accomplish
a little too much with the chip alone. They dial in a lot of fuel and
timing advance, much more than the P-chip which you use with the APS
stage II.

        I installed the Stage II kit back when they had first developed
it and then installed the 260 deg supercharger cam from APS. I called
AutoThority about a chip to compensate for the cam and they sent me
what later became the chip for the Stage III kit. I noticed no difference
at all between the stage II and III chips. The cam however, makes a HUGE
difference. Much more midrange and top end, no loss (or minimal at best)
of low end. Fuel consumption is a function of your right foot in any
turbo or supercharged car. If you go easy you can still get 27-29 mpg
highway. The 260 deg cam is very mild and doesn't affect idle at all.
In fact, you can't even tell the cam has been changed until you get the
boost up and then all hell breaks loose. The stage II kit should not
be installed without the 260 deg cam, it makes that much difference.

When i was having problems with my car originally, I ran a stage 2 chip
with my stage 3 cam.  from what I can tell the stage 2 chip is just a little
leaner.  I'm sure there are alot of subtle differences but that is the only
thing I noticed.  Right now my car is running like shit!  It won't pull full
throttle.  The knock sensor cuts in and kills the motor the minute you punch
it under load.  I tried new plugs (usually fixes the problem) but it didn't
help.  It pulls real strong part throttle so I'm guessing the timing got
advanced some how.  I need to check it this weekend.  Of course after the
car got totally vandalized by some gang this weekend, I'm ready to dump it.
Did you know that spray in foam insulation can not be dissolved by any
common solvents?  And it does a great job of sticking doors, spoilers and
hatches shut.  Plugs exhauts pretty well also.  It even sticks to rubber.
And always keep your car heavily waxed so spray paint comes offf easier.

<p>
Wow my car needed wax!<BR>

&gt; Leaner? That's not that great for VW engines, they seem to like to
&gt; run a tad rich.

<p>
All the ones I have seen tend to run lean.

<p>
&gt; Do you notice a big difference between the regular cam and the
&gt; stage 3 cam? I am sure there is more power, but at what point do
&gt; you really feel the difference? How does it affect the low end?

<p>
I went straight from stage zero to stage 3.  I drove a friends stage
2 for a couple of miles but that's it.  I can't remeber much except
thinking that going from stage 2 to 3 was a waste of time for normal
driving.  There isn't much difference.

<p>
&gt; Perhaps your knock sensor died? Torqued wrongly?

<p>
I haven't touched it.  I'm going to try to retard the timing.  The
sensor is definetly working...working too good.

<p>
&gt; Bummer. I just saw an add for an SLC on the net. I was almost tempted.
&gt; The SLCs are 10 times better than the G60s.
&gt; Of course, if you are like me, I have my eye out on some 2nd hand 911s.
&gt; One guy here at work bought an '82 targa in mint condition for about 12k$.
&gt; Hope you have vandalism coverage.

<p>
I still think the best deal for the money is an 85-86 944 turbo with
a stage 2 kit in it.  300 hp.  It's like comparing the G60 to the SLC.
It makes the VW look like crap. I got scared of 911 when I priced a set
of cylinders and pistons (about $2k).  I'm sick of cars right now.  If
i want to go fast I hop on my motorcycle.  For less than 10K you can get
a bike that will blow away any car on the road.  My 55hp Ducati will
rip the Crappado apart.  Save the car for the grocerey store and when it
rains.

&gt;It's time to tune up my G60. Where can I get the K&amp;N air filter which

<p>
Dave,

<p>
Nuespeed makes the aircleaner you are talking about.  Personally I'd go
with the stock K&amp;N replacment and keep the original airbox.  The difference
in horsepower with the P-flow (cone shaped filter) is minimal and you will
get more intake noise and the filter will require cleaning often.  You can
temporarily pull the airbox out of your car and run it to see if the airbox
is causing any restrictions and losses of power.  You may notice a slight
increase in power but it could just be the increased noise level that makes
it "feel" quicker.

<p>
Why don't you want to try a chip or something?  VW tuned the motor so it
will run forever on any kinda crap gas you can put in it.  Face it, if
you had to put a warranty on it you would detune the hell out of it.  The motor
does have potential though.  I've run a Autothority Stage 3 kit for 30k miles
and a buddy of mine has about six months or more on the Stage 2 kit we
installed.  The difference in performance between stock and modified (mildly)
is pretty big. I just stripped the AutoThority stuff off my car to trade it in.
I just drove the car for the first time this morning in stock trim I left
the cam in, but it's a very mild one) and the car is slow.  No... it's a dog.
I am selling the engine kit.  If you want to make the car run like it is
supposed to, you're going to have to go the chip/pulley route.  If not, there
is nothing you can do with aircleaners, exhausts etc. that wiull give you
any real increase in power.

       I have a Corrado G60, and over here in the U.K there is a company doing
similar things to what you described.  I looked into this and was told that the
kit consisted of a PROM change to the engine management system, and a
replacement (smaller) drive pulley on the supercharger shaft.  I was told that
this would result in an increase of power from 160BHP to 190BHP, and an
increase of torque from 160 lb/foot to 250 lb/foot!!!  As my car is a company
car I decided not to go ahead with this, but I was assured that there would be
no long term damage to the super-charger if I did make the change.


<p>
Hope this helps,

I have a 90 Corrado and have added a Leistritz exhaust and a P-chip from
Nuespeed. The exhaust was a tremendous difference and as for the chip,
well, it wasn't worth the $250 big ones, go with a stage two or three but
then there is that cost thing. The P-flow is supposed to be very nice also
but you can 'make' one from a K&amp;N filter and some PCV pipe for @ 60-70
bucks.

I too have a 90 G0 Corrado with Leistritz exhaust, P-Chip and P-Flow. What I
found was a bit different. The Leistritz didn't really make that much of a
difference except hassle in getting installing so the pipe won't hit my rear
axle. The Leistritz sound pretty good and it does eliminates the suit case
muffler. The only problem is it occassionally have a loud buzy sound may be it
is a defect. As for the P-Chip, it is great I would not go back to the stock
chip. Also the P-Flow is louder but the response in the high end is fast. I am
still contemplating in going to Stage II and with APS or APE. Is stage II too
much power for the G60 Corrado? Any comments.

<p>

&gt;I'm not sure what timing maps have to do with anything.  Since most
&gt;functions are stored as lookup table in memory all you really need
&gt;to do is locate the tables and play with the numbers (in small deltas)
&gt;until you get what you want.  An example is A/F ratio tables and
&gt;multipliers.  Most Superchips merely run the engine richer than
&gt;stoich or at least richer than the original calibration allowed.
&gt;Another thing to play with is the top speed fuel cut-out calibration.
&gt;This is usually just a number in memory that can be altered to suit
&gt;the driver's needs.<BR>

<p>
MK&gt; Its that kind of "run the engine richer..." mod that causes
Superchips to ping and knock like crazy. Really. I have seen/heard
Superchips/Neuspeed and AMS, and went with AMS because they allow me
exactly what I need, ie, 7200rpm redline, so my 268 cam's can be used
effectively, increase throttle response WITHOUT knock or ping, no mean
feat specially with high lift/duration cam's, and retain VAG 1551
compatibility. The difference is in the R&amp;D.

Suggest you spend a bit more for a kit ie. Autotech Stage 2, or    Neu
approach. More boost , ,more poop. Autotech,s Stage 3 is a BIG improve
Use the Liestritz free-flow and a K@N air filter also.  Note: DO NOT a
more boost without more fuel enrichment !!!

&gt; What were your impressions?

<p>
        Yes, this is exactly how I have my wife's 91 G-60 setup right now. It works
great, better mpg with more power if needed. The engine very willingly revs to
redline now. I don't want to go with the pulley since the car already has 50k.
The loss of torque with the 260 cam and no smaller pulley is not that
noticeable.

<p>
&gt;2) The Momo Arrow wheels have caught my eye.  I saw a set of 17
inchers on&gt;a Golf (Feb European Car) and I liked the look.  Any onopinions?

<p>
        I think 16" is more practical, and looks as good. You are very limited in
tire selection also when you go to 17".

I have a 90 Corrado.I purchased the Neuwspeed stage 2 kit.It came with a
smaller s- pully &amp; a center Gillet muffler.The problem is;the new muffler
hits rear axel on hard acceleration.It rattles like crazy.It is driving me
nuts.My service shop has tried 5 to 7 times over the last 3 years and cant
get it to quit rattling. If anyone is in the rear seat it will always rub
on axil.Is it because the factory springs are possibly sagging or is this
just a poor fit? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS PROBLEM .It's so
bad I've thought of selling the car.(It makes it sound like a bug not a
sports car.)It is almost time for a new FREE FLOWING EXAUST SYSTEM.PLEASE
HELP ME. What will fix it? Or ,what system(brand) will work with a proper
fit?

Please give any help.   Troy (bihifi123@aol)

First, the data, with only a simple statistical analysis.

<p>
24 total responses, 2 lost a charger, 4 had small pulleys, nobody with a
small<BR>
pulley lost a charger.  For the 18 with original chargers and pulleys, the
average<BR>
mileage was 55,000 (range 26,000-90,000).  At charger loss mileages were
26,000 and 45,000.  Small pulley cars have an average mileage of 57,000
(25,000-82,000), with the small pulley used for an average mileage of
25,000<BR>
(16,000-44,000).  Both chargers were replaced under warranty, only one
person<BR>
gave an estimate of $2600, parts and labor.

<p>
Now, my IMHO analysis.  Charger loss is a small but significant
possibility.<BR>
Mileage is probably not the only important factor (If your chargers number
is<BR>
up...).  No data on whether the charger has any lifespan, such as 100,000
miles,<BR>
as turbos seem to.  Small pulleys do not radically (defined as an order of
magnitude) increase the probability of charger loss, but the data is too
sparse to<BR>
reveal even a major (factor of 4) impact on charger reliability.

<p>
Will post again if I get data that alters this picture much.

Hey all (espacially Todd and Andy),

<p>
Well the Q-Flow finally made it here today without being squished by UPS.
It took less than 10 minutes to put it in my 1990 G60...(maybe I was rushing
and couldn't wait to start the car.) And...well when I cranked the car, it was
anticlimactic; no change from stock...thought to myself "$100 for this"...
So I decided to go for a test drive (let the car warm up to 180deg oil, as
I cleaned up my mess and old huge airbox).  Then it came...I thought there was
someone next to me, but at about 3.5k you hear this sound that begs for more
gas, and you keep on giving it, until, well 6k comes around and you have to
shift, and then comes a surprise (it sounds like the car sighs) and you get
to go through this fun sound experience again.

<p>
On a more critical level though, the Q-flow is not audible (or very minor) if
the windows and the sunroof are rolled up, so should be good for long trips on
the Hwy, but then again I have the Leistritz "sport sound" exhaust, which by
no means is QUIET.  The filter itself is a K&amp;N, looks like an O (capital), ie
it is not a circle/ round cyllinder, but an O cyllinder (hope you understnd)
and comes with a connector and a bracket u-shaped that screws into where the
vaccuum pump is (under the now gone airbox), so far no rubbing, although the
filter is not in really tight, but I guess it's not supposed to. As for
throttle response, maybe (hopefully) there is a slight improivement, but
what I noticed is that when the supercharger kicks in at about 3k, the car
revs up a lot quicker in 1st gear than it used to, and is smoother over 5k.
Performance changes...I can't really tell...What I can say though, is that
I went for a 15 minute drive, and was gone for 75 mins, with a 23.1 ave mpg,
and I kept the car over 3k rpm most of the time...LOTS of fun....

<p>
Is it worth $100, I don't know, but I didn't want to spend $30 on a stock one.
And the sound is kind of fun...drove like a bat out of hell down Ocean Drive,
on Miami Beach, and people were turning their heads...I think I'm glad I got
it.  Now if only my wrist pin(s) were not making noise!!!!!


<p>
Any q's just ask, hope this helps...

<p>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Would be interested to find how many other people have the same  part.
&gt;<BR>
Jan was the first to mention this "Hecho en Mexico" stamp beneath
the airbox.  I removed my factory airbox to install a Neuspeed p-flo,
and sure enough, stamped right onto the body panel was "Hecho en Mexico."

<p>
We can rest assured that the assembly took place in Germany.  Mine
has "Made in W. Germany" on the door post plaque.  I wonder if the
stamp became "Made in Germany" after the fall of the wall in '90.
My cars were both made 11/89, as the wall was crumbling.

<p>
Speaking of body panels, I've checked out the new Golf and Jetta ///s,
and I'm afraid the body panels are just not as strong or thick as
the Corrado.  At least they are not as bad as my old Hyundai, you
could crease a panel by looking at it the wrong way.

<p>
Incidentally, there is a difference with the p-flo.  I find a quicker
throttle response at high rpms on my G60, like 3500 to 5000 rpms.
The sound is not really what I would describe as "sport growl" as
advertised.  It is more of an exaggerated supercharger "whooooosh,
waaaawaaaaahaaaaaha."  But it looks more trick in the engine bay.

<p>
Corrado: it's not just a Volkswagen, it's better than a Porsche.

<p>
I drive a corrado VR6, and I have Neuspeed race springs, SPAX adjustable
shocks, Neuspeed swaybars(front and back), Neuspeed tower bar, Remus
exhaust.In terms of suspension, I really like the way it set up, because I
like it really stiff, since I often go to the race track for lapping. I
belive your G60 will handle as good as my VR6 if you put the same stuff in
your car. If you want to modify your engine, I will suggest you to
purchase the Neuspeed power kit, including their cam and  their P-chip.
The stock exhaust from VW is a good one already no need to change. The
reason I change mine is because I like the Remus exhaust look.

I am still wading through all my mail...geez I get WAY too much
mail (~150 msg a day).

<p>
&gt; &gt;I have found that you can manually advance the timing for some
&gt; &gt;more power. Even with the knock sensor max'ed out you are still below
&gt; &gt;knock range of premium gas.<BR>
&gt; &gt;Just a guess.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; How many degrees are you advancing the timing?

<p>
I think a tooth or two on the flywheel. Not sure how many degrees
that corresponds to.

<p>
&gt; Is this on your stage III G60?

<p>
Yes.

<p>
&gt; What kind of power gains are we talking here? (Best guess)

<p>
I was having a decrease of performance after I installed the Stage III
kit at the low end. This helped compensate for it.
I may have other problems that I have not figured out yet.

<p>
In my opinion, the "factory" settings are ok for unmodified new cars.
For older modified cars, the ignition requirements change
and probably the only good way to tune a car like that is
through a dyno tune. I just did it by ear.

<p>
&gt; Is it worth the cost of premium? (I guess I'll have to decide this one!)

<p>
Stage III already requires premium. The low end is a bit weak,
still, but once it starts spinning, that G60 is like a rocket,
especially on the freeway. Just tap it and you see all the cars
that were next to you disappear in your rear view mirror.

<p>
&gt; The only time I was able to get my G60 to knock was right after I changed the
&gt; timing belt.  I installed the new one, and took the car for a spin (before
&gt; checking the timing).  When I nailed it, the car exibited a slight knock (w/
&gt; 87 octane).  OK, so I checked &amp; reset the timing, and now no more knock.  I
&gt; believe I have it set at 6 deg advance (per Bentley).  I suppose theoretically,
&gt; I could advance the timing &amp; use premium for a little bit more power.  But I
&gt; don't imagine it's much.  Comments?  Is it worth wrestling with that #$&amp;*ing
&gt; bolt to loosen the distributor?

<p>
I'd go with the chips first. Yeah that bolt was a MAJOR pain to get at,
took me an hour.

&gt;Sounds like an interesting proposal. You could reroute the plumbing from
&gt;the turbo to the intake of the intercooler and remove the bypass valve
&gt;(needed only with a supercharger).

<p>
Actually, it would be a good idea to leave the bypass valve in the
circuit - my SAAB turbo has one to prevent the compressor from
stalling when the throttle is closed under boost, so when you get back
on it, you don't have to wait as long for the turbo to spool up.
These are a popular aftermarket item for other turbo cars that don't
have them, since it increases driveability.

        Problem is, Neuspeed doesn't make a P-flow for Digifant cars because
its a waste of time and money.  A P-flow will do nothing for this engine
except make it real noisy. I would agree the extra cost of a lot of their
products are worth it in that they are generally well designed, but careful
shopping will sometimes find alternatives as better prices. You can also find
places like PlainWrap that offer all the Neuspeed stuff at generally 10% less.
I have been using the cams from AutoTech for years and never had a problem.
Why spend $179 for an APS G-60 cam when you can get it for $100 from AutoTech?

 This is in memory of my 1990 Corrado G60. It had all the goodies a G60
owner could want.<BR>
The engine had Nuespeeds HP kit, chip, 260 camshaft, K&amp;N filter, and my
own custom Intercoler. It came out of a, ahem, Renault fuego. It was
slightly larger than stock, but it had a highspeed fan that came on
above 5 pounds of boost. It worked awsome, and the fan was great on the
hot summer days.<BR>
The chassis had all the usual stuff. Sofsport springs, 22/25 swaybars,
Boge shocks, front and rear stress bars (all Nuespeed), VW Motorsport
A-arm bushings, and VR6 strutbearings. 15 inch TSW Evo wheels with
205/50 BFG Comp TA IIIs kept it glued to the road.
European Headlights (get them if you can, they are F'n awsome) rounded
out the mods.<BR>
In the works was a 16V conversion (I still have the motor if anyone
wants it. check my add in classified.) .
Unfortunatly last October a fuel line blew. By the time the fire
department got there my Alpine White G60 was char black. Most of the
accessories were detstroyed.<BR>
Luckily I had receipts so Mr. Insurance Man had no choice but to cough
up most of what I had into the car.<BR>
Many a Mustang GT and Camaro Z must of pondered why all they saw was my
tailpipe. Not to mention the early 80's 911s who wondered why that VW
symbol that so  sudenly apeared in their rearview could not be shaken
off.<BR>
My car was great. I miss it.<BR>
All is not lost though. My new project is a 93 VR6 Corrado. with more

 You can mount it in the stock location, but its a bitch to make the
mounts to hold it in place. I finally moved my battery to the trunk to
make room under the hood. Now there are two ways to get air to it. Top
( yuky taky hood scoop<BR>
but is easy ) or bottom ( nobody will know but you ). The second way is
the way I finally decided on. You have to cut a large hole where the
battery use to be which isn't much harder than cutting one for a yuky
taky hood scoop. Oh yeah, you have to go to the salvage yard first! Find
a Reanalt Fuego turbo if you can. You will find the intercooler on the
pasenger side. On the same side mounted to the front of the strut tower
are three pressure switches with various hoses and wires coming out of
them. I don't remember exactly which one you need. So take all three!
One is set to trigger at five pounds. The other two are over boost
switches for the turbo, and are set at somthing like 20 PSI and
obviously won't work scince you only have 14.5. You will figure out
which one by wether or not your fan works. The swithes have a small
screw in the top which I never messed with but may allow you to adjust
the pressure at which the switch operates. Anyways, you have to make
your own ducting to feed cold air to the intercooler. Be creative. You
can use most of the factory intake to plumb the intercooler. Although I
used a the aluminum pipe from a Saab turbo to attach the G-charger to
the intercooler. Ok you also have to plumb in the pressure switch.
Actually, on the Renault the aluminum pipe that crosses over the valve
cover has the a nipple for the hose that leads to the presure switch.
you need the nipple and you can folow the hose to the correct switch.
Well I've draged on long enough. you should be able to figure how to
wire and plumb everthing by looking at the renualt. Use your imagination
these projects should be fun, Good luck!

&gt; The time has come to get a performance chip for my G60. I know Jan rates the
&gt; APE chip the highest, and I agree by what I've read, I don't want to spend
&gt; $375 for the chip.  Neuspeed and several others make a stage 1 chip for $250,
&gt; and I don't think the APE chip is that much better to be worth 50% more.
&gt; I'd like to hear opinions on what is the next best chip.  Thanks.

<p>
Actually, John Hamill tried both kits and liked the APE one the best for
a variety of reasons (less noisy, more power, but less driveable).
However, in the mean time APS has done some more twiddling and may
have a chip with better throttle responce. Aaron figured out a way
to control the Airbypass valve better or something.

<p>
But in any case, the thing to keep in mind is where you think you may
end up.

<p>
Also don't buy from APE but from AT. I bought all my upgrades
during their yearly sales (June 24 this year) and after the initial
St1 only paid something like 100$ for the Stage II, 80$ for the cam,
and 100 for the chip upgrade (not on sale).
Can't remember how much I paid for St1, but it was a tad more than the rest.

<p>
Don't forget AMS, he's supposedly also coming out with a kit.
Try to sweet talk Marc into giving you a good price and that you'll review
it on the Internet ;-&gt;

<p>
A PS to all: If you have the power/torque numbers for the APS PChip,
I'll be more than glad to add them to my table.
Also feel free to verify the numbers I have.

BTW a neat tip. Take out the plastic splash gaurd from the drivers side front
wheel well. Then measure where the intercooler sits in front of it. Use this to
mark the plastic gaurd. Then using a ruler mark a grid 4"h x 6"w or larger on the

The holes will look like this:

Nope. Actually I haven't had to clean it out as much. Used to be that mud would

Yes the car is more fun to drive.  I still haven't tried the SLC yet...
Maybe I'm afraid I'll like it more.  And I must admit that the car
is rarely driven with less than half throttle now and I usually cruise
80+ on the highway.  The stage three cam has only a little more overlap
than stock so it shouldn't greatly impact the mileage.  If you drive the
car easy (55-60) then it will get almost 30mpg.  But this is very hard to
do.  I usually find myself whipping in and out of traffic at speeds much
greater than the limit.  If you have a stage 3 and are getting 30mpg then
you didn't need it to start with.

<p>
Now if I could only figure how to fix the "self-intersecting topology"
error I'm getting.  I wish Clive Sandhurst was still here....

  Well I finally got my car running good (?).  My first comment is that even
with 200+ hp I think the Corrado could use more power.  Is it fun to drive?
Yes.  On curvy roads the car is probably a blast.  For straight lines it needs
to either go on a diet or gain some more power.  My big problem appeared to
be nothing more than engine timing. I was running 8-9 degrees retarded.  I had
a friend drive the car and his comment was that he though the car was too fast
and that it had too much body roll.  I'll agree with the body roll but I guess
it's like anything else.  After awhile you get used to the speed and it seems
slow.  He thought the car felt like it had an easy 200 hp.  Oh well..now if I
can fix the oil leaks the rattles and the strange noise from the back strut.
And what about the way the exhaust noise changes (gets deper) when you hit
a bump or have 2 or more people in the car??

<p>
Can you resuse the valve cover gaskets or do you shell out $26 everytime the
cover is off?

<p>
I sympathise for all those people who said their stage 2 Corrados were increadibly
fast.  Yeah maybe compared to my 59 bug.  I guess driving a 944 turbo with
a modified engine (300+ hp) spoiled me.  Looks like the Corrados for sales as the Porsche has been offered to me cheap.  Hell, they don't cost anymore to maintain.
Parts for VWs are outrageous (just like the Porsche).  Might as well stick with
the beter car if they're going to cost the same to keep on the road....

I had a renault turbo intercooler in my G60 which came with a high speed
fan that came on above 4 psi. That was an involved project. You prbably
could find a fan to fit the stock cooler somehow. I was talking with
Turbo Tim about it awhile back. Arron at Nuespped was thinking about a
fan kit along time ago but droped the idea.

<p>
You can cut a hole behind the intercooler to help improve airflow.
Although I don't really know if it helps. Some people say that once you
get going, high pressure builds in front of the tire and prevents much
air from flowing through. ABT included a vent in their G60 hop up kit, so
I don't know, maybe it does help. Anyway, if you think your up to some
fabricating, I'll give you some more info on thr intercooler setup that I
had, or maybe I'll brainstorm a little bit on installing a fan on the
stock cooler. There's alot that can be done. later

I saw a G60 at the shows that has done this mod. He did it himself
though. It was not the Nuespeed kit. He ran a hose from the boost valve
to the t-body hose just like in the picture. You can also adjust the
bypass valve for more part throttle boost, your gas mileage may suffer
accordingly ( Rallye Golfs don't even have the bypass valve ).

<p>
Another mod you may want to try is a high speedfan for the intercooler. I
had a custom cooler on my G60 that had a fan, worked great. later

&gt; I was reading through the new EC and noticed the review of th "Corrado Gen2
&gt; Fuel Enrichment" Package from APS...<BR>
&gt; I talked to Aaron @ Neuspeed a few months back about this product, and he
&gt; was very optimistic about the gains that it produces in a 40k+ mile old
&gt; Corrado since the bypass valve for the boost starts getting sloppy...
&gt; What he also said, and it isn't in the article, that there is/will be a way to
&gt; tweak the new valve close later than normal----&gt;more boost without a smaller
&gt; pulley on some corrados!  He mentioned that you need to have a less restrictive
&gt; intake (as in a P/Q Flow)...<BR>
&gt; Has anyone tried it yet??????  At $199 it doesn't seem bad, if it does what all
&gt; of the above...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Tim:::I have made the mistake of getting the BOGEprogas for my G60 (guy at
&gt; Autotech said that his boss has them on his Corrado and they are great) and the
&gt; rears didn't fit with lowered Ho:r springs so I put in the stock ones in the
&gt; back...My Q...the progas shocks are valved soft and then hard when the piston
&gt; moves out of the "comfort" zone but they are made for STOCK A2, and since the
&gt; car is lower (mine is) the ride is very harsh, and in turns, one side moves
&gt; into the "comfort" setting (as the wt goes to the other side of the car) and
&gt; the car feels very un-Corrado like...(I told my mechanic that I should have
&gt; bought the Konis!!! and saved some money by not buying the progas and soon the
&gt; Konis...)  Maybe I should just get the TurboGas (which are the stock shocks)?
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; On a more positive note....I put a Mustang 5.0 to shame (it surprised me!)
&gt; I was going on the on ramp on the hwy, and he (late 80's convertible) gets
&gt; right up my bumper (I was going 30 on the ramp) so I pull off to the slow
&gt; lane and look over (this guy looks at the Corrado like it's a spaceship) he signals as if he wants to race so I nodded my head, but thought that it would be
&gt; close...We are going at about 45 at this time...We take off, and we are even up
&gt; to about 70 and then I start to get ahead...at 100 he is 5+ car lengths back..
&gt; I keep on going until 125...and he is nowhere to be seen :)  I slowed down to
&gt; 70 and he was back soon afterwards...I was feeling lucky at this time so I
&gt; signal for us to race again...but he doesn't want to!!!!!!!

&gt;<BR>

Did the mods on my `90 G60 today.  I bought a Stage 1 Chip from AutoTech for
$275, and the K&amp;N filter for $42, $10 for shipping.  Also got a Euro-Sport
exhaust system from EuroSport Accessories for $195+$20 shippiing.

<p>
Did the filter first.  I would suggest taking the whole air box out if you
want to do this, the clips are impossible to get off with the airbox in
the car.  Remove the air intake from the G-Charger (mine had a little oil in
it) and the 2 vacuum lines from the back.  There is a rubber band on the
inside and back of the box to hold it down.  Pop those off and it slides
out.  Saw the "Made in Mexico" stamp on the metal under the box.  Pop the 4
clips and put in the new filter.  Close the clips, drop it in, put the 2
bands back on, and reconnect the 2 lines and air intake.  Done.  Took about
half hour because I tried to get just the clips off, and also washed out the
airbox.  If I did it again, I could do it in 15 minutes easy.

<p>
Next was the exhaust.  Started by putting the car up on ramps and took off
the clamp at the back of the cat. and bewteen the 2 mufflers.  Tried to pry
off the hangers, but it's too difficult, the the new system included all the
hardware, so I just cut the old ones off.  Had to cut the pipe in back of
the suitcase muffler and pulled the rear off.  The rear muffler was in
pretty  good shape, and the exhaust pipes are really thick steel.  Next I
cut the front hangers off and dropped the pipe and suitcase muffler.  The
muffler had a lot of ruse and few holes, which is why I did this in the
first place, it was getting annoying.  The OEM exhaust system is really
heavy, I probably dropped 50 pounds with the new one.  The Euro-Sport system
has, in order from the front after the cat., a glass pack resonator,
crossover pipe, turbo rear muffler and tail pipe.  All clamps and hangers
are included.  The instructions are pretty poor, and I found that the best
way to put it together is to put the pieces on from front to back, pounding
them on one by<BR>
one, then putting the clamps on after it's all together.  I cut about 4" off
the tail pipe since it stuck out further than the bumper, and it was all
installed correctly.  Not sure if it was supposed to be like that, or if I
got the wrong tail pipe, but it looks cool cut short.  Sticks out about as
far as OEM, but it's silver.  The entire system is 14g steel, pretty big
pipes compared to the OEM system, and "aluminized".  It's a pretty good
system for $200.  Especially considering the OEM system is $1000.
As for sound, it's definately louder than stock.  It has that glass-pack
muffler rumble at idle, and has a louder tone as you accellerate, but only
at the beginning, as you get up to about 25 MPH and let off on the gas, it's
about the same, maybe a little louder than stock.  With the windows rolled
up, no radio on, you can only hear it at idle and when you first pump it.
Overall I'm pretty happy with it so far.  It took about 2.5 hours to do the
whole thing.  A lot of the time was getting the new pipes to fit, they're
really tight.

<p>
Last I did the chip.  What a job.  Took me about 60-75 minutes, I didn't
time it.  The instructions are pretty poor, they should include some simple
pictures.  First you pry up the cover over the "brain" and remove the cover
over the air intake.  It took me about 10 minutes extra to clean it out.
There was about a whole tree worth of leaves stuck in there.  I'm going to
start cleaning this out regularly now.  After pulling out the intake cover,
you remove one nut for the box frame, pull one vacuum line and snap off the
main electrical cable.  (anyone know what the vacuum line is for?)  After
this, patience is neccessary, since you have to slide the box and it's metal
frame to the outside of the engine compartment then pull it out.  It's a
trick taking it out.<BR>
Next you take out 2 screws to get the box off, then 7 screws to open the
box.   Next comes the what I thought was the hardest part, getting the
stupid plastic clips off the IC board.  Take out 5 screws to get the RF
shield off<BR>
the chip, pull the chip, put in the new one and put it all back together.
Again it's tricky shoving it back in the car.  Once it's in, it's pretty
easy to reconnect it all and finish.  Luckily it started back up so it seems
everything works.

<p>
I love the difference in the ride.  I haven't done the after measurements
yet, but the car seems to have the pull at 2500RPM that it used to have at
3500, which is a big difference.  Maybe I think I feel it since I'm pretty
excited about the whole thing, but it's definately better.  I'll get the
"after" times done in the next couple days and post them.

<p>
Start to finish the whole job took 4 hours.  I wasn't rushing and took a few
breaks.  If you have all the right tools and manuals you could do it all in
3 hours easy.

<p>
Now the car is lighter (only by about 50 pounds), faster and louder.  Next
step is new springs and shocks, but I'll wait till the stock ones are bad.

&gt; I have a similar question except that I am running stage III (APE, not
&gt; Neuspeed). My problem is throttle responce...power is there, but
&gt; it takes a while for the thing to "wake up" when I push down
&gt; the accelerator (that's so great about the VR6).
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Does anyone else have this problem?<BR>
&gt;

<p>
I have the Autotech stage II, and have had the same problem. Even before I put
in the stage II, it would hesitate before ~3000 rpm. The strange thing
is, sometimes it wouldn't. Shifting from 1-2 the boost would stay up on occasion
but usually just bog a little. Stage II helped a lot, but the basic problem
remained. The boost just would't go above 5 lbs (stock) until a certain rmp,
then the car would take off.

<p>
Going by what was said in EC about the kit, I went about trying out some mods.
The idea is to prevent the idle/boost valve from venting the bypass tube into
the exhaust manifold. So I tried the following:

<OL>
  <LI> Disconnect the plug on the valve. Theory: the valve is at some closed
  position(I hoped!) and the ECU will open it up screwing up boost. The problem
is that it is not closed fully, loosing some boost. Max boost is no longer
limited at redline (6200) but keeps climbing -&gt; 14.5 psi!
  <LI> Undo the hose to the bypass tube, plug the bypass tube, reconnect
  the connector to the idle valve. Bad idea. Drove just like normal, except
  for a whoosh when I exceeded max boost (as det. by ECU).
  <LI> Plug both bypass tube outlet and idle valve inlet. I think that this
  accomplishes the same thing as Neuspeed's kit except for idle behavior.
 I had to use the idle screw to keep the thing from stalling. I now get
 max boost past redline, and it seems to give me more boost at low rmp's also.
 Also, the throttle response seems much more linear at lower rmps.

</OL>
<p>
As for the fuel enrichment, I'm of the opinion that it's needed for their
kit since they kludged a fix in the first place. The Autotech does fuel
enrichment through the ECU, and should be ok. A new sensor is not going
to allow more fuel through the same injectors, etc. Besides, they put it
in for part-throttle boost. I hardly ever get part throttle boost, except
cruising at say 100mph.  Not worth $200 for the air bypass setup alone.

<p>
I've only had this mod for 1 day so I'll keep you posted.

I just got off the phone with Aaron at Neuspeed asking him about the fuel
enrichment kit. First of all it was really nice for him to return my call, I
never expected it and he call me twice to get to me here in Canada. My
question was what the kit would really do for my Stage I G60. The answer was
throttle response for all G60 from stock to Stage III cars for both APS and
APE kits. I am not going into details, he pretty well said what was written
in EC. I am going to give it a try, if anyone gets this kit earlier give us
a response/comment on the Corrado list.

Could someone please explain to me how the APS fuel enrichment kit
works?  I've read and reread the EC article, and am still bamboosled!
It looks like the kit rerouts the intake to teh idle stab from the
bypass duct to the boost duct.  I am guessing that the pressure the idle
stab "feels" will be greater now.  Is this true?  How does this help?
And then there's the fuel enrichment "hobbs switch".  What's that?
I understand (from the article that this adds fuel during high boost
non-full throttle conditions.  Do I need this even though I don't have
a smaller pulley?

<p>
Also, there is an adjustment for the boost bypass valve, but bentley
says "do not change from factory position", but then goes on to tell
how to check &amp; change using some funky protractor &amp; arrow.  Anyway,
has anyone ever fooled with this to increase boost by preventing the
valve from opening at "factory" positon?

<p>
One more thing, in EC, is says that the idle stab can be adjusted to
some extent, but this new kit bypasses it all together.  Does anyone
know what this "adjustment" entails?  Can I get away with adjusting this
valve &amp; not shelling out 200 bucks for a lousy t-fitting a ft long piece
of hose, some tie-wraps and a relay switch (I think that's what that
"Hobbs" switch is).

<p>
Thanks in advance.

This is true. The bypass tube "T" is plugged, as well. (where the hose to
the idle stab. used to go)

<p>
&gt; stab "feels" will be greater now.  Is this true?  How does this help?

<p>
Letting air through the bypass tube into the intake reduces boost. The valve
opens up when the ECU thinks you don't need any more boost. By taking the bypass
tube out of the loop (the valve at the throttle body is closed at full throttle)
boost is maximized.

<p>
The only reason the idle valve gets its air from the boost tube is for idle
control.

<p>
&gt; And then there's the fuel enrichment "hobbs switch".  What's that?
&gt; I understand (from the article that this adds fuel during high boost
&gt; non-full throttle conditions.  Do I need this even though I don't have
&gt; a smaller pulley?

<p>
Maybe, but I can't see a high boost part-throttle situation. The boost does
not occur until the last 1/2 inch of gas pedal position, anyway. At full
throttle the microswitch on the throttle body enriches the mixture, so
if you want to go fast, floor it. (Maybe in autocross things are different)

<p>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Also, there is an adjustment for the boost bypass valve, but bentley
&gt; says "do not change from factory position", but then goes on to tell
&gt; how to check &amp; change using some funky protractor &amp; arrow.  Anyway,
&gt; has anyone ever fooled with this to increase boost by preventing the
&gt; valve from opening at "factory" positon?
No, but I think that you can change the point at which boost occurs. My
worry is that by adjusting it too far, the valve opens again at full throttle,
limiting boost.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; One more thing, in EC, is says that the idle stab can be adjusted to
&gt; some extent, but this new kit bypasses it all together.  Does anyone
&gt; know what this "adjustment" entails?  Can I get away with adjusting this

&gt; of hose, some tie-wraps and a relay switch (I think that's what that
&gt; "Hobbs" switch is).

<p>
I haven't tried adjusting the valve, but did bypass it altogether for $0.
What i did was insert a plug into the bypass tube where the hose to the
idle stab. hooks up. Then I put the hose back on. The effect is the same
as just plugging up the hose. That way no air can come into the air stab or
out of the bypass tube. Has the same effect as the kit (w/out fuel enrichment,
which I don't think is necessary @full throttle). I did have to adjust the
idle screw (on the back of the intake manifold) to keep it from stalling. This
is why they use the boost tube to supply air to the stab. valve. I'm going
to do this as soon as I get some time, but for now I know what $200 buys.

<p>
Boost is much more consistent, and a little higher as well. Boost does not
drop at redline, but keeps going. I can now crawl along at 1500 rmp in 1st
without bobbing my head back and forth, too. It's worth the trouble, and
you can't beat the price.<BR>

With the G60, the Autothority Chip is much better than the
Neuspeed.  (it's cheaper through Autotech)  I've never compared
two VR6 chips, but the Autothority I did try and it makes some
difference though nowhere like the enormous difference the G60
chip makes.

By now most of us have heard of Aaron new "Generation 2" Idle
by pass doo hickey to alleviate the idle bypass valve leaks
robbing us of our much needed power.

<p>
Apparently, Dana of Autotech is working on something similar.
All it is, is a one way valve that you insert between the idle
valve and the high pressure side (or something) rather than
Aaron's by pass system.<BR>
They both would seem to achieve the same result in different ways.

<p>
Not a plug for either one, just want y'all to be informed about
the alternatives and what's cooking, don't know which works "best".

A few days ago, I posted something about my understanding of the
differences between the Neuspeed and APE Stage II kits.

<p>
Imagine my surprise when I picked up the phone just now, and it was Aaron
Neumann from Neuspeed!

<p>
He took a nice chunk of time to provide me a wonderfully detailed
explanation of what's going on with the ECU, valves, Neuspeed Stage II,
etc.. I am grateful to him for this, even more so because his only
motivation was setting the record straight, since I already have the APE
stuff!

<p>
My previous understanding was just plain *wrong*. Apologies to him, and
also to those who listened too closely to what I said.

<p>
Here's a summary of what he told me, to the best of my understanding.

<p>
For anyone who wants the real story, he encourages you to *call him*.


<OL>
  <LI> Different chips for different pulleys and cams shouldn't be necessary.
Any G60 chip encodes a 16 x 16 matrix, with RPM on the horiz axis and
manifold pressure (vacuum to boost) on the vertical axis, so the same chip
can give different results depending on boost &amp; RPM.


  <LI> Neuspeed kit does not trick the "cold start valve". According to
Aaron, there is no cold start valve on the G60--the cold start valve
existed only on CIS mechanical FI systems. (Don't know where I got this
idea. Anyone else heard this?)


  <LI> Stock fuel pressure regulator is more than sufficient even with the
smaller pulley.

&gt; &gt; I have a stock G60 and was wondering if anyone recommends
&gt; &gt; a stage I upgrade over another. I read the faq and I can't
&gt; &gt; find what I am looking for. the APE chip is $375 and
&gt; &gt; neuspeed is $255. is the APE worth the 120 bucks extra??
&gt; &gt; now, regardless of price, can anyone recommend one chip
&gt; &gt; (based on personal experience say)?
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I had the APE chip ("Stage I") for a while. Now I have the APE Stage II, which
&gt; consists of a smaller pulley, a higher-pressure fuel pressure regulator, and a
&gt; different chip.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Stage I alone made a BIG difference in drivability and fahrfergnuegen. Made a
&gt; noticeable difference in performance, too. Easy enough to install, once you get
&gt; the $!@%^! clips off the HVAC air intake.
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I have no experience with the Neuspeed chip.
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I am inclined to believe, however, that the APE chip would work better, based
&gt; on the fact that APE sells different chips to you depending on whether you have
&gt; a smaller pullley, different cam, etc., whereas Neuspeed is "one chip fits all".
&gt; Also, the APE Stage II increases fuel flow with the higher-pressure FPR, which
&gt; is what the Bosch FI book suggests, whereas the Neuspeed kit increases fuel flow
&gt; by tricking the cold start valve, which the Bosch FI book *specifically*
&gt; recommends *against*.

<p>
This is a great way to sell chips. APE gets you to buy 3 different chips when
you only need one. APE many years back started with very agressive timing in
their chips and depended on the knock system to take care of the detonation.
This did not work and is why many people complained about pinging with APE
chips. Over the years they have slowly become more conservative and now have
timing values close to the same as Neuspeeds. Neuspeed designed their chip to
work with 92 octane fuel and their  timing advance allows you to use 1 chip
for all stages. The factory chip is designed to be able to run 14 psi as
there are fuel value's built into it to allow it to provide enough fuel at
that boost. What the chip does is increase timing and some fuel to help cool
combustion temps which are caused by the increased boost. If any of you are
so convinced that the APE chip is so much better I will send you a Neuspeed
chip to try in your G-60. Try it for a few weeks and then put your old one
back in and send the Neuspeed one back. We are also looking for anyone with a
APE chip in their G-60 who lives close to ND to come down and have us do a
back to back test. We need one that has the stage 2 or 3 kit. We will also
test the pressure regulator so you need to have your stock one also.
Neuspeeds believes there is no need for the regulator as the G-60 was
designed as a supercharged system and most of the car models tuners are
changing them on are aftermarket turbo's or superchargers added to a system
that was normally aspirated. The fuel values are in the chip and the system
stock is already designed to deliver enough fuel. There are even enough fuel
values in the stock program to be increased for a 2.0 liter engine. Raising
the pressure also increases the chance of leaks and fire. The Bosch regulator
APE uses boost the pressure about .5 bar.

<p>
&gt;Also, the APE Stage II increases fuel flow with the higher-pressure FPR,
which<BR>
is what the Bosch FI book suggests, whereas the Neuspeed kit increases fuel
flow<BR>
by tricking the cold start valve, which the Bosch FI book *specifically*
recommends *against*.

<p>
Corrado's do not use cold start valves and the Bentley book was most likely
refering to CIS systems or for non-boosted factory systems where the pressure
may help.<BR>
The enrichment set-up from Neuspeed takes care of the lean fuel condition
between part throttle and full throttle. The bypass tube prevents boost
leakage at the idle stabalizer valve, up to 2 psi more boost is possible. See
the August issue of European car pg.62 on the Gen2 update.

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Just installed my Stage II kit yesterday. After driving it for a day it
&gt; feels like I brought a new car, the throttle response and power is amazing.
&gt; There is just one problem. Occasionally at 1/2 or full throttle the
&gt; power/boost seems to  cut off for a split of a second and then kick in
&gt; again. It feels like a turbo lack but I can feel the lost of power before it
&gt; kicks in. I have disconnected the battery hoping to reset the computer for
&gt; the added boost but the problem still exist. Has anyone experienced this or
&gt; any suggestions?

<p>
I also experienced this on my G60 when i installed the kit. You have to
adjust a screw on the Hobbs switch that came with the kit. Call Aaron and
he'll tell you exactly what you have to do. I think the engine is cutting
the fuel off because it senses the motor going past the factories max.
boost setting. Easy fix.

I just recieved EC. That G60 GTI was at Waterfest 95. Very nicly put
together if I recall corectly. The intercooler he has was for G60 GTIs
with AC. The real Rallye Golf intercooler is very large (about the size
of your radiator) and mounts up ahead of the radiator. Also required to
fit it is the speacial Rallye Golf grill.

<p>
In hindsight, I guess my custom cooler was not all that easy to install.
It took some time. I wish somone would come out with a highspeed fan for
the stock cooler. My fan really did work, helped alot at those
stoplights.

&gt; &gt; I noticed that too ...Here in South Fla, wherre the humidity is 70-100%
&gt; &gt; and temps in the summera are in the 90's, the G60 feels really slow!  I
&gt;<BR>
&gt; A hot day will slow down a G60 a bit.
&gt; Did you ever touch those tubes coming out of the G60 after a good
&gt; drive? HOT, very HOT.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Has anyone looked into those exhaust manifold wraps that will leave the
&gt; engine bay cooler? (See latest issue of Compact Sports Car or something
&gt; like it).

<p>
I also wrapped all the intake tubes with this insulated foil type stuff.
The bypass tube is particularly important because it passes very close to
the exaust manifold, thuss picking up even more heat. Can't say what the
power gains are, but you'll find most turbo charged racers do it. I never
got around to trying the exaust wrap, I think most cars would beniftit
though.

I didn't experience 'HUGE<BR>
&gt;CHANGES' but I do feel a subtle difference.  Is it worth it?  Um...
not<BR>
&gt;sure.

<p>
Ditto with Tom there, I too did not feel any major differences.  But
then I didn't think that I could get my car to do any better.  With 80K
and AT Stage II it's sooo smooooth and rev happy already(knock on
wood).  Whether or not it's worth it depends on the outcome of the
installation.  Judging by the diversity of impressions, seems like one
will never really know until he/she put's the a kit on.

<p>
&gt;BTW, what are any possible complications we gen2-equipped G-60's might
&gt;encounter?  Is something getting stressed more than it was before the
&gt;mod?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Tom

<p>
Complications?  I hope none.  My understanding is that if anything it
would avoid further (possible) complications.

&gt; &gt;just that me taking it off the car would make it a) undriveable, and 2)
&gt; &gt;would cost be hundreds of dollars in stock hoses.
&gt;<BR>
&gt; You must of understood if you do not like it I would love to have the kit
&gt; back so you can try it without. Thats why these are test kits as we want
&gt; your feedback to determine what products we carry.

<p>
I was kidding about all that returning business... I like it and want to
keep it but am not sure if I recommend it yet... just made me laugh to
think of trying to get my car working again after doing all that cutting
and sweating over it!  I'll do the best I can to describe my reactions.
Judging from what the other G-60 owner posted on his reactions, I do see
some changes.

<p>
The 'vibrations' he referred to are something I personally attribute to
more torque.  And once I found out I had a Stage II kit in my car (opened
it to put the Stage I chip in.. saw a stage II.. you can imagine my
reaction) and got it working properly, I could feel more of a vibration
under acceleration.  I always joke that a supercharger or turbocharger is
this little guy sitting there blowing into the engine saying "you're big!
you're big!" and I guess I would categorize this 'vibration' feeling as a
more exaggerated small-engine-thinking-it's-big feeling.  And the gen2 kit
makes this feeling a little stronger (you can feel it in the seat of all
places and the in sound of the car) before half throttle.

<p>
I think (from what I have heard -- never found the August EC, you (Tim)
sent me April) that this kit is especially for higher mile engines.  My
engine has 4500 miles.  Sure, the supercharger, t-body, etc have 55000
miles, so maybe there's something there too.  I didn't experience 'HUGE
CHANGES' but I do feel a subtle difference.  Is it worth it?  Um... not
sure.  Maybe if I read the article to really understand what is going on
here (getting back boost that would otherwise have been bled off up to
about half-throttle?) I could be more specific.

<p>
BTW, what are any possible complications we gen2-equipped G-60's might
encounter?  Is something getting stressed more than it was before the
mod?

<p>
Tom

This past weekend I installed the Neuspeed Gen2 Fuel Enrichment kit
in my '90 G60.  Oh what a difference!

<p>
Installation o the kit was very straightforward.  Though I did have
to reference European Car's August '95's article to make sure I cut the
intake hose in the proper location.  Also, I had a slight problem with
the placement of the Hobbs switch because of a previously installed
alarm system on the passenger shock tower.  By tinkering with the alarm, and
the vapor hose bracket, everything fit just fine.
I used the scotch-loc wire splicers provided even though many people
don't like them.  Perhaps in the future I will change them with a more
'positive' connection.  The one complaint I have is with the stainless steel
tee.  It looks real nice on the outside, but upon further inspection, I found
that the inside was dirty, and the joint needed to be deburred.  There were
metal particles hanging on where the small 3/4" outlet was cut (inside, by
the weld).  I cleaned it up with some emory paper, and then washed the whole
tee.  I didn't want those metal particles sucked into my engine!
All in all it was a simple job.  I spent about an hour doing the install
( took my time, checked everything 3,4 times).  It could be done in 15-20
mins.<BR>
After install, I started the engine to check for leaks &amp; to warm it up.
The car started as easily as before (just a twitch of the ignition key
brings it to life), and idled as before.  When I got in the car, I felt a
bit more vibration thru the seat.  Was I dreaming?  More on this later...  I
drove the car a short distance and knew the kit was just what my 70,000mi
engine needed!  The additional power comes on at around 2600 rpm, and  KEEPS
CLIMBING to the redline!  The pull is VERY noticable.  The pull does not seem
to increase linearly, but rather in steps.  Not that this is bad, but rather,
different.  I wonder if those 'steps' are points at which the fuel is
enrichened?  Also, the engine seems to vibrate more than I've ever noticed.
 Why?  Dunno, but it feels like Power Vibrations! I wish I had run time tests
before &amp; after, but I was to anxious to get the kit in.  In fact, I brought
the kit with me on vacation, and installed it while away from home.  The trip
home was definitely more exciting!  Fuel economy seems to be about the same.
 Though the extra boost is fun to play with!  I got about 26mpg with the car
packed to the gills, 2 bikes on top, traveling at 65-75mph up &amp; down hills on
the Taconic Pkwy (Taconic is a hilly twisty road in NY :-)
My Opinion, Everyone who enjoys driving there G60's (that includes everyone
right?) should get this kit.  Especially those with high mileage cars. I
think New Dimensions sells them at a discount to the list!
Ok, I gotta go, my  perma-grin is beginning to fade.  I have to restore it by
taking my Corrado for a spin.

Well, I just (haven't even washed my hands yet!) got done installing the
generation2 "Fuel Enrichment Kit" for the G60.  Not sure what I think
yet... only drove it to make sure I didn't screw anything up.  I'll
hopefully be able to write more about the performance but I don't have a
boost gage, so it won't be too technical.

<p>
I've got a 1990 G60 with the Autothority Stage II boost kit that was on
the car for probably most of the original 50,962 miles before I got a new
engine from VW about 4500 miles ago.  Everything else (engine wise) is
stock.

<p>
Here's stuff about the install.  To be honest, this was the first
mechical install I have ever done.  Not that bad, really.  I haven't even
had the air box off.  The instructions are easy to follow and there's a
nice picture.  I had to call ND a few times just to be sure on a couple
of things, but I am paranoid when it comes to that stuff.

<p>
Joe at ND recommended using the stock hose that runs to the idle
stablilizer - it's got a funny elbow in it though.  I accidentally ripped
it so I had to use the orange heater hose Neuspeed supplied in the kit.
They are non standard clamps and I didn't have any good cutters, so I had
to use force.  Oh well.  Also, Joe recommended not usng the scotch locks
on the wires that the new pressure switch wires plug into, rather to go to
the plastic connector and reclamp them with new metal connectors.  I was
impatient.  You know what I did.  It's okay for now (and probably
forever - the scotch locks that is).

<p>
Oh, the first thing I noticed was that before the car warmed up, quick
taps on the accelerator did NOT sound good at al.. really sputtery, but
that went away.  Not sure if it's cause of something to so with the first
ime I ran it after the install or if it is permanent.  I'll let you all
know.

<p>
Anyway, went okay, might be a little more perky, but not sure yet!

<p>
Tom

I installed the Gen Fuel Enrichment. Now just the Pulley to go.

<p>
Installation Notes:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> I routed the wire to the back of the manifold by the fire wall instead of
over the cam cover like the instructions said. It was easier.
  <LI> I don't like the way the way the hose bracket sits now that the
pressusre regulator is installed. Tried to find another place for it but
could not.


</OL>
<p>
Problem:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> the plug supplied was kind of small.
  <LI> the metal T had also the bad finish on the inside and I had to remove
the weld particles with my finger. (I did not go as extereme as to
sand it, like another person did, but just removed the parts that
copuld of gotten loose.<BR>
  <LI> While I was cutting away at the hose where the T goes, I found a thin
layer of green oily type stuff lining the tube. I removed as much as
possible but what is that stuff? Where did it come from. It was in the
tube that used to go to the idle stabilizer as well. It that comming from
the intercooler? Should I worry about it?

</OL>
<p>
Impressions:<BR>
Contrary to the other 2 posters, I found that the kit made the car even
smoother than it was before. The low end lag is even less distinctive.
Maybe I connected something wrong?

<p>
Tests:<BR>
Not done yet.


<p>
BTW, The car has 56K Km on it.

hi jan:

<p>
i spoke with you about some time ago regarding the
audi intake swap on the g60. well, i went ahead and
did it despite your warnings that the gains may not be
worth the money.<BR>
what we did was swap the intake for the audi turbo one,
port and polished the head and did a three angle job on the
seats. also dropped in a shrick 260 but did not change
to the autothority stage 3 chip.

<p>
well, the car sure is faster now, but unfortunately,
we didn't see as much gain as with the stage 2 chip. we
are able to burn rubber very easily on first gear throughout
the rev range.

<p>
i drove ron's vr6 synchro the same day and was awestruck
by the power of the damn thing. it didn't feel the same
as the golf 3 vr6 i drove half a year ago-- it was faster.

<p>
well, i know i still can't beat a 5.0 yet but what else do you
think is out there? we are flat broke now but we need brakes.
any suggestions at all on aftermarket crossdrilled rotors?
is there a wilwood 4pot system for vw?

<p>
you also mentioned a more efficient intercooler. where can
i find out more about that?

<p>
sincerely<BR>

This weekend I sucessfully installed the Gen 2 Fuel Enrichment on my '92
G60.  It doesn't seem like it did much of anything although it seems to be
breathing better above 3000 rpm when accelerating hard.  When I take off in
1st and second the car seems to squat back more than I remember.  Anyway, I
only have 47k miles unlike the others who installed the kit and have more
miles.

<p>
Here are my comments and some problems:

<OL>
  <LI> My tee fitting seemed fine no big burrs that had to be sanded.

  <LI> I did not like the way the instructions tell you to move the plastic
holder for the vapor lines down on the bottom stud.  Then there's only one
stud holding the thing at an angle.  I opted to drill a hole just above the
top stud.  Makes more sense and looks much better too.

  <LI> Why didn't the kit have Scotch T's instead of those bulky ScotchLoks.
Anyway the wiring is solid and semi-neat with the 'Loks.

  <LI> I used the original hose from the idle stab. valve.  No need to have
that ugly orange hose in the kit.  The fact. hose has an odd bend in it
though not a problem.

  <LI> The rubber plug was too short and I had to ream it out with a dremel
tool because the diameter of the opening was too small.

  <LI> According to the instructions and the picture in EC magazine the T is
supposed to fit on a straight part of the hose.  I have a PLASTIC tube
running all the way to the back of the valve cover, then there is a 90 deg
elbow to the throttle body.  I had to install the T in the middle of the
bend and this was not easy.  Luckily the one chance I had to cut the hose
was ok.  Did Neuspeed check this out first on the '92 G60 !?

&gt;2. I did not like the way the instructions tell you to move the plastic
&gt;holder for the vapor lines down on the bottom stud.  Then there's only one
&gt;stud holding the thing at an angle.  I opted to drill a hole just above the
&gt;top stud.  Makes more sense and looks much better too.

<p>
Faxed your comments to Aaron and here is some of his response, he also was
not sure if you had any other mods as I an not either.

<p>
As for the vapor lines he did not want to force people to drill so decided to
do it that way but he may change the directions to say that as an option you
may want to drill a hole and do it your way.


<p>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3. Why didn't the kit have Scotch T's instead of those bulky ScotchLoks.
&gt;Anyway the wiring is solid and semi-neat with the 'Loks.

<p>
With the scotch t's you would have 2 connections instead of 1. 1 on the T and
the other on the connector that would plug into it. He did not say this but I
just realiazed it. We (ND) throw the Scotch junk away and go directlly to the
pin and use a factory connector and crimp it with the factory tool. Of corse
many do not have the tools so the next best would be solder and shrink tube.
The scotch things work but I have never liked them as some of the abuse and
failures we see in the shop are downright funny. ie... On James Slys Golf2
someone who I will not slam installed the front turnlens wiring using these
and when 1 did not work I wiggled the wires/scotch connection and low and
behold they started working. In the outside/engine enviroment I have seen to
many failures as inside the car away from the elements they seem to work OK.

<p>
&gt;4. I used the original hose from the idle stab. valve.  No need to have
&gt;that ugly orange hose in the kit.  The fact. hose has an odd bend in it
&gt;though not a problem.<BR>
&gt;

<p>
We do the same thing and Aaron may include a new factory hose instead or
include in the directions that reusing the stock is ok.
note: many times the factory hose is brittle and can crack when trying to
bend it to fit.


<p>
&gt;5. The rubber plug was too short and I had to ream it out with a dremel
&gt;tool because the diameter of the opening was too small.

<p>
You want it to fit verrry tight as it also has a clamp so being a tad short
has no ill effect except for looks. Simply a matter of what plugs are
available is why that one is used. We have no problems on the ones we have
installed.

<p>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;6. According to the instructions and the picture in EC magazine the T is
&gt;supposed to fit on a straight part of the hose.  I have a PLASTIC tube
&gt;running all the way to the back of the valve cover, then there is a 90 deg
&gt;elbow to the throttle body.  I had to install the T in the middle of the
&gt;bend and this was not easy.  Luckily the one chance I had to cut the hose
&gt;was ok.  Did Neuspeed check this out first on the '92 G60 !?

<p>
Aaron fessed up to this one and said there are not that many of those models
out with that style. He talked about a different design for those but the
cost would probally be much higher. It seems to only be a small production so
at this time nothing can be done.

<p>
As for your comment "It doesn't seem like it did much of anything"

<p>
What other mods are done on your C?? If it's stock then the improvements may
not be as noticable as ones with boost kits. A great way to test it for
yourself is to disable it and drive for a week then hook it back up and drive
it. just a thought.

<A NAME="1"><H2>VR6 POWER UPGRADES</H2></A>

<p>
Last update: Jul 25, 1995: Split into G60, GTI &amp; VR6 archives.

<p>
I collected a bunch of info on engine power upgrades for the
US versions of the Corrado SLC, VR6 Golf/GTI Jetta/Vento/GTX &amp;
Passat GTX as they all share the same  VR6 engine.

<p>
I have also included personal impressions of these upgrades.
This is not meant as an advertisement. I have NO affiliation
with any of the listed sources.

<p>
I also included items from a posting by:
tpaquette@ita.lgc.com (Trevor Paquette(Contract))

<p>

<p>
HOW THE CHIP WORKS (G60 &amp; VR6)<BR>
<HR>

<p>
There are several shops that sell performance upgrades in the US
(and probably Europe as well).<BR>
One is by AutoThority (AT, in VA) the other by Automotive Perf. Systems
(APS, in CA).<BR>
They both offer roughly the same packages, each of which boost
the power, though they use slightly different methods.
AutoThority also sells its chips (for less) thru AutoTech (CA)
and APS thru PlainWrap (for less) and others.

<p>
Note, there are also other chips available, such as from Advanced
Motor Sport solutions and Superchips. However, I have virtually
no testimonials about either of these, I cannot comment on their
efficacy.

<p>
Essentially what the chips do is to "recurve" the ignition
curves and fuel maps.<BR>
According to an article in Wired magazine, the German chips
are generally programmed for smooth city driving while more
aggressive at the top end.<BR>
(see http://www.wired.com/Etext/2.05/features/silicon.hot.rod.html)
By advancing the ignition up to knock point you increase
power, most notably low end torque.<BR>
The result is ca 20% more low end torque and 10% more max power.
The penalty is that you have to use high octane gas, i.e.,
92 US CLC Octane (R+M/2).<BR>
Note that there is quite a debate now which chip is better.
According to a few sources, the AT chips are more delicately
tuned, while the APS chips are less radical.
APS also uses the same chip for their Stage II system while
AT offers different chips for each application.
AT also claims that they tune their chips along the entire range,
while APS concentrates more on the top end.
See the torque curves below for a comparison.

<p>
One of the things to keep in mind is that the chips are upgraded
from time to time and some of the initial comments may not be
true anymore...

<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that the chips are not interchangeable
with other cars or even between model years. The maps are the same,
but the microcode in the chips are different.
The 92-93 Corrados with ECU code P &amp; CD, using braker ignition use
the same chips, while the later 93 Corrado with brakerless ignition
use a different chip.

<p>
Passat, GTI &amp; Jettas, apparently do not have a removable EPROM, and
require the thing to be soldered out.



<A NAME="2"><H2>OVERVIEW: SLC/VR6</H2></A>

<p>
As of 1993, both APS &amp; AA have been busy with performance upgrades
for the SLC.<BR>
The first upgrade is a chip which works in the same spirit as the G60
power chips.<BR>
The improvement is not very dramatic (7 Hp more), but both APS &amp; AA
claim it makes the car more drivable (a test below disputes this though).
The next upgrade is a throttle body.

<p>
The US throttle body has an air ramp right in front of the throttle
plate, restricting air flow. The upgrade (which is really the
European TBody from VW) does not have that ramp, and they claim that
the total package (chip + throttle + K&amp;N filter) added 30 road Hps.
The throttle body is rather pricey (about US$ 300), and I
you can't take your existing tbody and mill that ramp out because there
is not enough material in the casting.<BR>
Another difference is that the Euro TBody has a progressive mechanism
to open the throttle valve while the US has a direct hoockup.
This makes the low end more controllable but also seemingly softer
<STRONG>(IMHO).</STRONG><BR>
The third difference is with the potentiometer. It is also different
but I don't know how.<BR>
Initial experiments have shown that the TBody &amp; K&amp;N actually improved
our gas mileage for sustained highway driving from about 26 mpg to
about 28 mpg. However, if you use the power, you will use more fuel
than before. YMMV.

<p>
Removing the airbox funnel will benefit performance &amp; not produce the
G60 wailing sound. See also Intake_Mods for more info.
The sound of the VR6 with the airbox modifications is awesome!
It's not overbearing on highway cruizing, and each time you accelerate,
you get this nice deep growl.

<p>
Later 93 Corrados require two airfilters if the original airbox is removed:
one for the intake, a second (the size of a 1/2 US$ coin) for the airpump.
The kit that APS, AMS, and so on sell for the VR6 Corrados consists
of a bracket and an 8inch cylindrical K&amp;N filter, part number RE-0910.
If you are handy with sheet metal bending you can probably construct
yourself a bracket and save US$50.

<p>
After these initial upgrades, it becomes increasingly more expensive
to produce more power. Probably, the next logical step are a new set
of camshafts such as those made by Schrick (US$1300).

<p>
After that, the Variable Inlet Manifold (US$2300) may be the next
logical choice. I

<p>
&gt;From an unconfirmed source [bernie@metapro.DIALix.oz.au (Bernd Felsche):
&gt;No. The VW is *built* by a corporation. It is designed by engineers
&gt;who probably get as much of a kick out of driving for pleasure as you do.
&gt;Proof of that is in the VR6 option of a VSR (variable inlet manifold)
&gt;providing much more torque in the mid-range and available from VW
&gt;Motorsport. It has not appear in series production due to accountants.
&gt;Nevertheless, the designers developed it further so that it could be
&gt;offered as an "after-market" option.<BR>
See also VR6_Variable_Intake, VR6_Variable_Intake_MH &amp; the Pictures
of it.<BR>
t improves mostly the mid-range.<BR>
The problem is that the combination of all of the above may not
work that well to gether, and a few tuners are working on it as I am
writing this.

<p>
There are now also kits being offered by Oetinger that change the intake
manifold, cams and a few other things.

<p>
There is also a Turbo charger available from Germany (for 6000US$)
that will boost the SLCs power to about 300Hp, making the car virtually
unmanagable.

<p>
Note that the new VW/Ford Van, the Sharan, is supposed to carry a
turbo charged version of the VR6 producing about 250 Hp.
No parts available as yet.


<A NAME="3"><H2>TORQUE CURVES</H2></A>

<p>
The following data was inferred from the torque graphs supplied by
AutoThority (yes, I just eye-balled the values, but the resulting graphs
are fairly close to theirs).<BR>
The data is in ft/lbs, and it show, (US) G60 Stock, Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3,
and SLC Stock, SLC + AT Chip (SAT) and SLC + APS (SAP).

<p>
Note that I have no idea on the accuracy (or reliability)
of any of these measurements.

SLC:	Torque = 63.750 + 4.43E-2 x RPM - 1.62E-7 x RPM^2 - 7.21E-10 x RPM^3
SAT:	Torque = 68.374 + 3.55E-2 x RPM + 3.68E-6 x RPM^2 - 1.12E-9  x RPM^3

Last night I heard some interesting information in which Jan and a few others
might be interested.  My brother has a friend who owns a shop that, among
other things, has a rolling road dyno.  It seems when my brother was there
his friend was testing an SLC that had a Neuspeed "chip" installed (that was
the only mod).  Well, the results were very disappointing.  It had a gain
of *1* (yes, that's a _one_) horsepower at I don't remember what rpm.  It
actually *lost* 1-2 hp at other rpm and was no different over the rest of the
test (you can take your engine as high as you want, but if/when it goes bang,
it's your problem.  And yes, some engines do go bang :-).  In this case the
owner wanted the car tested to redline.  So, this is some concrete evidence
about one of the "chips" available for the Corrado.  One thing the dyno
obviously can't test is any change in drivability, but overall it doesn't
seem to be worth it in this case (at least IMO).

We have tested all the Neuspeed chips and we show from 4-7 hp gain at
all rpm points. Will have to post the results of the dyno test for all
to read. The 6 cyl. chips works great! Just like your Golf chip did!
Tom, there is not a chip for the 1.8 16V. Bummer!!

BTW: I bought the AutoThority chip for my VR6...I'm probably going to
return it.  A LOT of pinging, even with 92 octane gas + octane
booster.  I haven't really noticed any jump in performance either.
Still want to do a little more testing, but it looks bad.

I have the P-flow K&amp;N air filter setup and also the throttle body --

I also had the P-chip (all these from Neuspeed BTW) but took it out

I notice absolutely no difference in power below 5500rpm.  Perhaps
it adds some in the very high (with the chip that is) end but I don't `

don't do that much ( to the G60 they do make much more of a diff).

1992 VW Corrado SLC<BR>
<HR>

<p>
&gt;From: Jan Vandenbrande<BR>
Date: Oct/Nov 94

<p>
I just installed the VR6 TBody on our 92 Corrado SLC as the first
power improvements (other than K&amp;N) to this car.

<p>
It's an expensive piece of equipment, but buying directly from
PlainWrap you get a bit of break. The odd thing is, if you order
through plainwrap, APS actually ships it...so I wonder if PW has
become part of APS...Same box, shipping label == APS, etc.
I have never met the guys at PW, but my wife did while picking up a part.
They are a bunch of hard core racers and started this business (with
sales of computer software in the same office) to support their
racing expences.

<p>
Installation is about as easy as it gets, and took me under an hour
to do with some cleaning of parts included.

<p>
The main difference between the STock US TBody and the APS one is
that it does not have the restrictor in front of the throttle valve.
APS's TBody is nothing more than the one VW puts on their European
counter parts, and therefore it's a perfect fit. The part even says
VW on it and it is made by Pierburg (AAAHHHHH, memories of my Pierburg
Zenith 2B5 carb comes to mind, where is my shotgun).
Other differences are that the Euro/APS T body has a different
potentiometer and a different ratio to open the throttle.
The only adjustment to make is to adjust the accelerator cable.

<p>
Despite my earlier claims, you cannot mill out the old TBody and
remove that ramp. There is not enough material in the casting!
Now why did they do that for! Furthermore the potentiometer should
also be adjusted..<BR>
I also had a chance to look into the VR6 Intake Manifold, boy is that
surface rough! I looked into Extrude Hone before, but they are so
bloody expensive! They want 800 US$ to do the manifold, but they do
claim between 5 and 10% power gain.<BR>
Perhaps I should just spend a weekend pollishing it my self, if I
can figure out how to do it...(I kind-a now how but never tried it).
Anyone?

<p>
See the file VW_Perf_Time to see the differences.

<p>
The car is a bit more powerful, but mostly at the top end, the low
end is softer. It removed some of the "snap" that it used to have.
This may not be so much a loss of power, but rather may have more to
do with the variable or progressive rate at which the TBody now opens.

Organization: Dundee Institute of Technology

<p>
&gt;       Some of the VAG garages offer a 215bhp Corrado(Auto unfortunately).
&gt;

<p>
Details of the above modification are as follows:-

<p>
        CVR6/3 Nothelle conversion.

<p>
        This conversion is relatively modest.  The standard bores and pistons
are retained giving a displacement of 2861cc.  Most of the work is confined to
the cylinder head.  Together with the manifold,which is modified to ensure
optimum gas flow.  The standard valves are opened by a pair of 274 degree
camshafts.  Camshaft design is one of Nothelle's specialities.

<p>
        The induction system from air intake to inlet manifold is carefully
smoothed and the engine management system has a modified control unit which
compliments the new parameters.

<p>
        These mods result in the power output being increased from the standard
190bhp to 215bhp.  Equally significant is the rise in maximum torque, from 180
to 201 lb ft.

<p>
        Maximum power is developed at 6000rpm and max. torque at 4250rpm.

<p>
        0-60  6.6secs

<p>
        Max speed 155mph

<p>
        power to weight ratio 181 bhp/ton&gt;

<p>
        The car sits on 215/40 ZR16 's to get the extra power onto the road.


<p>
        Hope this of interest.  It will be to Jan!!

&gt;John, how do you like the AT chip on the vr6? What effect?
&gt;Initial reports on the vr6 chips were rather negative.
&gt;Considered the new throttle body as yet?

<p>
        The chip makes some difference, but not that dramatic. The engine
does seems to pull from low RPM's a little better, but then it did
anyway. The high end did improve, I  discovered that the engine comes
alive again at about 6000 and starts reving harder again. I got the
most bang for the buck from the APS P-flow airfilter, it makes the
engine sound like a small block. Haven't considered the throttle
body, it's just too expensive for the hp gain in my view. I wonder
if a bunch of VR6's owners could make a group purchase and get any kind
of discount. Back to the chip, no one advertises much of a gain with
chips for VR6 motors, VW probably did ok with the original programming.
I've noticed 1994 Corrados are speed limited to 130mph, if you have
to go faster a chip might be worthwhile. I think it is anyway though.

Greetings,

<p>
Saw an ad for SUPERCHIPS in European Car that mentioned G60 upgrades.
Called them and asked for info.. Received a brochure in the mail. It
is full of silliness! For example...

<p>
picutre is of VR6 Corrado, not G60

<p>
"...the chassis is very competent and the 4 wheel drive system..."

<p>
"...the rev limiter is raised from 5800 RPM to 6500 RPM..."

<p>
random grammatical errors

<p>
Anyway...

<p>
They do offer 7 days' money-back guarantee, and a 12-month warranty (on what,
who knows?). Quite a large list of dealers, including one in Boston, where I live.

<p>
Has anyone had any experience with SUPERCHIPS? Their material is a big turn-off,
but maybe the product itself is interesting....

<p>
I'm not really tempted to go with them over Neuspeed or AutoThority, but I hadn't
heard any discussion of SUPERCHIPS at all, so thought I would throw this out.

<p>
Happy solstice!

<p>
Alex

&gt;&gt;John, how do you like the AT chip on the vr6? What effect?
&gt;&gt;Initial reports on the vr6 chips were rather negative.
&gt;&gt;Considered the new throttle body as yet?
&gt;<BR>
&gt;	The chip makes some difference, but not that dramatic. The engine
&gt;does seems to pull from low RPM's a little better, but then it did
&gt;anyway. The high end did improve, I  discovered that the engine comes
&gt;alive again at about 6000 and starts reving harder again. I got the
&gt;most bang for the buck from the APS P-flow airfilter, it makes the
&gt;engine sound like a small block. Haven't considered the throttle
&gt;body, it's just too expensive for the hp gain in my view. I wonder
&gt;if a bunch of VR6's owners could make a group purchase and get any kind
&gt;of discount. Back to the chip, no one advertises much of a gain with
&gt;chips for VR6 motors, VW probably did ok with the original programming.
&gt;I've noticed 1994 Corrados are speed limited to 130mph, if you have
&gt;to go faster a chip might be worthwhile. I think it is anyway though.
&gt;jh<BR>
&gt;

<p>
I have the AT chip, although right now the stock chip is in the car.
Using 92 octane gas (the highest grade which is readily available in CA),
the following things occur:  low end (&lt;3000rpm) improves noticably, above
3000-3500 knovking starts big-time if I'm more than, say, 20% throttle,
gas mileage seems to improve a little.  There are a few gas stations
around where I can get higher octane fuel, but it's very expensive,
so I switch the chips out every once in a while.

<p>
I've been wondering if the P-flow would be worth buying.  Any more
info from John would be helpful (or Jan of course).

<p>
Also, if the throttle body was cheeaper, I might give it a try.  I
suppose I'd rate my interest level about the same as John's.

        I think the P-flow is a must have. However, I asked AutoThority
about using their chip with the P-flow and the throttle body, and the
salemans eyes (I stopped by in Fairfax) kind of rolled back in his head
and he went into convulsions. He then started babbling about how their
programming can't/wouldn't work with the APS mods, seemed to imply my
engine might fry. Their chip works fine with the P-flow. If you are in
CA and having trouble with pinging, you would probably be much better
off giving APS a call and using their chip instead. Aaron doesn't seem
to be as aggressive in the timing modifications to the map and pinging
should be less of a problem. AutoThority is historically very aggresive
in their programming. They usually will re-program you a new less
agressive chip if you are having problems.

After finding the advertisement in this month's european car, I called
GTA in Quebec about the Oettinger kit for the VR6 engine.  You know what,
it's exact same modifications as in the car featured a few months ago
in this very magazine.  I called and found out that the kit cost about
$4,500 Cdn. and includes replacement camshafts and chips.
They don't have the correct filter box yet, but Louie, the guy in charge
of H2O cooled VW's, told me that the Neuspeed P-Flo will work fine.
They are also getting a new chromed header from Oettinger Technik.  BTW,
the grill that was featured in the article is also available as a kit
for $450 Cdn.  The modifications will bump output to about 215 bhp and
about 192 ft. lb. torque.  Wowsers!!!  I can't wait until my warranty
runs out, who needs an M3 when I can have a 215 bhp VW!!!???  BTW,
the work must be done at a race shop VERY knowledgeable with VW engines
and electronics.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;AutoTech (see the FAQ for #s) in San Juan Capistrano can get them
&gt;for you (the guy whose used rims I bought for my SLC had one put on)
&gt;and I think New Dimensions was looking at one.
&gt;You can call VWMotorsport directly as well. See the faq...
&gt;<BR>
&gt;They are EXPENSIVE, about 2300US$. Comes with a new chip and stuff.
&gt;However, the results are impressive, I think you get around 20Hp
&gt;more at 3000 rpms but it leave the top end power about the same.

<p>
    The VSR manifold comes with a chip similar to stock that hasn't had
it's fuel and timing curves tuned so I would think that you could ask APS
to make a chip for that manifold and in addition to a few other parts,
you could get more power than from the Oettinger kit which costs about $3200.

<p>
        Probably a lot more than you want to spend. I heard they around $2000
a pop, if you can find one. I found with my SLC the best and most cost
efficient upgrades to get more power were just a chip and the P-flow.
This combination makes about 190hp, and makes the engine sound great.
I found this level of power adequate, although if I still had it
I probably would have sunk $1200 by now for the Schrick cams. Glad
I sold it.

Jan, I'm at school right now so I don't have the exact data.  However,
I'll dig up the old "european car" issue, about March I think, where I
found the article and I'll find out more.  All I remember off the top
of my head though, is that it made 215 bhp, I don't know whether it is
SAE or DIN rating.  Some people have claimed that the VW Motorsport
intake manifold, at ~$2000 U.S. a shot, along with APS Neuspeed upgrades
is more cost effective than the $3300 U.S. GTA is asking for with
its Oettinger kit, do you agree?  I'm not sure that an intake manifold
along with the regular P-Flo, chip, and throttle body upgrades will
be better than replacing the camshafts and working within the engine
than around it.  I'd love the hear your comment, in the mean time, I'll
look for that article.  I'm not in a huge rush to do the upgrades, I'm
not crazy about voiding my last two years of warranty.

<p>
Hi  I few weeks ago I noticed a thread started by you Corrado guys  on the
Oettinger performance kit for the VR6. Well, I noticed that in the British
rag PERFORMANCE CAR they had an article about just this kit. I'll summarize
what I remember: Basically this kit is the standard performance stuff,
hotter cam and polished and slightly reworked intake and exhaust manifolds.
The writer said the low end was not improved but the mid and high range
were signifcantly improved. 0-60 mph droped a 1/2 second to the low 6
sec range.Power went from 190--&gt;215 hp and torque was up too but I don't
remember the number. Anyway the writer/driver was generally impressed by
this performance upgrade. Price: expensive.
 This mag may be hard to find in North American non-urban areas. Its is an interesting 
forum for small fast cars like VW's etc and has lots of big color
photos. As a side note the article had some history on the Oettinger company.
Seems like they were big in the 80's with Gti and Audi performance parts.
In the 90's they took a nose dive and had to close. Just recently (1992?)
an ex employee reopened on a much smaller scale in the old warehouse.
The warehouse (near Frankfurt) is still appartently stock full of older
VW performance parts (send them over here!) including an engine that will
make your VW Transporter go 125 mph!<BR>

&gt;Stuff about AMS deleted&lt;

<p>
Hey now this sounds like a testimonial for mark at AMS,
but experience with happy customers should be most important
when taking performance advise. The VR6 car you are
experimenting with is  equipped similar to ones we work with.
ND's first VR6 testing was done in August 92 on an 92 Passat .
We use all the Neupeed stuff that was available at the time
-p-chip -throttle body, modified air box with K&amp;N filter, a
mildly ported intake manifold, and a ND sport stainless exhaust
system. This car produced 209 hp . The current VR6 test car is a
92 VR6 SLC. This car is equipped as above with the addition of a
Neuspeed p-flow ,of corse  now it has the VSR manifold and 268
cams, the result is lost Neuspeed p-chip to use the VSR. The VSR
made good low end improvement but nothing good or bad in the top
end even with the cams. Quarter mile times we as follows- 1) all
Neupeed no VSR or cams 15.4 @90mph  2) w/ 80hp nos 14.3 @ 101 3)
Neuspeed with 268 cams w/80hp nos 14.2 @111
4) no p-chip w/VSR and cams no nos 14.89 @93  all test could
have been better but traction at start was always poor. Sorry
this car has not been dyno tested since it just had neuspeed
p-chip and throttle body at 200 hp. We will try to get some
testing done fully equipped VR6 sometime next year. This  test
car has none of the problems you have complained about no
pinging with and without VSR stuff. The performance of the car
is respectfully for the bolt on performance. True the manifold
and cams are too expensive for the gain &lt;in my opinion&gt;. The low
end performance is so good  the top feels bad because it stays
the same, so if you what low end grunt buy it all. If
performance to the dollar is a concern just do the neuspeed
stuff. More than 210-215 will be hard if legality counts &lt;and it
does at ND&gt;.

<p>
<STRONG>CHIPS</STRONG>

<p>
  Neuspeed chips work, we have dyno tested , they work because
of 20 years dyno experience, knowledge of timing and fuel
curves. Curves that work for performance  and reliability needed
for all driving conditions. The process of burning, Give me a
break I bet most of you know that this process is simple. But
who had this knowledge first WHO CARES! If the burning knowledge
was worth royalties other people would be in line far before
Mark would. A division of VW of America came to Aaron for some
custom chip work  to help with idle problems on A3 Cabrios. Also
remember that Neuspeed has been making chips for VW's since 1990
when replacable e-proms  first appeared in VW's.


<p>
   Did Mark really say he expected to get 250 hp from cams Hey
this most be a misprint the European ABT  3.1 with cams, chip
and throttle body only gets 240 hp- go figure!!

<p>
&gt;Comments on G60s deleted see the G60 archive&lt;

<p>
  When looking for companies and products for you car, trust is
most important. Neuspeed has been producing good quality
products for a long time and should be around for along time to
come some other people in the business will not be. New
Dimensions has been in the VW business since 1985 -we do full
service and performance work at our shop.  We offer a 12 month
and 12,000 mile written warrantee on our work we have to sell
products that work or we have to make them work at our expense,
this does not happen with Neuspeed parts or we would not install
them. We test and install most everything we sell. Research of
performance parts is very important and a smart move on
everyone's part. Our new catalog will contain true test and
proven parts a service only availability from a service company.

<p>
 I have to say I am slightly  opinionated  I have been at ND
since 1987. We put a lot of effort to make good products
available. Usually only talking about positive things where ever
possible without slamming another product for there bad points.
Recently I have noticed more calls with customers saying Mark
basically sells his chip by slamming others, and most recently a
turbo customer said  Mark said our turbo systems caused too much
stress on the motor and his 16V system would not. Let get
something straight a properly used turbo car can be very
reliable, and abused one &lt;like any abused car&gt; will not. We have
over 1,000 units on the road (inc. Callway version)  I don't
believe the AMS systems has even sold two. How would someone
with so few systems tested have a right to rip a proven product
, simple you don't have any thing better to do. Mark seems to be
pretty smart when it comes to ideas but he should not try to
succeed by copying and smearing others and others products. Talk
is cheap but I don't believe there is much truth to the smear
claims.


<p>
   Happy motoring

Hi Jan!

<p>
I was recently speaking with Gunther Schmidt; he races the Jetta GLX
(VR6) quite successfully.

<p>
Engine mods allowed in his class are quite minor and he mentioned some
tips for the VR6 engine.

<p>
His, out of the box, and before balancing and blue-printing, got 184
hp on the dyno. He tore it down, balanced and blueprinted it and did
two minor modifications: he changed to the K&amp;N air filter (the free
flowing one) and used the Passat manifold piece that connects the
airbox to the intake manifold. He replaced the chip in the engine
management system to eliminate the speed limiter (and swears that's
the only change he made to it!).

<p>
The result of the above is 215 hp on the dyno with a good increase in
midrange torque. I mentioned that some people had mixed reults with
the free flowing air filter and he told me the secret of it: He found,
through dyno testing and race experience, that the VR6 engine is quite
sensitvie to the air temperature going into the air intake. When he
just ran the filter in the normal engine compartment lots of hot air
was going into the intake with the result that there was little, if
any, power gain.

<p>
He made some ductwork that ducts air directly from the front of the
car into the air filter (in his case on the racing car through the
right headlight assembly) and noticed gains in the power immediately.

<p>
You might want to mention this in the FAQ as it sounds like a way that
most people will get some extra power. Obviously they wouldn't want to
remove the headlight, but htere must be other ways to insure the
filter gets fresh, cool air.

I can't see spending %150 (or $100!) for a Neuspeed K&amp;N fitler that
can be gotten directly from K&amp;N for about $50.  Make the metal
retaining bracket yourself (sheet metal, a vice, a drill and a little
patience needed) and pocket the $50 or $100 you're going to save.

&gt; Jan, I'm suprised to hear that you had little gain w/ the 2.9 T-B. My
&gt; stock ported one feels great everywhere! I didn't add any material to the

<p>
There is feel and there are measurements.
The EuroTB feels a tad softer, especially at the low end but that just
may be due to the progressive mechanism. The high end seemed more
free flowing.<BR>
But I am an engineer/scientist/whatever, and so I don't like to
rely on purely subjective impressions (e.g., louder cars seem faster,
brighter TV sets look sharper, etc).<BR>
What I usually measure is before and after acceleration figures,
and these obviously do not capture things like throttle responce:

<p>
92 SLC + K&amp;N + Syntec<BR>
<STRONG>--------------------- [JHV]</STRONG><BR>
<PRE>
2nd: 20-40 mph          3.07 - 3.40 secs
3rd: 40-60 mph          4.60 - 4.80 secs
3rd: 60-70 mph          2.89 secs
4th: 50-70 mph          5.64 secs
</PRE>

<p>

3rd: 40-60 mph          4.20 - 4.60 secs
</PRE>

<p>
My estimated error on these are .2 secs, unclear whether these measurements
are statistically significant.


<p>
In my 2nd gear test I got virtually no gain (actually a slow down!)
and in the 3rd gear test I am ahead about .3 secs.
Not much to brag about IMHO. Perhaps there are other things wrong
with the car. Also note that this is without a chip and
w/o a PFlow using just a replacement K&amp;N airfilter element and
the Helmholtz resonators removed.<BR>
Some say the TBody does not get its fullest potential unless you have
the PFlow...

<p>
&gt; away with out going through. How is the 2.9 progressive? I thought the
&gt; ramps in the stock T-B are what made it progressive. There's a small ramp

<p>
The Euro TB does not have any of these air ramps. Instead of attaching
the accelerator cable directly onto the cam attached to the throttle,
there is a 2 (3?) link mechanism that slows opening of the throttle
from the closed position and speeds it up towards WOT.
With this TBody, the car does not have this "jumpy" feel at idle.

Jan, I'm suprised to hear that you had little gain w/ the 2.9 T-B. My
stock ported one feels great everywhere! I didn't add any material to the
dimple in mine. There is actually Quite a bit of metal that can be ground
away with out going through. How is the 2.9 progressive? I thought the
ramps in the stock T-B are what made it progressive. There's a small ramp
on the top which I also ground away. No polishing, just cleaned it up
afterwards with a dremel. I was always led to believe that polishing was
a waste of time since the air along the walls is stagnant. later

I'm new here so you may already know this. You can port the stock t-body
on VR6s. I did mine just the other day, and I am very pleased with the
results. Throtle response is improved from idle on up, and high rpm is
better than ever.<BR>
You can only grind so far, so its not as big as the 2.9 t-body. But hey
it dosn't cost $350 either.

<p>
I also made my own cone type air filter. K&amp;N part no. RE0810 fits
excellent, costs about $45.00. Make a braket yo-self. Oh yeah, no air
pump on my car. Hope to save somone some money. See ya.

Who needs a machine shop to make a braket? I bent a bracket at home in my
vise. I then painted it flash red to match the car. The bracket attaches
to the front of the filter and mounts on the rear bolt for the radiator
support. It looks waaay better than the tuners, plus it's one of a kind.
I take pride in my car and the components I put on it. Anyone can bolt
parts on that someone else makes. But it's really cool when your at the
shows, to have people ask you, who makes that neat filter?

<p>
But hey, to each his own. If you feel it's neccesary to spend $120 for a
filter, go right ahead. I spent the $80 I saved on a front stressbar.

&gt;  &gt;I'll post this again even though you've probably seen it. You can make
&gt;  &gt;your own performance filter for both VR6s and G60s. K&amp;N part no. RE0810
&gt;  &gt;fits excellent and costs about $47 ( VR6 ). For G60s I've seen people at
&gt;  &gt;shows useing the the Mustang filter from K&amp;N, not sure what the part no.
&gt;  &gt;is. Make a pretty bracket yourself.

&gt; Since I don't have access to a machine shop, I wanted to have the fixup place
&gt; make a bracket for me. It turns out that it would cost about 40-50 bucks to
&gt; make one, so there would be little to no savings. I though, going cheap on my
&gt; Corrado would really bother my conscience. People, we did not buy a Corrado to

What I really think the "ideal" P-Flo installation is missing is a
shield/funnel that would serve 2 purposes:

<OL>
  <LI> direct the cold air from the cold-air inlet (rear of the
headlamp assy.) towards the filter<BR>
  <LI> shield the filter from the hot-air surrounding the engine
it might not protect it completely from convected heat
but it would protect it from radiant.

</OL>
<p>
I think the major drawback to the P-Flo is the cold-air
issue, if someone on the list (more motivated than me)
could hack together a shield it would be pretty
marketable me thinks.

<p>
I've mocked up something really basic with cardboard, I
would think you could do it with a single piece of galv.
sheet metal (or stainless).  My dad suggested using
a cookie sheet, not a bad idea...<BR>
Basically, it's just a sheet with a bend at the right point
to shield both the side and the top of the filter.

I removed the screens from my MAS today. The car is louder, might be
quiker even. I did not time the runs. Jan, would you care to do some?

<p>
Instuctions for removing - Remove MAS from car, Remove large C clips that
hold the screens in place, remove screens, put MAS back in car. Easy. Not
permanent. Oh yeah, the cooling fins are there, I'm leaving them alone.

 &gt;&gt;I installed the P-FLO filter kit last Friday from APS.  It probably did give
 &gt;&gt;me at least 5 more hp or one big reason.  As in this months European Car, the
 &gt;&gt;screen on the air intake to the filter box was clogged with leaves and one
 &gt;&gt;huge moth.  I've got 40K on the car.  They suggested to remove the prefilter
 &gt;&gt;screen.  I agree.  You'll still have a big filter there that if a big bug lands
 &gt;&gt;on it won't change the filter surface area as much as on the screen.
 &gt;&gt;<BR>
 &gt;&gt;As for the K&amp;N, it is nice.  Is the bracket worth 50 bucks.  Well it made
 &gt;&gt;installation in 20 minutes a snap, and it is good quality and not sheet metal
 &gt;&gt;like I would have made.

<p>
 &gt;How do you like the sound of the P-FLO.. I'm also thinking about adding one,
 &gt;but am<BR>
 &gt;concerned that it's overly loud and would get annoying after a while..

<p>
You can only hear it when you are past half throttle. It's not annoying, since
it's only when the engine is being pushed, plus it sounds so damn fine.

<p>
Rode in a Ferrari Dino today, and then  thought to myself, "It doesn't sound
any more musical than the VR6 with the K&amp;N."

<p>
I like the construction of the Neuspeed bracket, but if you want to save some
money, and get the large K&amp;N (I swapped the Neuspeed one for this one) or the
regualr one, call Gilbert at The Place. They make the brackets too. I think he
said he'd sell the whole set for around $85, if I recall right, but calling
him would probably be the most accurate way of getting the info. Their number
is (818)966-4888<BR>

I also posted some questions on VR6 cams earlier on but here's the extent of
my knowledge on this subject:

<p>
Cams with a wilder profile are indeed the next logical choices after the
standard Neuspeed mods, since the VSR intake manifold is rather pricey, and
engine bore &amp; stroke, or cylinder head port &amp; polish, are pretty radical and
costly stuff.<BR>
Also, the Corrado's stock exhaust system is so good that most attempts to
improve it by going to larger diameter pipes actually result in power loses
at the lower rpms,<BR>
though Eurosport &amp; Autotech's exhaust systems will net you 5 to 7 hp, at the
expense of more noise, which some people might like!

<p>
Anyway, I digress. Schrick cams? Good stuff!  Schrick has a strong reputation
in Germany and also do grinds for prepped BMWs, etc.    I've talked to a
couple of people with the 260 Schricks in their Corrados, they were generally
very happy with their choices, reported an extra boost of 10 hp or so above
4000 rpm and a well-behaved idle, coupled with a menacing growl when the
engine comes on cam.  The 268 should give you even more peak power higher up,
the downside being a slightly rougher idle...

<p>
ABT's 268?  They are one of the most repected German tuners so I'm sure the
cam's of the highest quality.  It's also lighter and cheaper than the
Schrick...  However, the cams are not manufactured by ABT, but by Sugo (may
not be the correct spelling), and I've been warned about the Sugo cams having
rigidity problems due to their hollow construction. Also this cam is
configured ideally for ABT's 3.0 Litre engine conversion, not for a stock
2.8L VR6...

<p>
P.S. Ron's Parts are the official Schrick importers but you can also get them
from APS, VW Specialties, European Import Performance, AMS, Autotech, etc.

topic:

I constructed a air intake for my 91 CRX si once and it made a noticeable
differance in preformance. What I did was I bought the tubing for air
conditioning for homes. I attached it to the original air intake housing and
pulled it so it was under the front spoiler, ram air i guess. It worked for
me and I bet if you put a little more time and effort in the results would be
even greater. Just an idea I thought i'd share with you guys.

Actually, UNIQUEVR6, in one of the VW FAQs there is discussion about a fellow
who has done just what you are asking about to his Jetta GLX - apparently the
VR6 works better with COLD air anyway, and while the P-Flow is quick and
dirty, and reduces airflow restriction, it's not as good as it COULD be if
you could get COLD air to the car.  They just updated the FAQs, and they're
also on the WEB - have you gotten the WEB for AOL and gotten to rec.autos.vw
in the newsgroups?

&gt;Hi I have a 1994 Corrado VR6, and right now it has 8000Km. I have this funny
&gt;whistling noise whenever I accelerate from 2000 rpm to 3000 rpm. The sound

<p>
Well, almost every VR6 that have a P-Flo experience this whistling.  It's
from the air rushing through the air mass flow meter or the throttle body.
 It's like blowing air on an empty bottle neck and you get this whoooo
whistling.  Well, it's something like that.  The whistling occurs only when
the throttle is partially open (slowly accelerating).  At least that's what
heppens with my P-Flo.  If you slam on the gas, the whistling will go away.
 So, if what I mentioned is true, then I won't worry about it.

<p>
Hope I helped!<BR>

   Someone up in Canada has already done a "3.1" Litre conversion on his VR6
(a Passat GLX) - apparently it has all the goodies:   ABT crank &amp; 82.5mm
forged pistons, VSR, 280 cams, modified chip (programmed by AMS), ported &amp;
polished head with 3 angle valve job, Supersprint headers, Remus exhaust tip,
throttle body, P-Flo, etc, etc.  Hasn't been dynoed yet but EC is going to do
an article on it, I believe.  I've called him a couple of times but he wasn't
in so I don't know the exact details, but sounds like he's got a really great
( and expensive!) setup!

<p>
  Other gossip (Disclaimer: these are rumours, not necessarily true or
accurate! Some of this info are quite a few months old, I've just been too
lazy to post them earlier):

<p>
   Darrell from Techtonics has all the mods in for his exhaustive lab/dyno
testing (VSR, cams, etc) but it's going to take a while before we hear
anything - am looking forward to seeing some relatively objective
measurements of what the various mods out on the market can really offer us!
 He's also working on a ported/polished cylinder head, about $2000 on an
exchange basis.

<p>
  Speaking of heads, a number of shops are also offering prepared VR6 heads
on an exchange basis, including GTA of Quebec (4 angle 50/50 job) and EIP of
Maryland (bigger intake valves).

<p>
   You've all heard about ND of Santa Clara's exciting oil cooler kit (sounds
simpler to install than the Neuspeed ones, about $360) and the 11.5" brake
kit (Ferrodo pads? May be rather pricey initially?) from our TurboTim here,
but did you know that ND are finishing tests on their (2.25"?) exhaust system
which features Borla mufflers with a dual tip option - makes a nice, deep but
civilized sound and will offer increased performance without sacrificing
anything from the bottom end (should be available by August/September).
  Autotech, EuroSport, ABT, Oetinger and Supersprint also offer exhaust
systems, with one being currently developed by Techtonics.

<p>
   Supersprint headers are finally available for the VR6 via Ron's Parts in
Vancouver, but you may have to wait a little while to get hold of yours. I
hear their exhaust system has a fake cat converter look-alike (!).

<p>
   Dana from Autotech in Southern California is working on dual piston
calipers for the VR6 brakes...

<p>
   NEVA will be coming out with a Carbon Fibre tie-bar and hood for the
Corrado in addition to their more cosmetic offerings.  They even have a 17"
rim, flywheel and pistons in the works, though I'm not sure if carbon fibre
is the ideal material for these components, especially in street use...but
they do have some good stuff which I hope they'll research and develop for
VWs (Porsche is their main bread and butter market).

<p>
   If you want your Corrado to behave a bit more like a domestic drag machine
(as much as a front wheel drive can, anyway) than a top-end Autobahn
wundercruiser, have you considered replacing your ring and pinion with one
from the European 16-valve Corrados?  Of course, a taller 5th gear and Quaife
differential would help balance things out...talk to GTA, Autotech or AMS
about the ring and pinion.

<p>
   Well, that's all for now - anyone heard of anything else for the Corrado
or VR6?  Please tell me that the prototypical 24-valve head is finally
available or that a reliable turbo VR6 is being put together...;-)

Nick, I also talked to Velocity a while ago about boring out the throttle
body (the Neuspeed one, not the stock), they said that would leave the walls
too thin so they decided instead to make up a different, bigger one slated
for production around September.  Don't know if this bigger volume throttle
body will have that much of an effect on a stock VR6 except at high rpms (may
even reduce some power lower down...), but should complement any bigger
displacement conversions nicely!

<p>
BTW, Extrudehone told me that they do not do any work on throttle bodies and
did not recommend extrude honing the VSR because of the flap between the 2
runners...

I called Velocity today about the T-body they are making for the VR6...it
will be bigger than<BR>
the typical European ones that are on the market from the other tuners.  It
will be out at the<BR>
end of summer for around $370.00 or so.  It's supposed to be about 68-74mm
(i think that's what he said)<BR>
Anyway if any of you are interested call Velocity (310-643-0005) and tell
them you want to be put on<BR>
the list of VR6 owners, and they will notify you when it's completed.  I
don't want to risk messing mine<BR>

was about $1000 plus about $200 for the fuel enrichment kit that he
recommends for the job.  He would be the best place to look for info, or
maybe Extrude Hone directly.   I think other shops have done it also  (Ed?).

Stuff like this been around for a while...
About 15 years ago they came out with these thimbles drilled with holes
that you would drop between the manifold and the carb. It would
swirl the mixture better.<BR>
Some Euro consmumer agency checked it out and said it did nothing at best
and made things worse in the worst case.
Reason is simple...you are creating a slight restriction in your
airstream.

<p>
In carburated cars, where the manifolds are "wet" the swirl may help
fuel evaporation, but in fuel injected cars where you may be several
feet before the combustion chamber and injectors that atomize the
fuel, I cannot see how much good it would do.

<p>
&gt;   But the thing that would really improve P-Flo sound and maybe performance
&gt; is an aluminum pipe leading from the throttle body to the mass air flow
&gt; sensor.  My cousin's 91 integra had a K&amp;N conical filter with stock rubber

<p>
In the case of the VR6 that may actually help...I was talking to
an old "race car" maker (go karts, Baja, Formula cars, etc)
When he looked at the "harmonica style elbow" between the air mass
sensor and the intake manifold he laughed and commented that I should
start there. He suggested replacing it with a smoothly bent pipe.
One problem is that there are a bunch of other tubes hanging from that
damn thing.

<p>
Actually, if you have a look at the VR6 Golfs...that elbow is much
smoother, perhaps because it's cheaper to make but I wonder
if it'll fit and whether it would help power.

<p>
Talking of intake manifolds...ever seen one made out of a thermohardend
plastic. The whole thing is injected molded with all additional
stuff molded in. Awesome. No porting or polishing needed!
The surface finish is very good and the whole thing weighs next to
nothing. I immagine the manufacturing costs are less (because several
car makers are getting into it), but I wonder how much
the set up costs are because the machine to make them is very complex.

<p>
&gt;Just talked to Velocity, looks like they are currently not allocating any
&gt;time into developing a bigger bore throttle body for the VR6 due mostly to a
&gt;perceived lack of demand and a small market!  For those of you who would
like<BR>
&gt;an alternative to the Neuspeed option, would definitely help if we were to
&gt;show them that Corrado owners are significant if a minority in the motorcar
&gt;community. If they get enough calls (310-643-0005, Los Angeles) expressing
an<BR>
&gt;interest, I believe they will put some time into moving this from the design
&gt;stage into production.

<p>
Bigger bore throttle bodies are available from us. We (ND) can get them for
$250 and they are made by ELP. They have not done one yet but will once we
send it to them. The say 3.5mm increase but we do not think thats possible.
Will have to get one sent out to them and see. They did a G-60 one and it
worked quite nice. We did not get a chance to dyno it. We will have to test
the VR6 TB and hope to do it in a while.

   As I sit here twiddling my fingers and impatiently waiting for the work on
my rebuilt motor to be completed, my mind fell to pondering, how much of an
adverse effect would the reduced rod ratio for this reworked engine have on
its smoothness, redline and reliability?

<p>
  Let's see, the super long rods in the VR6 are supposedly one of the main
reasons why this narrow angle vee engine is so smooth, free-reving, durable
and clean in the emissions department.

<p>
  According to James Sly's Jan 1995 article in EC, "Rod ratio = Connecting
rod length / Crankshaft stroke", where 1.65 is considered by many engine
builders to be the minimum desirable figure.

<OL>
  <LI> Stock     VR6:   Rod ratio = 1.8  (164 mm / 90.3 mm)
  <LI> Modified VR6:   Rod ratio = 1.7  (164 mm / 96.5 mm)

</OL>
<p>
 As illustrated above, increasing the stroke another 6.2 mm as per the ABT
crankshaft kit would decrease the rod ratio since the stock rods remain the
same length of 164 mm.  This should increase torque and low end grunt, as
expected, but may it also increase emissions &amp; piston wear, and reduce top
end revs &amp; smoothness?

   Hello, people, for those of you who have expressed an interest in the
status of my ongoing 3.1 Litre project, preliminary flowbench results have
come in and I'm rather excited, so just had to share the following with you!


<p>
   The 106 cfm figures I posted in an earlier message are probably not
completely accurate, but what I can reveal to you folks before anyone else
(i.e. European Car) is that my new head with the 42 mm intake valves (stock
ones are about 39.4 mm), modified intake manifold and a pair of Schrick 268
cams has a * 40% * increase in airflow over the stock VR6 head with stock
cams &amp; manifold...

<p>
   Of course we won't really know what this all means until the work on
engine is completed and it is dynoed/driven, but I'm confident that we are
(conservatively) talking about at least 240 hp for the final engine output,
with a much broader torque curve than stock!

<p>
   EIP started boring the block this week, and the assembly/balancing will
take place after that. My only regret is that I don't personally get to see
all the new parts and their installation (just the $$$ appearing on my credit
card statements!) since we are doing a coast-to-coast engine swap.

<p>
   Since my baby's the guinea pig for this project, most of the major kinks
should be ironed out by the time any of you feel like embarking on something
similar or exploring even more radical avenues...I'll try to share what we
learn from this first attempt at exploiting more fully the amazing potential
of the VR6  with those of you who are interested!

<p>
Cheers,    :o)<BR>
Edward<BR>
"UniqueVR6@aol.com"

<p>
P.S.  One of my goals for this project was to elevate SOME parameters of our
beloved Corrado's performance to Porsche 911 (non-turbo) or BMW M3 levels for
a VW-level price...

  Just got my car back with the ND oil cooler installed.  Cool! (literally as
well as figuratively).   Look out for an EC tech procedure article with
photos on this soon if you prefer to install it yourself (there's less room
on a VR6 but should be more straightforward than the Neuspeed version).  Will
post results later, but initial observations is that the oil temp now runs at
least 10 to 18 degrees lower, with the biggest differences occuring when the
engine is being flogged hard and the vehicle's moving at some speed...

<p>
   Oh, here are the preliminary results from the ND dyno.  Haven't analysed
them properly yet, but looks like the factory airbox with a K&amp;N filter
element makes at least as much power (actually a bit more at the low and mid
end!) as the P-flo and peaks at around 5500 rpm, but the P-flo has the
advantage higher up as it keeps going past redline.  These observations of
course apply to a Corrado VR6 with the P-chip and Neuspeed throttle body
already installed...<BR>
   This correlates in general with my subjective personal driving experience
<UL>
  <LI> the car felt slightly less sluggish in the lower middle rpms with the K&amp;N
in the airbox (better velocity, lower air temperatures?), but seem to open up
more eagerly around, and beyond, redline with the P-flo (better
breathing?)...

</UL>
<p>
   Assuming a conservative formula of Engine hp = Wheel hp * 1.25, then we
expect to see at least 200bhp for the P-Flo, P-chip &amp; throttle body
combination.  If Torque = Engine hp x 5252 / rpm, then we're getting around
205 lbs/ft at 4500 rpm.

<p>
   Interestingly enough, ND's exhaust system on a stock VR6 GTI comes close
to these figures for the Neuspeed mods.  I wonder what the ND exhaust and
Neuspeed combination would do for the VR6?!   Comments, Tim?

<p>
   As for the other dyno figures, looks like the K&amp;N filter element delivers
more hp than the Amsoil in the top end.  Also the Tornado device didn't seem
to have made much of a difference either way.  On a slightly negative note, I
called the Tornado people after the dyno results to request a refund (they
supposedly have a 30 day money back guarantee), but they gave me a hard time
saying such things as "Dyno figures don't mean anything because the car is
not moving" (uh, didn't they themselves use dyno figures to "prove" their
product's effectiveness in their ads?) and "well, we have thousands of very
happy customers and the magazines rate the Tornado as being the best" (hmm,
just because some people like it doesn't mean I have to like it also,
especially if my tests &amp; experience with hp &amp; mpg doesn't support your
impressive claims)...

&gt; I am sure your note has already made it into the hands

&gt;next opportunity they have.  :-&gt;

<p>
   Can't wait to be shot down! Actually I'd be quite honoured should these VW
tuner giants pay attention to someone ordinary like me  ;o)    As an addendum
to my * Dyno Results * post, may I add that some caution should be exercised
in their interpretation, and that we should be aware of the following:

<OL>
  <LI> Since there is often a significant variation in engine output between
cars of the same model, these test results should be interpretated as an
INDICATION only of the RELATIVE effects of the Neuspeed P-Flow vs the Factory
Airbox with a high-flow filter, on a Neuspeed throttle body &amp; P-Chip equipped
1992 Corrado VR6 under those test conditions.  No dyno measurements had been
taken of the same test car in a stock state BEFORE any of these Neuspeed
modifications were installed.

  <LI> The factory airbox was not in a completely stock condition for the K&amp;N
and Amsoil tests since I had  removed the snorkel located in the lower front
(the one with the mesh screen filter) to improve flow.  We do not have any
results here for the Neuspeed P-chip and throttle body combination with a
completely stock factory airbox &amp; stock filter.

  <LI> Both dyno runs were made with the same equipment (as far as I am aware
of) and at the same physical location. There were no additional modifications
to the engine between 6/27/94 and 8/10/95, other than the ND oil cooler kit
being installed before the 8/10/95 session.  This in itself may have had some
impact on the readings.  In addition, other parameters such as the engine
breaking in (about 13000 miles on 6/27 and 26000 on 8/10), differences in
petrol/gas and oil quality, spark plug conditions, etc may have affected the
measurements somewhat?


  <LI> The ambient temp and humidity were not recorded for the 6/27/94 dyno
with the P-Flow, P-chip, throttle body.  All I remember is that the run was
initiated at about 6:30pm, and that it was a dry and fairly mild day.

  <LI> We look forward to Darrell's dyno results from testing the plethora of
VR6 performance enhancements currently available. Perhaps his extensive
research will pick up pace if enough of us VR6 enthusiasts will let
Techtonics know that there is a significant number of people out there who
would be very interested in seeing these results...

Jan, another thing to note is that it's pretty obvious the K&amp;N filter does
better in the horsepower department than the Amsoil above 5000 rpm, according
to the results.  What these dyno figures don't show however, is that the K&amp;N
might also let more dirt in than the Amsoil...

   Guess people from this list must have been calling Velocity Sport Tuning
in southern California - Jeff told me that up to 2 to 3 weeks ago, there have
only been a few inquiries re VR6 mods and so they have not given it much
priority.  However, because of a recent increase in demand/interest, they
will be testing a larger VR6 throttle body with a bigger throat &amp; plate (i.e.
not just boring out the stock or Neuspeed one) by the end of the month, size
will be from anywhere from 64mm to 70mm (stock is 64mm).

<p>
   If test results look good (i.e. low end is not compromised), they will be
able to sell an unit sometime in September.  The downside is that estimated
cost is a whopping $400-450!   Any news re the ELP version, Tim?

<p>
  Velocity also claims to have made up a set of 42mm intake and 35mm exhaust
valves for the VR6 head (stock = 40mm / 33mm?)...

Anyone know if the Canadian Corrados have the European spoilers (the bigger
ones), or the US ones? I'm going up to Canada really soon, so I may pick one up
there.

<p>
BTW I just tried the APE chip and I really like it. It makes the engine run
smoother and the car more drivable. No pings at all.

In a message dated 95-08-19 01:09:06 EDT, you write:

<p>
&gt;I was wondering if anyone with the VR6 has changed their exhaust system? I
&gt;remember Aaron at Neuspeed telling me that there would be no benefit, since
&gt;the stock exhaust is free flowing and has a good diameter piping already.
&gt;What<BR>
&gt;have your experiences been?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;

<p>
Aaron will be testing one of our systems soon as we have them ready to ship.
We have been test fitting the twin tips for the GLX and just got started on
the G-60. Will keep you posted on results. Listed below are results from our
GTI VR6 system.

Well here's another one my money saving ideas. Early Saab 900 Turbos have
a factory add-on oil cooler that may be adaptable to our VWs. I got one
off of a friends parts car. Interestingly, it looks almost exactly like
the oil coolers pictured in NDs catalog. The adaptor looks exact, and the
cooler looks like the Mocal thats pictured also.

<p>
It looks as though for now, the stock oil to water cooler would have to
be removed for its installation. I have bolted the adaptor in place on an
8V motor I have sitting in my garage, so it will fit G60s, and since the
VR6 uses the same stock cooler, I don't see a problem with bolting it in
place on it.

<p>
Now I Know it sounds silly ( and posibly disastrous ) to be installing
used oil cooler parts, but they are off of a Saab. Saabs are well built,
and I doubt very much that they would be useing second rate parts on a
Turbo motor. I called the local dealer and i can purchae new hoses and a
T-stat for about $50. That should eliminate any worry in my head.

<p>
Tim are there any identifying marks i may be able to find on these
pieces so that I may fin out who made them? Also, the cooler measures 4
3/4 by 6 1/2, is it big enough to do the job?

<p>

   Just chatted with Richie - for those of you who missed an earlier post of
mine, this is the VW enthusiast up in Canada who's done things to his VR6
that would make my 3.1 project car look like a dinky econo-car in comparison!
  For example:

<OL>
  <LI> First, Rich started with the Neuspeed mods (P-flo, throttle body, P-chip)
and suspension stuff.  Some improvements over stock but nothing to write home
about.<BR>
  <LI> He next added a pair of Schrick 260 cams.  Not bad especially higher up
in the powerband but somehow something was still missing...
  <LI> Then Rich popped in the VSR manifold and Schrick 268...WOW, now we're
talking!  Instant useful power coming on around 3000rpm, and a soul-stirring
roar as the VSR butterfly flap spins open @ 4000rpm!   He commented that this
combination was quite an eye-opener in terms of real-world performance gains.
  <LI> Now, just for fun, let's drop in that 3.1 litre bored and stroked
engine...  Whilst we're about it, why not port n' polish the Neuspeed
throttle body &amp; cylinder head, match-porting the intake &amp; exhaust.  Hmm, how
about replacing the factory exhaust with a Supersprint system complete with
ported headers and free-flowing mufflers  To harness all that power, let's
add a Quaife differential, lightened flywheel, Sachs Sports clutch and
heavy-duty pressure plate.  Now, don't forget those *dual-piston* caliper
brakes, and 17" rims with the 215/40ZR17 super rubber to tame that "VR6
engine on steroids".  And of course a special order to Aaron for a
custom-programmed Neuspeed chip for the whole system!   The party's about to
begin...talk about gobs of creamy smooth power from the lower midrange up,
yet free-reving to 7000rpm and beyond...pretty sick, eh? (I'm drooling
already at the thought, even though I haven't sat in Rich's car - yet!)
  <LI> Wait, that's just for starters, the best part's yet to come - in addition
to Schrick heavy-duty valve springs, VW Motorsport steel synchro rings and
other esoteric goodies, Rich is already working with Ron's Parts on a *16 psi
twin-turbo* 3.1 VR6 (possibly incorporating a Garrett T03 turbocharger) which
will use shorter Carillo connecting rods to reduce the compression ratio, and
is at the same time keeping an eye on the 24-valve prototype VR6 head which
VW announced and displayed 2 weeks ago!  This 3.1 twin-turbo terror is slated
to humiliate the competition by the end of the year, if the engine doesn't
blow up (yes, the 16 psi estimate was NOT a misprint) before then!

</OL>
<p>
   Well, fellow enthusiasts, looks like Rich is rather serious about VR6
performance, which is really smashing!  Even if most of us can not afford to
do even 10% of what he's put in his project car, it's super just dreaming and
seeing how far up on the performance ladder one could elevate the VR6 to!   I
also mentioned the Corrado group to Rich, and he's definitely interested in
coming down to California sometime to talk shop with us and let us take a
look/ride (and dare I hope, drive?) in his super VR6!

<p>
   Anyway, as you can see, my enthusiasm was indeed sparked and so I had to
rush-email this before I came down to earth. So, please excuse any sloppy
writing or inaccuracies on my part, it's 1:35 am but I just had to share this
with all of you...

<p>
Cheers,<BR>

   An addendum to my 3.1 litre VR6 post:

<p>
   Richie is currently running Goodyear GS-D P225/35ZR17s, not P215/40-17s as
I had previously reported.  He admits that this combination was put together
more for cosmetic reasons (pencil-thin band of rubber) than for pure
performance since the Goodyears give decent but not ultimate performance in
terms of grip.  Interestingly enough, he runs 15" on the track, but switches
back to the 17" on the street.

<p>
   Also his Passat GLX 3.1 litre setup has not been dynoed as yet - 300bhp
figures have been loosely quoted for his engine, but Rich is a little
skeptical of such claims.  He does strongly recommend the 3.1 litre
conversion, if one could afford it, as the real-world performance gains in
acceleration throughout most of the powerband are quite significant!  Also he
reports that there has been absolutely no problems in terms of reliability so
far even though he regularly pushes his VR6 extremely hard, on both the track
and street (I believe he's claimed to have hit the mid 150mph speeds).  And
the engine is getting stronger each day as it breaks in more...

<p>
Edward

<p>
P.S.  In case any of you have a problem with some of my writing, I apologise!
 I grew up in the UK but have lived in the States longer so am not too
consistent sometimes (i.e. usage of American slang coupled with English

   Some German tuner's supposed to be coming out with their (hopefully
cheaper and equally effective) version of the VSR very soon, haven't heard
anything more re the Brazilian VSR.

<p>
   According to Aaron (Neuspeed), one of the reasons for the VSR's impressive
performance gains is VW Motorsport's programming of their ECU - the chip has
aggressive timing programmed in the middle rev range, and the rev limiter is
set at 7600-7700 rpm!  In comparison, the P-chip extends the rev limit to
7500 rpm from the factory 7000 rpm mark...

   Velocity has started tests on their bigger throttle body prototype.
 Initial tooling costs are high, but if the mod can net a gain of 5 hp or
more up top on a stock VR6 without losing more than 2 hp or so at the low
end, they will bring it to market.

<p>
   GTA has also started research on something similar.  Their version will
probably use a butterfly plate that's 4mm larger than the European one.  The
main obstacle involves a clean cutting of the brass plate without causing
warping, maybe high-tech tools such as lasers are required!  ;-)

<p>
   Also waiting for ND to get the ELP one in for dyno testing.  In addition,
quite a few other tuners are offering less radical solutions like a slight
boring out of the US or Neuspeed throttle body.  Including a few people on
the list with a more cost-effective, do-it-yourself approach like our very
own Brian here, I believe...

    For those of you who are somewhat obsessive about tweaking things and do
not like leaving a well-designed thing alone (i.e. me), looks like the 3.1
litre conversion is becoming more popular with each passing day on the
American continent!

<p>
    GTA just delivered to a Jetta GLX customer in Mexico a rebuilt engine
with the ABT bigger bore/longer stroke 3.1 kit. This had a ported and
polished head, Abt (Suko) hollow 268 cams with press-fit lobes, Abt
re-programmed ECU, Abt headers.  The European throttle body was used, and the
inlet manifold remained stock.   Another customer of Louis will be doing a
3.0 litre (Abt crankshaft) conversion soon.  Two other people on the east
coast have put down the money for a 3.1 too.

<p>
    Anyone on the list contemplating going in this direction?  Anyone won the
lottery lately?  ;o)

<p>
    Oh, I've heard rumours that Ron's Parts is tinkering with the idea of
popping a 3.1 VR6 into a rabbit.  Yes, a rabbit!!  Just think of power to
weight ratio!!!  My only concern would be how the older chassis would cope
with all this power and how stable/reliable everything would be at 150 mph?!
 Interesting concept, though.

<p>
Cheers,<BR>

<p>
P.S.  Hey, I'd better get back to work...I've been spending much more time
than I really should hanging out on this list!  It's just been really
educational and fun reading all the posts here on so many diverse topics, you
chaps have so much to offer from mundane everyday maintenance tips to exotic
outrageously priced conversions...I've really enjoyed being part of this
Corrado list/club!   Very knowledgeable and wonderfully supportive group of
enthusiasts...   I think I've seen less juvenile flaming and personal attacks
here than on all the other message boards. Which is a very good thing for me,
since I tend to get over-excited sometimes with some of the ground-breaking
news and as a result make impulsive statements/claims without verifying them
first!  Well, guess I'm just learning, being new to motorcar mechanics and
all of that stuff...  :)

It's not to much work.  Maybe an hour total. It's not hollow, but there
is a dimple. However, the ramp is thick enough to grind quite alot away
without going through. There are roller type bearings in there, but since
I'm not welding, No worries. I took mine apart and painted it so people
would know that it aint stock. You can do this without messing up the
potentiometer by mesuring its resistance with a digital multimeter (
Fluke meter ) so it can be put back to the stock setting. I would like to
dyno it.

<p>
Brian 93 VR6&gt;<BR>
&gt;     Brian, I guess you did the porting job yourself since it didn't cost
&gt; anything...was it a lot of work?  I believe that the stock throttle body is
&gt; hollow around that restrictive lip/ramp area, if so, did you have to use
&gt; epoxy or something since there are seals on the bearings that may be
&gt; heat-sensitive (i.e. not weldable)?  Any dyno or timing runs after you did
&gt; this?  Please excuse any redundant or repeated questions, I seem to recall
&gt; that there were some posts regarding this subject a while back, but I don't
&gt; remember the exact context...<BR>

   Darrell (Techtonics) is currently in the midst of his suite of tests on
VR6 performance parts, and here are some preliminary observations:

<p>
   Schrick 260  - about 12hp gain @ 5500rpm (over stock).
   Schrick 268  - unable to set to factory alignment, have to install in
"advanced" or "retarded" position.  Will result in a boost at either the
lower end or at the top end.<BR>
   ABT 268 - nice gain at the bottom, but a loss of 30hp at the top!!!
  Something funny going on here...

<p>
  Again, I would like to stress that these are totally unofficial preliminary
results, I don't have details of the test environment/context, and so can not
vouch for their accuracy.  In fact, Darrell would probably not be too pleased
that I've "published" them here as he told me that Techtonics won't have any
results available for public consumption for another couple of weeks (I
didn't find out the above from him).

<p>
   Just wanted to share the scoop with you and to let Darrell know that we in
the VR6 community support his efforts at obtaining objective measurements for
these mods.  Just call the above an unsubstantiated rumour, alright?

<p>

&gt; In a recent e-mail, a table of torque vs. rpm for various flavors of Corrados
&gt; was reproduced from the archive file "VR6_Power_Upgrades". I don't know about
&gt; the other columns, but the one for a stock SLC seems off. The table shows a
&gt; peak of 197 ft-lbs @ 4500; yet the factory figure is a peak figure of 177
&gt; ft-lbs. I guess we should take heed of the disclaimer which accompanied the
&gt; table "Note that I have no idea on the accuracy (or reliability) of any of
&gt; these measurements."<BR>

Hey,<BR>
I found a neat program that will compute optimum shift points, best launch
RPM. The program even has a cool simulated 1/4 race based on several current
vehicle models. You enter or modify your car specs and away it goes. To compute
shift points it does calculations and you see messages like "wheelspin" flash
across the screen.

<p>
 If someone wants it I could uuencode it and post it somewhere, or mail it to
someone to put on the webpage.

<p>
 Ric<BR>
 '69 912<BR>
 '72 Ghia<BR>
 '95 Jetta GLX

<p>
 This program could be used to figure optimum shift points for both modified and
unmodified Corrados.

   Heard that VW decided against a turbo VR6 after their experience with the
one-off turbo Sharan that Porsche did for them (280bhp) - apparently they
experienced some major overheating probems...  However, the forced induction
VR6 built in Florida appears to be running fine, Ron's Parts and Motronix are
plowing ahead with their respective turbo VR6 projects, and ND will be
working on theirs at some future point.  Approaches to lowering the
compression ratio range from head spacers to custom pistons to shorter
connecting rods.

<p>
   I mentioned a while ago about the 24-valve VR6 cylinder head prototype VW
was playing around with, looks like it won't ever go into production due to
cost considerations.  Boohoo.  Also depressing rumours have been circulating
of the VR6 being eventually phased out and replaced by a VR5...come on, VW,
first you killed the Corrado, and now the VR6???   Hopefully this is only
gossip and not reality...

<p>
   Bigger displacement VR6s seem to be surfacing everywhere.  To mention just
a few, a 3.1 litre GTI is being done in PA with custom titanium connecting
rods ($2300 for just the rods + balancing!) and possibly a Techtonics head:
 a Jetta GLX 3.1 was done by GTA in Canada and is now flexing its muscles in
Mexico:  Ron's Parts may be selling the really souped-up 3.1 they recently
installed in a Passat GLX as the customer wants to move on to a twin-turbo
3.1 crafted from a fresh block (RPI also popped a VR6 into a *Rabbit*, just
for fun!):  AMS has just completed a 3.0 VR6 GTI and will be working on a 3.0
Corrado.  Oh, not to forget my own 3.1 being put together by EIP... anyone
heard of any other conversions?

<p>

  Hmm, looks like America On-Line's internet gateway's acting up again!  I've
posted several messages to the list last week which either never showed up,
or appeared to everyone on the list except for me, or had the body text cut
off...

<p>
Anyway, here's the portion that were deleted from my response to Butch's
questions on performance upgrades to his Corrado VR6...yawn, now I can
finally retire to bed...<BR>
<HR>
&gt;Anyone in favor of<BR>
&gt;those $250 computer chips?  If so, which one is best.
   I'm currently using the APS (Neuspeed) chip on my 92 VR6.  Biggest
difference is the full-throttle response. The speed limiter has also been
removed, and the rev limit raised another 500rpm or so. Expect a gain from 7
to 12 hp, depending on what other mods you have installed. The Neuspeed chip
seems to be the most popular, but Autothority has its loyal following too.
 The AMS version is probably one of the best custom programmed ones currently
available, though I don't have any personal experience with it.  Dinan,
Superchips which claims an increase of 21 hp (rather optimistic?), and
Star*Chips in the UK also produce performance chips.

<p>
&gt;What about a throttle body<BR>
   I would consider this only after something like the P-Chip and P-Flow.
 You may decide $369.95 retail is too big a price to pay for a mere 5 hp or
so of power at the top end (at the possible expense of a small power loss at
the low end), or you may look into boring out the restrictive lip yourself.
 Options besides the well-known Neuspeed/European throttle-body include
custom enlarged versions from ELP/ND, Velocity, and European Import...

<p>
&gt; Cams...?<BR>
   For a stock-like idle and minimal impact on streetability and emissions,
the relatively mild Schrick 260 cams are recommended.  For even more peak
power (but pushed higher up in the powerband), Schrick or ABT 268.  (If you
are racing, Schrick has 276 cams available). Remember, at this point, you are
playing around with $1000+ items...

<p>
   BTW, the ABTs are made by Sugo and have distinctive hollow shafts which
make them lighter and so theoretically better at very high rpms, but this may
be only a theoretical advantage as we may be talking about 8000+ rpm, the
ABTs are lighter only along the axis/centre of rotation and so have less of
an impact, and are probably not as strong as the Schricks?

<p>
&gt;really nice but stock exhaust (I<BR>
&gt;noticed several Leistritz stamps throughout).  Is there a better one
&gt;available?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
   The stock system is hard to beat as VW really did an outstanding job
there.  I've heard the Leistritz Sports muffler advertised by some dealers
are comparable to the factory ones. Avoid some of the cheaper solutions which
replace the rear muffler with a domestic "turbo" version - louder but not
necessarily better!  Another approach commonly taken is to install a
straight-through pipe in place of the mid-muffler, or even the front muffler
(resonator).<BR>
   Autotech and Eurosport advertise their own custom exhaust systems, but I
would personally recommend New Dimension's forthcoming model judging by their
dyno test results. Very impressive.  You may look at the Supersprint and ABT
systems too, which should be good but rather pricey...

<p>
&gt;I would like to JUMP to 17", but what would that do to the handling?  Will
they<BR>
&gt;fit?  What size tires?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
  I'm going to leave this to my better-informed colleagues as it is a whole
subject matter in itself (also I'm starting to doze off, sorry)...  Check the
archives too.

<p>
Good luck in your quest for more performance!

   Ritchie (the person in Canada with the 3.1 litre Passat GLX) has already
logged a few thousand miles with his rebuilt engine, reports it's getting
looser with each passing mile, and that the torque just seem to be growing
stronger and stronger.

<p>
   He hopes to dyno his setup in the next week or two, and reports he has
already posted quarter-mile track times in the 14 second bracket and 0-60
times in the low 6 sec area - remember, the Passat is quite a heavy car
especially with the custom mega-stereo system he had installed.

<p>
   A little concerned with the torque steer he's getting despite the Quaife
differential, Rich is now toying with the idea of converting his car to a
Syncro version, but that will probably have to wait until the (twin) turbo
3.1 project gets underway in October.<BR>
Meanwhile, he can still enjoy the 3.1 and also his G60 Cabriolet...  BTW,
they'll be firing up the *VR6 Rabbit*  up at Ron's Parts today (Monday),
should be rather interesting!

<p>
&gt; Now I<BR>
&gt;also have put together a massive AP racing brake set-up for most VW's. The
&gt;kit uses 4 piston racing calipers with 12" rotors with optional 2 piston
rear<BR>
&gt;calipers<BR>
&gt;<BR>
   12" rotors, Tim?  Amazing!  Cost of these? (Probably even more amazing!)
 Actually, believe it or not, Rich is currently looking into a set of *13.5"*
calipers for his Passat...

 &gt;Hey,<BR>
 &gt;I am going to buy a new chip for my '90 G60 and Iam trying to decide which one.
 &gt;I have narrowed it down to the P-Chip from Nuspeed and the Q-chip from Autotech.
 &gt;Does anybody have a preference? Why? Should I also get the P-Flow or just a
 &gt;K&amp;N element replacement.

<p>
 &gt;Thanks,<BR>
 &gt;CB

<p>
Although I have a VR6 instead I'll share my opinion.

<p>
I'm really happy with my Autothority chip. I've heard that the Neuspeed ones
are too mild to make any noticable difference, so I got the Autothority one.
Some people wrote about knocking problems, but I haven't experienced anything
like that yet. If anyone has a VR6 and is looking into chips, this is one I'd
recommend looking into.

<p>
As for the P-flow, I bought it and got a bigger K&amp;N on it. I'm glad that I
bought the P-flow. I don't know if it's the sound that makes it seem more
powerful, but it does seem to get more power. It does seem to breath better
at higher RPM's. As for the bigger K&amp;N, I think that it's more cosmetic than
performance. It fills up the big space left by that huge air filter housing.

Some people keep saying that the Neuspeed chip isn't as noticble of a
difference, as some of the other manufactures.  First off if you want
your chip done a certain way, call APS and talk to Aaron like i did.
Explain what you want and he will help you out.  Aaron goes for the
highest settings he can within reason!!  He doesn't do what some of the
other manufactures do, which is advance the timming WAY to high.
I am on my second APS chip because i wanted some changes to the first
which Aaron did at NO COST.  The original had alot of advanced timing
all the way through the power band.....now it tapers off like it should at
the top end.<BR>
It performs much better than the first one did and my top end is MUCH
improved!!  Just my 2 cents!!

<H1>VSR for VW VR6 engines.</H1>

The following information is from the May 1993 issue of
Gute Fahrt. It's a paraphrased translation (if you could
imagine such a thing :-)).

By: Bernd Felsche  (bernie@metapro.DIALix.oz.au)

<hr>
To produce an acceptable product, tuners must nowadays pay  close
attention  to  what  they  are  doing.  Top-end performance is no
longer the only requirement. Potential clients are  also  seeking
wider  power  bands  and high drivability standards. A synergy of
utility   and   enjoyment    of    driving.    [Americans    hear
"Fahrvergnuegen."]  Only those tuners who achieve those goals are
highly regarded.<p>

Limited by the transverse mounting of  the  engine,  there  isn't
much  room  for generous inlet manifolding. In order to achieve a
good compromise between maximum power output, and adequate torque
in  day to day use, the inlet manifold runs across the top of the
head. This has circumvented the shortage of space and allowed the
use  of  an oscillating-flow tuned  inlet manifold. Each cylinder
has its own inlet tract that is tuned to such a length as to  en-
sure positive  inlet pressure.   As engine output is proportional
to the airflow, this scheme means that the VR6 doesn't have to be
ashamed  in  the  face of  competitors.  The  2.8  litre produces
174 PS [ DIN hp] and a maximum torque of 240 Nm at 4200 RPM,  and
the 2.9 litre engine in the  Corrado  achieves 245 Nm at the same
engine speed.  But this achievement wasn't enough to satisfy  the
Wolfsburg  developers.  To  achieve   even   more  torque,  lower
down in the rev range, the 6 cylinders were to breathe even  more
freely.    The   idea   of  the variable  inlet manifold [ german
"variables Saugrohr" ] was born and developed  in  parallel  with
the   now   standard version, with assistance  from  the Pierburg
GmbH in Neuss, a company which has a high reputation with  things
relating  to  mixture  control. The  VSR [  abbreviated  from the
german ] system did not go into, falling victim to the  red  pens
of   accountants   shortly  before  the  VR6 started  production.
That this piece of motor technology  was  not  condemned  to  the
depths  of  the Wolfsburg catacombs, is thanks  to the  interests
of Volkswagen Motorsport, based in Hannover. This VW company took
the  VSR and now  offers  it  as  an  after-market conversion kit
for 2888 Marks.  The kit may be fitted to all VR6s with  2.8  and
2.9 litre engines.<p>

Even though the VSR achieves similar aims to those of the switch-
ing  inlet manifold of the 2.8 litre V6s from Audi, the operating
principle is different. In the Audi engine, a long, narrow  inlet
tract  achieves  high torque at low revs; 245 Nm at 3000 RPM. The
maximum power is achieved using a short, wide inlet  tract,  pro-
ducing  174  PS at 5500 RPM. For the engine to be fed through the
appropriate channels, depending on engine speed, inlet  manifolds
are  switched using six individual, vacuum operated flaps at 4000
RPM. In both stages, the technology  is  based  purely  on  tuned
oscillating-flow in- let manifolds, with the necessary switching.<p>

The VSR in contrast, two diverse technologies are applied. It  is
designed  so  that at low engine speeds, resonance is used to im-
prove cylinder charging efficiency -- at higher RPM, oscillation-
tuned,   individual, broad tracts are used. Switching from one to
the other is achived by a single flap, also  vaccuum  operated at
4000   RPM.  The  tuned  inlet tract operates by the low pressure
caused between the throttle valve and the  inlet  valve,  by  the
suction  of  the descending piston, Through inertia of the air in
the tract, the airflow tends to keep moving  towards  the  inlet,
even  after  it's closed, causing a slight over-pressure when the
inlet valve next opens. This ensures high charge efficiency  even
during  early stages of the induction stroke.  Of course, further
during the same stroke, inlet pressure falls followed by  a  high
pressure but not before the inlet valve closes.<p>

In order to achieve optimal control of the  oscillation  and  re-
flection  of the column of air in the inlet tract, it needs to be
closely coordinated with valve timing, but this is  not  possible
due  to  variation  in  engine  speed. Even at mid-range-rpm, the
valve opening and the are out of synch. The second pressure  wave
arrives  much too early before the inlet valve closes and a back-
flow reduces fill efficiency.  Now to achieve high  torque  under
these  conditions,  resonance-fill  is utilised.  This is done by
closing the connection flap between  a  small  resonance  chamber
which  is  immediately  before short inlet tracts above the inlet
valves. This transforms the 6 cylinder  ending  into  effectively
two  3  cylinder  engines with uniform firing times, and which do
not have overlapping inlet strokes.  Resonance pulses  of  up  to
0.4 bar [approx 6 psi] above atmospheric are achieved, leading to
remarkable fill efficiency and torque increases.<p>

Even though fitting the VSR requires not great skills, it  should
be  undertaken by a professional with the right tools.  For exam-
ple, fitting the new EPROM and the new control  harness  requires
dexterity  and  special  tools.  The  new  chip doesn't alter the
previously-programmed behaviour of the engine management, it only
adds   an   additional   control  output  for  the  electrically-
controlled, vacuum operated flap. The kit  includes  instructions
as  to  complete  installion, including connections to the vaccum
circuit and electrical connections.<p>
<PRE>

</PRE>
Further engine modifications are not required, so one is  permit-
ted to anticipate the VSR transformation. A marked improvement in
torque at mid-range is advertised with 255 Nm available  at  3600
RPM on the 2.8 litre engine.  This corresponds to an 11% increase
at that engine speed. In the 2.9 litre  incarnation,  260  Nm  is
available, providing more performance in the most-used rev range.
There is no promise of more power in the higher RPM range.<p>

To illustrate the performance improvement  in  a  VSR  Golf,  one
doesn't  need any test equipment! Almost right from the start, at
below 3000 RPM, a new urge is sensed. Up to 4000 RPM  the  engine
provides  markedly better acceleration, yet above, the previously
expected manners appear because the torque curve  corresponds  to
that  of  the standard engine. Even more! After the impetuous ac-
celeration, the switchover feels almost reserved. The steeply in-
creasing torque curve up to 3600 RPM also shows a rapid fall back
to the norm between 3600 and 4000 RPM.  The torque improvement is
an excellent fit to the Golf VR6.<p>

In fourth gear, the torque boost corresponds to 90 to 120 kmh, in
fifth  to  110  to  150 kmh. This turns the Golf into a sprinter,
that none of the near-200 PS professionally tuned chariots  comes
near.  Testign  showed  that  acceleration  from 90 to 120 kmh in
fourth gear only took 5.4 seconds. The  standard  VR6  Golf  took
6.1  seconds  and  a  near-200  PS  Oettinger VR6 Golf taking 6.4
seconds, and a Wendland special taking 6.2 seconds. No wonder be-
cause their maximum torque happens at much higher RPM.<p>

Unremarkably, the VSR trick didn't improve peak  acceleration  or
top  speed,  both  of  these  being exclusively in the higher rev
range.<p>

The VR6 opens up a new field for  Volkswagen  Motorsport  tuning.
This  is appropriate when one expects high torque for comfortable
and sporty driving.  It's even more  attractive  because  testing
showed  reduced  fuel consumption by half a litre [ per 100 km ].
On the other hand, the VSR offers professional tuners an  innova-
tive  platform for development - as some of them have already in-
dicated.<p>

Wheel and Tire Guide for the Volkswagen Corrado

<p>
by John Leipsic<BR>
jleipsic@mcimail.com


<p>
For the performance oriented Corrado owner, new wheels
or tires can complement a most capable chassis.  Benefits of
an upgrade in wheels or tires extend to both appearance and
handling.  Serious street or auto-cross use demands specific
considerations for wheel diameter and tire size.

<p>
Corrado since introduction has come with 15 inch aluminum
alloy wheels.  '90 to '91 alloy wheels were a sixteen spoke
design in a six inch width rim.  These rims were first seen on
the Rallye two engine Golf. Many G60 owners have bent or
cracked these soft rims from large potholes or road debris.  In
1991, a spiffy set of BBS mesh wheels were included.  The
standard VW 4 bolt pattern of 4/100 was changed to a five bolt
design.   Smart looking 5 spoke speedlines from Italy were the
last look of production cars from Karmann in Osnabruk,
Germany.

<p>
Rim width was increased from 6 to 6 1/2 inches and tire width
increased from 195 to 205 mm.  The tire profile remained
unchanged at a ratio of 50.  Thus, stock tires for most '90
blowers are 195/50/15 while some '91 G60s and six bangers
get 205/50/15.  The number 50 is the ratio of tire width to
sidewall, or 50 percent of tire width.

<p>
A useful concept in wheel upgrades is the Plus system.  Plus
One is an increase in one inch on stock diameter, Plus Two,
two inches.  Plus One provides benefits in filling out the
abundant wheel space provided by VW.  Another advantage of
the plus system is to preserve stock wheel circumfrence for
spedometer accuracy.VWAG builds into their cars
consideration for aftermarket modifications

<p>
Plus One allows for a wider rim, and a narrower profile tire.
For a Corrado this is a 16 inch rim.  Consequently, lower profile
tires are recommended to reduce tire rubbing and provide
proper clearance.  Thus, 205/45/16 tires are well suited to Plus
One.  For Plus Two, 205/40, or even 215/40/17 tires can be
shod.  17 inch rims is beginning to push it a bit and may cause
some rim rubbing.

<p>
A low profile tire such as a 50 series gives improved handling
and turn in response.  A stiff sidewall is also incorporated into
the design of high performance tires.  Low profile tires also
come in Z, V, and H speed designations.  Z is the highest at
performance assured to sustained speeds above 149 mph.  V
is next  for speeds up to 149 mph.

<p>
Another important considerations in tire selection is
treadwear.  Most high performance tires sacrifice tread life for
their better grip and handling.  Tire life is also affected by
driving style and service practices such as tire rotation, wheel
alignment and inflation pressure. Treadwear is given as a
comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire.  A tire
graded 200 should have it's useful tread last twice as long as a
tire graded 100.

<p>
The quickest way to get a performance boost is to go with a
high performance tire in the same size as stock.  Even with the
stock rims, a tire size of 205/50/15 can be easily
accommodated in a G60.  Most folks prefer to wait until
Goodyear Eagle GA, Uniroyal 440 or other provided tires wear
out.  Although decent for most street uses, the original tires
can't fully exploit the limits of Corrado's world class chassis.

<p>
Pirelli's P-Zero line has received ongoing acclaim as a solid
advance in tire design and performance.  It comes in 195/50
and 205/50 for stock 15 inch rims.  Increasing a tire's width to
205 provides a larger contact patch.  The amount of rubber in
contact with the ground is increased, with better stick, hold
and breakaway values.  Some increased steering effort may be
noticed as another effect. Pirelli also makes the P700Z, in
stock and plus one sizes.  This tire incorporates a protective
lip for often expensive rims.  The P700Z is in a class with
Dunlop's SP8000, being fast and nimble, as tested and owned
by the author.  Prior to the PZero line, the P700Z was Pirelli's
top of the line.  Both sport tread wear indices of 140.  Pirelli's
advice with the P Zero line is to place P Zero Asimmetrico tires
on all four wheels, as this gives the best results for front wheel
drive.

<p>
Dunlop SP 8000s represent an evolution of the oft-praised D40
M2.  The D40 M2  was highly praised for accurate, immediate
turn-in, grip and tracking in corners.  Treadwear is 170, V
speed rating.  SP or sport 8000s gain high praise from drivers
for tenacious grip and confident wet handling.  Treadwear is
150*, Z speed rating and sized 195/50 and 205/50/15 and now
205/45/16.  Dunlop SP8000s will not disappoint the stock or
modified Corrado enthusiast.stock diameter sizes, and the
uncommon 205/45/16.  They come highly recommended as
well.  Dunlop also makes SP2000s, which have been included
stock on a few lucky VR6 Corrado.  The SP2000 is rated for
sport touring, with a quiet composed ride and better treadwear
than SP8000.

<p>
Yokohama's, also know as Yok's, have their devotees as well.
Yokohama A008RS are an autocross favorite, with notorious
stick reflecting the soft compound and tread wear index of 80.
Yok AVS Intermediate come in both stock sizes with a
treadwear index of 140.

<p>
Goodyear has the reputation of  "Badyear."  Michelin  MXX and
such have also met with disdain and poor wet performance.
Sumitomo, the parent company of Dunlop, makes HTR 50 in H
and V speed ratings  They come in 195/50 and 205/50 with an H
speed designation tread wear index is 220 . Preliminary reports
indicate the Sumitomo HTR 50H  as an economical and
satisfying tire.

<p>
Continental Sport Contact seem promising as they are stock
tires on high performance German autos.  However, ratings
have not held up this promise.  Contis get variously panned in
the press.  BF Goodrich Comp TA could also be briefly
entertained, but no real advantage would be gained.

<p>
Personally, I find the Dunlop SP8000s superior as an all around
performer.  After getting too radical on one onramp, the
SP8000s recovered my Corrado's composure with panache, as
ABS prevented a side slide.  Their handling and confidence in
wet conditions is becoming legendary.  Tires on this level
provide a perfect complement to Corrado's capabilities.

<p>
For winter tires, Conti Winter Contact are a good choice.  Or
the high tech water absorbent cell structure of Bridgestone
Blizzaks are state of the art.  Blizzak's are designed so that the
soft-cell structure wears for one winter season and leaves a
set of all seasons to drive after.  Pirelli makes an __H__ rated
185/55/15 tire, the Winter 210P tires which is great in the snow
and not too bad in the dry either.

<p>
With a full set of 4 snow tires, Corrado holds it's own in snow
and ice.  A width of 185/55/15 is recommended by VW and
Bentley manual for winter tires.  The narrower width provides
better traction, and higher sidewall protects the rim.  Steel
wheels can be used in winter as well.  If studded tires are
allowed in your region, Corrado's front wheel design provides
even better inclement handling.  Studded tires and I became
close friends in the great northern reaches of Alaska.
Incidentally, the name Blizzak come from blizzard, and the
postal designation for Alaska, AK.

<p>
Rim selection is highly subjective, with personal taste and
preference foremost.  One advantage to a new set of rims is
that most aftermarket rims in 15 inch are 7 inch width.  It is
surprising to feel how much of a difference one inch can make
over stock G60 6 inches or VR6 6.5 inches.  And they say size
doesn't matter!  For the G60, this results in a greater rim
contact area of 4 inches, enough to make a difference you
can feel.

<p>
Another important consideration for aftermarket rim selection
is offset.  Offset is the length between the mounting hub and
inner rim of a wheel.  This length is important because offset
too great can cause rubbing against inner wheel well or
suspension components.

<p>
Corrado G60 4 bolt rims 7 X 15, that is 7 inch width by 15 inch
diameter can handle offset of 20 to 43.  7.5 X 16 offset of 20 to
37, 7.5 X 17 offset 20 to 30.  Corrado VR6 5 bolt rims 7 X 15
offset to 33, 7.5 X 16 offset to up 357.5 X 17 offset of  up  to 35,
8 X 17 offset of  up to 35.  This data was derived from the D &amp;
W aftermarket German catalog.

<p>
A sharp rim on the Corrado is the Borbet Type C, six spoke
tapered modern design.  MSW Type 55 have also been a good
choice.  Antera Opus One are a radical three spoke design,
very expensive.  One disadvantage to a three spoke design is
the increased exposure of wheel and brake assemblies.  Some
poor souls go as far to ask, "what's all that stuff behind the
wheel?"  Rota Anteres is a  more frugal copy of Antera's five
spoke design.  For those wanting the stock VR6 look,
speedlines can be ordered.

<p>
Momo has come out with a beautiful selection of rims.  Momo
Idea and Momo Evolution have interchangeable center caps,
for a modern techno look, or classic 5 spoke.  Momo Arrows
are a striking design, with split spokes.

<p>
All tires and wheels are best purchased mail order.  The sales
staff are often helpful and knowledgeable for attaining a proper
fit.  Two advertisers in european car carry competitive prices,
and wheel/tire packages.  Always check with these supply
houses, Discount Tire Direct and The Tire Rack.  Buying
wheels and tires at the same time leads to better deals and
negotiating room.  Also, Tire Rack and Discount Tire mount
and balance the tires at the warehouse.  Tires come ready to
mount.  Always use proper jacking and support for selfmounting.  
A floor jack is a wise investment.  Jack stands are
also helpful.

<p>
One way to get an idea of what new rims would look like is to
cut out the photo ad inserts and place them on a photo of a
Corrado.  Or go to a local VW show and see what rims you like.
Or a local performance shop that may have some.  Keep in
mind that most aluminum alloy rims are finished with silver
clearcoat paint.  But the depth of luster and quality of paint
varies greatly.  You get what you pay for, with the fit and finish
of Momos, Borbet and Antera excellent.

<p>
Custom rims are precision designed and finished.  Always
insist any installer hand torque your new rims carefully.  Using
power torque wrenches can lead to overtightening, potentially
warping rims.  Wheel locks are a must as well.  MacGuard are
efficient and easy to install.  The key has a metal insert that
may wear out with long term use.  Gorilla locks are
recommended by Discount Tire, with a solid key and bolts with
surface grooves.

<p>
One drawback to a larger rim, either 16 or 17 inch, and reduced
sidewall is increased ride harshness.  Also a lower profile tire
provides less rubber to protect your expensive rims.  But the
advantages of improved wheel well fill, wider width tire, and
lower profile sidewall provide a far more pleasing combination
and improvement over stock.  One advantage to getting new
rims is saving the stock alloys for a second set of rims.  Winter
wheels with snow tires kept on hand can be real useful when
the slippery stuff arrives.

<p>
I  hope this guide has been a helpful start to outfitting your
Corrado with new tires and wheels.

<h1> Sport Springs</H1>
from: TurboTim at New Dimensions<p>

Here is some info on suspension for Corrados. It was refering to someone who
said Eibach sells the same spring for the 4 as the 6.

<p>
***Quote from Roland at H&amp;R/Neuspeed****

<p>
Springs are the workhorse of the suspension system. The springs support the
weight of the chassis, including the passengers and load. The springs
function as a cushion over irregular road surfaces. They also help control
body roll, brake dive and rear squatting on acceleration. Spring rates, or
spring stiffness, greatly influence the handling characteristics of the
chassis.<BR>
There are as many different ways to do suspension spring Research &amp;
Development as there are companies offering springs. Most spring companies
are not able to even do R &amp; D because they do not have the ability or
knowledge to produce a spring design. These spring companies product designs
are basically stock spring with a shortened ride height, or poor copies of
some other spring brand. While other spring manufacturers try to use one
spring design for as many different fitments as possibly. This cuts down on
part numbers, reduces stock in warehouse and in turn cuts down on overhead
costs.<BR>
The only other reason other spring brands can sell there inefficient springs
is because of the foamy bump stop used in modern automotive suspensions
supports there soft low springs. This foamy bump stop acts like a spring and
is actually doing part of the spring work, the German spring industry even
calls it a spring - Gummi Hohle Feder - or gummi spring. There are several
reasons car manufactures use this long foamy bump cushion. Some of these
reasons are that they make the suspension progressive, that is, as the
suspension compresses the bump stop compress and builds up resistance, just
like a progressive spring. This gives a nice cushy ride and never has that
hard "I am hitting the bump stop feeling". The fomay bump stop also allows
car manufacteres to use a simple linear spring design with a thin wire
diameter. This saves weight and most importantly manufacturing costs. This
type of suspension set up may be good for satisfying the average driving
publuic, but does nothing for performance driving. A soft lowering spring
when used with a big foamy bump stop, will result in a spongy, bouncy ride.
This happens because the bump stop is doing the work and not the spring. The
rebound value of the compressed bump stop is different from a precisely
designed progressive spring. The bouncy rebound of the foamy bump stop also
causes shock absorbers to wear out quicker.
When tuning suspensions the right way the bump stop used for its indented
purpose, to keep the suspension from touching metal to metal in extreme
compression situations. When the springs are engineered correctly the
suspension should rarely go to full bump stop and the springs should be doing
their job. On the Corrado VR6 Neuspeed shortens the front bump stop and
offers a progressive spring which is working at a precisely calculated rate.
This set up gives a more predictable performance suspension that the shocks
are able to dampen without bouncing.<BR>
At Neuspeed, design starts with an understanding of the automotive
enthusiast's needs. These needs are considered by neuspeed engineers and are
integrated into each design. Key elements involved in development include
ride height and spring rate, which are dictated by the handling
characteristics of the stock chassis, stock suspension limitations, tire and
fender well clearance. Neuspeed engineers have a combined total of over 90
years of suspension tuning experience. Neuspeed knows Volkswagens!

<H1>Modyfing the Air Box</H1>
NOTE: This is a modification for the VR6 Air Boxes only. The G60's do not 
have the mesh filter or the snorkel. They only have a straight tube that 
connects to the back of the light. But this may be also taken out. Some 
(Jan) say it is too noisy.<p>

 from:lobo@nando.net (Matt Ridge) 

<p>
The article begins on page 52 of EC from July '95.  The modifications are
done to a Jetta GLX and vary slightly for the Corrado.  You will probably
need a medium length screwdriver to pry open the clips that hold the box
closed (this is actually the most difficult part of the procedure).  Once
you get the top loose, unscrew the two screws that hold the airflow sensor
to the box top and slide the top off of the sensor.  Now I had to remove a
10mm screw holding a A/C tube to the inside of the fender.  With this screw
out, the tube can be moved out of the way to allow easier removal of the air
box top.  After you get the top out of the car, remove the air filter and
you will see a oblong shaped fine wire mesh screen covering the air inlet.
This is the screen EC talks about, but it looks a lot different than the
pictures.  To get at it, I removed the air entire air box by popping the two
rubber bands (actually two big O-rings) off of the hooks - be careful not to
let them drop into the engine area.  With the box removed, you have to
remove the entire inlet tube from the box.  I think it slides right out - I
can't remember.  The screen is now accesible from all sides.  My screen was
riveted in (3 or 4 places) and I did not have a drill handy so I pried and
basically ripped the rivets out with a screwdriver.  I ended up pretty much
mangling the screen, so if you plan on putting it back in, you should drill
out the rivets.  The box goes back together in reverse order.

<p>
The "snorkel" tube in the air box top is easily removed by hammering it out
(from the inside of the box out).  I did both of these mods at the same time
so I don't know which one caused the majority of the power improvement.

<p>
Good luck - I think it is worth the time!

<p>
P.S.  Two people that have also done this mod responded to my e-mail by
telling me that everything should be OK, but I probably want to replace the
air filter with a K&amp;N or Amsoil one.  I planned on this, but have not yet
done it.

Alternative solution to the By-Pass Kit

</HEAD>
<H2>Alternative Solution to the By-Pass Kits for G60's ($45)</H2>
(mousetrap@juno.com)<p>

This is a plug.  As such, please do not post it in whole or in part to 
any discu
ssion group or forum where it would be considered inappropriate due to 
commercia
l content.  It is not my intention to slam Neuspeed, New Dimensions, 
AutoThority
, or any other of the fine aftermarket suppliers developing VW 
performance parts
.  The bottom line is simple:  the concept behind the Neuspeed Gen2 
kit is good.
  It works, but you do not have to spend $200 to get the same effect.
<p>
<h3>A brief explanation of Neuspeed's Gen2 kit:</H3>

While it is called the "HP2 Fuel Enrichment Kit" (also "Gen2"), there 
is more to
 the story.  Fuel enrichment is not the key ingredient.  The Gen2 
modifications
increase boost levels by eliminating pressure losses caused by leakage 
through t
he Idle Stabilizer Valve.  When the motor is idling, the ISV regulates 
air flow
from the bypass tube to the intake manifold to control idle speed.  
Under boost
conditions, the ISV can reduce boost levels by bleeding boost pressure 
from the
manifold into the bypass tube.  One unfortunate side effect of the 
stock set-up
is that the bled air being returned to the inlet of the G-60 is hot 
(from having
 already gone through the G-lader at least once), and increases the 
charge tempe
rature (which reduces power output and increases chances of 
detonation).
<p>
The Gen2 kit (and others) reroutes the ISV, disconnecting it from the 
bypass tub
e.  The immediate gains are noticeable.  A G-60 motor with the small 
blower pull
ey will make only 14.5psi  max. with the stock ISV routing.  A leaking 
ISV may b
leed that down to as low as 10psi.  The same pulley with the ISV rerouted 
makes
16.5psi max.  The benefits are similar even with the stock pulley.
<p>
The Gen2 kit also comes with a "fuel enrichment" system.  It is the same 
as the
enrichment system that has always come with their HP kits.  It ties into 
the fac
tory's system.  The stock G-60 motor has fuel enrichment that is 
activated at fu
ll throttle only.  Neuspeed's  "hobbs" switch parallels the full throttle 
switch
, activating the enrichment by boost rather than throttle position.  
There is so
me discussion as to whether or not this serves a real purpose.  A boost 
gauge sh
ows that it is near impossible to get more than a few psi of boost 
without havin
g the throttle wide open (even with the ISV rerouted).
<p>
Is there a down side to the Gen2 kit?  Not if the engine is in decent 
shape to b
egin with.  Neuspeed claims it adds 17hp.  Anything that adds power may 
have a s
light impact on longevity, but the 1.8 block and head are very sturdy 
from the s
tart.  The kit does not seem to increase oil or water temperatures at 
all.  It i
s a great may to get more from the G-60 without spinning it any faster.  
If your
 ISV was developing problems, the ISV reroute should improve your idle.  
Neuspee
d has gotten an exemption number to make their kit legal in all 50 
states.  It s
hould have no effect on emissions test result, and is virtually 
unnoticeable dur
ing a visual inspection of the engine compartment.<p>
If you have a Neuspeed HP1 kit and want to upgrade to the features of HP2 
(Gen2)
, all you need is the ISV reroute parts.  The ISV reroute can be added to 
any G-
60 motor, regardless of previous modification.  If you are running an 
AutoThorit
y Stage 1, 2, or 3 kit you can add the ISV reroute.  The AT kits that 
included t
he high pressure Porsche 944 fuel regulator already provide fuel 
enrichment.  If
 you do not have any aftermarket enrichment you have two choices.  One 
school of
 thought is to do without enrichment.  Again, it is rare to have a high 
boost, p
art throttle situation which is when the "hobbs" style of enrichment is 
activate
d.  Without the "hobbs" switch, this situation could result in the 
mixture getti
ng lean and causing the knock sensor to retard the timing.  The drop in 
power wo
uld probably cause you to open the throttle all the way, engaging the 
factory en
richment switch.  The other option is simple.  Buy a "hobbs" switch (from 
NAPA)
and wire it to the factory throttle switch.  Put small plastic "T" in a 
manifold
 pressure line to sense boost level and suddenly you have boost sensing 
fuel enr
ichment.
<p>
Hopefully you now have an understanding of what this plumbing trick is 
all about
.  Rerouting the ISV is a neat way to get more power at little cost.  The 
fuel e
nrichment system is already in place on many cars.  If you do not have it 
alread
y, it may not be required.  You may want to wait and try the ISV reroute 
before
determining if you want to add the "hobbs" switch.
<p>

<h3>The hard sell:</h3>

For $45, I will sell you a complete kit of everything you need to install 
the IS
V reroute.  It works on all G-60 Corrados* and other G-60 equipped motors 
which
have the ISV.  It comes with very easy instructions.  If you know how to 
use a s
crewdriver, installation takes about 30 minutes.  There are not very many 
pieces
.  The most important component is the junction fitting in the boost 
tube.  A nu
mber of people reported problems with the fitting supplied by Neuspeed.  
Some we
re sloppily made and required a lot of clean up and de-burring before 
installati
on.  I take great care in fabricating the fitting that comes in my kit.  
It is r
eady to install right out of the box.  My kit also includes complete 
instruction
s for installing a "hobbs" switch enrichment system on your car if you 
want to a
dd it.  I include a list of parts that you can get at your local NAPA 
store (abo
ut $30 in all); installation is easy and takes about 20 minutes.
<p>
I have not sought an exemption number, so you get this disclaimer:  Parts 
may be
 considered not legal for use on pollution controlled vehicles -- check 
local la
ws.  In WA, we have to emission test every other year.  Visuals are done 
randoml
y on cars passing the sniffer test.  ISV mods will go undetected.  If you 
are un
sure, you could remove it for the test.  It takes about 5 minutes to 
remove/repl
ace after the initial installation.
<p>
*A small percentage of 1992 model G-60 Corrados require an additional 
hose.  It
is not needed for 90-91 or most 92 cars.  I don't include this part 
(neither doe
s Neuspeed).  If you have one of the few 92's that need it, the 
additional hose
is about $12 at your local auto parts chain.

<h3>How to order my kit:</h3>

Send $45.00 + $4 shipping  to:<p>

Michael Daily<br>
2856 SW Adams, Suite B<br>
Seattle, WA 98126<br>
<p>
Please remember to include your shipping address and a daytime phone 
number.  I
fabricate the fittings once a week, so you might want to e-mail me 
<MDaily632@ao
l.com>  and tell me you have set in an order.  That way I can reserve one 
from t
hat week's batch.  Otherwise there can be up to a six day delay in 
getting it ou
t to you.  You do not have to e-mail me (MDaily632@aol.com), but if you do I 
can usually ship a kit
to you the day after I receive your order.
<p>
<h3>For international orders:</H3>

Outside of USA, send (US)$50 and I will ship via UPS international 
service.  UPS
 will collect freight, duty, and taxes at time of delivery.  The extra $5 
is for
 filling out the stack of necessary paperwork.<p>

<H1> Fixing the Sunroof Lining</H1>
By: Corrado-l member<p>
<PRE>
Does anyone have any experience on fixing the headliner coming unglued from
 the sunroof.  The dealer fix is to have you buy the sunroof piece the new
piece of fabric is glued to for $210!!  And that does not include labor!  Is
 there a special spray glue that is best for this?
</PRE>
<p>
Yes, the same thing happened on mine. I finally got tired of getting the
liner in my hair and bits of foam in my eyes trying to stuff it in the cracks.

<p>
First, remove the center panel (with headliner) and surrounding frame.
You don't need to remove the sunroof to do this!
(For my '90 G60....)<BR>
<OL>
  <LI> Tilt the sunroof open.
  <LI> Bang(or press or something) the inner panel towards the front of the car -
        it just slides loose. You can't remove it by itself, just yet.

</OL>
<p>
Grab the outline part of the headliner (the part that doesn't tilt) and
force it toward the rear of the car. It will slide back.
What I did then was slide it back far enough to get to the screws holding
the center part to the frame, and removed them. You can then remove the
frame by turning it 90 degrees in the empty part of the roof (in the back)
and pulling it out towards the windshield. Installation is the reverse
of removal (ahem). NOTE that this is not what the manual says to do...
I just couln't find the torx screw they were talking about, but it still
came out. Maybe it's the updated sunroof...

<p>
I next took off the headliner material from both parts, 1/2 at a time.
You may just want to buy new material from a cloth store (I didn't)
Scrape off the old foam from both liner and sunroof thing. Also scrape
off old glue (green) from the plastic sunroof thing.
I then used 3M spray glue I got at HI/LO for headliners and glued it back,
1/2 a piece at a time for easy placement and centering. Works pretty good!
You can`t even tell the foam is missing by looking at it. Doesn't feel as
soft when you press down, but who cares?

<p>
Oh yeah, glueing the border thing is a bitch. The liner stuff stretches.

<p>
Good luck!

<H1>Solution to Flooding Corrado</H1>
By: Corrado-l memebr<p>

Did you ever have a pool of water in your corrado? Either by washing the 
car or in a rainstorm? Well then, this might be your easy solution:<p>
<p>
Lift the hood and you'll see the big gutter running from side to side below
the windshield.  At either end, below the hinge for the hood, is a drain
hole.  The one on the driver side is bigger and unobstructed by any
mechanisms, thus more free flowing, explaining why most people have the
problem on the passenger side.

<p>
The passenger side drain is smaller and has the tube for the wiper fluid
coming up through it, making it much easier to clog with leaves and debris.
When a large volume of water, such as that from a car wash, fills the
gutter and tries to drain out, it drops right out on the driver side but
may pool on the passenger side.

<p>
Note that right beside this drain is the intake for the ventilation system.
It's about a six inch wide, two inch high tube held down with plastic tabs
and with a sticky foam rubber gasket to seal the bottom edge.  Mine was
sealing perfectly and in excellent condition, but if your problem is
chronic, you may want to check it.

<p>
To remove the intake tube, you'll have to lift off the rubber strip on the
FORWARD wall, and you can lift away the flimsy plastic cover.  I recommend
against trying to loosen the rear edge; it's covered by the robust strips
covering the bottom edge of the windshield, and I broke several plastic
tabs trying the lift these off.  Anyway it isn't necessary.  Move the
flimsy plastic thing aside and you'll see, on the outside edge of the
intake tube, a little black cotter thing with an upright tab.  Pull that
piece out and the intake tube will be free...careful peeling it up.  If
it's in good shape, put it right back down because you want want to get the
sticky surface dirty.

<p>
Here's where I discovered the problem most of us are probably having.
Looking inside the intake tube, I could see trails in the dust where the
water had spilled over the top and poured into the ventilation system, to
drop out onto the passenger's feet.  By pouring water into the passenger
side drain, I saw that it clearly drained more slowly than the driver side.

<p>
I used a clothes hanger to ream out the drain; it had some muck in it, but
not much.  It flows a little better now, but even with a perfectly clear
drain, the passenger side can be overwhelmed and water will always pour
into the car.

<p>
Workarounds:

<OL>
  <LI> Make sure the air is turned OFF when you take the car to the wash.
    Some lazy carwash guys may leave the key in the accessory position
    (they often do if you're getting foam wax, sometimes they turn the
    lights on to signal this).  I don't know if the suction into the
    intake would be enough to lift water in, but it's something to try.

  <LI> Don't let the car be in heavy water conditions.  I know that's
    not much help for some people.

</OL>

<H2> Now that I have solved the problem, how do I clean up the mess?</H2>


I had the same problem. I parked my Corrado in the driveway over night.
Heavy rain showers flooded the passenger side that much that there
was a centimeter of water above the carpet. After getting out most
of the water it took me two days using a fan heater and a hair dryer
to dry the carpet and damping material between carpet and floor.
After removing the seat and lifting the carpet as much as you can
without tearing it apart or removing the middle console (0.5 m) and
fixing it in that position, I put the fan heater below.
I ran it on low temperature (1kW) and put the hair dryer on low
temperature (250 Watt) into corners where it is impossible to dry
with the fan heater. Then I opened all windows and the sunroof and
closed the doors. From time to time I changed the position of the
dryers. It is important to check temperatures of the parts where the
heater blows to and to keep enough distance between heater and
the stuff to dry.<BR>
I tried to get the water out of the damping material with a
spin dryer but the mat was torn into pieces even at low RPM :-(.
Then I squeezed it out by hand as much as possible and used the
fan heater to get out the remaining wet.
It has to be fixed during drying in the shape it should have when dry.

<p>
I found two reasons for the flooding.<BR>
The water came in through the heating fan because the drains were
blocked with leaves and the gasket of the fans intake snorkel was
worn out. Replacing the snorkel and regularly cleaning the drains
avoided that procedure since then.

<H1> How to change the Activation speed of your Spoiler</H1>
By: Corrado-l member<p>

Well, here it is... how to change the speed at which your spoiler goes up
and down. Jan, feel free to add to your page/FAQ..



<p>
First you need to find the spoiler control module. It's NOT a relay in/above
the fuse box. There is a module about twice the width of a relay mounted
to the dashboard on the driver's side. The easiest way to find it is just
to trace the wiring from the spoiler switch. It goes directly to the module,
which is about a foot away. The module slides off the metal mount.
Go ahead and do so.<BR>
Next, you'll need to take apart this module. The connector side has a plastic
cover that comes off with some prying. Now the circuit board slides right out.

<p>
What you are interested in is a pair of resistors towards the top of the
circuit board, as illustrated:

<PRE>
                this resistor
                      |
        |-------------|----------------------|
        |  ----    X  o   O     [  ]    []   |	X=transistor
        |  ----   []  o-        [v ]         |
        |  ----      [  ]       [w ]   O     |  o = resistor
        |  ----      [v ]    O               |
        | [] [   ]   [w ]                    |	[], O =capacitor
        |    [ 4 ]                           |
        | [] [ 0 ]   =====      =====        |  [   ]
        |    [ 0 ]   |   |      |   |        |  [   ]   = chips
        |    [ 1 ]   |R1 |      |R2 |        |  [   ]
        |            =====      =====        |
        |             -diode-                |   R1,R2=relays
        \___________________________________/
           |  {}  |                |    |
           |  {}  |                |    |
</PRE>

<p>
                connector side, component side up


<p>
Simply put, it's the topmost resistor not counting the group of 4 on the left
side. Its value is 590 Kohm, 1% tolerance(!). Replacing this resistor with a
lower value will raise the speed at which the spoiler rises. After some
experimentation, I found that a 220k resistor will increase the raise speed
to about 67 mi/h (110 km/h), as well as the lowering speed to 35 mi/h.
I'm guessing that by changing the resistor directly below you can change
the lowering speed independently. I didn't bother, since I got exactly what
I wanted with the one change.

<p>
The 220k resistor is commonly available, even at radio shack. Just as a side
note, these two resistors are the only two that appear to be hand soldered on
the board, and the only two with 1% tolerance... maybe someone in Europe with
too much time on their hands could find out what values are used over there.

<p>
You could also send $75 to AMS and have them solder in the 10c resistor for you.

<H2>Need more Customizing?</H2>

Well, I had some spare time on my hands so I did some math regarding this
modification.  People who wish to select their spoiler activation speed may
find this information rather useful, and I really believe that the predicted
outcome will closely reflect actual results.  Jan, if you want to also add
this portion under the FAQ, feel free.
<p>
Here's what I did:
I took the measured resistance of the OEM resistor (the 45mph one) - 618k
ohms
And, the measured resistance of the 67mph resistor - 221k ohms
All resistances where measured with a Fluke 87 DMM
<p>
I then set up a linear regression equation using my trusty scientific
calculator.  This is what I came up with:
<p>
MPH = 79.25 + (Resistance)(-5.5416 x 10E-5)   or
Resistance = 1430045.45 + (MPH)(-18045.45)
<p>
If you look at the top formula, you will see that the maximum activation
speed can only be approximately 79.25 MPH (substitute a zero for resistance -
short circuit).
<p>
I made a chart of theoretical activation speeds @ various resistances:
<p><PRE>
MPH       Resistance	Popular resistor sizes and speeds
50            528k                                470k - 53.2
55            438k                                390k - 57.6
60            347k                                330k - 61.0
65            257k                                270k - 64.3
67            221k                                220k - 67.0
70            167k                                180k - 69.3
75             77k                                150k - 70.9
79.25           0                                 120k - 72.6
                                                  100k -73.7 
                                                  82k -74.7 
                                                  68k -75.5

<H1>Changing the Oil in a VR6</H1>

 Hi all, I'd like to change my own oil for the first time on my VR6, and
I'd like to know what to look out for, what tools I'll needs etc.

<p>
What follows is Mike's (anal retentive?) guide to changing the oil in
a VR6 engine.  Someone please preserve it, I took a while writing it,
but I think it covers everything.  Feedback would be appreciated, of
course!  Jan, we doubtless have something exactly like this already
that makes this whole dissertation redundant, right?

<p>
You will need:

<OL>
  <LI> 6 quarts of mobil-1 15W50 motor oil.

  <LI> one 8mm hex wrench

  <LI> one huge (36mm) socket, and a socket wrench, OR a 36mm box wrench.
   It's big, the same size as the axle end-bolts on a VW Beetle. :)

  <LI> a small screwdriver from an electrical kit, or a nail or something to
   remove the old filter gasket from the plastic filter cover.

  <LI> and a 19mm or 3/4-inch wrench for the oil-pan bolt.

</OL>
<p>
Run the car for a while to warm the oil, doing this will cause it to
run out of the pan and filter much faster.  Wait a few minutes after
turning the car off, of course, to let the oil cool enough to not burn
you... this is about 15 minutes or so, I guess.

<p>
Remove the oil-cap from the top of the engine, so that the oil will
drain better.

<p>
Put the oil receptacle under the oil filter.  Take your 8mm hex wrench
and unscrew the small aluminum plug at the bottom of the oil filter
cover, and let the oil drain out of there and into your receptacle for
a while, 15 minutes.  If you don't wait this long, when you take the
filter cover off there will still be a bunch of oil left in there, and
it'll get all over you.

<p>
When oil has stopped dripping from the plug, take that big socket and
loosen the plastic filter cover.  remove it, and take out the paper
filter element.

<p>
Use the small screwdriver (or basically any small item capable of
grabbing that o-ring) remove the rubber o-ring from the plastic filter
cover.  Take your new one and oil it up in the oil that you recently
drained from the oil fiter.  Place the new o-ring onto the plastic
filter cover the way the previous one was.

<p>
Take your brand new oil filter that you paid megabucks for and attach
it to the plastic filter cover... it should click into place.  Take
the aluminum plug and screw it back in there.  It's just made out of
aluminum, so don't screw it in too hard or you'll do ugly things to
the screw-threads.

<p>
Now take your whole filter/cover/plug assembly and screw it back into
place.  Wipe excess oil from the area, so that sand and other uglies
won't stick there later.  Make sure to get the oil off the hoses that
VW so nicely placed right in the way there.

<p>
Part one of your job is finished.

<p>
Part two is just like draining the oil from any other car, slide under
the car, position the oil recepticle under the oil-pan bolt, grab your
19mm or 3/4 inch wrench and take the bolt off.  If you've waited long
enough after running the engine, you should be able to remove the bolt
by hand without scorching your fingers... the bonus of this is that
the bolt won't fall into your oil-receptacle-- forcing you to fish for
it.

<p>
Wait a while as the oil drains.  It's a good time for you to towel all
that oil that you got on your hands while fishing around in the hot
oil, looking for the bolt. :)  Remember to remove the old brass (copper?)
bolt-gasket/washer from the oil pan bolt.

<p>
When the oil is all drained outta there, put a brand new brass
(copper?) gasket/washer on the bolt, and screw it back into the pan.
Make sure the bolt is relatively tight, but don't kill it with the
wrench; you shouldn't really need to lean on the wrench.  Wipe all oil
from the bolt and the bottom of the pan, you'll get a chance later to
see if it's leaking.

<p>
Now, pour five of your six quarts of Mobil-1 15W50 into the crankcase,
via that hole VW has placed in the top of your engine.  Replace the
oil-cap on the engine, get into your car and run the engine for a
minute or so.  Listen with avid interest as the oil fills the filter
and the valve-lifters pressurize.  Try to ignore the oil light as it
tells you you have no oil in your engine, it will (should!) go out in
a few short seconds.

<p>
Stop your engine, and as the oil drains back into the pan, take the
oil you just removed from your engine and pour it into the five empty
mobil-1 bottles.  If you run out of bottles to put the old oil
into... Hmm, I don't know, put the rest into a plastic milk-carton or
something.  Go into your apartment and have lunch, or take the old oil
off to the recycler.

<p>
After lunch (about 30 minutes), come out and take a look at the oil
level in your engine, via the dipstick.  Take it out once, clean it
off, stick it back in there, take it out and look at the level.  It
should be very low.  Remove the oil-cap, take your last new quart of
Mobil-1, and pour it into the oil-filler hole, periodically checking
the oil level on the dipstick in the same fashion as described above.
When you get close to the top of the textured region of the dipstick,
cap your Mobil-1 and put it in the back of your car to use in case of
some horrible oil-loss emergency.  Replace the cap on your engine.

<p>
The next time you go driving somewhere for a long enough period of
time to get the engine and oil hot (i.e., more than 10 minutes), after
parking the car, take a look under there at that oil pan bolt.  You
should be able to see it from the front end of the car if you get your
eyes down close enough to the ground.  If there's oil on the bolt, you
need to tighten it a little more.

<p>
There, you're done.  Was it harder or easier than you thought? :)

<H1> Idiot's Guide to Brake Replacement</H1>
From:	bdunning@netcom.com (Brian Dunning)<p>

<b>Please Note:</b>This procedure differs from the procedure in the 
maintanance manuals. To be safe, please read both instructions and 
use common sense!<p>
 <HR>

<p>
I have successfully solved my problems, completed the job, and hereby issue
this Idiot's Guide for the benefit of other non-technical, non-mechanically
inclined Corrado owners who wouldn't mind finding $100 in the street by
doing their own brake job.

<p>
I have a 92 SLC.  If by any chance your model's brakes differ from mine,
you should have gotten a 92 SLC.

<p>
A few special tools are needed:

<OL>
  <LI> A 17mm socket.  I broke two sockets before going out and getting a
Craftsman socket, so make sure it's a good one.

  <LI> An 8mm hex drive.  Contrary to at least one prior post, the rear
calipers are held on with hex bolts, not conventional bolts.

  <LI> A damn big C-clamp, 6-inch capacity.

  <LI> A big arm for the socket and hex drive, preferably at least a foot
long.  My bolts were on so tight I couldn't believe it.

  <LI> That famous little cube thing, a "universal disc brake tool," only
needed for the rear brakes.  Available at any auto parts store, you'll
almost certainly need a file or hacksaw to make it fit the VW brake piston.

  <LI> A reliable way to jack up your car.  You'll be yanking and tugging with
all your strength with your head inside the wheel well, so the stock jack
is absolutely not adequate (I used the stock jack, but then piled up big
pieces of wood to use as jack stands).

  <LI> A way to get the wheels off your car.  For some reason, my lug nuts
have always seemed permanently welded on.  Last time I got tires, the shop
had to drill out five of the lug nuts.  This time I didn't mess around and
got the huge Craftsman metric tire iron, the big "X" kind with the needed
17mm socket on one end.  It still took two people to get my lugs off.

</OL>
<p>
So much for the materials; if you've got everything (including, of course,
brake pads), the whole thing should be done in about 2 hours max.  Less if
you've done it before.

<p>
<STRONG>FRONT BRAKES</STRONG>

<p>
Easiest, so do them first to get your feet wet.  Take off the wheel,
obviously.  On the back of the caliper, you'll see two big 17mm bolts.
Take those off first.

<p>
Now the caliper's loose; you just have to manhandle it off the rotor.  If
it's hard to get off, try prying one end off first.  The brake line is now
the only thing holding it on...be careful of that.  Try not to let the
whole caliper hang by the brake line.

<p>
Take out the old pads.  They just snap right out.  If your brakes have been
clanking over bumps, here's where you'll see the broken brake clips.
Contrary to other prior postings, the brake clips are riveted onto the
outer edges of the pads; they are not separate pieces.

<p>
Take off that flimsy metal piece covering the top of the piston.  Take care
to note its orientation, with the two little tabs projecting through the
slot on the caliper's outer edge.

<p>
Put the big C-clamp onto the piston, and drive the piston back down into
the caliper until it's just below the top edge of its rubber boot.

<p>
Reinstall the flimsy metal piece.

<p>
Now you can fit in the new pads.  Careful not to break the clips.  When
they're in all the way, there should be enough clearance to put the caliper
assembly back onto the rotor.  If there's not, you didn't jam the piston
down far enough with the clamp.

<p>
When reinstalling the caliper assembly, make sure you don't have any kinks
in the brake line.  Replace the bolts (crank 'em on good), put the wheel
back and you're done!

<p>
<STRONG>REAR BRAKES</STRONG>

<p>
Remove the wheel as before.  First thing to do here is disconnect the
emergency brake cable.  Compress and remove that coil spring.  Pull the
clip off where the cable attaches to the caliper, being careful to note how
it goes on.  Pull that ball end of the cable out of its place by grabbing
it with pliers and prying it out.  Then (careful of the rubber boot), pull
the cable out through the hole on the caliper.  All set.

<p>
Unbolt the caliper using the 8mm hex drive and take it off the rotor.  Take
out the old pads as before.

<p>
File or hacksaw the cube until you have a side that mates securely with the
cutouts in the top of the piston.  I used a side that had four tabs, then
sawed two of them off.  Fortunately, it's cheesy, soft metal.

<p>
Here's the tricky part.  Open the C-clamp all the way and clamp the cube to
the end of the piston, with the rotating foot of the clamp against the
cube.  Tighten it as much as you can.

<p>
Stick a screwdriver into the hole in the side of the cube, and ROTATE the
piston clockwise no more than 1/8 of a turn.  Then tighten the clamp as
much as you can again.  Repeat this procedure until the piston will not
rotate any more, or until the top of the piston is a bit below the top of
its rubber boot.

<p>
Put the new pads in, stick the caliper back on, bolt it in.

<p>
Reconnect the emergency brake cable.  Be careful of the rubber boot when
jamming it back through the hole on the caliper.  Then make sure both ends
of the boot are securely snapped in place.  Put the ball back in, replace
the coil spring, and snap that clip back on, taking care to clip the top of
it just below the rubber boot and not over it.

<p>
Put the wheel back on, and put the car back on the ground.  You're done!!!

<p>
<STRONG>ALMOST....</STRONG>

<p>
Clean the grime off your butt and get in.  The brake pedal will go all the
way to the floor a few times.  Start the car, pump it once or twice more,
then take some little "baby steps."  By now the brakes should be pretty
much adjusted.  A little bit of light contact between the pads and the
rotor is normal at this stage.

<p>
You're all set, and you saved a hundred bucks!  Go drive your wheels off.

<H1>Tech Tip - Adjusting the Hand Brake</H1>
<H2>By Andrew Gajewski</H2>

me. Please check the manuals for detailed instructions. Copyright &copy

Most of us use the hand brake while our cars are parked. Some of us, up 
here in the great white north, use the hand brake to have some fun in the 
snow. Lock up the rear wheels in a turn, the back end goes out, and you 
are either having a ball driving sideways (looking through you side 
window) or praying that you will not hit that curb on the other side. No 
matter what you use the hand brake for, the cables will strech over time and 
you will notice that pulling the hand brake lever may have no effect 
until a certain point. Well, you can restore your hand brake to showroom 
condition by simply tightening the hand brake cables. Here is what you 
need and how you do it.
</p>
Need: 	A philips screw driver with short and long handle and 2 adjustable 
wrenches.</p>
<ol>
<li> Park the car on a flat surface in 1st gear and/or place wheel stoppers 
to prevent the car from rolling (logs, bricks)

<li> Take off the plastic hand brake handle by pusing on a little button 
under the handle and pulling off the metal lever.

<li> take out the rear ashtray

<li> lift up the rear seat dividor (where the first aid kit goes)

<li> Undo the 4 screws that hold it in place

<li> Undo the screw pointing towards the front of the car in the space where 
the ashtray used to be. Might have to squat your head to find the screw.

<li> Undo the screw under the metal hand brake lever (don't drop the screw)

<li> Unscrew (with fingers) the 4 plastic caps (2 on each side) at the 
bottom of the middle console (They are located where the plastic console 
meets the carpet by the seats)

<li> Lift up and forward the plastic cover over the hand brake lever. You 
should now see 2 cables attached to a plate. The plate is attached to the 
hand brake lever.

<li> Lower the hand brake lever all the way and tighten the screws on the 
cables, making sure that the plate is relatively striaght, until the play 
in the lever is gone.

<li> Reassamble the platic trim, ashtray, rear seat dividor and handle. 
</ol>

<H1>How to fix non closing window (alternative to a new assembly - $500)</H1>
 From:	Z_SLOTFC@TITAN.SFASU.EDU<BR>


<p>
        Many Corrados have a problem with the passenger side window not closing
all the way. This is because a plastic tab that keeps the cable in place breaks
off. It tends to only happen on the passenger side because the tab is facing
the other way on the drivers side. VW says there is no way to fix it, and since
it is all one piece( motor, cable , tab, etc) it costs $500. There is a way
to fix it however.<BR>
        First the inside of the door needs to be removed. There are 3 screws
covered by plastic tabs on the sides and a screw behind the speaker grill.
There are 2 more scres in the door handle(this can be removed by simply pulling
it apart) There are also some tabs at the bottom which need to be undone.
        With the inside of the door gone, there are two plastic moldings(these
are located where the glass goes into the door) which need to be removed. They
simply slide of the metal rail of the door.
        The reason the window won't close all the way is because with the tab
broken the cable gets pulled down instead of the window going up all the way.
The way to fix it is to find a way to keep the cable from being pulled down.
There are probably other ways to do it, but this is what I did.
        I made a double sided hook(hook on both ends) out of a piece of metal
wire about twice as thick as a coat hanger. It needs to be strong enough so thatpliers are required to bend it. It needs to be about an inch long or so, but
you will have to play with it a couple of times to get the right length.
        What you do is hook one end around the cable, and the other end around
the metal rail the moldings sit/rests on. This needs to be as tight as possible
, or the cable will still get pulled down some. It will probably take a few
times before you get the right length, but it does work, trust me.
        Test it out by closing the window a few times before you put everything
back together.<BR>
        Some cars might need more than one hook.
        Next, to get the moldings to fit on with the hook there, you need to cutor burn a small slit into the lower molding. Don't worry, this is the lower of
the two moldings and is completely covered up, so you can't see it. Then put
the top molding on and put the inside of the door back on and you're done.

<p>
        If anybody has any question feel free to E-mail me at

<p>
        And Jan or whoever knows how wants to put it in the faq, go right ahead.

<H1>Installation Notes of K&N Filter, Exhaust and Stage I Chip</H1>
From:	stevek@execpc.com (Steven M. Kosloske)<p>


<p>
Did the mods on my `90 G60 today.  I bought a Stage 1 Chip from AutoTech for
$275, and the K&amp;N filter for $42, $10 for shipping.  Also got a Euro-Sport
exhaust system from EuroSport Accessories for $195+$20 shippiing.

<p>
Did the filter first.  I would suggest taking the whole air box out if you
want to do this, the clips are impossible to get off with the airbox in
the car.  Remove the air intake from the G-Charger (mine had a little oil in
it) and the 2 vacuum lines from the back.  There is a rubber band on the
inside and back of the box to hold it down.  Pop those off and it slides
out.  Saw the "Made in Mexico" stamp on the metal under the box.  Pop the 4
clips and put in the new filter.  Close the clips, drop it in, put the 2
bands back on, and reconnect the 2 lines and air intake.  Done.  Took about
half hour because I tried to get just the clips off, and also washed out the
airbox.  If I did it again, I could do it in 15 minutes easy.

<p>
Next was the exhaust.  Started by putting the car up on ramps and took off
the clamp at the back of the cat. and bewteen the 2 mufflers.  Tried to pry
off the hangers, but it's too difficult, the the new system included all the
hardware, so I just cut the old ones off.  Had to cut the pipe in back of
the suitcase muffler and pulled the rear off.  The rear muffler was in
pretty  good shape, and the exhaust pipes are really thick steel.  Next I
cut the front hangers off and dropped the pipe and suitcase muffler.  The
muffler had a lot of ruse and few holes, which is why I did this in the
first place, it was getting annoying.  The OEM exhaust system is really
heavy, I probably dropped 50 pounds with the new one.  The Euro-Sport system
has, in order from the front after the cat., a glass pack resonator,
crossover pipe, turbo rear muffler and tail pipe.  All clamps and hangers
are included.  The instructions are pretty poor, and I found that the best
way to put it together is to put the pieces on from front to back, pounding
them on one by<BR>
one, then putting the clamps on after it's all together.  I cut about 4" off
the tail pipe since it stuck out further than the bumper, and it was all
installed correctly.  Not sure if it was supposed to be like that, or if I
got the wrong tail pipe, but it looks cool cut short.  Sticks out about as
far as OEM, but it's silver.  The entire system is 14g steel, pretty big
pipes compared to the OEM system, and "aluminized".  It's a pretty good
system for $200.  Especially considering the OEM system is $1000.
As for sound, it's definately louder than stock.  It has that glass-pack
muffler rumble at idle, and has a louder tone as you accellerate, but only
at the beginning, as you get up to about 25 MPH and let off on the gas, it's
about the same, maybe a little louder than stock.  With the windows rolled
up, no radio on, you can only hear it at idle and when you first pump it.
Overall I'm pretty happy with it so far.  It took about 2.5 hours to do the
whole thing.  A lot of the time was getting the new pipes to fit, they're
really tight.

<p>
Last I did the chip.  What a job.  Took me about 60-75 minutes, I didn't
time it.  The instructions are pretty poor, they should include some simple
pictures.  First you pry up the cover over the "brain" and remove the cover
over the air intake.  It took me about 10 minutes extra to clean it out.
There was about a whole tree worth of leaves stuck in there.  I'm going to
start cleaning this out regularly now.  After pulling out the intake cover,
you remove one nut for the box frame, pull one vacuum line and snap off the
main electrical cable.  (anyone know what the vacuum line is for?)  After
this, patience is neccessary, since you have to slide the box and it's metal
frame to the outside of the engine compartment then pull it out.  It's a
trick taking it out.<BR>
Next you take out 2 screws to get the box off, then 7 screws to open the
box.   Next comes the what I thought was the hardest part, getting the
stupid plastic clips off the IC board.  Take out 5 screws to get the RF
shield off<BR>
the chip, pull the chip, put in the new one and put it all back together.
Again it's tricky shoving it back in the car.  Once it's in, it's pretty
easy to reconnect it all and finish.  Luckily it started back up so it seems
everything works.

<p>
I love the difference in the ride.  I haven't done the after measurements
yet, but the car seems to have the pull at 2500RPM that it used to have at
3500, which is a big difference.  Maybe I think I feel it since I'm pretty
excited about the whole thing, but it's definately better.  I'll get the
"after" times done in the next couple days and post them.

<p>
Start to finish the whole job took 4 hours.  I wasn't rushing and took a few
breaks.  If you have all the right tools and manuals you could do it all in
3 hours easy.

<p>
Now the car is lighter (only by about 50 pounds), faster and louder.  Next
step is new springs and shocks, but I'll wait till the stock ones are bad.

<A NAME="1"><H2>Activating US Corrado Rear Fog Lights</H2></A>
<PRE>
                        By Jan Vandenbrande
                               DRAFT
                               Copyright (C) 1995
</PRE>

<p>
The European version of the Corrados have the same type of bright rear
fog lights you occasionally see the newer Volvos and M-B
blinding people behind them with.<BR>
This rear fog light or lights are to be used under adverse weather
conditions such as fog, heavy snow or rain, and provides a significant
protection against rear end crashes.

<p>
Most US versions of the Corrados (G60 &amp; SLC) share the same
tail light assemblies and fog light switches with their European
counterparts.<BR>
The only problem is that they are not hooked up.
This procedure explains how to upgrade your car:

<p>
Is your car eligible?

<A NAME="2"><H4>Check list:</H4></A>
<OL>
  <LI> Does your fog light switch have 2 "ON" position, the second
   one seemingly not doing anything? If yes, good. If not, you can buy the buy
   the right switch, but you'll have to do some more rewiring that I
   will not cover here.

  <LI> The rear fog lights are in the same assembly as the rear marker
   lights (the ones that come on when you have the lights on) mounted
   on the hatch (NOT on the body with the brake lights).
   Do you see a second reflector w/o bulb next to the tail light
   marker lights. It also has a red lens.

  <LI> Good so far? Now open up the black panel that covers the hatch
   lights and wing control. The panel is held by "bayonet" screws
   that require a 1/4-1/2 turn with a Phillips #2 screw driver
   to loosen. Carefully pull the plastic cover away. It's rather
   delicate.<BR>
   Look at the light socket assembly for the tail light markers after
   you remove one (push in the snaps and pull). It should
   have one empty slot where the rear fog light should go. The
   rear fog light lens is covered with a serated round blank.
   It looks a bit like a "*".

</OL>
<p>
If you find all of these, you can upgrade you car.

<p>
This procedure is technically not difficult, but requires some
patience, taking apart several interior panels, seats and carpet.
Unless you are very dedicated, I'd combine this procedure with
another upgrade opportunity.

<p>
I did my first upgrade in my 90 G60 when I installed my alarm system and
Dynamat sound deadening material: if you take half the car appart, you
may as well do everything at once.  Next I also upgraded our 92 SLC.
In the above cars, both had the necessary equipment on both ends
(switch and tail light assemblies) but did not have the wires
to go in between them. Bummer!


<A NAME="3"><H2>TOOLS:</H2></A>
Wire crimping tool<BR>
Several female spade connectors (std size)
10 meters 14 or 16 guage multi strand wire (I went with the thicker wire)

A bag of small (black) tie wraps<BR>
Soldering Iron (optional) or a Scotch Lock
Stanley knife<BR>
Regular tools (screwdrivers, nut-socket set)


<A NAME="4"><H2>PROCEDURE</H2></A>

<OL>
  <LI> Take the rear platic cover of the rear deck (1/4 turn on the screws)
  <LI> Punch or cut the "*" blanks from the rear fog light reflectors
   (I did both sides, though some prefere to have only the left
   light installed like in Europe).<BR>
  <LI> Install wire from right to left light fog light after you figure out
   which of the connectors of the tail light assembly to use.
  <LI> Pull wire from the left upper rubber accordion thingy on top of the hatch
   through the left side of the hatch.<BR>
   I just used a stiff 14 awg wire to push it through.
   It takes a lot of patience, greasing it up a bit, etc, but eventually
   it will come through. If you have an electrician wire puller, that may help.
   You may be luckier from starting at the bottom, but I always
   succeeded starting from the top.<BR>
   Once the wire is through, hook it up to the rear fog lights, install
   the lights and test to see whether it works (you do not want to
   find out you have a brake in the cable once you are done).
   The lamps are just standard single filament 20 Watt bayonet mount
   lamps used for back up lights.<BR>
   It's the special reflector that makes the seem so bright.
   You can also buy special halogen lamps if you want to have an
   even brighter effect.<BR>
   Congratulations, the first trickiest part is over.
  <LI> Detatch the left speaker carier, all platic molding and covers from the
   rear side of the car. Just makes sure you find all screws, and things
   should just come off. Some of the molding needs to be carefully
   pulled of because it's snapped on. Go slowly step by step, and
   it's ok to use a blunt instrument to help things to unsnap.
  <LI> Carefully pull on the plastic strip that holds the rear of the
   headliner, and pass the wire sticking out from the accordion through
   the hole and follow the stock wiring harness.
   Note: Use plenty of tie wraps to keep the wire from ratteling.
   You do not have to loosen the rear headliner much because you'll
   have just enough space to get to wire. Also make sure you have
   plenty of wire at this point because you'll be doing a bunch of
   loop-de-loops before you are up front. 10 meters may seem much,
   but you'll be surprised how much you really use.
  <LI> Follow the existing wiring harness as much as you can with your cable
   to the front of the car. The wire will go from the roof down to the
   left hand side of the car towards the rear trunk light, then possibly
   disappear behind some sheet metal panelling, then reappearing, before
   following the lower edge of the trunk.
   In the trunk, leave an extra loop or two of wire in case you ever goof up.
   The wire will continue past the rear left seat. The rear seat
   can be removed by pushing the front of the seat in and then pulling up.
   The wire will then follow the left bottom edge of the car, past the
   front seat towards the fuse box.<BR>
  <LI> Remove the plastic cover above the driver's foot well, next to
   the fuze box and also the panelling that's below the hood release.
   Pull the wire all the way to the fuse box, securing it every
   couple of feet with tie wraps.<BR>
  <LI> Now that you are at the fuse box, consult Bentley on what wire you
   need to attach yours to. &lt;I'll look this up soon, but double
   check with your car in case they changed anything&gt;
   The wire you need goes into the fuze box somewhere
   (Connector K, Wire 10 if I remember correctly (?)).
   Once you find it, just strip a bit of insulation with a sharp knife
   from that wire and soldered your new wire to it and insulate with tape.
   You could use a Scotch Lock, but I have not had much luck with them.
   You could also figure out in what location to insert the wire
   in the fuse box (there is indeed an official orifice for it),
   but you'll be happy if you just find the damn wire you need.
   Naturally, you need to test whether the wire you find is the right one
   before soldering. I usually just stick a pin in the wire and
   test it with a VOM by toggeling the switch.

</OL>
<p>
It's not as bad as it sounds, the worst parts are the fishing expedition
and finding your way through the rats nest of wires in the fuze box.
Expect two hours or more of work.

<p>
One of the optional enhancements is to hook the rear fog lights through
a diode to the brake lights. Having been rear ended 3 times in the
last couple of years, it is something I am considering.
The diode is needed so that your brake lights won't come on when
you have your rear fog lights on (so you need to orient the
diode's arrow in the right direction in the wiring).
However, I have not tested this yet, and if you are interested
check to see whether your front fog lights won't come on if you
use your brakes.

I've already wired both my fog lights and the brake lights.
  On the 93 VR6s, the place where the wire goes is P 6 in the fuse box.. It's
a grey and blue (if I'm not mistaken) wire.  Just strip some insulating and
attach the wire going to the rear fog lights.
  Well, here's how I did my brake lights along with my fog lights.

  WIRING FOR REAR BRAKE LIGHTS (Assuming you already did Jan's procedures for
the fog lights):

<OL>
  <LI> Have the wires already wired to the rear fog light housing.
  <LI> Get 2 diodes with the highest value you can find. (I got 3Amp/10000Volts)
        The way the diodes work is the stripe closest to the edge of the
diode is the way the arrow points; like this:

</PRE>

<p>
  The arrow shows the direction of the current flow (from left to right).
 The current can't go from right to left, unless the value of the diode is
loo low.

<p>
3)  Have the wire go next to the brake light housing in the trunk and nclip
the bulb plate of teh brake housing<BR>
4)  There are 5 wires going into 4 connections.  The brown is he ground.  The
one on the other side of the ground is for the signal.  The single red wire
is for when you turn on your lights, which makes the bulb glow.  The one with
the 2 wires going into the same connection is for the brake lights.
      Find the 2 wires and spread some of the insulating to expose the bare
wire, but DO NOT cut the wires because they are so short and hard to put back
together.<BR>
5)  Connect some of your wire to both wires and seal them good.
6)  Connect (soldering is best) the other end of the wire to one of the
diodes.  From teh diagram, the wire should be attached on to left lead of the
diode.  The current should go from teh brake lights into the diode and out
the other way.<BR>
7)  Connect the other side of the diode to the wire coming from the fog light
housings.<BR>
<STRONG>(ALWAYS ATTACH WIRES WITH ALGATOR CLIPS AND TEST BEFORE</STRONG>
SOLDERING.  It will be much easier)<BR>
8)  WIth the other diode, connect the right lead (according to the diagram)
to the right lead of the other diode.  In other words, you will have the both
right leads of each diode attached to the wire leading to the fog light
housing.<BR>
9)  On the second diode, connect the wire coming from the fuse box to the
left lead.

<H1> Fog Lights to Brake Light Conversion</H1>
<h3> By Andrew Gajewski (Copyright &copy Andrw Gajewski)</H3>

In the corrados, the rear fog lights are not activated for the North 
American markets. You can do several conversions with them. One is to 
just piggy back to the 3rd center brake light and add another set of 
brake lights to your car (described here). Another option is to actually
make the rear fog lights work (easy in the US versions) or do both the 
brakes and fog lights (these procedures are described in a different 
documnet).
<p>
You will need about 2-3 meters of wire, 2 female connectors (the type 
that is flat) and one of those splicer connectors (joins a new wire to an 
existing one). And of course, you will need 2 light bulbs (same as for 
the back-up light).<p> 
<ol>
<li>Open the hatch
<li>undo the panel on the rear hatch by turning the tabs 1/4 turn with 
the screwdriver.
<li>remove the rear of the light by pressing the two tabs on the side.
<LI>punch out the starred covers to the fog lights.
<LI>put in the new bulbs in the bulb holder.
<LI>re-attach the bulb holder to the light  (snaps back to place).
<LI>at one end of the wire, connect the female connector (this will be 
the left light).
<LI>now, place it near the light and measure out the distance from one 
light to the next (keep in mind that you will feed it through the wire 
holders in the hatch).
<LI>bend the wire 180deg, and splice off the insulation (don't cut the wire)
<LI>attach the second female connector.
<LI>measure the distance to the center brake light.
<LI> unattach the connector to the center brake light
<LI>cut the wire and attach to the red and black wire using the splicer, 
then wrap some electrical tape around it.
<LI>re-attach the connector to the center brake light.
<LI>Connect the rest of the wires to the lights according to the diagram 
below. <IMG SRC="../../pics/garage/lights.gif">
<LI>re-install the hatch cover.
<LI>test the lights.

<H1>Increasing the Dome Light Delay</H1>
<H3>By Christopher Hapeman (cjh@garage.att.com) Copyright &copy CCA</H3>

</CENTER>

Procedure for increasing the delay of the dome light. after shutting
the door(s), in my '90 corrado the stock delay is 5 secs.  Total work
time: approx. 30 mintues.<p>
<ol>
<LI> pry out the dome/map light module 

<LI> it will now be hanging by 5 wires which are joined to a connector
<LI> remove the connector from the dome/map light module by pushing in
  the connector clip and pulling it off.  now the dome/map module can
  be removed from the car.

<LI> lay the module with the lens side down...pry off the protective sheet,
  it is only held on with tabs and slots.

<LI> now you are looking at the circuit with the component side down...
 Carefully remove the circuit board by releasing the three tabs, 
  at the same time you must pry off the bronze connectors which are 
  located on the bottom side of the circuit board...there are two sets,
  one for the dome light switch and the other for the map light switch
  They are interlocked U shaped connectors, you will prying metal from
  metal ... NOT metal from plastic

<LI> lay the circuit board with the component side up (bulbs facing up),
  the dome light switch's three bronze connectors will be on the upper
  left and the map light's two bronze connectors will be on the upper
  right...

</PRE>

<LI> identify the capacitor which is responsible for the dome light 
delay, it 
  is the far top right capacitor labeled C1 and is the only component on
  the board with + and - leads labeled.  my stock one was wrapped in blue 
  with 35V 22uF written on it. <p>
  When current is sent to the module (ie. a door is opened)  the dome bulb
  is lit and current is also sent to and stored in this capacitor...when 
  current is cut (ie. a door is closed) the stored current in this capacitor
  is released allowing the light to remain lit until the stored current is 
  exhausted...<p>

  Swapping in a capacitor of a larger value, greater uF (or MFD), allows for
  more current to be stored which allows the light to remain lit longer.

<LI> radio shack has capacitors for < $1US,  you are looking for an 
electrolytic 
  capacitor with radial leads, 35WVDC. i used one with 47MFD, thus doubling 
  the stock 22MFD...my dome light now stays lit for approximately 12 secs. 
  after the doors are shut.  you could get a capacitor with about 70MFD  
  making the delay about 20 seconds.  this triples the stock component, i 
  don't think you should go much higher than this since you might damage 
  other components on the board. 
</ol>

  NOTE: make sure you match the - and + leads of the new capacitor with the 
        - and + labels on the circuit board<p>

<A NAME="2"><H2>WASHING YOUR CAR:</H2></A>


<p>
What is the best product to use as a car wash?  The correct answer is use
what you like best.  There are some drawbacks to certain products and
advantages to others.  Dish detergent (Ivory Liquid, etc) may be used, but
rea<BR>
lize that this product is designed to remove animal or vegetable fat / grease
from fired ceramic dishes.  It looks at your Porsche's nice coat of wax with
the same hungry eyes.  If you enjoy washing and rewaxing weekly, then this is
for you.  Wax retailers love people who use dish detergent (they send the
Ivory Company Christmas cards every year)

<p>
If you prefer to have your wax last a little longer, you may consider using a
product that is specifically designed for automotive use.   The quality
products are based upon detergents instead of soaps.  Soaps are manufactured
from rendered animal byproducts (the stuff the dog food people reject).  They
contain trace elements that can actually damage your paint.  These trace
elements are the same goodies that leave a ring in your bath tub.  (Ring
around the Porsche)

<p>
Quality car wash/shampoos (same thing - most cars don't have hair) are
usually<BR>
 pH controlled, contain gloss enhancers and some even have a small amount of
water soluable wax for good measure.  Use only enough car wash to break the
electrostatic/ionic bond between dirt and your Porsche.  Start with a clean
large bucket (preferably plastic - if you kick the metal bucket, Mr. paint
chip rears his ugly head), add a small amount of the car wash and fill the
bucket with cool water.  Avoid hot water as it will soften the wax.  Read the
directions on the car wash bottle and try reducing the recommended amount by
half.  I use less than a half a cap full in 5 gallons.  The more car wash,
the more wax you remove. Try to avoid powder car washes, as the undissolved
granules can get on your sponge or towel and scratch the paint surface.

<p>
Make sure that your Porsche is in the shade and the paint surface is
relatively cool.  Rule of thumb # 1: If you can comfortably hold you hand on
the hood, you can wash/wax the car.

<p>
Spray the car with a gentle spray to thoroughly wet the surface.  Don't use a
200 P.S.I. fire hydrant spray, it isn't needed and may grind the surface
grime into the paint and cause scratches.  Some of the concour purists will
not use a nozzle on the hose at all.  Start at the top of the car and work
down.  Rewet the top, gently wash the top and then rinse.  Move onto another
section, such as trunk or hood.  Rewet this area, wash and rinse.  Continue
on down the car, completing a section at a time.  This way, the car wash does
not dry on the paint.

<p>
You may use a wash mitt, towel, or sponge to wash the car.  I prefer a wash
mitt as the grit tends to work up into the long fibers and not scratch the
paint,  When I redip the mitt into the wash bucket, I give it a swirl to
release the grit.  The flat surface of a sponge can sometimes catch dirt and
act like a sandpaper.  The purist will use two wash mitts.  One for the top
half of the car (the cleanest) and one for below the trim line and
wheels/wheel wells.

<p>
Your Porsche should be dried as soon as possible.  There are several methods
to accomplish this.  Lots of towels are a great drying medium.  They should
be 100% cotton (some of the blends contain polymer fibers that scratch).
 Start at the top, lay the towel on the top and then **gently** drag the
towel across the surface of the paint to pull the water from the surface.
Change to a dry towel and blot any remaining water.  Move to the hood or
trunk and repeat. Dry the sides last as the water will usually take care of
itself on these surfaces.  Another method is to use a chamois.  There are two
types, natural and synthetic.  The natural leather chamois contain acids,
primarily tannic, that strips wax.  Most synthetic chamois don't seem to do a
satisfactory job.  One exception is the P21S Super Absorbing Drying Towel.  I
have stopped using towels after trying this goodie.  I used to be a "dyed in
the wool" towel man.<BR>
Driving the car to dry it may be fun, but you are redepositing dirt on the
wet surface and allowing the resulting "mud" to dry on the paint.


<A NAME="3"><H2>CLEANING WHEELS</H2></A>


<p>
"The wheels show whitish dicoloration....and small streaks on the wheel".

<p>
This problem is not unusual and may be the result of several factors. The
most common cause is your friendly local car wash.  Many automated car washes
use an acid to clean the wheels and tires.  This acid cleaner will rapidly
remove dirt, but may also attack the clear coat on Porsche wheels.  The
result is a cloudy, whitish or dull appearance.

<p>
Many times, this may be cleared up by using a paint glaze such as 3M Hand
Glaze or Meguiar #09 or One Grand Omega Glaze to clean the affected paint.
 The OEM finish on many Porsche wheels is simply a silver paint with a clear
top coat.  This combination is not too different from the paint on the body.

<p>
Clean the wheel throughly with a quality wheel cleaner and dry completely.
Apply your choice of glaze to a soft cloth and rub out the clouding.  If this
does not do the trick, put a generous amount of 3M on your cloth and add a
small amount (about the size of your pinkie nail) of Blue Magic Metal Polish.
  Rub out the clouding with this combination.  The Blue Magic /3M combination
will usually get the job done.  If it has, follow up with a coat of quality
wax.  I use Sonax Spray Hard Wax on the wheels.  It doesn't chalk and
requires only light buffing.

<p>
Some painted/clear coated wheels will "yellow" under hard use applications.
 This is fairly common with track wheels that are subject to hard braking.
 The tremendous heat generated affects the clear coat and causes it to turn
yellow.  The 3M/Blue Magic trick will help to some degree, but not usually
restore them to original appearance.

<p>
If the finish has not improved at this point, you may consider using a more
abrassive cleaner such as Meguiar #02 Fine Cut Cleaner or Meguiar #01 Medium
Cut Cleaner.  Apply either one to a soft cloth and *GENTLY* rub into the
wheel. Use carefully as you may put hairline scratches if you rub too hard.
 When the desired finish has been achieved, follow up with 3M Hand Glaze to
"finish out" the surface and then wax.

<p>
A wheel that has resisted all of the above, may require repainting.  If the
existing paint is in good condition, other than discolored, slighly rough up
the paint with a 1200 grit sandpaper.  Wash thoroughly with a Prepsol type
product to remove all grease.  Spray the wheel with a quality primer such as
Wurth Rustop Primer and several *LIGHT* coats of Wurth Gloss Silver Wheel
Paint, allowing each coat to dry for two hours, prior to the next coat.
 Allow to dry for a few days, clean thoroughly and spray several *LIGHT*
coats of Wurth Gloss Clear Wheel Paint.  The Wurth products match the OEM
finish.  The Wurth Gloss Gold Wheel Paint matches the BBS gold finish.

<p>
If the surface of the wheel is pitted, or the paint has flaked off in
patches, all paint should be removed prior to repainting,  The easiest and in
my opinion, the only way,  is to have them blasted with a plastic media.
 Most blasting shops have the plastic media, but don't like to use it because
it is relatively slow (time=$).  Some people use glass bead.   Other blasting
media will dimple the wheels. Aluminum oxide leaves a distinct texture to the
surface.  Once all the old paint has been removed, clean the wheel with
Prepsol, prime and then paint.

<p>
One of the keys to maintaining your wheels is a coat of wax.  The wax acts as
a sacrificial protectant.  The damaging effects of red hot brake dust,  brake
dust acids, pollution and ozone are unleashed upon the wax and not your
wheel.

</OL>
<p>
Realize that paint chip repair is a learned skill and should be practiced on
an area of the car that is not that visible.  The hood and nose are two areas
that should be tackled last.  Test all cleaners or solvents on the paint
prior to usage.  I like to use the seam underneath the rocker panels.  Apply
a little cleaner or solvent to a cloth and rub the seam.  If you do not get
any color on the rag, then the cleaner/solvent should be safe for the paint.
If you do get color on the rag, then you may wish to consider another
solvent.


<A NAME="5"><H2>CHIP REPAIR STEPS:</H2></A>

<OL>
  <LI> Twentyfour hours before you want to start, use the rubber glue to attach
small 600 grit sandpaper circles (the diameter of the eraser) onto several
new pencils.  The eraser must be unused and flat on top.

  <LI> Step #1:Wash the car with a quality car wash and dry thoroughly.

  <LI> Paint chips come in two flavors.  The worst case has exposed the bare
metal, while the less severe has left the original primer intact.  Clean the
area throughly with the Wurth or P21S citrus cleaner.  If there is rust on
the exposed metal,  clean off with the pencil eraser.  Use a toothpick to
gently probe the area and make sure that the edges of the chip are secure and
not waiting to fall off and destroy your work.  Take a new pencil/sandpaper
tool, dip into clean water and put a few drops of water on the chip area.
 *SLIGHTLY* rough up the chip and a small portion of the surounding paint.
 Lightly turning the pencil will rough up an area the diameter of the eraser
and this should be more than enough.  Keep the roughed up area as small as
possible, the object is to give the new paint approximately 1 mm of old paint
to "grab" around the perimeter of the chip and not dig scratches.

  <LI> Move onto the next chip and repeat the above.  Depending upon the amount
of time available, you may wish to tackle 10-20 chips at one time.  Try to
stay within the area that may be covered by your box(es).

  <LI> When finished sanding all your chips you are tackling at this time apply a
small amount of Alcohol or Prepsol or Enamel Reducer to a rag and wipe each
chip and surrounding area to remove any sanding dust and grease/oils.  Use
additional solvent and new area of the rag for each chip.  Allow to dry
(these are highly volatile and will evaporate quickly with no residue).

  <LI> If the original primer is intact, and "pencil sanding" does not disturb
the primer, then skip the next step and go directly to painting (# 9)

  <LI> Make sure that the chip and surrounding area is clean.  If not,  reclean
with the Prepsol, Alcohol or Enamel Reducer.  Pour or spray a small amount of
primer into a clean plastic cup.  Dip the point of a wooden toothpick into
the primer to get a thin coating on the first 1-2 mm of the toothpick. If
there is a blob on the end, gently scrape it back into the bottle. Place the
tip of the toothpick against the center of the chip and allow capillary
action to literally flow a *THIN* coat of the primer into the depression of
the chip. Move onto the next prepared chip.  If you have finished priming all
your prepared chips before two hours are up, cover with a box, taped down
with masking tape and go have a beer.  The key is to allow the first coat of
primer to dry at least two hours.  Dispose of your cup and start with a fresh
cup and toothpick.  Apply another thin coat of primer to each repair that
needs primer.  Priming is completed when no metal is visible and the level of
the primer is *BELOW*  the level of the surrounding paint.  This is
important!  Cover and allow to dry for two hours or until dry.

  <LI> Take a new pencil sander and dip into water and add a few drops of water
to the repair area and gently sand the area to rough up the chip and a small
portion of the surounding paint.  Lightly turning the pencil will rough up an
area the diameter of the eraser and this should be more than enough.   Apply
a small amount of Alcohol or Prepsol or Enamel Reducer to a rag and wipe the
chip and surrounding area to remove any sanding dust and grease/oils.  Allow
to dry.  Repeat for all the chips that are on today's list of victims.

  <LI> If you are using a touchup, shake the bottle thoroughly.  If you are
using color matched paint, mix thoroughly and pour a small amount into a
clean plastic cup.

  <LI> Dip the point of a new toothpick into the paint to get a thin coating on
the first 1-2 mm of the toothpick. If there is a blob on the end, gently
scrape it back into the bottle. Place the tip of the toothpick against the
center of the chip and allow capillary action to literally flow the paint
into the depression of the chip.  Repeat for each chip.  The key is not to
use too much paint.  Do not redip the toothpick.  Use only the amount that
will flow from one dip.  Temptation to add more paint with each application
will be almost overwhelming.  Fight it!

  <LI> Cover with your paint box and allow to dry 2 hours and repeat 8-12 times
till the depression is filled with paint and bulges slightly upward and
covers the roughed up area with a thin coating of paint.   The first 2-3
coats may not completely hide the primer.  This is fine because you have many
more coats to go.  Fight that urge!

  <LI> The paint application is completed when the new paint bulges slightly
upward (a fraction of a millimeter) and had covered the roughed up area with
a thin coat of new paint.  Allow the paint to dry for at least a week.

  <LI> The touchup paint has been applied to the surface and allowed to dry for
at least 1 week, and resembles a minute mound ( __o__ ) (this is exaggerated)
on the flat plane of the existing paint. The object is to remove the mound
and make the surface of the paint one continuous flat plane. The Finesse
Block offers the ability to gently remove only the high spot of the repair.
Unlike sandpaper or polish on a rag, the five usable sides of the block are
flat and act like a "wood plane" to remove only the elevated areas of the
repair. The 2000 grit will not leave scratches.

  <LI> Soak the Finesse Block in clean water for 24 hours prior to use. Then
gently "plane" the high spot on the paint. I prefer to "plane" in one
direction (usually back to front - drawing the block towards me). If the
block dries out, re-wet and continue use. When the new and existing paints
are blended (smoothed to the flat plane) to your satisfaction, clean the area
with a quality car wash and then use a quality glaze to restore the high
gloss finish. I prefer 3M Imperial Hand Glaze. Don't use a machine on your
Porsche, as they deserve to be caressed by hand. Use the machine on your
Yugo.

  <LI> When applying either a glaze or a wax, apply to your soft cotton cloth or
applicator pad (don't squirt the stuff on the car) and work in one direction
only. Don't go around in circles like dear of dad . Circles are many times
the cause of "swirl marks." A front-to-back, back-to-front motion (the way
the air flows over the car) will help minimize swirl marks or at least make
them less visible. Buff out with a soft cotton cloth. If it looks good, wax
with a quality hard wax and you are done.

  <LI> Tip for applying wax. If you are using a quality carnuba based wax, try
applying it with your fingers instead of a pad or cloth. Hold your fingers
together and use your finger tips as an applicator pad. The tactile feedback
from your fingers will tell you when the wax has been worked into the paint.
If grit should lodge under your fingers, you will know immediately and not
grind it into the paint. A pad will not allow this tactile feedback and these
devil grits become sandpaper. A circular motion of the pad will make a 360
degree swirl mark. All marks on paint are most visible at a 90 degree viewing
angle. Thus the front to back marks are most visible from the sides, whereas
a circle stands out from any viewing angle.

</OL>
<p>
The question was also asked if clear touchup should be used as a final coat
to repair chips on a clear coat paint. There are two view points to this
question.

<OL>
  <LI> The purist will say yes, the paint has a clear coat and thus, the repair
should also. The process is the same as previously described, except the
clear coat is substituted for the last 2-3 coats or paint.

  <LI> The practical world says no. The touchup paint is different from the
original paint and is formulated only as a touchup paint. Once it is applied
it should, according to the manufacturer, match well enough to be all but
invisible. I have found this to be the case with the numerous repairs on the
many cars/colors, I have completed. If you are using the original paint as a
touchup (I have not done this with a clear coated car), then my understanding
is that you should use the clear as a topcoat. The color coat of some paints
will many times be relatively dull in appearance. These paints rely on the
clear coat to provide the "shine."

</OL>
<p>
Try one chip in an area that is not that visible. If the process works, then
continue with the rest. If not try the clear coat top layer.


<A NAME="6"><H2>WAXING YOUR CAR</H2></A>


<p>
One of the keys to applying carnauba waxes is to apply it sparingly.
 Assuming that the finish has just been washed and dried and is free of grit
and does not need glazing,  then apply the wax with a small piece of 100%
cotton terry cloth or a terry cloth covered sponge applicator pad.  An even
better method of application is to use your fingers.  Hold your fingers
together to form an "applicator".  Rub the wax thoroughly into the surface.
 Your fingers will give you the tactile feedback to let you know when the wax
has been worked into the surface.  This is NOT a situation where a little is
good, so a lot must be better.  Your paint will only accept X amount of wax.
 If you apply 100 times X then you will have to remove 99X in the form of drie
d powder.  It will make waxing more difficult, require more buffing and
create clouds of white dust.

<p>
Make sure the paint surface is cool.  Rule of thumb, if you can hold your
hand comfortably on the paint, then it is cool enough to wax.  Work in the
shade, preferably in a garage.  To apply the wax, choose an area about 12" x
12".  Open your can of wax, get a small amount on your fingers (or cloth/pad)
and recover the can (this keeps dirt out of the can).  Apply to the paint
surface, rubbing in a linear motion.  Work into the paint in a front-to-back,
back-to-front motion (the way the air flows over the car).  Don't go around
in circles the way dear old dad taught you.  If you are using a pad and
airborne grit gets under the pad, you have made sandpaper. If you are working
in a circle, you have made a 360 degree scratch (or swirl mark).  Since a
scratch or swirl mark is most visible from a 90 degree viewing angle, a
circular scratch is visible anywhere.  If you work in a linear motion, and scr
atch the surface, the line scratch is only visible from a small viewing
angle.  Using only your fingers to apply wax will give you the tactile
feedback to know when surface grit is about to scratch your paint.

<p>
Work the small amount of wax into the surface until all that remains is
slight haze.  Use of your fingers will also tell you when the wax has been
thoroughly worked into the paint and will help prevent you from using too
much wax.  Most waxes work best when this slight haze is allowed to dry.
 There are some waxes that require you to buff immediately after applying.
 Zymol is a classic example of this type of wax.  If you allow Zymol to dry
before buffing, you will need a belt sander to remove it.   Read the
directions on the can to determine the proper method.  Buff out the slight
haze with a soft 100% cotton towel.  Buff this small section, shake out the
towel to remove any grit and rebuff with a new section of towel.  Keep using
new sections of towel and change towels frequently.   I use my wife's old
flannel sheets.  They are super soft and produce a brilliant shine.  Move
onto another 12" x 12" section of the car.  Repeat the application and
buffing procedures.  When the car had been completed, return to the first
section completed and rebuff with<BR>
another clean towel, continue to rebuff the entire car.  The wax has had time
to harden off and this extra buffing will bring out a deep shine.  If there
are areas that are hazy or cloudy, and you are using a carnuaba based wax,
the wax has become hydroscopic and has absorbed a little water.  Mist the
cloudy areas with a small amount of water (a plant mister works well) and
rebuff.  This should remove the clouding.

<p>
If you are using a polymer based wax on a German paint and have hazy or
clouding of the wax, about the only thing that will work is to strip  the
polymer wax and rewax with a carnauba based wax.  German paints hate polymer
based waxes.  I have spoken to paint chemists, the Glazurit people, Porsche,
BMW and M/B people and to date have not gotten a viable reason for this.  I
have gotten a lot of mumbling and shuffling of feet, but no hard and fast
answers.  The Amercian and Japanese paints LOVE polymer waxes.  The German
paints just don't react well with most of these products.

<p>
Another trick to buff out any cloudy areas is to mist the area with Meguiar
#34 Final Inspection and buff out.  This will usually remove all traces of
trapped water.

<p>
All towels you use on your Porsche should be 100% cotton and should be washed
in the washing machine using only detergent.  Do not add any fabric softner
to the water.  Dry them in the dryer and DO NOT use a dryer anti-static towel
(I think that's what they are called). These dryer towels contain coatings
that are transferred to your car towels and may cause streaks.  If you have
ever had your wax streak and you could not figure out why, your dryer towel
was probably the culprit.  You will remove a giant ball of towel and static
electricity from your dryer, but will not have mysterious streaks.

<p>
Some people use a power buffer on their paint.  I personally think that your
Porsche deserves to be caressed by hand.  Save the machine for your SO or
Yugo.   Use of a machine is a learned art and not a science.  It is very easy
to "burn" an edge or create swirl marks.  There is nothing that a person with
the proper chemicals and elbow grease can not do better than a machine.  The
only advantage of a machine is speed and the risks in my humble opinion far
outweigh any time advantage.

<p>
If anyone has any further questions on types of waxes, glazes, polishes or
application, please feel free to contact me.

 Old enough to remember when sex was safe and race cars were     dangerous

<p>
From: CarcareSp@aol.com<BR>
Subject: Re: Concour and Detailing Not...

<p>
I do not recommend a silicone based product for any part of a German car.
 Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against silicone.  It is cheap, and most
of the products based upon it are designed for the K-Mart crowd and their
Chevy Novas.  A German automobile has different vinyl than either an American
or Japanese car.  The vinyl is more prone to "polymer off gassing" than
either American or Japanese cars.  You appear to have only received the tire
part of the posting.  I have included the complete posting for you.

<p>
The problems associated  with silicone based products may be broken down into
the two catagories of usage,  tires and vinyl:

<OL>
  <LI> Tires/Rubber Trim:  There are two main degrading agents that attack tires.
 They are UV light waves and ozone.  Both of these attack the long
hydrocarbon chains of the rubber and by breaking these chemical bonds,
shorten the molecules with resulting loss of elasticity and other problems.
 Tire manufacturers add two primary sacrificial protectants to the rubber.
 To protect against UV, they add carbon black.  This is why tires don't come
in designer colors to match your paint. The carbon black will turn white/gray
as it absorbs the UV and dissipates the energy as heat. Thus the basis of
rubber parts turning gray as they age.  To protect against ozone, tire
manufacturers add a wax based sacrificial protectant.  The ozone
attacks the wax and depletes it.  As the tire rolls, additional wax is forced
to the surface of the tire.  This is referred to as "blooming".  This
blooming refreshes the surface wax protectant.  A tire that has not been
flexed will have the wax depleted by the ozone and thus begin to degrade and
suffer  "dry rot". The silicone oil in Armour All et Al may actually dissolve
the wax and be the cause of premature tire side wall cracking/failure.  It is
rumored that some tire manufacturers will not honor warranties on failures
caused by silicone based products.  I am in the process of checking with the
major tire manufacturers to determine the validity of this rumor.   In
conclusion, any tire dressing should contain a UV protectant to bolster the
efforts of the carbon black and preferably not contain any silicone.

</OL>
<p>
Plastics/Vinyls:  The dash, door panels, seat backs, and numerous other
interior/exterior trim pieces are usually vinyl.  Vinyl may be viewed as raw
semi-liquid vinyls that are held in place by a solid vinyl "skin" (this
description is for illustration only and not a PhD chemical dissertation ).
 The dash and other vinyl parts of your P car are constantly bombarded by UV
that breaks down the molecules of the skin, allowing the raw vinyls to escape
(off-gassing).  These vinyls then may deposit themselves on the glass,
forming a haze that is difficult to remove.  If you have such a haze, it is
probably your dash that has decided to pick up stakes and migrate(back to
Germany?).  Silicone based products do not usually contain UV protectants,
and the silicone may act as a magnifying glass, intensifying the UV
degradation.  Silicone oil may also dissolve the essential oils in the vinyl
skin, hastening the premature formation of cracks in the vinyl skin.  A
quality vinyl protectant will contain a UV protectant and essential oils to
replace lost oils from the vinyl.  These protectants are expensive, so the
K-Mart specials may do more harm than good. Silicone also has very strong
electrostatic attraction which may be considered beneficial in that it will
tend to stay where it is placed, but will also attract every dust particle in
the surrounding three counties.

<p>
This list is my personal favorites.  I only carry the products that I think
are the best for a Porsche.  I am constantly testing new products and
retesting old ones to compare their performance.  We have a committee of 10+
people including national restoration and concours experts involved in these
testing programs.  Of these favorites, there are some that I personally like
better than others.  I have customers who will argue against my choices and
defend their choice with equal vigor.  When I am conducting work shops, I
take a tire or two and divide them into sections and use all of the following
products so people and see them side by side.  Each person likes a different
look, so each chooses a different product.


<A NAME="7"><H2>Tire/Rubber(spoilers, whaletails, etc.) Care:</H2></A>

<OL>
  <LI> My favorite is Black Again with a top coat of Meguiar #42.

  <LI> Black Again - is a white creamy polymer formulation the gives rubber a jet
black color and a soft patena.  My only problem with BA is that it doesn't
last as long a I think it should.  That is why I use the Meguiar #42 on top.
 This combo seems to really last.  BA will also remove the white wax residue
that you slopped on the rubber trim.

  <LI> Meguiar #42 - is thick emulsion specifically formulated for black trim
areas and tires.  Will maintain the black patena without greasy shine.  Does
not restore color quite as well a Black Again.

  <LI> Harly Tire Nu - many of the old time concour people use harlys.  They love
it.  It maintains rubber for long periods of time and does not turn brown.

  <LI> Meguiar #40 - This is supposed to be for rubber and vinyl - I feel that it
works a lot better on vinyl.

  <LI> Tony Nancy Vinyl/Rubber Care - This is a great product.  Tony Nancy is a
World class restorationist (Pebble Beach Class) and judge.  This is his own
brew.  Does a great job on rubber.  I only use it on the exterior as the
smell will kill you.

  <LI> One Grand Exterior Rubber - This is similar to the Harly product.  Lots of
people swear by it.

</OL>
<p>
8.Zymol Vinyl - Better for vinyl than rubber.  I think it is too much $, but
many people love it.  Be aware that Zymol has hooked up with Turtle Wax Co.
to produce a new line of K-Mart crowd products with the Zymol name.  I call
them Zurtle Waxes.  They are crap.  They come in black containers.  I think
it is Turtle Wax with pina colada mix thrown in.  I got pre-release samples
and tested them, hoping for a decent product at a reasonable price. Wrong!

<p>
9. Tire-Nu - This used to be a GREAT product.  The original formula was made
in Japan.  They now make it in California for the K-Mart crowd and it stinks.
They changed the formula to make it CHEAP.  I bought up every case in the
country when they discontinued importing it.  I now own 2 cans for my
personal use.

<p>
10. Formula 303 - A good product.  I don't carry it because I personally
don't like the "slick" finish.  I won't sell something I don't like (which is
stupid from a business point of view), but if I can't endorse something, I
won't sell it.

<p>
11.  Sonax or Wurth Rubber Care Spray - These are better suited for the
rubber gaskets around doors, windows, etc.  They rejeuvinate the rubber and
help maintain the seal.  Should be used twice a year.

<p>
12. Sonax PVC Maintenance Spray - A good product that is better for the hard
rubber of spoilers and whaletails.  Leaves a little more shine to the surface
than I care for, but many people swear by it.  Lasts a long time.


<A NAME="8"><H2>Interior Vinyl:</H2></A>

<OL>
  <LI> My personal favorite is Lexol Vinyex Spray.  This in my humble opinion
has it all.  A very strong UV protectant, essential oils, anti-static (helps
keep dust off) and a soft patena finish.

  <LI> Harly Polyguard - This used to be my favorite, till I lost my heart to
Vinylex.  Leaves a touch more shine to the finish than Vinylex.

  <LI> Somethin' Else - This is the sister to Black Again.  Has all the right
ingredients and people who love it are died in the wool.  I prefer the
Vinylex, but that only a subjective opinion.  It leaves a "new car" smell.

  <LI> Harly Interior Magic - An old standby that leaves a lemon scent.  Some
people love it.  I don't think a car should smell like lemons, but that's my
opinion and I could be wrong.

  <LI> Zymol Vinyl - Another tropical oil product.  Leaves a pina colada smell.
 Die hards will defend this product to the death.  I just think it is to Much
$. See warning in tire section.

  <LI> Meguiar #40 - A great product that cleans and protects.  Does not leave a
slippery finish.

  <LI> meguiar #39 - A very strong cleaner.  This should be used carefully and
very infrequently.  It will clean just about anything out of vinyl.  Must be
followed by #40.  A great cleaner for plastic Targa tops.

  <LI> Tony Nancy - I don't recommend use on the inside.  The smell is a bit much
for me.  Some people do and swear by it.

  <LI> Sonax Cockpit Spray - This is a German product that is designed for German
vinyl.  Does a great job, but leaves a little more shine to the surface than
I care for.  There are a gagle of users who love it.

  <LI> Wurth Cockpit Spray - ditto above. Wurth people don't like Sonax and vice
versa.

  <LI> Formula 303 - This leaves an Armour All type of high gloss shine to the
vinyl.  I personally don't like this type of finish.  Some people do, so feel
comfortable using it as it is a very good product.

I have no problem with your transmitting the notes to anyone you choose, so
long as you leave the name and company address/phone/fax/email tag on the

<p>
The Naval Jelly works very well on the larger areas.  I was trying to
concentrate on a small chip repair.  Another product that I have found that
works well is  Wurth Metal Prep Spray.  This does the same thing and is
paintable and provides a great base for the primer. My favorite primer is the
Wurth Rustop Primer.  It is easy to work with and will take any paint.  The
metal primers (Rustoleum/Wurth/KD/PPG, etc) are sometimes not compatible with
certain paints.  Sometimes they will bleed through and in one case,  I had
new paint lift off in sheets.

<p>
I don't mention a lot of products in my articles because I don't want to
sound like an infomercial.  I test all of the new products that come onto the
market.  In fact I have a group of 10+ people (some of whom are nationally
known experts) that are involved in the testing programs.  We all test the
products and then compare notes.  If we like something, it goes onto further
testing using 20+ people across the country.  All of this input determines if
I will or will not carry a product.  I want to make sure that each item is
the best for a particular application for a German car.  My personal favorite
everyday wax is One Grand Blitz.  If I am entered in a Concour, I will wax
the night before with Zymol Carbon and that morning will mist with water and
buff.  Then 1/2 before judging, I will mist with Meguiar #34 Final Inspection.
  The Mequiar (#16,#19 and #26) waxes are excellent waxes.  I just happen to
really like Blitz.

<p>
As to wheel cleaning, I solve problems everyday for people who have used the
acid based cleaners and had the paint damaged.  The German paints seem to
very sensitive to acid cleaners.  I conducted several tests on wheel cleaners
to determine the pH of all the major brands.  The only three that were close
to pH neutral were P21S, Sonax and Meguiar #36.  All the rest were either
acid or basic (some were so basic that they dissolve your skin).  The next clo
sest to neutral was Zymol Brite.  This was slightly basic.  I have seen
several BBS wheels that the Simple Green ate the clear coat off in quarter
size spots.  I can think of at least 6 sets with the same problem and all trac
ed back to Simple Green.  If you want a thrill check it's pH, it will
surprise you.

<p>
One other thing you have to remember when writing a "how to" article in
today's world, you have to recommend the safest approach.  Not necessarily
the fastest or sometimes the best, but the safest.  I don't want to buy some
yoyo's wheels because he/she left an acid based cleaner on them for 3 months
and found out that the paint had dissolved.  "You did not warn me not to do
that"  Look at lawn mowers with a sticker that says "stick your fingers into
the spinning blade and you will get chopped fingers."   It is cover your a**
to the Nth degree.

<p>
I have no problem answering any question you may have on a personal basis.  I
LOVE what I do for a living.  I was an engineer for many years.  (In fact
that was my foundation design that they tried to blow up when they bombed the
Trade Towers)  I decided to turn a life long hobby several years ago into a
full time business and have had it grow beyond my dreams.  I enjoy each day
dealing with great people and helping them solve their problems.  I love
getting up each morning to come to "hobby".  Work for me is the lawn.

<p>
If you are interested in other articles, let me know what I sent you and will
fill in the gaps.  My product description catalog goes into some detail on
each product.  If you are interested, I can send you a copy by snail mail.  I
also have a description of vinyl and rubber care products that I put together
in response to my silicone article.  I can E-mail you a copy of this if you
are interested.

<H1>Volkswagen Corrado G60 Grill Modification
The Drill Free Method<BR></H1>
<HR>
by John Leipsic<BR>
johnny5@netcom.com


<p>
In 1992, with the introduction of the VR6 engine, the
Volkswagen Corrado underwent several subtle, yet significant
styling modifications from the G60.  To accommodate the
larger engine, hood creases went from downward to
upward.  Interior controls assumed a softer look with more
rounded control stalks and switches.

<p>
The front grill was changed as well.  From seven horizontal
slats and central emblem, to four horizontal slats and a
slightly protuberant central emblem.  The updated grill
brought Corrado in line with other 92 VW front end grills
and has a more three dimensional look than the 90 grill.
Even the Passat, with a once smooth front end, got a grill
in 94/95.

<p>
The new grill for 92 onward VR6 Corrados is part number
535 853 653 A 01C.  It is made in Germany of high impact
plastic and can be special ordered through your local VW
dealer.  My dealer charged USD $80.82 for the grill.  I
also recommend ordering a new VW emblem to fit your new
grill.  The emblem is VW part number 1H0 853 600 DRR.
Mine was made in USA, and costs about $9.  The reason
to get a new emblem is that it comes with a gasket that
fits on the new grill.  Plus, a new emblem will look
all shiny and fresh for your new grill.

<p>
When your new grill arrives, the first thing you will notice
is that it's tabs do not fit into the spaces the old grill's came
out of.  No problem.  With the Leipsic Drill-Free Grill
Modification Method, you will have that new grill on in
no time.

<p>
The only tools you will need are: Krazy Glue, Tie-Wraps, and
a handy Swiss Army Knife.

<p>
The old grill has two clips on top which clip into long
holes on the metal grill upper cross member.  There are two
tabs on the bottom of the old grill which fit into two
holes in the bottom cross member.  The new grill has
three clips on top, and three larger tabs on the bottom.
The absolute length of the new grill is about 1cm longer
than the old grill, but it still fits right in between the
two light housings.

<p>
Now, if you want to get a power drill and cut new tabs into
your metal cross members to fit the new grill, that is
your choice.  The upper cross member would be an easier
cut, but the bottom one would be harder with it's more
contoured metal.  Besides, this writer has a constitutional
aversion to cutting on a car.  Be that as it may, no
cutting is necessary on your car with the Leipsic DrillFree 
Grill Method.

<p>
The old grill looks like this:

<p>
  ^             ^           &lt;-  clips<BR>
<HR>
<HR>
<HR>
  I	        I           &lt;-  tabs

<p>
The new grill looks like this:

<p>
 ^        ^        ^        &lt;-  clips<BR>
<HR>
<HR>
<HR>
 I        I        I        &lt;-  tabs


<p>
The first thing you do is slice off the three bottom tabs.
Use a file to cut down the outer length of the tab, then
a knife can remove the rest of the tab.  A little
bending and twisting will get it right off too.

<p>
Don't break up the tabs themselves, you will need
them.  Each tab has a rectangular base which serves
to elevate the grill a bit above the lower metal cross
member.  For the new grill placement, this base is
about two times too high.  So just cut it in half.
Here's a drawing attempt:<BR>
<HR>
<PRE>
      |  |      &lt;- tab
      |  |
     ------
    |      |    &lt;- base
    |      |    &lt;- cut off half this lower part to halve base
</PRE>

<p>
Then get some fantastic Krazy Glue, or any super plastic
bondo stuff should work.  This glue completely melts the
plastic beneath, and when it is applied to both sides, it
forms a new plastic bond between the pieces.  I rough up
the plastic by scoring it with a knife, to improve bonding.

<p>
With your new tabs with bases sliced in half, line up the
place on the new grill where the old grill has it's bottom
tabs.  This is easy to do.  Just put the grills side by side
and mark the place for the new tab placement on the new
grill.  The new tabs should be lined up with the rear margin
of the new grill.

<p>
Then scratch up the place for the new tabs, apply
plastic bond glue, put new tab on, hold until bond has
taken, and repeat for the second tab.  Easy.  Wait for
these to dry before installing grill.

<p>
Now, the three upper clips.  Slice them all off as well.  This
is much easier than the bottom tabs.  You don't need to
save the upper clips, we won't use them.

<p>
Again, line up the old grill with the new one and mark
the places where the old grill upper clips are on the
new grill.  These places are also directly above the
new lower tab placements.

<p>
Use the leather awl tool on your Swiss Army Knife to punch
a small hole in the upper grill plastic just before the
small inner ridge.  This hole can be small, but enlarge
it with the knife blade to make a 0.5 cm slat.  These are
the holes through which the tie-wraps will go.

<p>
Now, the glue is dry, and your upper slats are cut.
Take the VW emblem and snap it into place keeping the
black gasket on the emblem.  The old grills do not use
the black emblem gasket.  The new grill does use the
gasket, for good effect.  The G60 emblem can be unclasped
and glued into it's new place.

<p>
Now it is time to fit your new grill into place.  Gently
place the lower tabs into the lower cross member holes.
Then gently bow the grill until the upper edge meets the
upper grill cross member.  Take your tie-wraps, thread
them through the holes in the grill and then place
them through the holes in the cross members where the clips
used to be. Tighten the tie-wraps, trim, and you new grill
is in place!

<p>
If, perchance, the lower tabs were to give way while
driving or struck by an errant missile, the grill is
still attached by the tie-wraps on top.

<p>
Complement your new sporty, modern grill with a front grill
lip spoiler, and you're fully ready for action!

<H1> Installing a G60 Starter</H1>
<H3>By Mike Ferrand</H3>

The starter for my Corrado was rebuilt from the original starter housing,
so compatibility was not an issue.  The problem occurs when the starter
is removed from the vehicle.  The engine drops approximately 1/4 of an
inch due to the fact that the starter nuts are parts of the front engine
mount system and are attached to a hinge assembly.  To reinstall the
starter you must:
<p>
VW Corrado G60 manufactured between 1/90 and 6/90
<p>
1.  Set the starter in position without the bolts in place.
<br>
2.  Position a piston jack under the engine (not on the oil pan) near the
transmission and raise the engine until the nut hinge assembly aline with
the starboard bolt shaft holes (please forgive me if I'm not using the
proper nomenclature). Insert the bolts and secure the starter.
<br>
3.  Remove the piston jack and wire the starter.
<p>
As far as the wiring issues are concerned, after the starter install
problems was resolved, I couldn't remember if the black and red wire
attached to the horizontal prong or the vertical prong. It was the
horizontal prong.

<H1>Oxygen Sensor Replacement Procedure (using 3-Wire Universal) 
1990-1992</H2> 

By: Matt ???
<p>
<PRE>
1. Disconnect OXS sensor connector (located at passenger rear engine 
    mount).

2. Remove OXS connector bracket from passenger rear engine mount 
    (10mm).

3. Raise the car and support it securely on jackstands.

4. Unscrew OXS sensor from the top front of catalytic converter.  The 
    special OXS sensor wrench is a good investment.  A 22mm crowsfoot 
    extension would probably work too.  Otherwise the three bolts 
    which hold the cat to the downpipe will have to be removed so the 
    cat can be lowered enough to get a wrench on the sensor.

5. Remove sensor and harness from car.

6. Cut the sensor off of the wiring harness approx. 3" back from the 
    sensor.

7. Splice in the universal 3-wire sensor using the crimp connectors 
    and the heatshrink tubing supplied, or solder and heat shrink 
    the sensor into the harness.  (Refer to diagram for connections).

<IMG SRC="../../pics/garage/o2.gif">

8. Remove the plastic cap from the sensor.  Be careful you don't get 
    any anti-seize on the sensor probe (if you do, wipe it off very 
    carefully so none gets in the probe slots).

9. Screw the sensor back into the cat.  Torque to 37 ft lbs.

10. Fish the connector bracket from the cat to the engine mount and 
      reattach the bracket to the mount.

11. Secure the OXS harness wire with the clip on the subframe, so it
      doesn't lay on the hot exhaust.  I also wrapped this clip with 
      some electrical tape since my original harness was about to be 
      eaten by the sharp edges on this clip.

12. Reconnect OXS harness connector.

13. Smile, you just saved yourself ~$70 on parts alone.
</PRE>
<p>
BTW, I bought my Bosch Universal 3-wire OXS sensor from GPR for $69.  
GPR's number is 1-800-321-5432

<H1>VR6 Thermostat Replacement Procedure
</H1><h3>Greg Campbell, Seattle, USA, gregc@eskimo.com</H3>

This procedure was performed on my 1992 VR6 with 73,000 miles. 
<p>
In the Bently  manual there's a picture of the housing on page 19.17.  The
picture is pretty good at showing what's in the assembly.  But here's what
it doesn't tell you.
<p>
1) Location
It's located on the top right side of the engine, under the distributor cap.
Follow the radiator hoses right to it.
<p>
2) How to get to the lower part, where the thermostat is located
The 5mm hex bolts are too close to the transmission to remove.  You have to
take out the whole assembly, then remove the lower part to expose the 
thermostat
<p>
3) How many hoses, and other things have to come off before the housing.
I removed the 2 radiator hoses.  I removed the plastic cover on the top of
the radiator, & the fan's electric plug for better access.  I also removed
the plastic cover over the 3 sensor connections on the housing.  Tug & pull
it toward the battery.  I removed the cover for the coolant run-on (Bently
diagram item #7 pg 19.17)  located on the lower front of the housing.
<p>
4) How many & where are the bolts to remove the thermostat housing?
The Bently shows only 1, but there are three.  All 5mm hex drive. The first
is in the picture in the Bently (pg19.17)  The second is below the one
displayed in the manual.  The third is at the rear of the housing.  It sits
back, tucked in the a hole behind the housing.  It's pretty tough to get at.
The three bolts make a triangle of sorts.  I had to run to Sears & buy a 5mm
hex drive & a 6'' socket extension to get at it.
<p>
Over all, the disassembly process was fairly difficult.  The assembly
process went very smoothly.  Now that I've done all the "discovery", the job
would fairly easy to repeat.      
<p>
Things to buy before you start:
<ol>
<li> The thermostat 
<li> 5mm Hex Drive
<li> 6'' socket extension
<li> 1 Gallon of VW coolant.
<li> Rubber "O" rings.  The Bently says there are 2 to replace.  The one on
the thermostat was in really good shape.  The one between the housing and
the block was pretty bad off.  I cleaned it up, soaked it in oil, the put
some gasket goop in with it.  No leaks so far.
</ol>
<p>
I did get some WaterWetter but haven't put it in.  Winter is coming &
Washington stays pretty cool.  My temps are back to normal, Coolant=the
thick mark between 160 & 230, occasionally it goes up to 230 but never for
long.  Oil, ususally 212.  When driving hard, it can go up to 230, 240ish.

<H1>Corrado Heater Core Replacement Procedure</H1>
<H3>Prepared by: Greg Campbell, gregc@eskimo.com<br>
Contributions: Rodney Noriel, rbn@corp.cirrus.com</H3>


This procedure was performed on 1992 VR6 with 84,000 miles.  I am not a
professional mechanic, but perform most of the work on my cars.  
<p>
Most shops will quote this as an 8 hour job.  I choose to take a longer time
to fix some rattles with sticky back felt & foam packing.  I completed it in
approximately 16 hours spread over a period of a week.
<p>
To do this job, you have to remove the entire dash.  I highly recommend that
as you remove each part, put all of the screws in bag and attach them to the
part with some of 3M's blue masking tape (leaves no glue residue).  This
will make re-assembly much easier.  Also, many of the screws in the dash,
attach to a metal clip.  This clip is usually pressure fit over a metal tab.
On my car, many of these clips were fairly loose.  It's a good idea to pull
them off, squeeze gently with a pair pliers, then re-install.  Other wise
you may loose them as you are jostling the parts around.

<b>
Things you need:
</b><ol>
<li>Bentley Manual (not required, but highly recommended)
<li><25mm Socket (for the steering wheel)
<li>Heater Core (Aftermarket ~$65, dealer ~$170)
<li>Phillips head screw drivers.  (lots of different lengths are helpful)
<li>Metric sockets, assorted sizes & accessories (extensions, etc..)
</ol> <p>
Review diagrams in the Bentley manual<br>
Pages 70.7, 70.8, 80.2, 80.4, 90.19 Dash assembly<br>
Pages 80.6 & 80.7 Heater & A/C Air box assembly<br>
Pages 48.2 & 48.4 Steering Wheel & Steering Column<br>
<p>
<b>
REMOVE THE KNEE PADS</b>
<p>
Start by removing the two trim panels that cover the underside of the dash.
Then remove the two knee pads. There are two screws on the bottom of the
knee bar.  Remove them and tug and pull till the clips release.  Its on
pretty tight.  The knee bar has clips built into the frame that clip onto a
large metal sub-frame, so if it feels like its stuck keep pulling, it will
pop out.
<p>
<b>REMOVE THE STEERING WHEEL & COLUMN COVER</b><p>

The horn pops off to reveal the 25mm bolt holding the wheel on.  There are
three screws on the underside of the steering column.  Once removed the two
plastic pieces are held together by 4 to 6 plastic clips.  Take the bottom
half off first, to expose the bolt (faces downward) that holds the tilt
lever on.  Remove the bolt.  The turn signal & wiper control levers are held
on with three screws facing toward you.  The left lever came off easily.
The right lever was not so easy, so it stayed on.  However, this provided
plenty of clearance for the dash removal
<p>
<b>REMOVE THE DASH
</b><p>
Start with the instrument cluster trim piece (4 screws).  Remove the stereo,
heater controls, & miscellaneous trim pieces in the center panel insert.
Then remove the instrument center panel insert, that houses the stereo &
heater controls.  Followed by the dash vent on the left. Now you can remove
the instrument cluster.   I also removed the glove box.  This may not be
required.  However, it allows better access to the right side dash interior.
Remove the right side air vent. Remove the two nuts in the plenum panel,
under the windshield, in the engine compartment. These two nuts are under
the windshield (where the wiper and the ECU are one on each side).  I was
able to get a socket on them.  On the driver's side, I choose to remove the
wiper assembly for better access.  While I had the wiper assembly apart, I
put new grease on the wiper drive shafts.   Now remove the remaining 3
screws & 1 bolt holding the dash on. At this point I would highly recommend
that you take some time to study & map out on paper, the paths of the wiring
harness & all control cables.  By the time you get the dash off, all plugs,
wires & cables will be lying all over, making very difficult to re-install
the dash.  Before you pull the dash off, be sure to unplug the all of the
remaining electrical connectors & detach any wiring attached to the dash.
Remove the dash.  It should pull slightly up and back.  Be patient and take
your time.
<p>
With the dash fully removed, remove the large metal-sub frame that the knee
pads where attached to.  There are 4 bolts.  Also note, with the bolts
loose, the height of the sub-frame can be adjusted.  The adjustment affects
how close the knee pads are to the dash.  On my car I put it in the upper
most position, to reduce the gap between the knee pad and the dash. 
<p>

<b>REMOVE THE HEATER BOX
</b><p>
With the heater box and A/C exposed, go to the fire wall and look for the
inlets for the heater hoses.  Detach the hoses.  Look for the 2 bolts that
hold the main air/heater box to the firewall.  On mine, they where
approximately in the center of the firewall, vertically about 10" apart.
Remove these.  They may be in a different location on G60s.
<p>
Pull back, or push aside any wires or cables that will interfere with the
box pulling straight back.  On my car there was a small silver box on the
left side, that I removed to get better clearance.
<p>
Now separate the heater box from the A/C box.  The two boxes are attached
with 6 clips.  There is 1 on top, 1 on bottom, 2 on the front & 2 on the
back.  These pop off with a flat blade screw driver.  The 2 clips on the
back are very hard to get at.  I was only able to remove 1 of them.  The
other one broke when I removed the heater box.  On re-assembly, I was not
able to re-install either of the rear clips.  Currently, there are only 4 on
my car.  This seems to be working fine, so far.
<p>
With the heater box free, wiggle & gently tug it straight out & up a bit.
When you get it out, the heater core is held in by 2 clips on either side.
Also, my car had 2 screws holding it in.  The core will pull straight up.
Once out, take a look in the heater box.  If there is a puddle of
anti-freeze in the bottom, clean it out.  It's good idea to tilt the box
around a couple times, get all the anti-freeze out.  Anti-freeze doesn't
evaporate very easily, and will hang around for a long time.  Take some
time, & clean it up the best you can.   
<p>
Now re-assemble.  Take some extra time to install some sticky back felt
(available at most fabric stores) & foam in areas that could rattle.  Try to
route the wiring harness where it will go before you re-install the dash.
That will prevent having to remove the dash to move a section of the
harness.  Take your time & think about what you can buy with the $800 you
saved by doing it yourself.

<H1>Relocation of Hella Air Horns due to addition of ND Oil Cooler</H1>
<H3>by: sin@southeast.net</H3>

I recently installed the new dimensions oil cooler kit on my vr6 C which
necessitated moving my hella twin air horns from the stock horn location
and finding a new home for them. (in spite of my oaths and threats, roof
mounting was never seriously considered). I knew there was some space
behind the front bumper as that was where I put my electric horn so I
investigated further and the result was an easy, effective and clean
install. I would like to recommend this location to those of you
considering the horn upgrade. The location ensures good sound projection
out front and doesn't significantly obscure air flow to the radiator.
I did not really cover the wiring part completely but the
instruction sheet supplied with the horns does an adequate job.<p>

Here is the basic procedure for those interested:<p>
1) remove the driver side foglight assembly (4 screws)<p>
2) remove the driver side headlight assembly (3 screws)<p>
3) remove the front grille (press down on the 3 tabs on top and pull
forward and down).<p>
4) look at the back wall of the hole where the fog assembly rested. You
will see 3 bolt holes in the bumper steel on the extreme left of the
assembly hole. Your C may vary so check to confirm this. I mounted my
air horns to the L-shaped bracket that the factory horns bolted to and
used the center hole in this bracket to bolt it to the lowest of these 3
holes in the bumper using an 8mmx20mm hex bolt with 1 washer, 1 lock
washer & a nut.<p>
5) assemble your horns tightly to the bracket and attach all tubing
before attaching the bracket to the bumper because it is a bitch to get
to once behind the bumper. or maybe you could just bolt the horns
directly to the bumper holes? Leave yourself 3' of hose to reach the
compressor.<p>
6) gently feed the horn assembly down between the radiator and the
bumper steel. position the horns to face left and slightly down when
viewed from the front. route the air hose between the bumper and the air
horns so the radiator won't cut/melt it.<p>
7) bolt the horn assembly to the hole in the bumper using the 8mm bolt.
use a lock washer or you will spend an hour fumbling around trying to
hold the bolt as you tighten it.<p>
9) mount the compressor horizontally behind the headlight. how: I
drilled a bolt hole in the metal plate that runs across the top front of
the car. i drilled the hole approx. 2" to the left of the rubber hood
stop in the middle of a flat recess. feed the supplied bolt up thru the
hole and secure with a nut & round washer. the bolt should be flush with
the top of the nut so as not to stick up too high. clip the compressor
on the bolt head and tighten. the power leads of the compressor should
be pointed back towards the right corner of the battery to allow
clearance for the headlight. There should be no problem with the
connectors getting wet in this position.<p>
10) cut the hose to length and attach to the compressor. route hose so
it does not rub against the headlight's center screw or otherwise get
crimped. use as short a length as you can to minimize the delay time
between pushing the horn button and getting air from the compressor to
the horns.<p>
11) attach the power & ground wires to the compressor using female spade
connectors.<p>
12) replace the foglight, grill, and headlight assemblies.<p>
13) finish your wiring to your relay and horn circuit. I mounted the
relay to the relay panel in front of the master cylinde. I ran two wires
from the relay to one of the disconnected horn plugs using male spade
connectors. The ground location I used was the bolt holding the power
steering fluid reservoir to the inside fender. for a power lead i ran a
wire directly from the postive terminal of the battery with an inline
fuse.

<H1>A home made Oil Cooler for VR6</H1>
<H3>by Eric Schumacher</H3></CENTER>

The article that follows outlines how to fabricate a very efficient oil 
cooling 
system for the VW VR6 engine.  The system described, while in the 
strictest sense a 
bolt-on, needs to be fabricated.  I have described sources for the key 
parts and the 
modifications required to make them all work together.  The result is 
very low cost 
and gives performance that cannot be bettered at any price.
<p>
If you believe even a tenth of the online posts on the subject, the VR6 
engine needs 
all the help in the cooling department it can get. Like the diesels and 
16V engines, 
the VR6 has oil squirters that direct a spray of oil over the bottom side 
of the 
piston crowns to maximize the cooling effect of the oil.  VW choose to 
transfer this 
heat to the radiator via a oil to water heat exchanger.  This is a cost 
effective 
solution on their part in that an oil radiator is eliminated with the 
additional 
benefit of fast warm-up of the oil.  However it also provides hotrodders 
who live in 
hot climates an opportunity to easily increase system cooling capacity.  
A well 
designed cooling system has excess capacity and uses a thermostat to set 
the 
operating temperature. One of the best VW oil cooler systems around was 
the original 
factory system used on the European GTIs.  This system replaced the US 
style oil 
filter mount with one containing connections for an external oil cooler 
and a 
thermostat with a large diameter hot-wax actuated piston.  Like most OEM 
VW parts 
this is a very high quality piece not to be compared with some of the 
after market 
stuff produced by obscure manufacturers.  This thermostat is of the same 
design as 
used in 911 & 935 Porsches with front mounted oil radiators. In fact the 
pistons are 
interchangeable with the VW ones except that the Porsche thermostat opens 
15 deg C 
lower in temperature than the one VW specified for the GTI.  Typically 
the opening 
temperature is stamped on one end.  Be sure to test it before use, these 
things can 
wear out.
<p>
Lucky for us the Audi 5000 turbos use the same thermostat with the added 
advantage 
that, unmodified, it will bolt up to the VR6 block in place of the 
oil/water heat 
exchanger.  Turbo Audis are plentiful in junkyards and I only had to pay 
$3.50 for 
this fine item at my local Pick-A-Part. The earlier turbo Audis had two 
filters on 
this mount. I am not sure but it looks like one filter is for the engine 
and the 
other for the turbo.  The mount I obtained ( VW PN 034 115 417) was off 
of a 86 Audi 
turbo and it differs from the earlier cars in that only one oil filter is 
used and 
the oil lines to the cooler are1/2 inch while the earlier cars,  like the 
Euro GTI 
have 3/8 inch lines.  The bad news is that there is an interference with 
the upper 
of the two ignition knock sensors on the VR6.  Knock sensors, as 
implemented by VW, 
are notoriously finicky about their mounting.  Because of the foregoing I 
was 
reluctant to alter the sensor mounting in any way.  The are numerous ways 
to make 
this accommodation and the path chosen will depend upon the nature of the 
resources 
available.  A simple way would be to add a 1/4 inch thick disk as a 
spacer between 
the adapter and the VR6 block.  This would work well with the older 
two-filter 
adapter but would require fabrication of a new longer mounting bolt to 
use the 86 
filter mount.  I chose to lop off the filter mounting flange and weld a 
cover over 
the hole.  This allows the Audi adapter to mount on the VR6 with the 
thermostat 
portion of the adapter pointing straight down with plenty of clearance 
all around. 
The turbocharger oil line hole must also be closed either by welding it 
over or by 
plugging it with a 3/8-18 setscrew tapped into the hole in the casting.
<p>
On the VR6 the oil inlet and outlet end up facing straight forward where 
there is 
plenty of clearance, if 45 degree hose-end fittings are used.  Both VR6 
water hose 
connections, that formerly went to the oil/water intercooler, were closed 
with caps.
<p>
It is tempting to consider bypassing the canister filter that comes with 
the VR6 and 
using a conventional spin on filter on the Audi mount however I do not 
think that 
this is feasible.  I am guessing, but Imaximum VR6 oil pressure excessive 
for a spin-on type filter.
<p>
The oil cooler used by the earliest Audies is the same as the one used on 
later Bug 
engines with the dog house oil cooler.  Later cars use a similar shaped 
cooler but 
with banjo fittings right on the cooler.  I donis optimum in form factor 
for most VW applications since it has a rather thick core 
that is better suited to a location with a high air pressure and on the 
Golf it is 
hard to find such a location.  An aftermarket cooler that is thinner but 
with much 
more core area,  mounted below and behind the bumper, should be much more 
effective. 
 
<p>
The cooler I selected came from a rotary powered Mazda.  It is a monster 
thing 
5x19.5 inches with large I/O fittings.  Conveniently the threads into the 
aluminum 
fittings on the Mazda cooler are the same as the threads on the older 
Audi oil 
filter mounts.  Unfortunately they come out on the side and I had to 
relocate the 
fittings to the right end.  In my installation in a 85 Golf the oil lines 
exit the 
thermostatic mount from 45 degree fittings and go horizontally to the 
right, past 
the a/c compressor and around the end of the radiator.  The two oil lines 
continue 
forward out of the engine compartment thru the 5 inch space between the 
right end of 
the radiator and the frame and directly into the cavity in the backside 
of the 
bumper where the oil cooler is mounted horizontally by bolting it to the 
inside-front of the bumper.  The hoses lay in one continuos arc directly 
into the 
right end of the Mazda cooler.  
<p>
The Mazda oil cooler has a built in thermostat that I did not want to use 
so I 
removed it and its associated spring and replaced them with a 2 inch 
length of 1/2 
inch hose. When compressed by the end plug, the hose is just the right 
diameter to 
seal the thermostat cavity.  As an aside the Mazda oil cooler with 
thermostat might 
be used with a simple non-thermostatic sandwich plate type oil cooler 
pickup.  The 
major problem with this approach is that the hoses are subject to very 
high 
pressures when the oil is cold.  I rejected using the Mazda thermostat to 
avoid the 
added flow restriction of the hoses to cold oil.
<p>
The plumbing for an oil cooler installation should be low restriction, 
light weight, 
tolerate high pressures and be very reliable.  Personally I also add low 
cost to the 
list.  To meet these requirements I choose size 8 a/c hose fittings, the 
kind that 
use an O ring to make the seal.  The fittings are available in either 
aluminum or 
steel in a wide variety of configurations. They seal well and have very 
low flow 
restriction. If you are serious about an OEM look you can have hoses made 
up at any 
a/c shop, other wise use clamps and a/c fittings scrounged from your 
local junk 
yard. The aftermarket fittings designed to work with clamps are the 
easiest to work 
with but the OEM crimp-on fittings can also be used by cutting off the 
crimp-on 
ferule. To connect the hose fittings to, on the right end of the cooler, 
I welded on 
two female fittings removed from an old a/c condenser.
<p>
I used the hose ends from the Audi that match the fittings on the 
thermostatic 
filter mount. The hose end fittings are odd metric things that use a 
tapered ferule 
and O ring for sealing but they have nice low restriction  bends and will 
work on 
fractional-inch sized hose if modified. The Audi oil hoses are rather 
nice steel 
braidcovered Teflon lined types but it is unlikely that a suitable cooler 
location 
can be found on the VW that the hoses will reach 
<p>
 The hose ends on the late Audi are designed to be used with steel braid 
covered 
Teflon lines however they are a little contorted for use in a typical VR6 
installation. I chose to use 300 PSI rubber covered lines so I made 
fittings by  
silver soldering hose barbs on to the cutoff ends of the Audi fittings. 
The 
contorted fittings can easily be reduced to a simple 45 degree bend by 
cutting them 
off just past the first bend and brazing on a hose barb cut from the end 
of a steel 
a/c hose fitting. If you choose to use the early Audi oil filter mount, 
the hose 
ends from the cooler end of the Audi hoses are just right unmodified for 
use on the 
engine end of the hoses in a VR6 installation.  They have the additional 
advantage 
that they are designed for use with rubber hose and require no 
modification. Also 
the threads on the early oil filter mount are close enough to 5/8 -18 to 
use 
standard AN fittings if so desired.
<p>
I have tried to provide some background leading to my decisions so that 
my junk yard 
parts research could help other fabricators that have unique installation 
problems 
in other vehicles using the VR6 engine.

<H1>A Cheaper replacement for the VR6 top Radiator Hose</H1>
<H3>by Eric Schumacher </H3></CENTER>

The top radiator hose PN  535 121 101H  on a VR6 powered Corrado that sells
for over one hundred bucks at your friendly dealer can be replaced with one
from Trak Auto ( PN 71238 for $5.35)  The fit is good as purchased and was
made perfect in my case by trimming 3/4 of an inch from the radiator end.
The bad news is that the 71238 has no provision for the 8 mm air bleed hose.
I remedied this by making a fitting to tap into the plastic elbow on the top
of the radiator.  I made the necessary fitting by drilling out the center of
a 1/4-20 stainless steel bolt with a #30 drill and silver soldering the bolt
into a brass 5/16 hose barb fitting.  The hose barb fitting I started with
was for 1/8 inch pipe.  I cut the threads off nice and square just past the
hex and soldered the 1/4-20 bolt in the 1/4 inch hole in the hose barb
fitting.  The plastic elbow was drilled and tapped with  1/4-20 into the
mounting flange just above the O ring opposite the inlet.  Make sure the
hole is perpendicular to the flange surface to insure a good seal.  A thin
rubber washer on the screw for sealing completes the fabrication.  The bolt
threads were coated with Permatex "just in case."
<p>
Do not be tempted to omit the air bleed hose.  This hose drains the air
pockets, that will develop at the two high points in the cooling system,
into the headertank.

<H1>Installing G60 Brake Ducts on a VR6</H1>
<H3>by Brian Jowett (hjowett@nasc.mass.edu) </H3>

Well, finally got around to installing some cooling ducts for the brakes 
on my VR6 today. The ducts are from a G60 (obviously). I have yet to the 
run the car down one of my favorite mountain passes, so I'm not sure how 
much these will prevent fade. My G60 never faded it's brakes, and the VR6 
does, sooo... we'll see.
<p>
Install. hmmmm... the right side is almost straight bolt on. you have to 
open up the vents in the lower grill, and trim the opening in the wheel 
well liner. All the bolt holes etc. are there. Left side... not so easy. 
There's some metal that has to be trimmed away, it pretty much blocks the 
opening in the lower grill. I used a cutoff wheel to trim out the metal. 
There's plenty of room to cut the section out. After the metal is out of 
the way, the duct slides right in place. The towhook cover should be 
removed for best airflow into this duct. 
<p>
Total time for the install was about 2 hours.

I am the original owner. Documented oil changes every 5-7000 miles.
I ran valvoline for the first 3000 miles, changed the oil/filter & ran it to 7000.
From 7000 miles on I've run Mobil-1 fully synthetic in weights appropriate for
the season.  All documented work done by the local Porsche/Audi/VW dealer.  I installed a 
P-flow at 30,000 miles; all fluids changed (brake~coolant). The P700-Z's have 0 miles 
as I use steel wheels w/ 195 P210 WP tires in the winter.  Everything else is stock and 
in excellent condition. Leather cleaned and conditioned twice yearly with Connoly products. 
Waxed with Zymol.  I love the car dearly but have found something which better suits my needs.

I am the original owner of this 1993 VR6 SLC, purchased in April of 
1994.
Included in the asking price is the extended warranty which is fully
transferable, as well as a VW custom 2-piece bra.  The Dunlops have 
about 5,000 miles on them. 
The car has always been dealer serviced and very well cared for. 
It's fully loaded with black leather, all power windows and sunroof,
the cold weather package all the factory goodies.
Although I hate to sell this car, it just isn't practicle for me
anymore, but it was lots of fun for me to drive and I'm sure it will
be for you!!!

This car is 99% stock.  The only non-stock components are Cross Drilled and Slotted rotors w/Metal Master brake pads from Rapid Parts and Viper 500+ alarm.
The alarm has valet start (remote star excellent for warming car & interior in the winter and cooling it in the hot summer), it closes windows and sunroof and locks the doors.
Also available are a set of 16" Fondmetal Tech1 (Five Stars).    I am the second owner of the car but I bought the car it only had 8,000.  It wasn't even broken in yet.
This Corrado is also one of the few Automatics in the U.S.  Don't knock the car because it's auto.
This car will snap your neck on the highway with just the touch of the pedal extremely fast and powerful.  It has a torque converter with Sport and Economy.  (Sport = Highway & Economy = City)
I am a diehard VolksWagen MotorHead and have taken extremely good care of this car.  It is in excellent shape.  Will go only to good home.  Selling to buy a bigger VW.

Black leather,  problem free sunroof, pwr windows and locks, cruise cntrl, Code-alarm elite 3000(keyless entry, starter kill, two stage shock snsr),
Car is stock and was formerly owned by the a svc. tech. at the local dealership).  Xferable extended warranty that covers all(incl. spchgr). VIN coded body panels(provides addl. $2500.00 dlrs. if car should be stolen.
This car is in superior shape.  It has only one small shopping cart type dent on the passenger side door.
This car is a California model so I think it has a 7yr/70,000 mile warranty on the Emmissions system.

Asking: $ 125 <br>
<LI>AutoThority FlowTech , similar to Neuspeed P-Flow but with longer carbon-fibre tube.  Claimed to deliver better low-end performance than the P-Flow due to the location of its K&N cone-type filter  (further away from the heat of the engine block), and 







the increased length of the inlet tract (higher air velocity at lower rpms).

The above items have performed impeccably for the last 5-6 months (8,000 miles), but now it's time to upgrade... ;o)

<H1> Known Corrado Problems</H1>
From: FAQ's<p>

<p>
   90-92 Corrado G60: Made by Karmann, US market.
   Major problems: Generally fairly reliable.
   First cold start sometimes fails. Second start usually ok. Notchy
   transmission/Linkage/Reverse binding, many had their 2nd gear syncro die,
   most G60s do not have the clutch with Cd or Ni plated splines
   exasterbating shifting problems.

<p>
   Common problems: exhaust hangers go bad (it's a heavy exhaust),
   auto belts malfunctioning (really, starter switch),
   windshield wipers miss a few areas, vibration damper gets loose
   on driver's side axle, supercharger dies between 50-?k miles (no corrolation
   found with those using AST or Neuspeeds smaller pulleys), sunroof dies
   after a couple of years, foglights crack due to heat.

<p>
   Impressions: Low end lacking, notchy shifter, but otherwise a nice, sturdy,
   and practical car. Good handling, bad rear visibility. The usual rattles
   but better then other A2s or A1s.<BR>
   Lots of aftermarket parts available to improve power and handling.

<p>
   92-&gt; Corrado VR6/SLC: Made by Karmann, US market.
   Major problems: Transmission Linkage binding, increasing notchiness.
   Several had their ABS system go bad, many had their 2nd gear syncro die
   older VR6s (92) do not have the clutch with Cd or Ni plated splines
   exasterbating shifting problems.<BR>
   Common problems: Windshield wipers miss a few areas, sunroof dies
   after a couple of years, foglights crack due to heat.

<p>
   Impressions: Great car, better than the G60 version in virtually all
   respects. Quiet.

<p>
   [Tom H]<BR>
   From what the service people at my dealer (whom I have a lot of confidence
   in) say, a partial quality/reliability ranking might be something like:

<PRE>
     Corrado  &gt; Golf/Jetta A3 &gt; Golf/Jetta A2 &gt; old Passat
    (Karmann)     (Puebla)     (Westmoreland)     (Emden)
</PRE>

<H1> G60 Fire ?!?!</H1>

Tim was so nice to forward me/us a bunch of notes called Tech Talk
(I am not sure of its origin).

<p>
One of the items mentions of a potential engine fire in 90 G60s.
To eliminate the problem you need to move the ground strap
between the firewall and the #4 cylinder head cam cover stud
to the top of the TBody.

<p>
I have not checked mine as yet, but I do remember when I was
installing my cam that I found this wire a bit tight and
rerouted it a bit.

<p>
Now where did I leave that @#$%^&amp; file of all the things that
go shafe at night on Corrados to add this to the list.

<p>
Actually...I still have lots of interesting info on a non-volatile
storage medium (paper) that I'd like to convert to electronic form
(text, not bitmaps).<BR>
If any of you with a scanner and/or an OCR could be so kind to lend me
a hand, I'd appreciate it.

<p>
If we could do that, you could figure out the hard starting problem
when hot on ABA and AAA engines.

Authors: ND, anonymous, Jan Vandenbrande

<p>
Check the following:

<UL>
  <LI> The power steering hose on G60s. It kind-a hangs down below
  the oil filter before it goes up to the PS reservoir.
  At some point it crosses the car's front subframe, and I found
  wear at that spot. I covered it with some split tubing and
  secured the hose with some tie wraps. You'll figure out what
  seems right. I don't think the VR6 has this problem.

  <LI> Upper radiator hose rubbing up agains the fan for G60s. Talk about BAD
  design! The upper radiator hose is routed RIGHT ABOVE the radiator
  fan. On top of this hose is that piece of plastic, pressing down.
  This all works ok if the little line on the hose lines up with
  line on the upper radiator neck. Mine did not ==&gt; wear ==&gt; 90$
  So check it out. In an extreme case, I would not be surprised
  if it stopped the fan from running.<BR>
  VR6 *may* have this problem too.

  <LI> [From someone else on the net] The A/C cord clipped on to the
  stationary fan housing strut may interfere with the fan.
  This seems to be a problem mostly in G60s.
  What I did (Jan) is to reroute the wires a bit and use split
  tubing to protect them.

  <LI> A/C hose: On the SLC, at the front-passenger side right above the headlamp,
  that bent was rubbing up against some sheet metal.
  Reinforced it as above.

  <LI> Oxygen sensor wire clip on subframe: This clip is sharp and tore through
  most of the cladding on my G60. VR6s may have this problem too.

  <LI> From ND's Tech Talk:
  There is a potential for engine fire in 90 G60s.
  To eliminate the problem you need to move the ground strap
  between the firewall and the #4 cylinder head cam cover stud
  to the top of the TBody. (#4 is near the tranny).

  <LI> I also do not like how they routed all these wires and tubes
  right above the engine. Too much heat. In a while all the insulation
  will be hard and snap the wire like dry spaghetti. Anyone who has
  worked on an old car will know what I mean. Not sure you can do much
  about it short of adding some heat insolating wrap.

  <LI> Keep an eye on battery leaks...it creates all kinds of havoc
  on the supercharger tubes, intercooler, electrical connections, etc.

VR6 Engine Fires
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H1> VR6 Engine Fires</H1>
by Rick Floyd<p>

Q: Does the Corrado have any known electrical system problems?
<p>
A: There are two known wiring problems:
<p>

<ol>
<li> VR6 Corrados manufactured between August, 1991 and November, 1992
     were subject to a recall (campaign number 93V102000) to correct
     the routing of wiring harnesses. Incorrectly routed harnesses
     could wear and short during normal operation, causing the engine
     to stall or the radiator fan to stop operating.

<li> A few 1993 Corrado SLCs have experienced a short in a power
     distribution module for the cooling system, leading to the meltdown
     of multiple wiring harnesses and potentially resulting in an engine
     compartment fire. VW is covering the repair costs (which can run
     US$4000-$5000) in some cases. You'll have an easier time of it if you
     contact VW before repairs are attempted. If you have seen this failure,
     please contact me (Rick Floyd; rick@cs.duke.edu) for details.

</ol>

<b>WHAT HAPPENED ?<p></b>

About 2:30 pm Saturday 14 December 1996  Liberian registered freightliner, <b><i>Bright Field</i></b>, rammed into a dock housing a <b>Riverwalk mall and hotel complex</b> in <b>New Orleans LA</b>. The 763 foot freightliner piloted by Ted Davisson was loaded with 56,000 tons of corn bound for Kashima Japan via the Panama Canal. The freightliner apparently lost an engine lube oil pump which automatically shut down an engine at a very bad time (3 minutes till impact). <a href="override.htm"><b>Manual over-rides (to the shutdown)</b></A> were available but not used. Early in the investigation it was unclear if the crew knew of their existence and how to use them.<p>


December 22 AP reported, "Testimony indicates the incident that injured at least 116 people and caused millions of dollars in damages could have been prevented if the engineer had known there was an emergency and would have hit an override
button. That<b> would have restored full power within 10 seconds.</b> Engineer Fang Jim Yun testified that he did not know anything was wrong so he used a slower, traditional method of restoring power. The ship's captain says he had alerted the engineer, but admitted his warning might not have been heard due to the ship's horn."<p>


As the large ship bore down on the shopping center, Davisson was able to drop the bow anchor and when it caught it jerked the bow around and cause the ship to 'parallel park' between two cruise ships (one was the<i> Nieuw Amsterdam</i>) and a casino boat named <i>Hilton Flaming Casino</i> with 800 people on board.. It was earlier reported there may have been a communication problem with the mostly Chinese crew but the captain seemed to think they understood his request to drop anchor, but just did not comply. When the <i>Bright Field </i>finally came to rest, it was about 70 feet from the<i> Flaming Casino</i>. You can see the actual crash in a <a href="photos/freight.mov"> <b>CNN Quick Time movie</b></A>. Note the impact occurs broadside vs. the almost <A href="photos/freight5.jpg"><b>head on photo </b></A>moments before due to the anchor hanging and yanking the bow around.<p>

The <i>Bright Field </i>is a 763 foot, 9,789 HP, 68,200 dwt Liberian registered freightliner with a top speed of about 14 knots is listed as built 1/12/88. It is owned and operated by COSCO,  a Hong Kong shipping firm. COSCO is the worlds 4th largest shipping firm by tonnage and dead weight, owning 78 vessels. Most of them are bulk carriers like the <i>Bright Field</i>. COSCO stands for "China Ocean Shipping Company".</i> AP wrote a nice <a href="cosco.htm"><b>background information story on COSCO</b></A> and they also have a web site at <A href="http://www.cosco.com.hk:80/shipping.htm"> <b>http://www.cosco.com.hk:80/shipping.htm</b></A>. Their web site includes a nice <a href="bfspecs.htm"><b>specifications sheet on the Bright Field</b></A> which we copied to this site.<p>

On July 11, 1996 the Bright Field passed its <a href="inspect.htm"><b>annual Coast Guard inspection</b></A> and it had also been given a clean bill of health by the union representing its crew.<p>


The <i>Bright Field</i> lost about 15 foot off under the bow and was pushed up to the remainder of the dock by a number of tugs (see the <a href="photos/bright1.gif"><b>AP Photo</b></A> as rescue efforts and problem evaluations continued. Note- <b>Check out  the prop wash </b>from the tugs in the photo. Later, GE (General Electric) took the opportunity to issue a <a href="geengine.htm"><b>Press Release</b></A> that three of the tugs stabilizing the vessel and preventing additional collapse of the shopping area were powered by GE diesel electric engines.<p>

Monday December 16 officials said, a strong cold front that brought wind and rain was making the tugboats' task more difficult.<p>

The river is very busy here. Approximately 6000 large ocean bound vessels and 120,000 tugs pushing and pulling barges pass this point each year. At this time of year, large amounts of grain are being exported to Asia.  A <a href="grain.htm"><b>Reuters report</b></A> discusses the problems that will result if the river is closed more than a few days. They have already evaluated moving the grain by rail to the west coast for bulk transport but currently have sufficient reserves to cover the anticipated few days delay on current shipments coming through the crash area which are due there in mid January.<p>

The Friday night (December 13) preceding the Saturday afternoon crash an <a href="repairs.htm"><b>engine heat exchanger was removed</b></A> upstream, brought to New Orleans for cleaning, and reinstalled on the bright Field. It is unknown if this had any relation to the events that followed.<p>


On Dec 18 CNN reports Pilot Davisson saying the local river pilot was blowing the horn (warning horn?) at the time he (Davisson) was trying to tell the Chinese crew to drop anchor and they did not respond immediately because they could not hear him. Later <A href="chinese.htm"><b>Chinese Captain Jing Quan Deng testifies</b></A> he heard and agreed with Davisson's ideas for full speed astern, rudder to hard right, and dropping the anchor. His "first man to anchor" could not hear him initially over the alarms. Then when he could be heard the man did not drop anchor for fear of swinging into a cruise ship, the <i>Niew Amsterdam</i>. Finally, when the "first man to anchor" saw we were bearing down on a casino boat he dropped the anchor.<p>

A <a href="records.htm"><b>December 20th USA Today - AP report</b></A> mentions a page is found missing in the engine log records covering the 2 days prior to the crash, Maritime law of limiting damages to the value of the ship and its cargo (about $16 million) if the ship is found to be seaworthy and the crew is void of negligence is being discussed, and a marine firm was caught removing the failed lube pump thought to have contributed to the disaster.<p>


During the inquiry, the Coast Guard pointed out that power loss is common in this area. In the previous 24 hours (to the 2nd day of testimony) 3 freighters lost power and were anchored upriver of the city and 2 more had halted due to power fluctuations. This is reported in the <a href="chinese.htm"><b>"Chinese Captain Testifies Day 2" </b></A>newsclip. NTSB officials say Davisson himself had been involved in three loss-of-power accidents in his 16 years as a river pilot. They say an average of one ship per day in the area suffers a loss of power similar to the one that
caused the accident.<p>


Coast Guard says Sunday December 22  the <b>Marine Safety Board will reconvene Jan. 6</b> to continue its probe into why the 70,000-ton <i>Bright Field</i> crashed on Dec. 14. The board already has completed its initial questioning of witnesses.<p>

<a name=damages></A>
<b>DAMAGES</b><p>

The Riverwalk was built in 1986 at a cost of $58 million and had suffered a few ship minor ship impacts before, but none anywhere near as violent as this. The <i>Bright Field </i>hit the Riverwalk in the middle at the Cafe du Monde at 2:30 p.m. when a large crowd was on the Riverwalk. Several maps of the area are below.<p>

116 people sustained injuries and no deaths have been reported. 15 shops and 456 hotel rooms were demolished. New Orleans Mayor Mark Morial is asking President Clinton to declare a disaster so the city can get federal aid to help repair damages.<p>

Monday December 16th even as authorities tried to assess the damage, the first lawsuit against the ship's owner, the Cosco Co. of Hong Kong, was filed  Sunday in federal court in New Orleans. Walter Lejier, one of eight attorneys filing the suit, said the plaintiffs include several Riverwalk business owners, residents of One River Place condominiums who had to leave their homes because utility connections were severed, and the owner of a car that fell from a parking garage into the river.<p>

COSCO is hoping maritime law will apply which limits liability to the value of the ship and its contents (about $16 million) if the ship is found seaworthy and the crew is void of negligence.<p>

December 21 National Underwriter Property and Casualty Company began to discuss some of the insurance and property damage situations. The report is in the news reports below.<p>

December 22 AP reported a contract diver aiding in cleanup efforts this weekend was trapped under water for about 15 minutes in the accident rubble, but officials say he was freed by other workmen and escaped injury.<p>

<img src="new.gif">  Saturday December 21 the hearing learned of another "crash manuever" switch. Also the engine cylinders or pistons had been repaired 9 times in the last 4 months due to an overheating exhaust temperature.This is reported the news clips below.<p>

December 23 Reuters reported they have been off loading the 64,000 tons of corn at night to minimize the dust problems beginning Sunday night and may be able to move the ship Friday. Still unsure how much the mall wreckage is being supported by the ship under the Poydras Street Wharf. Early damage estimates of $250 million to businesses and another $250 million in losses.<p>

<b> WEBMASTER'S COMMENTS ON THE CRASH</b><p>

I think that as in most accidents, several thinks began to go wrong and they all added to put the ship in a bad set of operating conditions which caused the crash. I have been interested in the recent attempts to apply <b>chaos theory and the ideas of complex adaptive systems </b> to manufacturing and other business practices. It seems like this accident is a place they could also be applied. One of the concepts is that when things are going smoothly they may go that way for a long time, then a few subtle changes can cause major / drastic changes to the system. If you are already in a very dynamic position some minor events can send your system "to hell in a hand basket."<p>

In this case the <b>factors of allowing the hotel and shopping complex to be built "out over the water" in an area that has a history of many vessel impacts, the potential for language barriers with the Chinese crew and American pilot, allowing casino boats to dock in heavy traffic areas, and perhaps insufficient training in the automatic engine over-ride system all contribute to make the operating conditions "shakey" to start with. When you combine this with a winding river channel and throw in a failed steering system you are bound for trouble.</b> It the contributing factors had been addressed the crew would have had much more time, been able to try the emergency over-ride, and if they did crash it would have been into a wharf or riverbank - not into a crowded shopping center.<p>

If you are interested in studying chaos theory or complex adaptive systems further, we have a <a href="../../../desks/mgmt/mgmt.htm#cas"><b>Chaos Theory and Complex Adaptive Systems Area</b></a> on our RBBI Managers Desk.<p>

<b>Does anybody out there have a Navigational Map of the river in this area</b> (mile 95) they could scan that we could post here? You can match the area to the area show in our maps above. Just looking for the very immediate area of the crash (this bend in the river). If you are a chart company we could give you a nice plug here.

Just thought I'd make a small suggestion for your Bright Field/Riverwalk
coverage.<p>

The<b> terms 'freighter' and 'freightliner' are incorrect terms for the Bright
Field.  These type vessels are correctly referred to as 'bulk carriers'.</b>
Yes I know all the media has used the term 'freighter', but it is still
incorrect.  <p>

By the way, I recently retired from 25 years service in the US Merchant
Marine as a Chief Engineer.  So I am very interested in incidents such as
Bright Field/Riverwalk.  Thanks for your web coverage<p>

****************************************<br>

Thanks for your reply. Of course, I had no trouble logging onto the<br>
site today! It is a really fine job you've done.<p>

A most excellent and informative site.<br>
 
Thank you for providing this info!<p>

Date: Wed 25 December 1996<br>
First of all, your coverage is excellent and you have my thanks, as a
retired mariner who likes to keep up with current maritime events.<p>
 
Secondly, I finally got around to looking at the rest of your web site and
like it very much.  I've placed your site on my 'favorites' list.<p>

Nice work on the Bright Field Info....
I happen to work at CG HQ ....The Investigations and Analysis Division
which develops policy and procedures for such activities.<p>

Well done web!!! Thanks for the info and a way of sorting out the
scuttlebutt. I am a marine pilot in NY. Loss of the plant is not
uncommon; rather a fact of life. The quality of seamanship, due to the
policy of Foriegn Flag crews, thus language difficulties is this
incidents' smoking gun. You get what you pay for! My hats off to the
River pilot for a job well done! State Pilots are our front line defense
against this industries absuridities and profiteering with ill reguard
toward SAFETY.<p>

*****************************************<br>

Date: Thursday 2 January 1997<br>
 
I am an active pilot at the panama canal and have piloted
ships of all nationalities.
 
I have noticed that PRC vessels have,as a general rule,
very poor discipline. It frequently happens that the
crew just wont respond to the Masters orders or respond
on their own timetable. This has been explained to me to be
the result of the crew and officers coming from different
parts of China. (I have not noticed anything like this on
 HK or Taiwan vessels.)  This may explain the anchor not
 being dropped promptly.<p>

                        
 
It is also my personal opinion that bridge control is
not as dependable as having the engines on manual control
from engine room. Also any pilot can tell you a suitcase
 full of horror stories of resulting from computer
control of engine.<p>

Great homepage on the Riverwalk/Brightfield accident!  One
recommendation for something else to add would be any information on
where to contact if you were involved in the accident (unfortunately, I
was eating at the LeMoynes Landing Restaurant when it hit and received a
broken arm--I need to find out how I get my medical bills covered!!!)<p>
 
Since I'm from out of state, your site had a TON of updated
info--thanks!<p>

<h4><b><i>thanks to this reader's note  we obtained the info and it is<br>
now posted at the top of our page</b></i></h4><p>
 
*********************************<br>
<img src="new.gif"> Date: Saturday 4 January 1997<br>
                             --- We were eating at the glass walled restaurant,on
the river side,at the foot of the second set of esculators when the
accident happened.we were watching the cruise ships loading and enjoying
our meal when we began hearing this irrating horn sound.we watched the
boat coming for about three minutes before it hit.truly a once in a
lifetime experience.<p>

On this page we are going to point out  some of the areas that can be particularly beneficial to Drive Manufacturers.<p> 

Among the DESKS you will probably find the Engineering, Management, Marketing, Purchasing, and Regulations desks to be the most interesting. If you get pulled into any sort of a Product Liability situation you will find the Legal Desk to be very helpful. Find the desk that most closely identifies with your job and investigate it thoroughly. <p>


In the FOLDERS you can find information on the Boating Accidents, Boat Show schedule, how to calculate the Economic Impact of Boating in your area as well as the Economic Impact of  your plant, detailed information on Fuels, and see past and present industry Patents. You can also read about the latest Technologies. The Technologies Folder is divided into Basic, Product, Process, and Business Technologies. The rec.boats newsgroup Folder includes newsgroup messages from your customers offering insight into what they want and what their problems are. The Patent Folder has a great story in it about the <a href="../../folders/pat/isd.htm">Invention of the Stern Drive</A>.<p>

The OFFICE TOOLS section will rapidly answer all those daily office questions about phone numbers, addresses, creating maps to a place, package tracking, time zones, area codes, zip codes, etc. <p>

The NEWS section will bring you the latest industry news.<p>

The FTP area contains larger files available for downloading including the latest EPA regulations for the industry.<p>

The LINKS area helps you find web resources. The BOATING LINKS area maintains the most complete list of Boat Builder websites available. It also provides links to the drive manufacturer sites. You can compare your web site to the sites of your competitors. The OTHER USEFUL LINKS section provides links to a large number of the technology, environmental, management, and travel planning sites. The page also provides links to areas those in special disciplines (Aluminum, CFD, Corrosion, Freight / Logistics, International Markets, Manufacturing, Packaging, Quality, Safety & Health, Service, and Tech Writing) will be very interested in.  Its job and labor section can help you fill technical positions at your plant. The WEBMASTER LINKS section can help you establish and maintain a great website. The PERSONAL LINKS section will assist you in your personal life in terms of continuing education, financial planning, heath questions, hobbies, and other personal items.<p>

If you find this resource to be invaluable to you, and we hope you do, you might ask your firm to sponsor one of our pages. It will help guarantee that the latest information will always be here and it will daily expose your firm to industry professionals.<p>

Good Luck and be sure and drop us a note about what you like or don't like about the site.  E-mail us at

<h3><center><b>Sponsor Information Page</b></center></h3>
<p>

At this moment  (Early November) we are focusing on trying to get the site up and running. As soon as we can get it going smoothly we will be looking for site sponsors. The site provides a very tightly segmented group of users and will be used daily by many of them. Those supplying components or services to the Boat Building Industry have an excellent and economical opportunity to communicate with their existing and future customers. Those outside the industry who have products and services used by the types of professionals that will be daily using this service have an opportunity to reach some new customers here. The Drive Manufacturers can reach the Boat Builders here, the Boat Builders can reach the Boat Dealers, and the Boat Dealers can reach the individual boaters who come into this site. Also those of you who benefit greatly from the wealth of information available on this site might wish to sponsor a page to help keep this site going. Without proper sponsorship this site will be gone.<p>

The pages available for Sponsorship have a small rectangular sponsor box in the top right corner and an advertising Banner in the middle of the page. Examples of them are shown below.<p>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../artwork/sponsors/smktds.gif" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT=
"58" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>
<p><br><br><br.<br><br><br><br.<br><br><br><br.<br>


<CENTER><IMG WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="60" SRC="../artwork/sponsors/sblankb.gif" ></A></CENTER>
<p><p>

When visitors click on either box they will be sent to your web site and you can supply them with any information you desire. If you do not have a web site - we can establish one for you on this site. We would encourage you to establish your own web site with your provider and begin to apply this technology so you can grow with it. If you are unable to do that at this time, we can establish a site with some of your basic product or service information and provide your phone and fax numbers. We have the ability to scan photographs and brochures. E-mail us at 
<a href="mailto:polsong@virtualpet.com">polsong@virtualpet.com</A> or give us a call at (800) 443-6543 with your needs.<p>


We envision the small upper right sponsor box remaining at it is shown, and just adding your company name. The Banner Ad can included some basic information about your company and its products or services as well as any current specials. We can use your company colors and logos if desired. The banner is 60 X 468 Pixels and we can help you design it if you wish. We do not allow animations in the banner. <p>

Additionally have a <a href="sponsors.htm">sponsors page</A> (with the yellow box link in the Folders section of the Home Page) which lists all the current sponsors with links to their sites.


<hr>
We will be regulating the type of advertising on the site to make sure it is appropriate for and of interest to our users. Also will keep the site "G-Rated" so you don't have to worry about seeing some X-Rated Materials here or on those sites sponsoring our site. <p>

Also we will not be allowing advertising that might aggravate prime users of specific pages. For example, no Drive Manufacturer advertising is allowed on the Drive Manufacturers Office Page. Drive Manufacture advertising would be welcome on any other page.<p>

The net contains a great deal of information that can help managers do a better job. We will try to point you toward those areas and let you apply them as you see fit. <p>

<hr>

<h3><b>Discussion of Links</b></h3>

We suggest you browse the front of our <a href="../../links/otherl.htm">Other Useful Links Page</A> and look through the headings and note the various kinds of information that is available. Some areas that should be of interest to all managers are the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#bench">Benchmarking / Re-Engineering Segment</A>, the <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#management">Management Segment</A>, the <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#travel">Travel and Food Segment</A>, and the <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#quality">Quality Segment</A>.  Its job and labor section can help you fill technical positions at your plant. We suggest you browse these groups of links and any others groups of links that interest you. Especially check out those sites marked <img src="../../links/great.gif">.<p>

<a name=vasa><b><h4>VASA</h4></b></a><p>

An interesting Case Study involving a historical boat and its design and management decisions is available on the net. It illustrates some of the problems encountered when managing innovation and large projects. The case is called<a href="http://www.cox.smu.edu/mis/cases/vasa/home.html"> "The<i> Vasa</i> Capsizes"</A>. It is interesting to find that many of the same problems that plague innovation management were present hundreds of years ago as well.<p>

If you are interested in learning even a little more about the <i>Vasa</i>, it is in a Swedish museum being restored and they have a <a href="http://www.vasamuseet.se/">nice multi-language web site</A> with another site providing <a href="http://www.sunet.se/stockholm/museums/vasa/vasa.html">an English overview of the museum</a>.

<hr>


<b><h4>MCB Press</h4></b></a><p>

The <a href="http://www.mcb.co.uk">MCB Press web site</A> has over 100 management related journals with many sample articles. The site offers a current European viewpoint to many of the issues faced by managers today. Many of the journals have an online discussion page associated with them. We strongly suggest you wander this site, note the particular journals in your fields of interest, and read some of the articles available from them. You will need the <img src="../../ftp/pdf.gif"> .pdf Adobe Acrobat Reader which can be obtained from their web site. We have a link to their site in our <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#software">Software Support Segment</A> of our Other Useful Links Section.<p>

<H3><bold>Discussion of Other Areas of the Site</h3></bold>

<b><h4>Intranets</h4></b></a><p>

4 December, 1996 - For those involved in setting up an intranet (internal network similar to the internet) we have established a group of<a href="../../links/netl.htm#intranet"> intranet links</A> in our Webmaster Links section. Several contain "white papers" and case studies you will find very useful.<p>


<hr>

<b><h4>Mangement and Engineering Use of the Web</h4></b></a><p>

The October 18th 1996 issue of Machine Design has a great landmark article titled, <a href="../../folders/net/change.htm">"The Web Ships Up Waves Of Change"</A>, that does a great job of illustrating some of the new uses of web technology by management and engineers.<p>

<hr>

<b><h4>Boating Newsgroups</h4></b></a><p>

Several  on-line bulletin board type newsgroups discuss boating activities, problems, questions, etc. We have captured a few of the conversations and posted them in our <a href="../../folders/recb/recb.htm">rec.boats FOLDER</A>. We have a <a href="../eng/eng.htm#newsg">discussion</A> at the Engineering Desk about the need to establish a procedure to respond to field problems and other situations in the newsgroups.<p>


<hr>


<b><h4>Invention of the Stern Drive</h4></b></a><p>

The Patent Folder has a great story in it about the <a href="../../folders/pat/isd.htm">Invention of the Stern Drive</A>. The background includes an internal conspiracy, several managers rejecting the new technology, and is an example of how long it can take for an idea to flourish. Many feel the stern drive itself is now in the mature position and some "new technology" may be knocking on its door. Its a great time to be alive!<p>

<a name=cas></a>
<h4><b>Chaos Theory and Complex Adaptive Systems (cas)</h4></b>

There are a number of articles and books being written right now on chaos theory and business. Chaos theory appears "poised" to establish the next set of management buzzwords and consultants.<p>

The 18 October 1996 Wall Street Journal,  Front Lines Segment by Thomas Petzinger Jr. was one of the first general public exposures of the concepts. The article titled, <a href="chaos.htm">"How Creativity Can Take Wing At Edge of Chaos"</A>, goes on to report that many natural systems seem to thrive the best when they are poised on the edge of chaos. He likens large corporations to these systems and implies they too might do best "on the edge". We have a copy of the article posted as well as some e-mail comments from Mr. Petzinger and some ties to some other works we have posted.<p>

For some additional information, the 21 October 1996 issue of Industry Week has an editorial type article on page 12 titled, <a href="chaosiw.htm">"A New Science for Business Strategists:Complexity, chaos, and the 'natural laws' of business'"</a> by John Mariotti. We have a report on his article on this site.<p>

<img src="../../links/new.gif"> The December 13, 1996 Wall Street Journal "The Front Lines" column by Thomas Petzinger Jr. was titled, "Mexican Cement Firm Decides to Mix Chaos Into Company Strategy." It tells the problems of trying to deliver cement in Mexico with weather, traffic, labor disruptions, and unscheduled government inspections interfering with every truck load of cement that begins its life with only 90 minutes till spoiling. One huge firm, Cemex, in Monterrey was demanding orders 24 hours in advance and could only promise delivery within a 3 hour window in 1993. Builders were forced to maintain large crews on hand with nothing to do until the cement arrived. A Mr. Homero Resendez was assigned to merge information systems with another large producer they purchased. They were drawn to visit Federal Express by their well know on time guarantees. They visited the  Federal Express operation again and then they spent some time with the 911 department of the Houston Fire Department. The revelation was that individual emergencies were unpredictable, but together emergencies display a rhythm that could be planned for. <p>

They no acknowledged things were going to interfere with many loads.They were never quite sure what exactly would happen, but they could be sure that something would happen. Rather than penalize the customer, perhaps they could make last minute changes in their plans. They began a pilot program of putting dashboard computers in every truck in a city and putting the whole 
a pilot program of putting dashboard computers in every truck in a city and putting the whole city under the control of one switchboard.  The truck reports their position and status by computer. An expert system is used to place incoming orders to the appropriate mixing plant or truck in the city based on traffic, anticipated orders, and  pouring conditions. Now they are able to accept same day orders and deliver within a 20 minute window. The pilot program is now being expanded.<p>


<img src="../../links/new.gif"> A related field,<b> Genetic Algorithms</b>, is covered in our Technology Folder in the Business Technology section on the  <a href="../../folders/tech/business/genetic.htm"> Genetic Algorithms Page</a>.<p>

<img src="../../links/new.gif"> We discuss the relationship between some of the current chaos / CAS concepts and the Bright Field bulk cargo vessel crash on the Riverwalk in New Orleans on our <a href="../../folders/acc/bright/bright.htm#webcom">Bright Field Page</A>.<p>


We have also established a <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#cas">group of links to Complex Adaptive Systems sites</A> on the web. They are in our Other Useful Links section.

<h3><b>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Information</b></h3>

<h4><b>NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) to replace SIC codes</h4></b>

A new system is being prepared to replace the SIC (Standard Industry Classification) system. You might want to gain a basic understanding of it and make sure those who report your data or use SIC data in creating forecasts for your operation are aware of what is coming . We have a <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/industry/naics/naics.htm">NAICS page</A> on our sister site, The Manufacturing Industry Research Desk.<p>

<hr>

<h4><b>Demand Flow Technology (DFT)</h4></b>

The November 18,, 1996 issue of Business Week (pages 70-74) has a story titled, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/1996/47/b350278.htm">American Standard Wises Up"</A>, that talks about Emmanuel A. Kampouris and his use of a new technique called<b> Demand Flow Technology or DFT</b> to turn around  American Standard. The process involves JIT combined with shortening manufacturing times to increase inventory turns.<p>

The process is also described by a firm developing related software on their <a href="http://www.teamflow.com/AmerStd.html">American Standard example page</A>.

<a name=temps></A>
<h4><b>Do You Have Temps Working In Your Facility?</h4></b>

"Temps Win Full Time Benefits at Microsoft in Business Setback" was a 14 October 1996 Wall Street Journal article. The article describes the use of temps as a common practice in the technology industry. Portions of the article are reproduced below, more is available from the original source.<p>

" The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco earlier this month ruled in favor of plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit alleging that Microsoft Corp. had wrongly classified them as independent contractors rather than direct Microsoft employees. The appeals court overturned a Seattle U.S. district court judge's ruling in favor of Microsoft."<p>

"Microsoft said over the weekend that it is likely to appeal. But if the ruling stands Microsoft is certain to have to pay many millions of dollars in compensation."<p>

"The Microsoft case turned on the definition of who is a temporary worker and which workers qualified for Microsoft's 401(k) retirement plan and its lucrative employee stock-purchase plan. Federal law contains a number of descriptions and tests for distinguishing between temporary and direct employees, and state law often adds to the list. The basic principle is know as "right to control," and refers to whether the company or the worker - or the worker's employment agency - really determines the worker's tasks, use of time, how the work is done, which tools are used, and other factors."<p>
<i>
The boat building industry due to its seasonality and cyclical nature is a heavy user of temporary workers in both hand labor and technical positions. We encourage you to follow the development of this situation and to review your practices involving temporary workers.</i><p>

<hr>





<h4><b>On-Line Job Postings</h4></b>

November 19, 1996 we started posting <b>boat building industry related jobs</b> in a <a href="../../folders/jobs/jobs.htm">Jobs Folder </A>on this website. If you are adding some people, go to our Jobs Folder to obtain information about how to post job openings there. This web site is being read daily by those in the industry and can provide great exposure of your needs to a very focused audience..<p>

The 20 September 1996 Wall Street Journal carried an article titled, "Job Hunting Takes Off in Cyberspace". The article talks of the huge growth in job postings on the net. It says that postings for the 15 leading on-line job banks have jumped from about 15,000 on any given day in 1994 to over half-a-million now. The article goes on to  tell several success stories of corporations hiring good people throughout the net. It also tells success stories of individuals who found good jobs through these postings.<p>

We have listed the 3 largest job sites in our <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#jobs">Jobs / Labor Links</A> segment of our Other Useful Links page. America's Job Bank alone now has about 300,000 job postings. Several of the services allow you to post resumes as well. This could be a low cost avenue to find some good technical people for your firm and if the business cycles to "in the toilet" again, you might use it to find a job yourself. <p>

<hr>

<h4><b>The Year 2000 Computer Date Problem</h4></b>

One topic making the rounds in the literature now is the potential for major computer disasters when the date changes to the year 2000. Most programs have been using a 2 digit date code and the 00 will cause them a lot of problems in calculating the difference between dates. We have a link to the Problems With the DATE/YEAR 2000 Page and to the U.S. Army Year 2000 Page in the  <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#software">Software Support Segment</A> of our Other Useful Links Page.<p>

The August 12, 1996 Business Week article, "Panic In The Year Zero Zero" on pages 72-73 discusses the problem of the major financial institutions computers and their inter-connectivity. There is special concern for Wall Street and the management of trades. <p>

One recent article on the topic "Tick Tock 2000" is in the September 2 issue of Industry Week Magazine on pages 36-39. The article suggest an 8 step plan.<p>

<ul>
<li> Create an awareness of the ramifications and risks.
<li> Ensure that new purchased software and hardware as well as in-house system changes incorporate 4 digit year codes and accommodate the year 2000.
<li> Arrange support and financing to handle the problem.
<li> Analyze and inventory all software and hardware for date codes and how they interface with each other.
<li> Plan a solution.
<li> Test the fixes.
<li> Review the practices of business partners to make sure they are not putting your company at risks. Explain any changes you are making in systems they interface with.
<li> Look ahead to the next digital glitch, such as the expanding of the Social Security Code by one digit or the advent of a new, singular currency in the European Union.
</ul>

The September 18, 1996 Wall Street Journal carried an article titled, Even Some New Software Won't Work in 2000". The article tells of the year 2000 date problem and how most of the fears have involved mainframe systems. Now they are finding "tens of millions of PC owners will be affected." The article also reports that many of the currently popular PC software packages being sold today have still not been "fixed". Quicken says they are waiting on a fall release to address the problem. Access 95, File Maker Pro and others still haven't fixed the problems either. The companies are taking some heat from those who say they have been short sided in addressing the issue.<p>

You might want to get somebody looking into this before its too late.<p>
<hr>

<h4><b>Lotus Notes</h4></b>

It has come to our attention that some of the major firms in the industry are using Lotus Notes as a web browser. How can we put this politely?  Lotus Notes will not allow you access to frames, Java, movies, sound, gif animations, VRML (3-D Virtual Reality), internet phones, desktop conferencing, white boards, it is unable to use "cookies" to store information about prior visits to a site, and will not accept the hundreds of unique plug-ins being written for more popular browsers such as Netscape.  In addition to these problems, you are looking at a "cached copy" of websites that may not include the latest updates. It 's like reading last weeks newspaper! We have seen estimates putting Lotus Notes' share of the web browser market at 1/2 of 1 percent. Why do you think that is? If you were sending your troops into war, you would want to arm them with the latest weapons. The business environment is a war right now. If your people are using Lotus Notes as their web browser, they will be crushed. Sorry about that Lotus / IBM. Lotus Notes has its uses, just don't use it as a high performance web browser.<p>

<h3><b>Discussion of Links</b></h3>

Be sure and browse the <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#marketing">Marketing Links</A> segment in the Other Useful Links section. Pay special attention to those marked <img src="../../links/great.gif">. You will also find the <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#travel">Travel and Food Links</A> segment of the Other Useful Links section to be very useful.<p>

If you are a <b>Drive Manufacturer,</b> you may want to browse the list of <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatm">Links to Boat Builders</A> in our Boating Links Section. It is the most extensive list of Boat Builder links available on the internet. You can learn more about some of your existing customers, learn more about the specific needs of some customers you wish you had, and learn about some potential customers you didn't even know existed. <p>

If you are a <b>Boat Builder</b>, you may want to browse the list of Links to Boat Builders to see what your competition is up to and to see how your website compares to theirs.<p>

If you are a <b>Boat Dealer</b>, you can browse the same list and see who has the most exciting boats for your customers and perhaps develop some new relationships with builders that are better meeting your needs. <p>
<hr>

Our <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatingm">Boating Magazines</A> section of the Boat Links page has a link to a media page covering over 270 boating magazines. It provides circulation and advertising rate data for boating magazines by country. The  Boating Magazines section also lists several on-line boating magazines and provides links to web sites for printed boating magazines as well.<p>
<hr>


The bottom of the Other Useful Links page lists a number of newsgroups in the marine area. You might especially want to monitor the recboats group to see how your products are being discussed by end users. You can also answer marketing questions boater pose there. Often they are asking about the differences between two products in the same product line. Do not try to advertise your product there or you will get yelled at and be considered an idiot for the rest of your life. Newsgroups are very strongly against advertising in their posts. <p>
<hr>

<h3><b>Other Areas of the Site</b></h3>

Our <a href="../../folders/show/show.htm">Boat Shows Folder</A> has links to <b>web sites established by the London International Boat Show and the Paris Boat Show.</b> Both web sites are fantastic. They contain a great deal of information about the show in multiple languages including layouts of the pavilions and area attractions. If you are supporting U.S. boat shows, encourage them to view these web sites and respond appropriately. For minimal dollars, large U.S. shows could multiply their attendance by a factor of 10 or more by providing materials for the online audience.<p>


<hr>

Some new product opportunities are discussed on our <a href="../../invent/invrbbi.htm">RBBI Inventions Page</A>. They are posted here for the world to see, so you better "get on them in a hurry."<p>
<hr>

The <a href="../recb/recb.htm">rec.boats newsgroup FOLDER</A> contains some of the newsgroup messages we thought to  be of special interest to the industry. One great example is the two stroke oil discussions. It costs a great deal to do consumer research. Here are your customers talking to each other about their likes, dislikes, and how they see the industry. All you have to do is respond with the proper products and marketing programs.<p>
<hr>


There is a Marketing Section of the <a href="../../news/editor.htm">Editorial Page</A> on the Industry News Section that discusses some of the areas of marketing that we think need greater development. We encourage you to read it and would be glad to hear your comments.<p>
<hr>

<h3><b>Potential Marketing Opportunities</b></h3>

<h4><b>Advertising Specialty Item (Blinking Button)</b></h4><p>

Business Week 21 Oct 1996 issue, page ENT 28 has a story titled, "When Pushing the Right Buttons Isn't Enough" about Edward D. "Buz" Lewis and his company called Buztronics. They make pin on "campaign type buttons" with a battery and a blinking light in them. The buttons can be in special shapes (cards, beer bottles, etc) and are very popular in Japan. The article mentions there are 5 other competitors in this "blinking button" industry. The concept might be adaptable to many different campaigns, but one jumps out in our minds.<p>

Attn: <b>Mercury Marine / MerCruiser </b>- can you imagine a round black campaign style button with the <b>Black Scorpion</b> on it with two flashing red eyes ???  Seems like an awesome potential application of the product to us. People would kill each other at boat shows for them. We looked up Buztronics using our Office Tools page and found the contact info:

<h4><b>Chinese Immigrants </b></h4><p>

The Wall Street Journal had an article titled, "Influx of Immigrants Adds New Vitality to Housing Market" on page 1 of its Thursday October 10, 1996 issue. It describes how the wave of newcomers to the U.S. in the 80's from not only China, but also South Korea, Vietnam, India, the former Soviet Union, Mexico, and Peru is now turning into a wave of home buyers in the 1990's. Many of the Chinese people are now quite affluent and are purchasing very expensive homes in Southern California. <p>

The top two dozen gateway cities contain two thirds of these foreign arrivals. These cities include: Metropolitan Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, and Washington D.C..  Nationally, as the baby boomers are leaving the home buying ages, the baby bust group was expected to cause a considerable slow down in housing starts. The large influx of immigrants has helped to reduce this downturn.<p>

The article explains that in Southern California some areas are being specifically developed for them and their culture. It explains several special steps being taken to accommodate them: hiring Chinese speaking salesmen, using Budist Monks to bless subdivisions, removing the number "4" (makes them think of death) from housing and street numbers, fountains symbolize prosperity, they like water tanks, extra cooking exhaust vents to handle Chinese cooking, and stairways the angle away from the front door (so the luck won't run out). <p>

<i> Perhaps this affluent and concentrated group of new home buyers would also be potential boat buyers? If you are in the area of one of these developments it might be worth visiting with some of them and seeing what it might take to interest them in boating.</i>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Information</b></h3>

<h4><b> Advertise on RBBI website</b></h4><p>

Here is a self serving idea - You might want to place an add on this website. It gives Drive Manufacturers the opportunity to be daily in front of the Boat Builders who are using this resource. It gives Boat Builders the opportunity to be daily in front of the Boat Dealers using this resource. Magazines are flipped through and thrown away. These adds will be seen again and again. Boat Dealers can be in front of the hundreds of end user boaters who browse through here on a daily basis. If your interested check out our <a href="../../sponsors/adinfo.htm">Sponsor Information Page</A><p>

<h4><b> Evaluate Another Industry</b></h4><p>

Several of you have considered expanding your product lines into new areas, purchasing other businesses, etc. If you want to evaluate another industry and learn more about it, we have a <a href="../../../industry/howto/search.htm">"How to Learn About an Industry or Company"</A> page on a sister web site that can greatly help you organize your thoughts. It also can be very helpful in learning about potential suppliers or distributors.<p>
<hr>



<h4><b>Annual Corporate Reports</b></h4><p>

A lot of general information about the industry is available in the annual corporate reports of the large players in the industry. They have a bunch of "glitzy photos" and then provide some hard statistics on the industry and compare their current performance to last years. They also have a "Letter from the President" describing why things are up or down and their view of the future. Annual Reports can be very interesting. You do need to remember that the numbers are usually correct, but the words are always slanted in their favor. <p>

Here are some addresses of some of the majors. You can just write them and request a copy of their current annual corporate report and they will send you one for free. The reports for the past year are normally out in April of the current year. OMC ends it year with September so its new reports are out around the first of the year. The most relevant annual reports are from people tied only to the boating industry (OMC 1st, Brunswick 2nd). The other reports are interesting but spend a lot of coverage on the other activities of the corporation. The Japanese companies in the industry are mostly quite diversified and it is also difficult to get an English copy of their reports. <p>

<pre>
Brunswick Corporation
1 North Field Court
Lake Forest IL 60045-4811

Outboard Marine Corporation
100 Sea Horse Drive
Waukegan IL 6085

Volvo Investor Relations
535 Madison Ave
New York NY 10022
</pre>

The basic data in the annual reports and the security exchange filings made during the year by those companies filing electronically (Brunswick and OMC) are available on-line in the EDGAR System. Their are some links to the EDGAR System in the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#financial">Financial Links</A> segment of our Other Useful Links page.<p>

<h4><b>Case Study of Boating Industry</b></h4><p>

A nice general discussion about the boating industry and its various elements appears as a Case Study in the book,<u> Recreation Business</u>, by John R. Kelly in 1985 and published by MacMillan Publishing Company. The case, "The Complex Market for Boats" begins on page 317 and ends on page 323.

<H3><bold>Discussion of Links</h3></bold>

First, we encourage you to become familiar with many of the links on the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm">Other Useful Links Page</A>. Review the list of topics at the top of the page and be sure to surf the following segments: Corrosion, Engineering / Technology, Engineering Components, Engineering Organizations, Environment / EPA, Hydrodynamics, Manufacturing, NASA, and Patents. Especially visit those sites with the <img src="../../links/great.gif"> label.  If you are having trouble finding good technical people for your staff you might want to try some of the online job banks in the Jobs / Labor segment of the Other Useful Links section.<p>
<hr>


<b><h4>Boating Links</h4></b></a><p>

Also the Boating Links area includes the most complete list of <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatm">Boat Builder Links</A> available anywhere. This gives you an opportunity to see the latest boats available and their designs. The Boating Links area also includes links to the <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatdm">Drive Manufacturer sites</A>. Here you can learn the latest specs available from the engine and drive suppliers to the industry. <p>

<hr>

<b><h4>Finding New Suppliers</h4></b></a><p>

If your interested in finding new suppliers or finding technical information from existing suppliers be sure to check out the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#engineeringc">Engineering Component Links</A> segment of the Other Useful Links area. The links to Thomas Register and Industry Net will prove invaluable. Industry Net is a collection of over 4000 suppliers with a huge wealth of technical information about their components online. </A>

<hr>

<b><h4>Plastics</h4></b></a><p>

If you happen to work in the plastics the<a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#plastics"> Plastics Links</A> segment of the Other Useful Links section can put technical specs on your desktop from most of the industries leading suppliers. It also provides a lot of technical plastic design information.<p>

<hr>

<b><h4>Corrosion</h4></b></a><p>

Many of you work with corrosion and try to minimize its effects on your products. There are three exceptional web sites that gather professionals and vendors together in this field. <b>FinishingCom, Metal Finishing, and Paint/Coatings Net </b>are all exceptional resources in this field. There are links to them in the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#corrosion">Corrosion Links</a> segment of our Other Useful Links page.<p>

<hr>


<H3><bold>Discussion of Other Areas of the Site</h3></bold>

If your firm is looking for some inventions to develop or you are considering developing some inventions yourself, be sure to check out our <a href="../../invent/invent.htm">Inventors and Inventions Corner</A>. The section includes several <b>new boating product ideas</b> available for development.<p>


Our <a href="../../folders/tech/tech.htm">Technologies Folder</A> is divided into Product, Process, Business Technologies, and Basic Research.  You should especially watch the Product and Process areas for new ideas. <p>

Our <a href="../../folders/pat/pat.htm"> Patents Folder</a> includes information on significant patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the industry. It also reviews and posts the most recent patents that may be of interest to you. <p>

If you do any work with fuels. lubes and oils, you will be amazed at the information available in the <a href="../../folders/fuel/fuel.htm">Fuels, Lubes, and Oils Folder</A>. Be sure to check out the link to the Fuels, Lubes, & Oils segment of the Other Useful Links Section and read the Gasoline FAQ (frequently asked questions). Its awesome. <p>

<a name=newsg></A>
<h4><b>Boating Newsgroups</b></h4><p>

We have taken a few of the conversations in the boating newsgroups and reprinted them in our <a href="../../folders/recb/recb.htm">rec.boats FOLDER</A>. Here is a chance to hear the "voice of the customer" as he or she discusses their needs and problems.<p>

Near the bottom of the <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#newsgrp">Boating Links Page</a>, several newsgroups dealing with boating are listed. We encourage you to visit  the rec.boats newsgroup. You can see how your products are being discussed by the end users. Before you jump in and make some comments; first, no advertising is allowed in the newsgroups. Don't try to toot your products horn here or you will get an earful. Second, before trying to help with some technical problems, you might try to get your firm to agree on how to handle field problems throughout this media. It probably makes most sense to have them referred to your Service Dept. Usually they don't want to call somebody, they want on-line help. You might refer them to your own web site if you have basic service information posted there or you might have a bulletin board for posting service questions there? Some of the majors think there could be some potential legal liabilities involved in letting every "half-cocked engineer" reply to service questions on the net. You can also run into difficulties with your service department. They know the history of the machine and the people involved. You may make promises or suggestions that are our of line with their policies. Sometimes end users try to approach a company from several angles to try to get the best response (free replacement), they just keep asking different people until they get the answer they want. We are just suggesting that your company decide how it will respond to newsgroup posted field problem questions and respond to them. Also occasionally somebody's products are being slammed or called into question. Your firm might want to have a plan for responding when this kind of thing gets out of hand. Usually it involves straightening out some facts or explaining why some decisions were made. To date, most firms just "lay low" till it blows over, but I think they are missing some great marketing opportunities to back up their products.<p>


<b><h4>Engineering Use of the Web</h4></b></a><p>

The October 18th 1996 issue of Machine Design has a great landmark article titled, <a href="../../folders/net/change.htm">"The Web Ships Up Waves Of Change"</A>, that does a great job of illustrating some of the new uses of web technology by management and engineers.<p>


<b><h4>Invention of the Stern Drive</h4></b></a><p>

The Patent Folder has a great story in it about the <a href="../../folders/pat/isd.htm">Invention of the Stern Drive</A>. The background includes an internal conspiracy, several managers rejecting the new technology, and is an example of how long it can take for an idea to flourish. Many feel the stern drive itself is now in the mature position and some "new technology" may be knocking on its door. Its a great time to be alive!<p>

<h3><b>Discussion of Links</b></h3>

Be sure and browse the Benchmarking / Re-Engineering,  Engineering Components, and Purchasing / Procurement / Acquisitions segments of the Other Useful Links section. Be sure to expecially visit those sites labeled <img src="../../links/great.gif">. The Benchmarking / Re-Engineering segment has some good links on revitalizing your purchasing dept. The Engineering Components segment has links to the <b>Thomas Register</b> and to<b> IndustryNet</b>. If you are not familiar with IndustryNet you should take some time to become familiar with their site. It contains over 4000 industrial suppliers and over 20 industrial associations. Select "On-Line Market Place" begin searching for a particular product on IndustryNet.<p>

You will also find the <a href="../../links/tools.htm">Office Tools</A> section to be of great use to you in finding phone numbers, addresses, local maps, zip codes, area codes, and all those other things your always trying to lookup. <p>


<h3><b>Other Areas of the Site</b></h3>

If you are looking for some help in the coating  industries, there are three exceptional web sites in that area that also host vendors in those fields. <b>FinishingCom, Metal Finishing, and Paint/Coatings Net </b>. Links to these great sites are provided in the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#corrosion">Corrosion Links</A> segment of our Other Useful Links page. <p>
<hr>



<h3><b>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Ideas</b></h3>

If you want to evaluate a potential supplier we have a <a href="../../../industry/howto/search.htm">"How to Learn About an Industry or a Specific Company"</A> page on a sister web site that will help you do it in an organized manner. It also handles many of the tasks online. <p>


<hr>

<h4><b>Site Sponsors</b></h4><p>

Also, please remember the sponsors of this web site. They have helped make all this information available to your company and are only a <a href="../../sponsors/sponsors.htm">"click away" </A>when you need them. If you already deal with them or contact them as a result of seeing them here, please thank them for their sponsorship of this site. If you have some major suppliers who aren't currently sponsoring a page on this web site, you might want to mention the opportunity to them. Tell them you are seeing their competition daily when you use this resource to do your work and you were wondering where they were.  That will get their attention. The more sponsors we can line up, the better this site will be. Its as simple as that. We appreciate any help you can give us by mentioning us to your suppliers. <p>

<h3><b>Discussion of Links</b></h3><p>

We suggest you browse the "Other Useful Links" Page and especially the Corrosion, Recalls (Product Safety Recalls), Service  (Be sure to check out the online magazine, "Managing Service Quality Journal"), Tech Writing, and Travel & Food sections. The Boating Links Page can familiarize  you with the various Boat Builders and competitive products.<p>


<h3><b>Discussion of Other Areas of the Site</B></h3><p>

The November 18, 1996 Wall Street Journal had a nice article about Freightliner, titled, <a href="freightl.htm">"Getting in Gear"</a> , and their expanding use of computers. Several of the applications are in the customer service area. They have a "killer app" (killer application) of connecting an "ECM (engine control module) like" diagnostics module to a cell phone to forward previously collected and real time data to diagnosticians when the driver begins to think something might be wrong. The voice link allows them to question the driver and offer suggestions. <i>Could this reduce the sunday afternoon dead boat motor blues???</i><p>




<hr>
Several  on-line bulletin board type <b>newsgroups</b> discuss boating activities, problems, questions, etc. We have captured a few of the conversations and posted them in our <a href="../../folders/recb/recb.htm">rec.boats FOLDER</A>. We have a <a href="../eng/eng.htm#newsg">discussion</A> at the Engineering Desk about the need to establish a procedure to respond to field problems and other situations in the newsgroups.<p>

<hr>

The<b> Net Folder </b>will be investigating ways of expanding the use of internet tools in the boating industry. We will be looking into the use of webcams by dealers and mechanics to provide live 2-way video to telephone customer service reps which will both help the reps gain a rapport with the  people involved, but will allow them to actually see the situation first hand. Portable PC's make it possible to capture Quick Cam video (including sound) while conducting on water testing for transmission later. Cellular modems allow those "on water" videos to be broadcast live. Your best service people can handle more calls by getting to the problems quicker and reduce the need for travel.<p>

<hr>
The Tech Writing Links on the Other Useful Links Page may be able to put you in touch with the software vendors you use for converting your manuals between various electronic formats and publishing them.<p>

<hr>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Ideas</b></h3>

Here we plan to discuss putting service and parts manuals on the net, allowing end users to e-mail your customer service reps with problems and have them respond. Providing more information for basic problems on the net will reduce the number of service calls. We will be following other industries and looking at how their customer service people use the net. For starters, you can read the <a href="../../folders/net/net.htm#fork">Fork Lift Story</A> in the Net Folder.<p>

We will post items here regarding litigation in the boat building and boating industry, including information about some boating accidents that resulted in litigation. Information about high profile boating accidents as well as some local boating accidents (not info about litigation) will be located in our <a href="../../folders/acc/acc.htm">Boating Accidents Folder</A>. That folder also contains boating accident statistics.

<hr>


<h3><bold>Discussion Of Links</bold></h3>

The U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Navigation Central web page has links to boat recalls and boating accident statistics. A link to it is provided on our <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatings">Boating Safety segment</A> of the Other Useful Links page.<p>


Be sure to browse the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#law">Law Links</A> segment of our Other Useful Links page. Especially visit those sites marked <img src="../../links/great.gif"><p>

The internet has <A HREF="http://www.boatman.com/maritime/acc.html">Boating Accident Database</A> that can be used to find information on specific accidents.<p>

<h3><bold>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Information</bold></h3>


<h4><b>Temporary Workers</b></h4><p>

An October 14, 1996 Wall Street Journal article describing the recent Microsoft class-action lawsuit which was lost by them is in the <a href="../mgmt/mgmt.htm#temps">Management Desk</A> section of this web site. It appears that it would be a good time to review the use of temporary workers at your sites and determine how closely their use meets with federal and state laws. <p>
<hr>



<h4><b>Legal Books</b></h4><p>

Some books in the area of Recreational Boating Law are:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Recreational Boating Law</i> Edited by C. Peter Theut, New York: Matthew Bender, 1992. 1090 pages.<p>

<li><i>Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation</i>  by Roy Scott Hickman.1996. Available from Lawyers and Judges Publishing Company.  600 pages. More info is available on their web site. A link to their site is provided in the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#bookstores">Bookstores Segment</A> of our Other Useful Links Page.<p>

<li><i>An Attorney's Guide to Forensic Engineering in the Maritime Environment</i> by Ephraim F. Kaufman. 1992. Available from Lawyers and Judges Publishing Company. 79 pages. More info is available on their web site (see above book).<p>

</ul>
<hr>

<h4><b>ALR Annotations</b></h4><p>

The American Legal Reporter (ALR) has published some excellent summaries (annotations) of certain areas of boating. They begin with a specific case and then extensively cover prior litigation in that general area.  As you look up these references be sure to look in the back of the books and examine the "Supplements" for more current information of these annotations. Some of these are:<p>

<ul>
<li> Liability of owner or operator of powered pleasure boat for injuries to swimmer or bather struck by boat. 98 ALR3d pgs. 1121-1135.
<li> Liability for injuries to or death of water skiers. 8 ALR3d pgs. 665-674.
<li> Products liability, sufficiency of evidence to support product misuse defense in actions concerning automobiles, boats, aircraft, and other vehicles. 63 ALR3d pgs. 1-94. In this annotation, the specific case happens to be a boat.
<li> Products liability: liability of manufacturer or seller for injury or death caused by defect in boat or its parts, supplies, or equipment. 1ALR4d pgs. 394-430.
</ul>


<hr>

<h4><b>Propeller Cases</b></h4><p>

One area of continued litigation is propellers. One major reference in this area is a model trial put together by the American Jurisprudence. It is their Model Trial #41 and was published by the Lawyers Co-operative Publishing Company in 1990. The title is "Motorboat Propeller Injury Accidents" and the author is Stephen R. Bolden. The Library of Congress card catalog number is 64-56647. They also published a supplement in August of 1994. This book provides almost 200 pages of information on how to prepare for a trial in this area.<p>

Some typical cases in the area of propeller injuries are:<br>
<ul>
<li>FITZPATRICK v. MADONNA and Outboard Marine Corp, Appeal of OUTBOARD MARINE CORPORATION.  623 Atlantic Reporter 2nd Series, pgs. 322-327.
<li>PREE v. The BRUNSWICK CORPORATION. 983 Federal Reporter 2nd Series (8th Cir. 1993), pages 863-868.

<h3><b>Discussion of Links</b></h3>

We suggest you become familiar with the EPA,  EPA Mobile Sources (it leads to non-road and on to marine sources), the TTN2000 site, Right To Know, CARB, and Federal Clean Air Act web sites in the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#environment">Environment / EPA Segment</A> of our Other Useful Links page. <p>

We would also encourage you to browse the Bookstores, Laws, and Libraries segments of our Other Useful Links page. You may need to utilize some of the tools they provide to find copies of regulations. <p>
<hr>

The City Hall area on the <a href="http://www.sea-doo.com/sd/cityhall/index.html">Sea-Doo</A> web site does an excellent job of promoting awareness of PWC legislation and informing the public how they can be involved. <p>
<hr>


<h3><b>Other Areas of This Site</B></h3>

The June 1996 EPA Standards for New Nonroad Spark Ignition Marine Engines are available in our <a href="../../ftp/ftp.htm#epaj96">FTP Section</A>.<p>
<hr>

The NTDB (National Trade Data Bank) published a report a few years ago on the Marine Engine Emission regulation situation in Europe. A <a href="../mkt/internat/ntdb/europe.htm">copy of the report</A> is on our NTDB page in the International Section of the Marketing Desk.

<hr>


One growing area of concern has been styrene emissions during the forming of boat hulls. We have some information on some patents in this area in the our <a href="../../folders/pat/pat.htm#styrene">Patents Folder</a>. Also the NMMA (National Marine Manufacturers Assn. is closely following the issues. The August 19, 1993 issue of their "Inter/port" newsletter describes the regulation tracking system they have in place. <p>
<hr>

We copied a <a href="boatem.htm">page from the CARB site</A> that shows their 1980's plans and methodology to attack the emissions problems. It also includes some good early references and data.<p>

<hr>

For actual methods of reducing emissions, be sure to check out our Patent and Technology Folders.<p>
<hr>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Ideas</b></h3>

<h4><b>Two Stroke Engines</b></h4><p>

Currently the industry is heavily focused on the 2-stroke engine emission problems and most  manufacturers are expending a great deal of money and effort to bring that portion of the market into compliance with pending federal regulations. Most U.S. Environmental Regulations pertaining to marine engines can be found on-line. Foreign countries are beginning to use the net to a greater extent. It seems logical that the internet will have an increasing importance in the development of environmental regulations. It allows world wide posting of the pending regulations and can allow everyone the opportunity to post comments. It would be nice if the EPA or some government agency would set up a single reference desk with pointers to the engine emissions regulations in other countries.
<hr>

<h4><b>TTN and TTN2000</b></h4><p>

Before the World Wide Web portion of the internet was available, EPA information was being passed around on a telnet site called TTN (Technical Transfer Network). That site still exists, but all of the old info can now be reached on the web at the TTN2000 site. At the TTN2000 site, select TTN BBSWeb, and then select Gateway to TTN Technical Areas. Most of what you will be looking for will probably be in the OMS (Office of Mobile Sources). If you are looking for some older info that is not available on the EPA web site, give TTN2000 a try. If you want to take a ride back to "how it was" try the telnet link on the TTN2000 site and go to the old TTN BBS.<p>
<hr>

<h4><b>Printed Reference Works</b></h4><p>


Some printed resources that may be of interest to you are:<br>
<ul>

<li>"Worldwide Engine Emission Standards and How to Meet Them" a collection of 24 technical papers presented at an Institution of Mechanical Engineers Seminar (An England Association). This document is in the Oklahoma State University Library and its call number is 029.2500218 W927<p>

<li>"Access EPA" information for accessing all the various areas of the EPA and many of their on-line databases.  <a href="http://www.fedworld.gov/ntis/yellowbk/1nty262.htm">A page of information about "Access EPA"</A> is available at the Fedworld Web site. Oklahoma State University has a copy at call # FE211 A165 EP35.<p>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4><b>Regulation Path</b></h4><p>

For those who may not understand all the terminology and references, here is a quick explanation of how a regulation proceeds after it is passed.<p>

Regulations that are passed are printed in the Federal Register, then they are codified (put into a legal format) and are printed in the CRF (Code of Federal Regulations). The CFR is divided into 50 sections by topic.<p>

The United States Code (USC) is a compilation of current federal laws of a general and permanent nature. It is also divided into 50 sections by topic (but they are different than the 50 sections used by the CFR).

Links to all of these sources are provided in the Law Links segment of the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#law">"Other Useful Links page"</A>.<p>

<H3>Brunswick Corp. To Buy Igloo Hldgs Inc. For $154M Cash</H3>
<p><font size="-1"><i></b><font size="-1">Dow Jones News Services  19 November 1996</font><br>
<b></i></font></p>
<p>LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Brunswick Corp. (BC) signed a definitive contract to acquire closely held Igloo Holdings Inc. for about $154 million cash. In a press release, Brunswick Corp. said Igloo will become part of the company's Brunswick Outdoor Recreation Group.
The transaction is scheduled to close in early 1997, subject to customary closing conditions. Igloo, Houston, makes ice chests, beverage coolers and thermoelectric cooler/warmer products. Igloo has annual sales of about $150 million.<p>




<h4>Igloo Holdings Inc. Agrees to be Bought By Company</h4><p>

<pre>
Wall Street Journal 20 November 1996
</pre><p>

Brunswick Corp. said it definitively agreed to pay $154 million to acquire closely held Igloo Holdings Inc., a Houston manufacturer of ice chests and beverage coolers. Brunswick, a maker of boats and recreational products, called the purchase part of a strategy to expand its presence in "active recreation consumer products."  In pursuit of that "refocusing," it has this year adjusted its boat-manufacturing holdings and paid an aggregated $318 million to acquire Roadmaster Industries Inc.'s camping-products division, bicycle business and its line of sleds and wagons. Brunswick said its acquisition of Igloo, which has annual sales of about $150 million, will complement its current line of recreational and camping offerings.<p>

<h4>Igloo Warms Up to New Ownership</h4><p>

A lengthy story in the November 20, 1996 Houston Chronicle titled <a href="stories/igloo.htm">"Igloo Products Corp Signs Deal With Brunswick Corp" </A> provides historical and current information about Igloo.<p>

<h3>Brunswick Acquires Domain Name - BRUNCORP.COM</h3><p>

While checking some domain names in WHOIS today (13 Nov 1996) I discovered Brunswick has acquired <b>bruncorp.com </b>as a domain name on 11-Oct-96. I personally contacted Brunswick MIS (Management Information Systems) Dept.  in December 1994 and suggested they register brunswick.com and several other brunswick trademark names as domain names.  They did not register them and as a result, <b>brunswick.com</b> and several other brunswick names were lost to other firms.  Has the sleeping giant discovered the internet?<p>

<h3>Toyota Low Cost Engine</h3><p>

The November 11, 1996 Wall Street Journal has an article titled "Toyota to Unveil Low-Cost Engine Next Month". The article says Toyota claims to have developed an engine with 1/3  fewer parts that can be produced for 1/3 lower cost. This would make their small car engines cost to produce drop from about $600 to $400.  In the "nickel and dime" automotive cost cutting world this is incredible. This has been followed by a 25 November 1996 Business  Week article titled "Toyota May Have the Little Engine That Could". Both articles are available in our <a href="../folders/engn/engn.htm#toyota">Engine Development Folder</A>.<p>

<h3>Florida Executes Killer of Evinrude Heiress</h3>
<pre>
Stillwater Newspress 22 Oct 1996
STARKE, Fla. (AP) story
</pre>
A man was executed in the electric chair for kidnapping and killing an heiress to the Evinrude motor fortune after stealing $134 from the convenience store where she worked. <p>

John Earl Bush, 38, was put to death Monday night for the 1982 slaying of 18-year-old Frances Julia Slater.<p>

She was working the night shift at a Stuart convenience store when four robbers entered and kidnapped her. They drove 13 miles, stabbed and shot her, and pushed her out of the vehicle.<p>

...Ms. Slater was the granddaughter of actress Frances Langford an <b>Ralph Evinrude</b>, founder of the marine motor company that bears his name. Although her family was wealthy, Ms. Slater planned to invest in convenience stores and worked at one to learn the business...

Brunswick Corp. Closes Bike Plant in Delavan, Wisconsin
</H3>

<pre>The Wisconsin State Journal via Knight-Ridder/Tribune via Individual Inc. 
The Wisconsin State Journal Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News</pre>
<P>
<b>Oct. 9--</b>Brunswick Corp. will close the Roadmaster bicycle plant in Delavan by
mid-December, throwing about 450 people out of work, Brunswick said Tuesday.</P>
<P>
The jobs, but not the employees, are being moved to another Roadmaster plant
that Brunswick owns in Olney, Ill.</P>
<P>
Shutdown of the plant will begin Nov. 27 and be finished Dec. 11, said Gary
Dollahon, Brunswick spokesman.</P>
<P>
The company said it is consolidating bike manufacturing in Olney to reduce the
cost of its bike operation.</P>
<P>
"This is just good business sense," said Jim Dawson, president of Brunswick's
Outdoor Recreation Group, based in Tulsa, Okla. "Moving the Delavan operation to
Roadmaster's primary location in Olney is simply the best use of the extra space
and existing structure there. The closing has nothing to do with the quality of
the products or the quality of the work force."</P>
<P>
Brunswick, with corporate heaquarters in Lake Forest, Ill., bought Roadmaster's
bicycle division and its Flexible Flyer line of sleds and wagons about a month
ago for $198 million.</P>
<P>
"The overhead structure was in place, so it made sense to consolidate operations
and save millions in costs," said Dollahon.</P>
<P>
Brunswick, a 150-year-old company that started by making billiard tables, also
includes Mercury Outboard and Mercruiser boats in its Outdoor Recreation Group.
Brunswick has annual sales of about $3 billion, said Dollahon.</P>
<P>
Roadmaster makes a full line of bicycles, which are assembled domestically from
imported parts. The Delavan plant makes 24- and 26-inch mountain bikes including
some store brand bikes, said Dollahon.</P>
<P>
After the Roadmaster sale, Delavan workers said they were promised the plant
wouldn't close, said Heath Goff, a paint line group leader and representative of
the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, which unionized the
Delavan plant about a year ago.</P>
<P>
"We heard a rumor of it, but every time we asked the company, it said 'No, it's
not going to happen,' " said Goff. "We feel like we've been cheated all the way
around."</P>
<P>
Goff said the first official word came Tuesday in a five-minute written
statement read to workers by a company official.</P>
<P>
Goff and Angel Godina, a forklift operator and member of the union's bargaining
committee, said they believe the formation of the union had an impact on the
company's decision.</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people who think it was like that too," said Godina.</P>
<P>
Mel Kent, vice president of human relations for Roadmaster, said no compensation
package has been worked out for all of the employees. They are not being offered
jobs in Olney, where 350 to 400 jobs will be added to the 1,400 people who
presently work there.</P>
<P>
Goff said it's too early to say what workers will do, but many are talking about
finding jobs elsewhere before the plant closes. Godina said many workers were
angry and upset by the announcement, but are not panicking; Walworth County has
a lot of well-paying jobs to be found, he said.</P>
<P>
Trek, another bicycle maker, opened a plant in Whitewater in June, but is not
currently hiring large numbers of people to staff it, said Trek communications
director Jackson Lynch.<p>

<H3>Outboard Marine Stake Is Acquired By Investor Group</H3>
Dow Jones News Service ~ August 23, 1996 ~ 6:03 am EST
<B>  By Michael J. McCarthy</B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</FONT><P>  A group including activist investment firm Greenway Partners LP said it holds an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corp. and may hold discussions with management or other shareholders about the company.<P>  Greenway Partners, based in New York, said the boating company's stock, which has been slumping, is "undervalued." In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Outboard closed at $16.25, up 75 cents on the day but near its yearlong low of $14.38. In the past year, Outboard has traded as high as $22.63.<P>  Two years earlier, Greenway successfully pushed U.S. Shoe Corp. to a breakup. And earlier this year, Greenway, led by Alfred D. Kingsley, a former associate of takeover strategist Carl Icahn, proposed similar breakups at Woolworth Corp. and Unisys Corp.<P>  Greenway wouldn't comment beyond a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it recently acquired about 1.7 million Outboard Marine common shares for $14.54 to $18.75 a share. In the filing, Greenway said it will "closely monitor developments" at Outboard Marine.<P>  In Waukegan, Ill., Outboard officials didn't return phone calls.<P>  For its fiscal third quarter ended June 30, Outboard Marine reported lower sales and a loss of $3.6 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $28 million. In announcing the lower results, Outboard Marine said it planned to "re-engineer" its businesses to lower costs and improve profit margins.<P>  Late last month, Outboard said it planned to spend $100 million in an eight-year program to remake its outboard engine lines. The changes, which will improve fuel efficiency and cut exhaust output, will allow the company to comply with new emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.<P>  Under the new regulations, marine-engine makers must reduce certain motor emissions by 75% by 2006. According to the EPA, the rule is expected to add $700 to the price of the average outboard engine, which generally costs $5,000 to $6,000.<P>

Which search engine to use  become a matter of personal preference and the exact task at hand. <b>Yahoo </b>is the time honored favorite for general searches and coming up with relevant links. It is more of a directory of groups of sites than a search engine. <b>Hotbot </b>and <b>Alta Vista</b> seem to be currently leading the pack of true search engines. They will search for specific terms and the responses may or may not be relevant. I also frequently use <b>Lycos</b>, <b>Excite,</b> and <b>WebCrawler</b>. I suggest you give them a try and see which ones work best for you. The additional engines are for special cases, searching more than one database, or have additional capabilities.<p>

<b><h4>High Profile Accidents</h4></b>

We will cover the recent high profile boating accidents here plus some of the local accidents. The discussion of litigation of boating accidents is thoroughly covered at our <a href="../../desks/legal/legal.htm">Legal Desk</A>. The Legal Desk also provides access to boating safety statistics. This page will focus on the accidents themselves. These high profile accidents could give the population a fear or concern of boating. This site will provide some basic press coverage type information about them to allow further research by others. Below the accident reports we present some safety / accident data and links.<p>

<b>The recent high profile accidents have been:</b><br>
<ul>

<li>Saturday December 14, 1996 <A href="bright/bright.htm"><b>Bright Field freightliner </b></A> hits shopping mall in New Orleans LA. This site provides very extensive coverage of this disaster.<p>

<li>Saturday August 17, 1996 <a href="seaworld/seaworld.htm"><b>Sea World boat </b></A>goes into grandstand in Aurora Ohio.<p>

</ul> 

<hr>

<h4><bold>Discussion Of Links</bold></h4>

The U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Navigation Central web page has links to boat recalls and boating accident statistics. A link to it is provided on our <a href="../../links/boatl.htm#boatings">Boating Safety segment</A> of the Other Useful Links page.<p>

The internet has <A HREF="http://www.boatman.com/maritime/acc.html">Boating Accident Database</A> that can be used to find information on specific accidents.<p>

A <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/cgi-bin/dec/wwwfetch?/sgml/fh00862e_pr101.sgml">Canadian Government web site</A> provides a number of US boating accident statistics.<p>

<hr>


<h4><b>Boating Safety Data</b></h4><p>

Four studies that provide a lot of boating safety data are:<br>

<ul>

<li> The annual report on the boating industry in the January issue of Boating Industry magazine. The January 1996 issue reported that boating fatalities dropped 2% in 1994 to 784. Pointing out the need to wear PFD's, 613 of those deaths were from drownings, with capsizings and "falls overboard" as leading causes.<p>

Accidents increased 9% to 6,916 and injuries were up 14.7% in 1994. Collisions and "falls overboard" were also the leading causes of accidents and injuries. Personal Water Craft accounted for 1,338 injuries, open boats for 1,672 injuries, and cabin boats for 612 injuries.<p>

Below is a scan of the graphic used in the Boating Industry report. It is based on Coast Guard data.<p>

Several studies have been done to determine the economic impact of boating in certain areas of the country and also the economic impact the factories associated with the industry have on their communities. As certain elements of the industry have came under fire it could be very useful to present some of these economic studies to the public to show how important boating is to your area.<p>

The basic methods for doing economic impact studies have been established by the government which also supplies several excellent resources and examples. The basic concept is there are 3 types of impact. <p>

<b>DIRECT IMPACT</b> - direct expenses by those involved in the activity or industry. For boaters it would be gas, oil, new boat, trailer, food, lodging, boating fees, boat registrations, etc. For factories it would be things like new buildings, tooling, raw materials, labor, and taxes paid into the area under study. Direct Impacts are immediate consequences of economic activity.<p>

<b>INDIRECT IMPACT</b> - come from economic activities attributable to the industry, but are not considered part of the industry. For boaters it could be items purchased by convenience stores for sale to boaters. Gasoline and oil purchased by stations for sale to boaters, advertising purchased by lodges to bring in boaters. For factories it could be raw materials purchased by their suppliers, supplier labor costs, community store employees needed to sell goods to factory workers.<p>

<b> INDUCED IMPACT</b> - these are the multiplier effects as the money continues to turn over inside the area being studied. For example, the local stores pay their people who then spend a portion of their income in the community to others who in turn do the same. The money eventually leaks out of the area being studied  after several rounds.<p>

The total economic impact is the sum of all 3 of these impacts. Total Economic Impact = Direct Impact + Indirect Impact + Induced Impact.<p>

The thing that makes the studies easy, is that the government has already identified all the various industries and worked out the various impacts in different regions of the country. This RIM (Regional Impact Model) data is available in the Government Books listed below.<p>

Regional Input - Output Modeling System (1981)<br
Oklahoma State University Library  Call # ECP276 EC27 R334 IN65<p>

Regional Multipliers (1986) <br>
Oklahoma State University Library Call # ECP276 EC27 R344 MU55<p>

Regional Multipliers (1992)<br>
Oklahoma State University Library Call # ECP276 EC27 R334 MU55 1992<p>

The U.S. Forest Service also has a method called IMPLAN (IMpact Analysis for PLANning). This method was used in the Maryland study below.<p>

Also a technical paper, "Evaluating Alterative Regional Planning Models" by John B. Crihfield and Harrison S. Campbell, Jr. was published in the Spring 1991 issue of <i>Growth and Change</i>. It discussed the application of the RIMS and other models and compares their outputs.<p>

A good local example is the Oklahoma Airport System Economic Impact Study. January 1994. By the Oklahoma Dept. of Transportation and the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission.<p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts and Ideas</h3><p>


<h4>Biodegradable Oil for Boats</h4><p>

The 29 February 1996 Wall Street Journal had a short clip in it about a new biodegradable oil for use in boats. The article appears in its entirety below.<p>
<pre>
Snowmobiles and critters must coexist at Yellowstone National
Park these days. So, the park is selling a new biodegradable oil 
from Conoco Inc., for use in two-cycle engines such as those in
snowmobiles, jet skis and boats. The synthetic lubricant
breaks down easily  and produces fewer emissions, says
Houston-based Conoco.

<h4>Gunnerman A-21 Water based Fuel</h4><p>

Beginning in 1994, a half water and half gasoline fuel (A-21) invented by Rudolph W. Gunnerman began to get some press. He teamed up in a joint venture with Caterpillar and they are continuing to develop the product. We have several references to this venture on our <a href="a-21.htm">A-21 Fuel  Page</A>.<p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Items and Ideas</h3><p>

<h4><B>Know-It-Alls</b></h4><p>

The special technlogy section of the November 18, 1996 Wall Street Journal (pages R28 and R31)  talks about Chief Knowledge Officers, harnessing corporate knowledge, knowlege leveraging consultants and other related areas. It also focuses on the idea of capturing your corporate knowledge and making it available via intranets. That section of the article is reproduced below.

<H4>A New Class of Worker Arises<br>
To Manage Firms' Know-How</H4>

<p>By DAVID BANK

<p>When Gordon Petrash joined Dow Chemical Co. as a young
project engineer, his career goal never was to become the company's
"director of global intellectual asset and capital management."</p>

<p>And later, as a manager of the business that produces Dow products such
as Ziploc bags and Styrofoam, he didn't envision spending his days
convincing group vice presidents about the importance of "visualizing their
knowledge processes."</p>

<p>So when he was asked to take on the new job as the company's knowledge
chief, he agreed only reluctantly, and vowed to move on within two years.
Four years later, however, Mr. Petrash can barely contain his enthusiasm
and is pushing Dow to vastly expand its commitment to "knowledge
management."</p>

<p>"Talk about catching the wave," the 46-year-old Mr. Petrash says from
his office at Dow's headquarters in Midland, Mich. "Companies are
leapfrogging others based on their intellectual assets. If a company is not
addressing these things, it's running a very high risk, because a lot of
other companies are."</p>

<pre>
(the middle of the article is deleted for space and copyright concerns)
</pre>


<p><b>Knowing the Know-How</b></p>
<p>Patents, trademarks and copyrights are easy, however, compared with the
intangible "know-how" that makes a company competitive. In a pilot project
involving three of Dow's businesses, Mr. Petrash brought together heads of
the units, along with research engineers, manufacturing managers, patent
attorneys and marketing teams to identify the 200 to 300 most important
technical processes at Dow. Then, to document the information, the teams
used a template similar to the one used in the application process for
patents.</p>

<p>"This is the know-how we want all of our business guys to have," Mr.
Petrash says. "We're putting it in a very abbreviated form they can quickly
grasp. We're talking one page, the four to five keys to their business. In
many cases, that key know-how is the reason we're in that business."</p>

<p>By the end of the year, Mr. Petrash expects a commitment from Dow's top
executives to expand the project companywide. Then he plans to move on to
capture Dow's marketing knowledge, sales knowledge and customer
knowledge.</p>

<p>"In the end, we want to have all of the key know-how that gives us our
competitive advantage articulated and databased," he says. "Then we can
visualize it. Then we can measure it. Then we can improve it."</p>

<p><i>--Mr. Bank is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's San
Francisco bureau.</i></p>

<h4><B>List of Coming Attractions</b></h4><p>


We will soon discuss some of the more relevant tools (web cams, internet telephones, desktop conferencing, white boards, real time test data sharing, remote control of prototypes or testing, real time sound, etc) and how these might be applied in this industry in both intranet and internet applications. Also, if you want to read ahead, check out the <a href="../../links/netl.htm#weird">Weird Things Connected to the Internet </A> segment of the Webmaster Links page. Try to imagine how you might apply some of these tools and methods to your situation.<p>

Cost is about $700 for the dish and equipment, plus $40 to $130 a month for the service depending upon time of use, plus your normal internet provider connection charges. Download speed is about 10 times faster than conventional modems and the cost is not far from I.S.D.N. but the speed is 3 times faster.<p>

<i>As this service matures it might be a natural for some applications in the boat building industry.</i>

<b><h4>Firefly</h4></b>

The October 7, 1996 issue of Business Week has an article , "Why Firefly Has Mad Ave. Buzzing", beginning on page 100. The article describes the use of psychographic profiles and a special agent software to determine people with similar likes. This site or a similar one might be able to identify potential boaters. For some more info on the article, check the <a href="../../desks/mkt/theory/theory.htm#firefly">Marketing Theory</A> portion of the Marketing Desk.<p>

<b><h4>Fork Lift Factory</h4></b>

The May 17, 1996 Wall Street Journal , "The Front Lines" section by Thomas Petzinger Jr. ran a story titled, "Two Educators Turn a Fork Lift Factory into Corporate School". The story talks of Raymond Corp. which makes some of the smartest and most sophisticated fork lifts. They felt they had too many models (<i>sound familiar?</i>) so they decided to create a universal fork lift stuffed with integrated circuits that could be programmed to fulfill the unique needs of the customer. They were flooded with orders, but when the new forklifts hit the field, "all hell broke loose."<p>

"Customers couldn't begin to keep track of the constantly flashing computer codes. In any practical sense, "When you have a truck that can be infinitely configured, you can't come up with enough code numbers,' Mr. Colquhoun says. Even worse, there were close to 1,000 trained service mechanics expertly trained in everything except how to deal with programmable chips."<p>

"Suddenly the truck was a computer,"Mr. Colquhoun says. "It was a traumatic shock"<p>

They deluged mechanics with new service manuals, so many that they engulfed the cargo bay of the service vans. Mechanics were humiliated and didn't know what to do. A 24 hour help line at the factory didn't help much either, "Now we had two blind men at either end of the line."<p>

Mr. Calquhoun approached Diane Gayeski from Ithaca College. She discovered that some individual mechanics were starting to make some breakthroughs in the field. But, these ideas didn't get heard around the circle, because people kept talking about the problems and not about the solutions. No one was recording the "best practices" that were being discovered. <p>

<b>"The biggest weakness is not in Raymonds ability to<i> provide</i> information<i> to </i>dealerships," she wrote, "but rather in their ability to<i> access</i> information<i> from</i> dealerships."</b><p>

They created a knowledge network and set each dealer up on CompuServe. Service manuals were scanned into databases and a corporate "intranet" was established in which dealers, mechanics, and engineers offered troubleshooting ideas. <p>

 I would encourage you to follow all the links in our <A href="../../links/otherl2.htm#patents">Patents Segment</A> of the "Other Useful Links" Section and become familiar with the various information available from them. The U.S. patent office is the best place to start. You can search the abstracts there for free. You can also go in with a patent number and read the abstract. The MicroPatent link will allow you to actually obtain a copy of the 1st page (including the abstract sketch) or the entire patent for a minimal fee. They also allow you view the full text of the patents (no graphics) issued in the last 4 weeks for free.  MicroPatent uses a special viewing system which is downloadable from their site.The Fontel Inventors BBS provides a CD ROM searchable system similar to that available at many of the patent depositories. It is free except for normal long distance phone charges. Also it requires a special communications software (TELIX) to allow the use of "doors". It is available for download on their site. If you are near a Federal Depository Library you can contact them, find out what specific tools their site has, and learn more about the patent system from them. A link to help you find the nearest <a href="../../links/otherl.htm#libraries">Federal Depository Library</A> is in the Libraries segment of our Other Useful Links section. Some of the Federal Depository Libraries have some general patent information on-line.<p>

The patent classification system allows searching the system to find similar items. Patents are classified into a class and then into a subclass. They are also cross referenced to other classes and subclasses they appear to have some relationship to. The two classes of most interest to the recreational boating industry are Class 440 (Marine Propulsion) and Class 123 (Internal Combustion Engines). Both  of these classes have a large number of subclasses. This classification system can be further explored at some of the links in out Patent Segment of the Other Useful Links Section.<p>

We will also be providing coverage of some of the boating industry patent battles fought in the past and present as well as coverage of some of the more significant patents issued in the past and present.<b> At the bottom of the page, we will point out some recent patents that may be of interest to the industry. </b><p>

</b><h3>Patent Legal Battles in the Industry</h3>
<hr>
<h4><b>Lough v. Mercury Marine</b></h4><p>

One of the current patent battles that may have just been laid to rest was between an individual (Steven Lough) and Mercury Marine over a brass seal. We have extensive coverage of this case on our <a href="lough.htm">Lough v. Mercury Marine Page</A>.
<hr>


<h4><b>Volvo v. Brunswick (Twin Prop)</b></h4><p>

One recent patent battle was the fight between the Mercruiser Dual Propeller Bravo-Three and the Volvo Duo-Prop. This was a very interesting case. The general public had the concept that Volvo had patented the dual counter-rotating propeller concept and owned it, but that concept had actually been in limited use for many years. The areas being contested were some propeller blade design parameters. The actual fight was over patent Volvo #4,741,670, or more properly - over its reissue as Re.#34,011 on 28 July 1992. The details of this case are on the <a href="volvo.htm">Volvo vs. MerCruiser Page</A><p>


<hr>

<h4><b>Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.</b></h4><p>

The case of <i>Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.</i> 489 U.S. 141 (1989) received a lot of comments in the legal literature. It held that federal patent law preempts Florida statute prohibiting the copying of boat hull designs by using a direct molding process. One of the discussions is in the  <i>Iowa Law Review</i> Volume 76 (1991) pages 959-1010. The title of the article is, "Federal Intellectual Property Law and the Economics of Preemption". Basically the Bonito Boat hull was not patented (the court said it provided too slight an advance to be patented) and thus belonged to the public and should be able to be directly copied by the public since it was not patented. The Florida statute had prohibited direct mold copying of any boat hull (as had several other states), the federal court said direct mold copying of non-patented boat hulls by competitors (or anybody else) was legal.<p>

<b><h4>Invention of the Stern Drive</h4></b></a><p>

The Patent Folder has a great story in it about the <a href="../../folders/pat/isd.htm">Invention of the Stern Drive</A>. The background includes an internal conspiracy, several managers rejecting the new technology, and is an example of how long it can take for an idea to flourish. Many feel the stern drive itself is now in the mature position and some "new technology" may be knocking on its door.<p>

<hr>


<h4><b>Vasa</b></h4><p>

An interesting Case Study involving a historical boat and its design and management decisions is available on the net. It illustrates some of the problems encountered when managing innovation and large projects. The case is called<a href="http://www.cox.smu.edu/mis/cases/vasa/home.html"> "The<i> Vasa</i> Capsizes"</A>. As technical types, you will rapidly identify with the situation and find humor that the same problems of innovation management you face today, occured hundreds of years ago as well.<p>


If you are interested in learning even a little more about the <i>Vasa</i>, it is in a Swedish museum being restored and they have a <a href="http://www.vasamuseet.se/">nice multi-language web site</A> with another site providing <a href="http://www.sunet.se/stockholm/museums/vasa/vasa.html">an English overview of the museum</a>.

Here at <b>RBBI</b> we've encountered several individual inventors with <b>boat industry inventions</b> looking help, advice, assistance, a way into the industry, etc. On this page we will try to address their needs. If you have an invention outside of the boating area you might still find some of these comments useful. <p>

<h4>RBBI Inventions Page</h4><p>

We've had some ideas ourselves we think could be of benefit to the industry. We are posting them on our <a href="invrbbi.htm">"RBBI Inventions Page."</A>  Some firms or individual inventors might want to try developing  some of these ideas.<p>


<hr>

<CENTER><A HREF="../sponsors/adinfo.htm"><IMG WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="60" SRC="../artwork/sponsors/sblankb.gif" ></A></CENTER>

<hr>



<pre>
The suggestions below are to be taken at your own risk
and are certainly not being given as professional advice 
by Gary Polson, Lora Polson, or Polson Enterprises. We do
suggest you receive professional advice from several 
qualified people as you develop your invention.

</pre>

We are going to "tell it like it is" which may "rain on your parade." With that behind us, here we go ...<p>


<center><h3>How to Develop a Boating Invention</h3></center>

<ul>
<li><b>Does the idea/concept belong to your employer??</b> Many of you work for somebody else. Did you sign some kind of agreement giving them rights to all your ideas? Did you develop it on your employers time and with their resources? Is it okay with them if you pursue the idea on your own?<p>


<li><b>Is the idea/concept unique and patentable?</b> Do a preliminary patent search yourself using the online resources and/or a Federal Depository Library. They will have access to U.S. patents and often have some invention / marketing literature. There are some links to help you find the <A href="../links/otherl.htm#libraries">location of your nearest Federal Depository Library</A> in the Library segment of our Other Useful Links Page.<p>

Ideas that are not unique and patentable may still be great ideas. You just have to handle them differently. You need to make sure any existing patents have expired and be aware that if you are successful competition will be on your heels. As we will discuss later, it may not make a lot of difference in the boating industry if your idea is patented or not. <p>

You should learn about the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office <b>"Disclosure Document Program"</b> and how you can file certain records with the government to help prove you are the inventor and when you invented the device. You are still allowed time to decide if you wish to pursue a patent or not. A form for the<b> Disclosure Document Program </b>is available on the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">U.S. PTO web site</A>. Just go the Forms Area and look for #PTO/SB/08 Disclosure Document Form.<p>

<li><b>Identify your customers.</b> Who in the industry would use your product? Who would benefit from it? Are they Drive Manufacturers, Boat Builders. Boat Dealers, Marinas, Mechanics, Boat Accessory Suppliers, Water Toy Manufacturers, PWC Manufacturers,  or End Users? Then get more specific such as aluminum boat manufacturers over 24 feet, salt water fishermen, competition ski boat manufacturers, outboard manufacturers over 150HP, marinas in freezing areas, third world wooden boats <20 feet, women pontoon boaters, etc. <p>

Many inventors think their product will be used everywhere. Be more realistic. At least find the best place your product could be used and begin there.<p>


<li><b>Learn about your industry, companies in it, and your end user customers</b>. This web site is an excellent place to begin. Also we have a, <a href="../../industry/howto/search.htm">"How to Learn About an Industry or a Specific Company"</A> page on a sister web site that can help you. We own another business that sells weight lifting products institutionally.It is constantly being approached by inventors with products bound for the consumer market. The business does not deal in the consumer market, we only sell to institutions. They are "barking up the wrong tree" and wasting our time. Don't you make this mistake! Identify your product as an<b> industrial product </b>or a <b>consumer product.</b><p>


<li><b>Identify your product as a durable or a consumable item</b>. It lasts for several boating seasons it is a durable product. An example would be bolt on "whale tails" for drives. If your product is consumed during its use such as corrosion anodes, sunscreen, and gasoline additives it is a consumable product. These two types of products are marketed distinctly differently. You need to be aware of which group you are in. Some products, such as propellers, fall somewhere in between and are marketed both ways.<p>



<li><b>Learn how your product would be produced in production quantities.</b> Could it really be made cost effective to replace what it is to replace or to demand the price for its performance. Don't forget their must be money in it for everyone in the distribution chain.<p>

<li> We are now at the <b>make or sell point</b>. If your idea is not unique and patentable you can forget selling it. There is no reason for them to purchase your idea. You need to decide if you want to produce the product yourself or if you want to license/sell the idea to a firm in the industry.<p>

Tied into this decision, if you decide to produce the product yourself, how will you market it. Don't give me this, "My product is so good it will market itself" stuff either. Marketing takes good ideas and hard work. Be sure you have concrete plans in this area.<p>



</ul>
***************************************<br>
<b>Note!</b>

This is a good time to point out <b>this is a very brutal industry </b>from the individual inventors perspective. If you look at our <a href="../folders/pat/pat.htm">Patents Folder</a> you will see a number patent lawsuits filed between the industry and individual inventors or between each other. The big boys can smash you even if you have a patent. They steal your patented product idea and produce it, your lawyer sends them a "cease and desist letter" telling them you think their product infringes on your patent and they should "cease and desist" marketing the product or you will sue them for infringement. They may respond with a "weenie offer" of pennies on the dollar of what a normal license fee for them might be and tell you if you don't sign up they will file a suit against the validity of your patent. If you  get in a patent suit you better have over $150,000 in the bank. Since most of us don't you either take the "weenie offer" or just let them alone. They begin mass production and with their large established marketing organization they squash you in a couple months. Not a pretty picture. <p>

I'm not saying all the big players do this, I'm just pointing out that they can do this to you pretty much "at will". If you haven't read, <a href="../folders/pat/isd.htm">"The Invention of the Stern Drive"</A>, yet, this would be a good time. Note how many years it took that product to come to the surface and all of the behind the scenes actions going on the scenes actions going on. As long as you are reading - check out the Steve Lough vs. Brunswick Corp patent suit Court of Appeals final report in the <a href="../ftp/ftp.htm">FTP section</A>.For one thing, this case certainly shows the importance of keeping good documents and seriously controlling any experiments. <p>


If your product is a low cost, easy to produce idea, such as "the club" (use in locking automotive steering wheels to prevent car theft) even if you have a patent, every body under a rock overseas will be dumping "knock off" products here. In this particular case the manufacture has a large crew of lawyers, "cease and desist" letters in several languages, and budgets in the hundreds thousands of dollars a year to protect themselves against "knockoffs". You will not have this option. If you have a good idea, they will swarm you and you will be gone.<p>

There is an excellent article titled, "How to Skin a Copycat" in the 1996 Enterprise Edition of Business Week on pages ENT4 to ENT6 in the Legal Affairs section. It contains stories of the efforts of several, including the "club" to reduce losses to copycats. As you read these techniques, image what they cost.<p>

The only people able to protect an idea in this industry are the big boys. They threaten each other and have informal "give and take" agreements to bring stability to their new product operations. Foreign operations can be stopped by them at the ports because they come from a limited number large well known firms.<p>

We might also point out here that a U.S. patent only gives  you the right to sue to those who produce the product in the U.S. or sell the product in the U.S. You will be swarmed overseas by everybody and many foreign companies have even less scruples than U.S. companies.<p>

In addition to the competitive problem you will have a very, very difficult  or impossible time of trying to get the major players to look at your invention. They have the NIH (Not Invented Here) disease and a history of almost never dealing with individual inventors.<p>


If you do license your great idea to someone, you can't just set back and count your money. They may not actively market your product and cause it to "die on the vine". They may just be busy fighting other fires in their company or just not really be interested in your product. You have the fire and conviction of the idea. They are looking at this weeks shipments vs. last years shipments and whipping people to make quotas. Your new product can get lost in their large system.<p>

These difficulties make it nearly impossible for individuals to profit from boating inventions. I have had a few myself and seeing the difficulties I have just posted them on the <a href="invrbbi.htm">RBBI Inventions Page</A> for the world to see. If the ideas are used, hopefully, they will be a minor stimulation to our economy and I will have the knowledge of where they came from. If you would like to do the same, we can group them on this site for all to see. <p>

**********************************<br>

<ul>

<li> You will encounter <b>Invention Submission Firms </b>that will market your idea for a fee. Some better known ones are Kessler Corporation and Invention Submission Corporation. Many firms of this nature advertise in the back of popular magazines and prey on individual inventors. They ask you for a little information, tell you they love your idea, and need payments as they go through various steps of marketing your invention. Ask to see 10 products they have placed with firms and to visit with the submitters. Ask them to put their successful placement ratio on paper (if they promoted 100 inventions how many of them will typically be placed with firms). There are very very few firm of this nature that are on the "up and up." Do not give them any money without some serious promises in writing and visiting with several inventors who have had their inventions successfully placed by them. Find out how long they have been in business and at their present address. How do they select companies to try to market your product to? Several just mail companies listed in your category in the Thomas Register. You can do that yourself, but neither will be very successful. They must have real contacts at these companies and a working relationship with them. Consider that you are working for Mega Corp. Are you going to evaluate every idea sent to Attn: New Products, Mega Corp?? We get hundreds of them at our other business and trash them all. <p>



<li>If your interested in patenting your device and would like to<b> learn more about the patenting process,</b> there is a <A href="../links/otherl.htm#inventors"> Patent FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file</A> in the Inventor segment of our Other Links Page. Take some time to visit the other links i our Inventors segment as well. They will explain some of the resources available to inventors.<p>

<li>If you do chose to patent your device, try to learn enough about the patent process to write the patent yourself. Then hire a  patent lawyer or agent to do it. The better knowledge you have of the system and your product, the more effective you will be in helping your lawyer or agent to file the best patent possible. Also your costs will be reduced as you will not require so much of their time and  you will not have them pursuing things they shouldn't be. Hire a good lawyer or agent with good references, preferably one with experience in patents in the area you are filing in. Those "in the business" can "give and take a little" with the patent examiners. If you file yourself, the patent examiners tend to blow you away. They know they will never see you again and they have no relationship with you. Attorneys that regularly deal with them have a much better rapport with them.<p>



<li>See if your state or area has an<b> Inventors Club</b> such as:<br>

<pre>
Oklahoma Inventors Congress
P.O. Box 27850
Tulsa OK 74149-0850
</pre>
Please do not bother the Oklahoma Group if you are not in Oklahoma.<p>

The IPC site in out Inventors Links on the Other Useful Links page has a <a href="http://www2.best.com/~ipc/localinv.htm"> list of Regional Inventors Organizations</A>.<p>

<li>See what can be learned from some of the <b>on-line invention forums and news groups</b> (alt.inventors). Remember not to take everything you here in them as truth. They can be a good source of general information, but they are becoming a place for others to market services to inventors. <p>


<li><b> Wal-mart </b>has a system set up with South West Missouri State University and a group called the Innovation Institute to evaluate and assess your idea.<p>

<pre>
Innovation Institute
Rt. 2 Box 184
Everton MO 64646
</pre></pre>


<li>Before approaching component manufacturers or manufacturers for the full device, be sure to get them to sign a <b>Non-Disclosure / Confidentiality Agreement</b>. It is best to visit with a lawyer dealing in intellectual properties to get a form you have confidence in. Some examples are available in our Inventors segment of our <a href="../links/otherl.htm#inventors">Other Useful Links Page</A>. Be sure they know you want them to sign an agreement before they invest time and travel into your project. Also, be sure to prepare and sign two copies of the agreement, one for your records and one for theirs.<p>


Carefully select the companies and individuals you deal with to maintain ownership of your invention. It is possible to become too paranoid. Suppose your invention is some assembly made of metal and plastic parts that is eventually sold through retail outlets. Component suppliers will not have any reason to "steal your invention". They want you to be a success so they can sell you more components. But suppose your device is a fishing lure and you go to a fishing lure company - <b>lookout</b> - if your device is a great idea, they may want to "steal it" because they already have the basic tools to build it and the market connections to sell it. You would want to protect your idea as securely as possible when dealing with firms that are currently making and marketing products similar to yours. While on the other hand, you can generally be less concerned about component manufacturers or service providers (plating, anodizing, painting, chroming, crating, etc.) because they do not currently manufacture products similar to yours, they do not currently have the marketing connections to market your invention, and they have every reason to want you to succeed so they can sell you more components or services.<p>

 
<li>If you do try to approach a manufacturing firm with your idea, <b>be sure it actually fits into their product line, </b>could be sold through their current distribution chain, could be used by their existing end customers, and that it is truly novel (we see hundreds of ideas that are like things that we have alrideas that are like things that we have already seen). <p>

<li>If you are considering <b>forming a small company to produce and market your invention</b>, do you have the money, desire, facilities, and skills to run the operation? Is the capital cost of setting up a site to produce the product beyond your financial capability? Are the  production processes and methods something your could do? If it is possible for you to produce the item do you have the skills and time to manage the operation? Is a production facility available for your use? There is an excellent web site about small businesses called SB2000. There is a link to it in the Inventors section of our <a href="../links/otherl.htm#inventors">Other Useful Links Page</A>.<p>



<li>Try to obtain assistance at your <b>local Vo-Tech school.</b> many provide small business assistance and can guide you to someone who assists inventors.<p>

</ul>

<hr>

Some of the very basic problems encountered by all are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I have a prototype built?
<li>Where can I obtain some funding?
<li>How do I get a patent? Should I get a patent?
<li>Where can I find a manufacturer?
<li>How can I explain my device to others and not have them steal my idea?
<li>What is a disclosure document and how do I file one?<p>
</ul>

I suggest you do some real soul searching about:<p>
<ul>
<li>What is the market for this device? (Quantity, Geography, Customer Demographics)
<li>What will it cost to manufacture?
<li>What can it be sold for?
<li>What is my cut?
<li>Who are my competitors?
<li>If I was looking at this from the outside, would I invest my mother's retirement fund in this thing?<p>
</ul>

Take the above two groups of questions, think about them, and take them with you when you go somewhere for assistance. You need to find the answers to these questions for your specific situation. Some resources can be found in our <a href="../links/otherl.htm#inventors">Inventor Links</A> in our Other Useful Links section.<p>

On this page we will copy some of the conversations from the rec.boats newsgroup and other newsgroups that seem specifically addressed to manufacturers. We encourage you to follow / monitor the actual rec.boats newsgroup as is it the "voice of the customer". TileNet keeps use statistics on the newsgroups. In October of 1996 they reported 40,000 readers and an average of 113 messages a day in this group. We will list the basic topic and date of the original post.

Why don't we have an aluminum automotive type engine designed for marine applications? That is the theme of the discussion below.<p>

<h3>TCWIII Oil Messages (Threads)</h3><p>

A little editorial statement: <img src="../../links/updated.gif"> <i>Manufacturers, such as Mercury and OMC, have a great opportunity to gain respect for themselves and confidence in their<b> two stroke oil products.</b> They could provide information and test results as to why their specific oil is needed, why it is better than the others for their specific applications, and defend its premium price. It is time "to poop or get off the pot."  Many end users do not feel they are getting "value" for their dollar(s) in oil purchases. They think the manufacturer is trapping them into buying their oil at near outrageous prices and that the product is not significantly different from other lower cost oils on the market. It is not good to have your customer feel he or she is being "ripped off."<p>

They need to prove their oil is superior to lower priced alternatives, that it is needed, and provide this information to the end user.  Once product superiority is proven  and the need for this superior product is proven - then pricing could be defended.  Price could be defended as production costs, packaging costs, marketing costs, distribution costs, and as reasonable profit for them and the dealer. Manufacturers could point out they need to make a profit on each drive which is the profit on original sale (warranty costs are usually built into this profit) plus profit on parts and service for the drive. Manufacturers could have lower service parts and oil costs if they charged more for the unit up front, but that might make the end user shop elsewhere.<p>

Internet web sites would be an excellent place for manufacturers to post the information needed and  to defend their oils and  pricing structure. <p>

Message number 27 of the 17 December 1996 thread shows how one individual has carefully studied the materials from the manufacturer, read about 100 messages on the topic, and is still not sure he is receiving a superior product for the premium price.. The information to make good purchasing decisions on premium prThe information to make good purchasing decisions on premium products from how they stack up against the competition in terms of performance should be readily available and not "smoke and mirrors" (Slick 50, 90+ octane gas, high speed tires, and turtle wax are examples). Do you industry folks lack the ability to dream up some of the performance stunts Kiekhaefer used to run?? Do you need to reread the "<i>Iron Fist</i>"?? He would put an end to this dribble. (that is if your products are truly superior?)  RBBI would be very happy to post test data supplied by the manufacturers comparing the performance of OMC and Merc TCWIII oils vs. the lower cost alternatives.</i><p>

<ul>



The following Threads cover most of the ideas brought up about the <b>two-stroke oils</b>. It is a frequent topic in rec.boats and in some of the other related newsgroups (snowmobiles, jet ski, etc). <p>

<h3>Discussion of Links</h3><p>


You will want to browse the <a href="../../links/otherl.htm">Other Useful Links</A> section in general and specifically the <b>Corrosion</b> and <b>EPA/Environment </b>categories.<p>

We have a group of <a href="../../links/otherl2.htm#testing">Product Testing Links</A> on our Other Useful Links page. <b>Lake Havasu</b> is often used for Engineering Testing and for Marketing / Magazine Shoots. <b>Lake Taneycomo</b> is a unique cold water trout 2,000+ acre lake near Branson Missouri that allows cold water testing the year around. The <b>Safe T Boot </b>might be useful in hiding your latest secret? It could even be used to hide new items at a boat show and be dramatically removed at the right time?? The <b>Lab Planning Data</b> link offers and incredible amount of information about designing, constructing, and operating and engineering test facility.<p>

<img src="../../links/new.gif"> The  <a href="http://165.95.50.81/">Center for Marine Training and Safety</A> (in Galveston) offers many training classes and will put together custom training for your product test people that spend a lot of time on the water. They offer basic technician type training, all kinds of water safety training including search and rescue, cold water emersion, and first aid in the water environment.<p>

<img src="../../links/new.gif"> The  <a href="http://www.dot.gov/dotinfo/uscg/hq/g-m/moa/mao1a.htm">Coast Guard Office of Investigative Analysis</A> web site has some reports of prior accident investigations. Select the "Formal Investigative Reports Area". One of the two cases currently presented is of a low pressure CO2 fire suppression system in an engine room that discharged during a Coast Guard Inspection, killing 2 by asphyxiation and injuring 4 more. Many of you operate engine test cells with various fire extinguisher methods. Reading the background on this accident might help prevent a similar occurrence at your site.<p>

<a name =toyota><h4>Toyota Low Cost Engine</h4></A><p>

The 25 November, 1996 issue of Business Week has an article title <a href="bwtoyota.htm">"Toyota May Have the Little Engine That Could"</A> with more info on the "buzz" about the new Toyota low cost engine that was "leaked" at a Nov. 8 media reception and Detroit's shocked response.<p>


The November 11, 1996 Wall Street Journal has an article titled <a href="toyota.htm">"Toyota to Unveil Low-Cost Engine Next Month"</A>. The article say Toyota claims to have developed an engine with 1/3  fewer parts that can be produced for 1/3 lower cost. This would make their small car engines cost to produce drop from about $600 to $400.  In the "nickel and dime" automotive cost cutting world this is incredible. <p>

<h4><b>Russian Low Emision Engines</b></h4><p>

Russia is developing some low emission engines. They include an axial engine that automatically changes piston stroke depending upon demand in gas and diesel versions. We have a <a href="engtech.htm">file of information on them</A> from the Technology Access web site.<p>

<h4>Background Info About Marine Engine Applications<br>
Basic Differences in Marine and Automotive Engines</h4><p>

For those not greatly familiar with marine engine applications we will provide a few comments about marine engine applications and how they differ from other applications of similar engines.<p>

<b>Duty Cycle</b> - Automotive engines tend to spend most of their life in the  low to mid rpm and are rarely ran at WOT (Wide Open Throttle). Many boat engines spend a lot of time at WOT. On the other hand, some fishing boat engines spend a lot of time at low rpm in a trolling mode. Boat tend to run up and down through the RPM range many more times than automobiles during the same operating time. <p>

<b>Life Expectancy </b>- Todays automotive engines are expected to go 100,000 miles with very minimal problems. Most recreational boat applications receive a max of 25 hours of use a year at off throttle conditions. Many shoot for durability of 150 to 300 hours at WOT. <p>

<b>Cooling System</b>- Automotive applications use fans and radiators. Boat applications typically use "fresh water cooling" which is just circulating raw water from below the boat through the engine and out the back. This cooling method is one of the reasons they are  not yet using the larger automotive aluminum engines and are sticking with the cast iron truck engines.<p>

<b>Outboard Crank Orientation</b>- Outboard engines have a vertical crankshaft while many other engines of their size have horizontal crankshafts.<p>

<b>Explosion Proofing</b>- Many of the engines accessories and fuel related parts are specially designed to reduce the possibility of fuel explosions from fumes or leaky fuel lines.<p>

<b>Emissions</b>- Automobile engines have been heavily regulated to reduce emissions due to their numbers. Until recently, boat engines had it much easier. Thus the continued use of carburetors as an alternative to electronic fuel injection which is more efficient and "cleaner", but costs more money.<p>

<b>Carburetors</b> - Manufacturers are very cost driven in the industry and use carburetors vs EFI as a result (and as a result of not being under emission regulations stiff enough to get rid of the carbs). The carburetors on many marine installations run at an angle to horizontal (inboards tilt the engine down), also during takeoff of stern drives the boat attitude (angle to horizontal) changes greatly as the nose first comes up and then later breaks over flat. Not running horizontal plays havoc with carburetor performance and design. Along with this problem comes high altitude operation - many boats are ran in mountain lakes at high altitudes - they require special carb settings and sometimes special gearing.<p>


<b>Fire Protection</B> - In a car if a fire develops you can stop and get out. In a boat that can be a much more serious situation so many additional regulations concern switches, electrical lines, fuel lines, and engine accessories. Also special fueling procedures may be followed.<p> 

<b>Corrosive Environment</b> - Cars are hot under the hood, boats may be  hotter but they are also exposed to a corrosive water and sometimes salt water environment that eats away anything not properly protected.<p>

<b>Torque Curves</b> -  The profile of the engine torque curve (Torque vs RPM) is different for the two applications.<p>

<b>Horsepower Trends</b>- Automotive engines have been coming down in horsepower and going up in efficiency to get improved mileage. Boating engines have still been going up in horsepower.<p>

<b>Steering System Demands</b>- Automotive steering systems have their largest horsepower requirements when the vehicle is parked or moving slowly. They are very easy to steer at high speed. Recreational power boats are just reversed. The steering systems require very little power at slow speeds and their peak horsepower requirements are at maximum speeds. Boats are typically steered by using the drive as a rudder and turning it to one side at high speed takes a great deal of power.<p>

<b>MANUAL OVERRIDE OF AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN SYSTEM<br>
AP 17 December 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>Freighter's Safety System Blamed</H3>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS - The Associated Press : An automated safety
system made a freighter hard to steer at a critical turn in the Mississippi
River and may have contributed to a crash at a crowded riverside shopping mall
that injured 116 people.</P>
<P>
-   ``Any time you have automation that is supposed to contribute to safety and
it has a reverse consequence, we are interested in that,'' National
Transportation Safety Board member John Hammerschmidt said Monday at a news
conference.</P>
<P>
-   Preliminary findings show that a lube pump on the 763-foot Bright Field
failed and a backup pump switched on just minutes before the crash Saturday. An
automated safety system also came on, which reduced engine rpms and the vessel's
speed, eroding the freighter's steering control, Hammerschmidt said.</P>
<P>
-   The ship's pilot and crew apparently didn't use the system's manual override
controls, he said. The automated safety systems worked as they were designed.</P>
<P>
-   Loaded with 56,380 long tons of corn, the ship lost engine power and crashed
into the Riverwalk shopping mall and the Riverside Hilton. No deaths have been
reported, but searchers brought in sensitive listening devices to determine
whether anyone was buried under the rubble from the heavily damaged buildings.</P>
<P>
-   Only three of the 116 people injured remained hospitalized today, two with
pelvic fractures and one with abdominal injuries.</P>
<P>
-   ``It is nothing short of a Christmas miracle,'' Mayor Marc Morial said.</P>
<P>
-   A Coast Guard hearing was set for today. Investigators are focusing on
whether the crew understood how to use the equipment in an emergency and whether
communication problems between the English-speaking pilot and the freighter's
12-member Chinese crew were factors.</P>
<P>
-   The ship's global positioning system, which recorded its drift into the
mall, is also being investigated. A ``course recorder,'' similar to an
airplane's ``black box,'' was on board but not operating.</P>
<P>
-   Maritime officials have praised pilot Ted Davisson, who came on board three
hours before the crash to guide the ship through the port, with averting a more
serious accident. With its emergency horn wailing and its anchor dropped in a
desperate attempt to stop, the freighter narrowly missed hitting two cruise
ships holding some 1,700 people.</P>
<P>
-   ``He had the utmost concern that there had been loss of life,'' Robert
Barnett, a spokesman for the New Orleans-Baton Rouge Steamship Pilot Commission,
said Monday. ``His demeanor today is guardedly optimistic because there has been
no loss of life.''</P>
<P>
-   The pilot and crew have passed alcohol tests. Drug test results were not yet
available.</P>
<P>
-   The bend in the Mississippi River gives New Orleans its Crescent City
nickname. The port is one of the world's busiest, used annually by 6,000 large
ocean-bound vessels and 120,000 tugboats that tow or push huge strings of barges
as long as 100 feet.</P>
<P>
-   The accident has <b>rekindled public debate over development along the
riverbank</b>.</P>
<P>
-   ``We realize what the risks are, but we also realize the public has an
interest in being at the river's edge,'' said Ron Brinson, executive director of
the Port of New Orleans.</P>

NEW ORLEANS - The Associated Press via Individual Inc. : The freighter Bright
Field, which lost power and crashed into a crowded, glass-fronted mall Saturday
afternoon, is operated by COSCO Shipping Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong.</P>
<P>
-   COSCO is the world's No. 4 shipping company, measured by tonnage and dead
weight, according to a list from the December 1995 ``Containerization Weekly''
cited on that company's site on the World Wide Web.</P>
<P>
-   The list put it behind Sealand, Maersk Line, and Evergreen.</P>
<P>
-   COSCO owns, manages and operates 78 vessels, most of them bulk cargo
carriers like the Bright Field, which was hauling 70 tons of grain and was
registered in Liberia.</P>
<P>
-   The Bright Field, at 68,200 deadweight tons, is among the larger cargo ships
in the fleet. It can carry up to 81,337 metric tons of grain, and can travel up
to 14 knots.</P>
<P>
-   The company's name is short for China Ocean Shipping Co., and it is the core
of COSCO Group, which was founded in 1961 and has more than 300 subsidiaries.</P>
<P>
-   COSCO's ships carry more than 24 million tons a year of food, grain,
fertilizer, steel, coal, ore, feed, agricultural products and wood, the company
said.</P>
<P>
-   ``The vessels are trading worldwide, plying between ports on five continents
and in 21 trading areas,'' it said.</P>
<P>
-   Grain is the company's biggest cargo, making up more than 32 percent of its
total.</P>
<P>
-   The Coast Guard said it inspected the Bright Field in June, but did not
board the ship.</P>

<b>ANNUAL COAST GUARD INSPECTION<br>
The Journal Of  Commerce 17 December 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>Prior to Accident, Coast Guard Found Wayward Ship In Good Condition</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON--Dec. 17--The cargo ship involved in Saturday's accident in New
Orleans was pronounced shipshape by the Coast Guard team that boarded it <b>June 11</b>
to conduct an annual inspection required of foreign-flag ships entering U.S.
waters.</P>
<P>
Exam complete. No deficiencies. All outstanding deficiencies have been cleared.
Master and crew cooperative, reads the inspection record made available from the
Coast Guard.</P>
<P>
The ship, Bright Field, also has a clean bill from the union representing its
crew.</P>
<P>
There have been no complaints about working or safety conditions on the Bright
Field, an International Transportation Workers Federation official said.</P>
<P>
The ITF is a London-based union coalition that holds collective bargaining
contracts with many flag-of-convenience ships, such as the Liberian-flag Bright
Field.</P>
<P>
Coast Guard inspectors examine a ship's vessel-classification certificates,
officer competency certificates, logs, record books, charts and nautical
publications, and check the working order of navigation equipment.</P>
<P>
They also check the steering system from all control stations, in addition to
lifesaving and firefighting equipment, cargo and mooring systems, and even the
galley, the mess and engineering spaces.</P>
<P>
The Bright Field disaster could fuel a lingering debate about the Coast Guard's
ship inspection practices and reporting procedures.</P>
<P>
There have been some suggestions that the Coast Guard adopt a more aggressive
program, like the one under wayin the European Union. Authorities there publish
the names of ships failing inspections.</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard does not publish such a list but maintains a database from which
the records of individual ships can be checked with relatively little
difficulty.</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard's top safety official Monday said the Coast Guard has a "very
systematic way of boarding" the vast number of ships calling at U.S. ports and
operates a "very aggressive program."</P>
<P>
Adm. James Card, assistant commandant for marine safety, said that based on the
factors the Coast Guard uses to prioritize boardings, such as classification
society, flag-of-registry and owner, the Bright Field did not warrant additional
inspections.</P>
<P>
Silas Nunn, a shipbuilding consultant who is a member of an international group
known as the Committee for the Elimination of Sub-Standard Ships, cautioned
against a rush to judgment.</P>
<P>
The inspection and reporting procedures embodied in the Coast Guard's Port State
Control program are new, Nunn said. They are not perfect, but they are
improving, he said.</P>
<P>
An official from a union representing U.S. maritime workers was less reticent to
assess blame.</P>
<P>
"This tragedy highlights the problems you get when you substitute low-cost
flag-of-convenience vessels for quality American vessels," said Alex
Shandrowsky, president of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association.</P>

<b>
GE TUG BOAT ENGINE PRESS RELEASE<br>
PR Newswire 21 Dec 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>
Tugboats Powered by GE Diesel Engines Support New Orleans Riverwalk
</H3>

<P>
ERIE, Pa., Dec. 20 /PRNewswire/  -- Three tugboats powered by
General Electric diesel engines are being used to support the freighter that
crashed into a New Orleans pier near the city's French Quarter last week.  The
diesel engines -- the same ones that are used to power locomotives -- are
manufactured by GE Transportation Systems of Erie, PA, at its diesel engine
plant in Grove City.  While primarily used for the locomotive market, the
powerful engines can also be found in oil well rigs and other marine
applications.</P>
<P>
The tugboats, <i>Mississippi, Louisiana </i>and <i>Texas,</i> were called into help the
situation by stabilizing the vessel to help rescue efforts and avoid further
collapse of the shopping area.</P>
<P>
The 735-foot Liberian-registered freighter lost power and also steering
capabilities as it collided into the New Orleans wharf damaging the riverwalk
containing a dockside shopping center, a wing of the New Orleans Hilton Hotel
and a parking garage.  There were no fatalities confirmed, but at least 116
people were injured.</P>
<P>
City officials reported later that the barge, now known as the Bright Field,
owned by the Cosco Co. of Hong Kong, could be removed from the area "soon," and
that the tugboats were playing a major role in stabilizing the freighter and
preventing additional damage. SOURCE  GE Transportation Systems</P>

<TITLE>Bright Field crash impact on grain delivery to Asia</TITLE>

<b>IMPACT ON GRAIN DELIVERY TO ASIA<br>
Reuters 17 December 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>
New Orleans shipwreck worries Asian grain buyers
</H3>
<P>
TOKYO, The Reuters Asia/Pacific Business Report: There was
unease, but not alarm  among major East Asian grain importers on Tuesday as 
trans-Pacific freight rates and U.S. corn prices blipped higher  after the
partial blockage of the Missisippi River.</P>
<P>
The United States Coast Guard said on Monday it was still  restricting passage
of the river, a major export artery for the  grain growing areas of the U.S.
Midwest.</P>
<P>
It said only small vessels could ply the route following  Saturday's bulk
freighter collision with a waterfront shopping  complex in New Orleans.</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Gulf/Japan freight route is a very delicate  pipeline. An efficient
operation is required to keep Japanese  feed plants running smoothly," an
official at a Tokyo-based  commodity trade house said. "The accident is bad
news."</P>
<P>
The Tokyo corn futures market surged on Monday as local  speculators rushed to
build long positions on the freighter  accident and supply concerns, traders
said.</P>
<P>
The two nearby contracts -- March and May 1997 -- hit the  daily 400 yen limit
by Monday's close. The spot March position  continued to rally on Tuesday
gaining 200 yen to 15,300 yen a  tonne by the close of the day's trading
session.</P>
<P>
South Korean and Taiwanese traders said the news had pushed  Pacific freight
rates higher and nudged up U.S. corn export  prices, but that the the congestion
would have to continue for  an extended period to affect local grain markets
seriously.</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there seems to have been no impact on the  domestic market. But
we have seen firming freight rates and a  widening basis," an official with
South Korea's National  Livestock Cooperatives Federation (NLCF) said.</P>
<P>
South Korean traders said the basis for U.S. corn prices for  prompt shipment
had risen by 0.5 U.S. cents a bushel over  Chicago futures to 37.5 cents now,
from 37 cents on Friday.</P>
<P>
Traders in Taiwan said at least three shipments bound for  the island were
stalled on the Mississippi and many more  incoming vessels would be delayed.</P>
<P>
Shipments for Taiwan Members Feed Industry Group, Hui Shung  Group and Marubeni
Taiwan -- totalling 144,000 tonnes of corn  and 16,000 tonnes of soybeans --
were waiting on the river for  departure or loading, a corn trader said.</P>
<P>
All three shipments were scheduled to depart from the Port  of New Orleans
around mid to late December, he added.</P>
<P>
Taiwanese corn and soybean product prices would rise  slightly due to the
shipment delays, traders said.</P>
<P>
"Local soybean and corn products will rise modestly, because  a few days delay
should have a minor impact on the market," one  trader said.</P>
<P>
Taiwan would not have any significant shortages unless the  delays extend for
another ten days or more, he added.</P>
<P>
Japanese traders said that <b>if the congestion persisted they  would have to
consider transporting grain by train to the U.S.  west coast for export,</b> but
they were confident that adequate   stocks would stave off any threat of animal
feed shortages.</P>
<P>
The Japanese Food Agency and the Mixed Feed Supply  Stabilization Organization
currently hold domestic reserves of  650,000 tonnes of corn, 150,000 tonnes of
sorghum and 400,000  tonnes of feed barley.</P>
<P>
A trader with South Korea's Cheiljedang Corp said due to the  supply concerns
major local grain buyers might now reconsider  their previous plans to buy corn
in place of feed wheat.</P>
<P>
"But if it this goes on for only four or five days, we think  there will be no
impact on the market," he said.</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard said on Monday shipping traffic in the  Port of New Orleans
would remain restricted until at least the  end of the week, although it eased
the limits to allow ships of  up to 25 feet (eight metres) to proceed
downriver.</P>
<P>
The stricken freighter, the Bright Field, was loaded in Terre  Haute, Indiana,
at a facility owned by U.S. trader Cargill and  was carrying nearly 56,000
tonnes of corn to Japanese customers  and due to arrive in mid-January, Cargill
in Tokyo said.</P>
<P>
Cargill, Japanese trade house Itochu Corp and one other  undisclosed company all
owned grain on the ship, spokesmen from  the two named firms said.</P>

<b>FREIGHTER RECENTLY REPAIRED<br>
AP 16 December 1996</b>


<H3>Freighter Was Recently Fixed</H3>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS - The Associated Press : On its way down the
busy Mississippi with a fresh cargo of corn, the Liberian freighter Bright Field
had to stop for repairs.</P>
<P>
-   Crews from <b>Dixie Machine Welding &amp; Metal Works Inc.</b> went aboard the Bright
Field at an anchorage upriver from New Orleans on Friday night, said Carl
Roussel Sr., Dixie's president.</P>
<P>
-   They <b>removed an engine air cooler and took it to the company's shops in New
Orleans for cleaning before returning it to the ship.</b></P>
<P>
-   The Liberia-registered freighter resumed its journey down river, and on
Saturday it apparently lost power and smashed into the Riverwalk shopping mall
in New Orleans.</P>
<P>
-   Initial reports indicated the ship's engine shut down because of ``a lube
oil-type situation,'' said Ron Brinson, executive director of the Port of New
Orleans. He did not elaborate, but Coast Guard officials said it may been a
problem with an oil pump.</P>
<P>
-   There was no immediate indication if Friday's work on the ship had anything
to do with Saturday's mechanical problems.</P>
<P>
-   Members of the National Transportation Safety Board were to join the Coast
Guard to investigate the accident.</P>
<P>
-   The ship had loaded 56,380 long tons of corn Wednesday at the Cargill grain
elevator in Reserve and was <b>bound for Kashima, Japan</b>, via the Panama Canal, the
Coast Guard said.</P>
<P>
-   Then it sailed across the Mississippi River to the Reserve Anchorage, one of
many repair places along the river, said a spokesman for Barwil Agencies Inc. in
New Orleans, the steamship agency that handled the ship's visit.</P>
<P>
-   The Coast Guard said it had inspected the Bright Field in June although the
ship was not boarded.</P>
<P>
-   The freighter, built in 1988, is operated by COSCO Shipping Co. Ltd. of Hong
Kong. The company's name is short for China Ocean Shipping Co., and it is the
core of COSCO Group, which was founded in 1961 and has more than 300
subsidiaries.</P>
<P>
-   COSCO is the world's No. 4 shipping company, measured by tonnage and dead
weight, according to a list from the December 1995 ``Containerization Weekly''
cited on that company's site on the World Wide Web. That put it behind Sealand,
Maersk Line, and Evergreen.</P>
<P>
-   COSCO owns, manages and operates 78 vessels, most of them bulk cargo
carriers like the Bright Field, which was hauling 70 tons of grain and was
registered in Liberia.</P>
<P>
-   The Bright Field, at 68,678 deadweight tons, is among the larger cargo ships
in the fleet. It can carry up to 81,337 metric tons of grain, and can travel up
to 14 knots.</P>

<TITLE>Chinese Captain of Bright Field Tesitifies</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="66FFFF" TEXT="000000" LINK="0000FF" VLINK="FF00FF" ALINK="FF0000"></HEAD>
<b>
Chinese Captain Testisfies<br>
AP 18 December 1996<br>
</b>
<hr>

<H3>
La. Freighter Captain Testifies
</H3>

<P>
NEW ORLEANS - The Associated Press The Chinese master of
the freighter that smashed into a crowded waterfront shopping mall testified
today that he overruled a river pilot's orders and waited to drop anchor so his
ship wouldn't swing into a cruise ship.</P>
<P>
-   The captain, Jing Quan Deng, said he then ordered the anchor dropped at the
last minute to avoid ramming a loaded casino boat.</P>
<P>
-   The pilot, Ted Davisson, testified Tuesday that the master and his crew
showed no signs of responding to his commands as he tried futilely to keep the
763-foot freighter Bright Field under control before Saturday's crash. No one
was killed, but 116 were injured when the ship plowed into the Riverwalk
complex.</P>
<P>
-   Pilots are required to be aboard to navigate ships down the tricky
Mississippi River, but the ship's master or captain stays in command of his
ship.</P>
<P>
-   Deng testified today through an interpreter, although he did not have an
interpreter on the bridge at the time of the accident. He showed that he
understood some of the English questions, occasionally answering before the
translator repeated them, but his answers were in Chinese.</P>
<P>
-   Deng said he concurred with Davisson's orders to put the rudder hard right,
drop anchor and rev the engines to full speed astern. However, he said, his
first order to the man at the anchor could not be heard because of alarms being
blown on the ship's whistle.</P>
<P>
-   After he could be heard, Deng said, he held off dropping the anchor because
it would have swung his ship into a cruise ship, the Nieuw Amsterdam, which was
docked nearby.</P>
<P>
-   He said he held the anchor until the freighter was bearing down on the
docked casino boat, and then dropped it to stop the ship's forward motion.</P>
<P>
-   ``I overruled the pilot,'' he testified.</P>
<P>
-   Deng also testified that he transferred control of the ship's engines to the
engineering crew, so that the bridge was no longer in control. That was done
because the engine speed can be increased more quickly from below than from the
bridge.</P>
<P>
-   He said he did not initially advise the crew that there was an emergency.
``They were informed when the collision became unavoidable even with increased
speed,'' he said.</P>
<P>
-   He did not address the question of why he waited so long.</P>
<P>
-   The testimony came in the second day of a National Transportation Safety
Board inquiry. It added a new dimension to the accounts of what happened
Saturday in the three minutes between the loss of power and the moment the ship
hit the Riverwalk.</P>
<P>
-   It's not uncommon for ships to lose power on the river, Coast Guard
officials said at a news briefing today.</P>
<P><b>
-   In fact, three freighters lost power in the previous 24 hours and anchored
upriver from the city, Coast Guard Capt. Gordon Marsh said. He said such ships
are told to not move until their problem is corrected and the ship is inspected
and cleared by the Coast Guard.</b></P>
<P>
-   In addition, two pilots refused to take ships down river because of power
fluctuations, said Marsh, commander of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office.
He said he didn't know if they did that because of heightened awareness
following the crash.</P>
<P>
-   Davisson, hailed by maritime experts for narrowly missing two loaded cruise
ships and the casino boat, testified Tuesday of his frustration as the ship bore
down on the crowded mall.</P>
<P>
-   ``People were just standing there watching like it was some Mardi Gras event
or something,'' he said.</P>
<P>
-   Davisson also said the Chinese crew never told him the ship was slipping out
of control and didn't seem to respond to his orders with any sense of urgency.</P>
<P>
-   ``I told the captain to stand by the anchors. ... He did not say anything,''
Davisson said. ``I remember literally yelling at him on two occasions to stand
by the anchors.''</P>
<P>
-   The hearing opened Tuesday with a recording of Davisson's urgent radio
transmissions to the Coast Guard as the ship headed out of control _ first
toward the Creole Queen excursion boat, and then toward the Riverwalk.</P>
<P>
-   ``I'm going to hit that damned cruise ship!'' Davisson exclaimed. ``Call
them or do something! I'm going right for them!''</P>

<H3>Engine records missing for crashed freighter</H3>

<P>
NEW ORLEANS  - <b>Someone cut a page from the engine log book </b>on
the huge freighter that plowed into a crowded riverside mall and
injured 116 people, the Coast Guard said Thursday.
<P>
The <b>missing page from the handwritten log covered the two days
before the accident </b>and might have recorded problems with an engine
pump that failed Saturday, leaving the ship almost powerless to
avoid the riverbank.
<P>
None of the other engine records from Friday, when the <strong>Bright</strong>
<strong>Field</strong> was moored upriver from New Orleans, indicate anything was
going on that day, Coast Guard Cmdr. Ken Parris said.
<P>
Word that the page had been cut out came Thursday during a joint
Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board inquiry into
the cause of Saturday's accident.
<P>
Lost business and property damage from the crash could total well
over $500 million, said attorney Daniel Becnel, who has filed
a class action lawsuit on behalf of the mall business owners.
<P>
James Roussel, an attorney for the ship's owners, filed suit Thursday
to <b>have all claims consolidated according to maritime law, which
would limit liability to the value of the ship and its cargo -
about $16 million - if the ship is found to be seaworthy and the
crew is absolved of negligence.</b>
<P>
The 763-foot <strong>Bright</strong> <strong>Field</strong>, loaded with 56,000 tons of corn, lost
power and crashed into the Riverwalk mall, injuring 116 people
and destroying more than a dozen shops and a small part of the
Hilton Hotel.
<P>
Officials at the hearing had been using photocopies of the log
provided by the company until Bob Barnett, an attorney for the
state's river pilot agency, insisted on seeing the original and
discovered the missing page Wednesday.
<P>
Parris said the missing page was for last Thursday and Friday
in the &quot;engine movement book,&quot; where the ship's engineer
on duty customarily records any notable ship activity.
<P>
It was not known when the page was removed. Parris said he personally
looked at the log aboard ship after the crash and did not notice
it missing.
<P>
After the accident, the attorneys for the ship owners took the
log and kept it until Tuesday. When the hearings began it was
turned over to the Coast Guard, which didn't notice the missing
page.
<P>
&quot;If Bob Barnett hadn't demanded the original, we would never
have known,&quot; Becnel said.
<P>
In another development that stemmed from an apparent misunderstanding,
lawyers for the Riverwalk said <b>they &quot;caught&quot; a marine
repair firm removing the damaged lubrication pump which is believed
to have caused the accident.</b>
<P>
They immediately went to federal court, accused the workers of
destroying evidence, and got an order from a federal judge barring
the vessel's owner, COSCO Shipping Co., from disassembling equipment
on the crippled vessel.
<P>
Livaudais' order, signed Wednesday, gave that authority exclusively
to the Coast Guard and NTSB.
<P>
However, Parris said it was all &quot;a miscommunication.&quot;
He said the work was being done for the Coast Guard, but the workers,
employed by a New Orleans machine repair firm, were supposed to
call the Coast Guard before they started.

<b>CONCERN VOICED FOR CASINO BOAT SAFETY<br>
IN MISSISSIPPI RIVER AFTER BRIGHT FIELD INCIDENT<br>
AP 16 December 1996</b><p>

<hr>

<H3>
Mississippi Bends Are Perilous
</H3>


<P>
NEW ORLEANS - The cargo ship that
plowed into the Riverwalk shopping mall reinforced Rep. Billy Tauzin's
conviction that the busy Mississippi River past New Orleans is dangerous and no
fit place for riverboat casinos.</P>
<P>
-   ``There's no way you can stop a ship from losing power or losing steering.
But why on earth would you want gambling boats full of people out in that
traffic?'' the Louisiana Republican asked.</P>
<P>
-   ``Why would you put a (casino) boat in that location and then tell it to
sail? The people on board don't have life jackets. They don't even know where
the lifeboats are,'' he said after Saturday's accident.</P>
<P>
-   The Liberian-registered freighter<b> Bright Field ground to a halt just 70 feet
from the crowded Hilton Flamingo casino riverboat </b>when it smashed into the wharf
that holds Riverwalk.</P>
<P>
-   In addition to a strong current, the bend that the Mississippi River makes
around New Orleans is one of the world's busiest ports, used annually by 6,000
large ocean-bound vessels and 120,000 tugboats that tow or push huge strings of
barges as long as 100 feet.</P>
<P>
-   ``It's the busiest and most treacherous stretch of the river,'' said Coast
Guard Lt. Verne Gifford.</P>
<P>
-   Tauzin has been concerned about the safety of riverboat casinos operating in
the area since they were first proposed.</P>
<P>
-   ``We dodged a bullet this time in terms of a major riverboat accident,''
Tauzin spokesman Ken Johnson said Sunday. ``That boat (Flamingo) would have been
a sitting duck had it not been for luck.''</P>
<P>
-   In 1993, Tauzin held a Coast Guard and congressional subcommittee hearing in
Baton Rouge at which a parade of shipping officials said riverboat casinos posed
an unnecessary risk in the area.</P>
<P>
-   During that hearing, Coast Guard Rear Adm. James C. Card testified that
every seven days a foreign vessel loses steerage on the heavily traveled river.</P>
<P>
-   And during the period of 1983-93, Card testified, 37 percent of all river
shipping collisions from its mouth to Baton Rouge occurred in the Algiers Point
area of New Orleans _ near where Saturday's accident occurred.</P>
<P>
-   Safety planning for Riverwalk involved city officials plus maritime, police
and fire experts, said Cathy Lickteig, a spokeswoman for Rouse Corp., the owner
of the mall.</P>
<P>
-   Rouse also built Baltimore's 15-year-old Harborplace and Miami's Bayside,
and neither waterfront development has had any serious accidents, Lickteig
said.</P>
<P>
-   Although the Hilton Flamingo sits in the busy zone, other floating casinos
have been kept away.</P>
<P>
-   The Coast Guard refused to let the Treasure Chest Casino anchor at Rivertown
in Kenner, saying the location was too dangerous. The casino wounded up on Lake
Ponchartrain, north of the city and away from the river.</P>
<P>
-   Both the Coast Guard and the Port of New Orleans vetoed a downtown location
for Bally's Belle riverboat casino, and it also ended up on Ponchartrain.</P>
<P>
-   Tauzin is concerned about the <b>potential for an even worse accident, such as
a ship collision that might release poisonous clouds of toxic chemicals.</b></P>
<P>
-   ``It's a very dangerous river, next to a very populous community. We need to
be constantly on guard.''</P>

<b>
SHIP OWNER BRACES FOR WRECK CLAIMS<br>
Lloyds of London 19 December 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>
'Bright Field' faces huge New Orleans claims
</H3>

<P>
Source: <I> Lloyd's List</I>
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's List : THE owner of the panamax bulk carrier Bright
Field, which ploughed into a New Orleans dockside complex on Saturday, was
yesterday facing the prospect of substantial claims from the 100-plus shoppers
injured in the accident.</P>
<P>
Insurers for the 68,200 dwt vessel confirmed the Liberian-flag Bright Field was
fully covered for damage caused by the crash, including the cost of restoring
the New Orleans Riverside complex, and compensation for personal injury to
persons ashore. But the company said it was too early to assess the extent of
the damage.</P>
<P>
However, observers believed awards for those claimants seriously injured in the
accident could exceed $1m per person, which, added to the property damage, could
push the total bill for the accident into tens of millions of dollars.</P>
<P>
"It is very early days. Obviously we are pleased there is no loss of life, and
we are continuing to work with the shipowner to minimise the claim," a spokesman
for the West of England P&amp;I Club, the Bright Field's liability insurer said.</P>
<P>
"However, it will be many months before a clear picture of the cost of the
incident emerges," he added.</P>
<P>
The incident, which took place during a busy shopping period, was alleged to
have occurred after a problem with the Bright Field's oil lubricating system,
which resulted in a power failure.</P>
<P>
The vessel, which was equipped with just one propeller, lost control almost
immediately, subsequently cutting a 160 ft swath into the wharf, stores,
restaurants and hotel situated in the complex.</P>
<P>
<b>At least 15 shops were believed to have sustained serious damage, while 456
hotel rooms positioned above the shopping complex were also destroyed. </b>The
vessel narrowly avoided a collision with the Flamingo casino riverboat, which
was carrying nearly 800 gamblers.</P>
<P>
A formal investigation into the accident will now be carried out by the US Coast
Guard.</P>
<P>
The Bright Field, which is managed by Cosco's Hong Kong arm, has been detained
alongside the wharf. There remain fears that further damage to the wharf will
result if she is moved.</P>
<P>
She is believed to be aground by the bow, with rupture holes in her hull plating
on the port side. Some of her $15m cargo of <b>soyabeans </b>has leaked out through the
damaged plating.

<b>RESTRICTING AND RE-OPENING OF THE RIVER<br>
Reuters 16, 18, 19  Dec 1996 </b>
<hr>

<b>16 Dec 1996</b>
<H3>Shipping remains restricted at Port of New Orleans</H3>
<P>
NEW YORK, Reuters : U.S. Coast Guard officals said shipping
traffic at the Port of New Orleans will remain restricted until at least the end
of the week following a freighter accident along the Mississippi River over the
weekend.</P>
<P>
"I have no expectation that (operations) will be back to normal tomomrow," said
Lieutenant Commander Daniel Whiting, chief of port operations for the U.S. Coast
Guard in New Orleans  "Later in the week is the most optimistic estimate I would
give."</P>
<P>
The freighter Bright Field, 735-foot cargo ship loaded with 64,000 tonnes of
corn, lost power and plowed into a waterfront shopping complex on Saturday. The
vessel was being held in place against the wharf by tugboats while rescue and
salvage operations continued.</P>
<P>
Officials were increasingly confident that no one had been killed in the
accident. More than 100 people were treated for injuries.</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, New Orleans port director Ron Brinson said the port should be
"back to full, normal operations within 24 hours."</P>
<P>
But the Coast Guard officials appeared to dispute that claim, saying that ship
traffic will probably need to be restricted until the Bright Field is removed.</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to continue controlling and likely restricing traffic until
the vessel is removed, and that will certainly not be tomorrow," Whiting said.</P>
<P>
Since this morning, the Coast Guard has slightly eased restrictions on vessel
draft navigating in the vicinity of the accident. <b>Down-river traffic was limited
to ships with drafts of 25 feet, up from 20 feet this morning. Up-river traffic
was confined to 30-foot draft vessels.</b></P>
<P>
"We're increasing the size of vessels that we are coordinating to navigate
through the area," Whiting said. "As vessels get larger it's a bit more
touchy."</P>
<P>
As the operational delays wore on, congestion in the port area increased. Coast
Guard officials would not say how many ships were waiting to enter or leave the
port, stating only that the number was "significant".</P>

<b>18 Dec 1996</b>
<H3>Shipping restrictions eased further at New Orleans</H3>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS (Reuter) - 
Restrictions on vessels navigating the Mississippi River near New Orleans were
eased again Wednesday, although there were still some delays, following a
weekend accident in which a freighter hit a waterfront shopping complex.</P>
<P>
The draft limit on vessels navigating the Mississippi River near New Orleans was
raised to 42 feet Wednesday, and could be increased to a normal level of 46 feet
if no problems occur, Coast Guard officials said.</P>
<P>
``The Coast Guard had increased the draft to 42 feet,'' said Cmdr. Ken Parris of
the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office here.</P>
<P>
Draft restrictions have been in place since Saturday, when a grain freighter,
the Bright Field, lost control and plowed into a waterfront shopping complex
near the city's French Quarter. At least 116 people were injured as a result of
the collison, but no deaths have been reported.</P>
<P>
After closing the port immediately following the accident, the Coast Guard has
gradually allowed larger ships to navigate up and down-river in the vicinity of
the wreck.</P>
<P>
While maritime traffic was permitted in both directions, it was required to
alternate between inbound and outbound vessels, and some delays were noted.</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, divers continued to search beneath the wreck as the Coast Guard
sought to determine how to remove the Bright Field from the river. The freighter
was being held in place by tugboats because it was thought to be supporting part
of the damaged wharf. REUTER@</P>

<b>19 Dec 1996</b>
<H3>Draft limit at New Orleans raised to 46 feet</H3>

<P>
NEW YORK, Reuters : The Coast Guard on Thursday raised the
draft limit on vessels navigating through the Port of New Orleans to 46 feet, as
maritime traffic was gradually restored to normal following a weekend shipping
accident.</P>
<P>
But some shipping restrictions remained in place, Coast Guard officials said,
including a ban on simultaneous two-way traffic at the port.</P>
<P>
"Right now the river is open to traffic up to 46 feet," said Lieutenant Curtis
Shaw, of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in New Orleans. "(Traffic) is
in-bound and out- bound, but it is one way at a time," he added.</P>
<P>
With the port open to all but the largest tankers, officials said there were no
vessels waiting to enter or leave the river late Thursday.</P>
<P>
Maritime traffic has been curtailed on the lower Mississippi River since
Saturday, when a grain freighter, the Bright Field, plowed into a waterfront
shopping center near the heart of downtown New Orleans. More than 100 people
were injured in the accident, but no one was killed.</P>
<P>
The wharf was heavily damaged in the collision, and the freighter, which was
thought to be supporting part of the structure, was being held in place by
tugboats.</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said it had yet to determine how it would go about removing the
grounded Bright Field from the river. Divers searched the water around the wreck
again today, but officials said it could be some time before salvage operations
got underway.</P>
<P>
"They have to get things shored up," Shaw said. "The boat is going to be sitting
there for a while."</P>

<b>RIVERWALK BUSINESSES RELOCATE<br>
AP December 1996</b>

<h3>Riverwalk businesses relocate after freighter crash</B>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS -- 
The Christmas shopping season was snatched from about 100 Riverwalk merchants and restaurateurs a week ago when the grain ship Bright Field lost power and slammed into the riverfront shopping mall. The mall has been closed since, jeopardizing the future of many businesses at the height of the holiday season. It was unclear Friday how many of the 1,500 people who work at the Riverwalk are unemployed.<p>

<ul>
<li>A banner over the new location of Orleans Jewels says it all: "Shipwrecked -- Temporary Location." The jewelry store has set up shop temporarily at The Esplanade mall in Kenner. It is one of several Riverwalk shops that have moved to recoup some holiday business.<p>


<li>Some merchants, such as Cafe du Monde and The Gap, were able to move employees, said Brian Lade, the mall's general manager. Others have business interruption insurance that will pay workers' salaries during the shutdown, he said.<p>

But like Orleans Jewels, some shop owners aren't waiting around to find out when the mall will reopen.<p>

<li>Artworks of Louisiana last week set up temporarily at the Edgewater Mall in Biloxi, Miss., after owner Linda Roddy made arrangements to sell her framed posters and prints there.<p>

<li>The Sharper Image also moved. It's now on the first level of the Canal Place Shopping Center, not far from the Riverwalk. It opened for business Saturday.<p>

</ul>

Riverwalk's management was expected to announce a possible opening date Monday.<p>

Meanwhile, Bert Mothershead, manager of the Sharper Image, applauded the company's quick move to Canal Place.<p>
<ul>
<li>The Sharper Image at the Riverwalk does 20 percent of its annual business at Christmastime, he said.<p>

<li>Even more important is <b>January</b>, which is bringing the <b>Sugar Bowl and Super Bowl games to town, as well as the National Association of Television Producers and Executives convention.</b><p>

<li>On Friday, 15 Sharper Image elves scurried around, placing the store's executive gifts and toys at the temporary digs.<p>

<li>Although Sharper Image stores typically carry 450 different items, there will be just 100 items in the temporary shop. But customers can place catalog and phone orders just like at the Riverwalk location.<p>
<li>
New Orleans is the company's only location in Louisiana.<p>

<li>Mothershead and his workers have made two trips to the Riverwalk store, filling a van with all the merchandise they could quickly retrieve. They had to bring items from the store because there isn't much left in the company's warehouse at this time of year, Mothershead said.<p>

<li>San Francisco-based Sharper Image flew in a specialist from its corporate headquarters to program the cash register system, which was en route from the local delivery station Friday afternoon.<p>

<li>"If we do any business it's more than we would have if we didn't relocate," Mothershead said.<p>

<b>INSURANCE & DAMAGE ASSESSMENT RIVERWALK CRASH<br>
National Underwriters Property & Casualty</B>
<hr>

<H3>
Damage, Cover Assessed For New Orleans Riverwalk Crash
</H3>
</HR>
<P>
National Underwriter Property &amp; Casualty : As damages are
assessed from the Dec. 14 crash of a 700-foot freighter into the Riverwalk mall
on the Mississippi River in New Orleans, attention is focusing on the insurance
coverage for the Liberian-registered vessel.</P>
<P>
The freighter Bright Field tore away a 200-foot section of the mall's walkway,
damaged 13-15 stores and several condos and partially collapsed a building
containing the 125-room Hilton Hotel and a parking garage.</P>
<P>
While no one was killed in the accident, more than 100 people were injured
during a stampede on the Riverwalk as the freighter approached.  There were no
damage estimates at press time. The National Transportation Safety Board is
holding hearings about the accident.</P>
<P>
The ship was returning from La Place, La., where it had loaded 64,000 tons of
corn bound for Asia--freight worth an estimated $2 million, sources said.</P>
<P>
The ship is operated by the Hong Kong-based China Ocean Shipping Co.  It was
registered in Liberia, and insured though Liverpool-based West of England
Mutual, a protection and indemnity club.</P>
<P>
West of England representative Kenneth Norman said that if the shipping company
is held liable, it will pay for the damage and then be reimbursed by the P-I
club.</P>
<P>
West of England has approximately $20 billion in reinsurance for claims such as
this, though Mr. Norman stressed it was very unlikely that any payment would
approach that figure.</P>
<P>
"It will be a long time before we know what will happen," Mr. Norman said,
adding that liability has not yet been determined and any payments will depend
on the specific terms of the policy.</P>
<P>
A representative from Lloyd's of London said they were trying to determine if
any of their syndicates had hull insurance on the ship.</P>
<P>
According to Robert Jumonville, a representative of the Port of New Orleans, the
buildings are leased by a company called International River Center. That
company subleases the mall to Rouse Riverwalk, part of Maryland-based Rouse Co.,
and the Hilton.</P>
<P>
Mr. Jumonville said most of the leases of the stores have been traced back to
the Hilton. However, he did not know details of that company's insurance. "Of
course we hope and feel the ship's insurance will cover the damages," he said,
adding that the Riverwalk "did not jump in front of that boat."</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills-based Hilton Corp. could not be reached at press time.</P>
<P>
The account representative at the Port of New Orleans's broker, Aon Corp., was
unwilling to release the name of the port's insurer.  However, she said that the
port could only be held liable for a small portion of any loss.</P>
<P>
Steven Sachs, risk manager for Rouse, said he has been working with Columbia,
Md.-based Industrial Risk Insurers to determine the extent of the damage and a
plan of action. Rouse plans to reopen the mall as soon as possible, but, he
said, "the priority is making sure the building is safe."</P>
<P>
Mr. Sachs said the aftermath of the accident has been similar to what would
follow a natural disaster, though the Riverwalk presents some different problems
than other malls because of its long, narrow structure.</P>
<P>
He said representatives from the Hilton, the port, the mall stores and their
insurers have been meeting to plan the mall's repair and reopening. While
insurers for those parties will initially fund the repairs, according to Mr.
Sachs, he said they expect the shipping company will eventually bear most of the
liability.</P>
<P>
Rouse operates 72 malls, including South Street Seaport in New York and Boston's
Faneuil Hall.</P>
<P>
According to published reports, a pump on the freighter failed before the crash,
activating a backup pump and an automated safety system that slowed down the
ship. In an odd twist, that safety system may have contributed to the accident,
because the reduced speed reportedly made the ship more difficult to navigate.</P>
<P>
The American pilot, Ted Davisson, sounded alarms and dropped anchor after the
freighter began to head towards the Riverwalk. He was piloting the foreign ship
due to an American law stipulating that ships on the Mississippi must be piloted
by a state-licensed pilot.</P>
<P>
Reports of his testimony in the NTSB hearings suggest he had a communication
problem with the Chinese-speaking crew.</P>

<H3>Engineer didn't hit override</H3><p>
<h4><i>Chief: Unaware ship in trouble</i></h4>

Article was summarized by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

The chief engineer of the Bright filed said Friday he used a slower method of restoring power instead of an override button because he did not know the freighter was in trouble. <p>

The override button restores power in 10 seconds, engineer Fang Jim Yun said. Instead he used a different method that failed to gain enough power to fight the current in the three minutes it took the freighter to drift into the riverfront.<p>

Fang and Bright Field Capt. Deng Jing Quan both had access to an emergency button,, but neither used them. Fang said he has never hit the override button on the Bright Field or any other vessel.<p>

"I can only use the override button if it is an emergency situation and I am informed of the emergency situation," he said. Fang was grilled for about 10 hours by the NTSB Friday, the fourth day of a joint hearing into the accident.  They asked Fang if his alternative method of restoring power offered any advantage. "By using the override button, heavy damage or a meltdown can be caused to the engine." Fang said after investigators rephrased the question at least 3 times. Later, he recounted conversations he had with the ship's master that emergencies warranted use of the override button, even at risk of damaging the engine.<p>

Friday's testimony revealed the Bright Field had recent mechanical problems. Hours before the accident, the engine failed to start twice as the freighter tried to leave LaPlace, Fang testified. The turbocharger was repaired the day before. And nine times in the past four months, either the main engine cylinders or pistons were removed for repair, investigators said.<p>

"Is this normal for a diesel ship?" asked Rob Henry of NTSB.<p>

Fang replied, "Every time there was a problem we corrected it right away."<p>

Henry, citing the second engineer's records that documented welding repairs he made to cracked cylinder lines asked if such repairs would be considered permanent or temporary.<p>

"Temporary." Fang answered after Henry pressed him.<p>

At one point,  Coast Guard Capt. Tony Regalbuto asked Fang if he had as much trouble getting his pint across in his control room as he did at the hearings.<p>

Concerning the missing page from the engine logbook, Coast Guard Cmdr. Ken Parris said he was aboard the Bright Field within two hours of the crash and started collecting evidence, including the log book. "I was quite pleased to begin the collection of evidence before the arrival of the attorneys," Parris said. He said one page appeared to have been torn out of the book. The testimony did not satisfy everybody. Attorneys for the damaged businesses and a state riverboat commission said no one yet has offered an explanation for the missing page.

<H3>Corn to be unloaded from damaged ship</H3>

<h4>From Staff Reports</h4><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Friday (Dec. 20) Port of New Orleans officials said workers are expected to begin unloading corn from the Bright Field Sunday.<p>

The 735-foot ship was carrying 56,380 long tons of corn when it struck the Poydras Street Wharf. <p>

Friday divers continued to determine the extent of damage. Building debris landed on top of one diver who was caught in the underwater rubble for 15 minutes. Two other divers went in after him and no one was injured, the Coast Guard said.<p>

The divers are being provided by Bisso Marine Co. of New Orleans, a salvage company.<p>

The unloading effort is centering on the damaged Number 1 cargo hold in the forward area of the ship because the bow is now aground.<p>

"The river is falling. It has gone down almost a foot (since Dec. 14) and they need to get some of that cargo out of there," port President  J. Ron Brinson said Friday.<p>

<H3>Ship siren drills banned at dockside, port president says</H3>
<h4>By Mary Judice</h4><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Cruise ships will have to wait until they are under way to familiarize passengers with fire and distress alarms, under new Port of New Orleans procedures. The port's President and chief executive, J. Ron Brinson addressed the three cruise ship lines that call at the port in a letter Friday (20 Dec.) He said Riverwalk employees have said they did not react to the Bright Field siren last Saturday because cruise ships routinely test sirens during safety drills. The cruise ships sail on Fridays and Saturdays.<p>

People "ultimately came to realize the danger and were able to evacuate the impact area in time. however, it is likely that their momentary confusion delayed their flight," said Brinson.

Ships using the Riverwalk berths, including the Julia Street Passenger Terminal shall not sound distress or fire alarms as part of on-board preparation drills.  The new procedure is effective Monday Dec. 22. Also the ships must contact the Harbor Police, Hilton Hotel, Riverwalk and One River Place when they conduct quarterly Coast Guard tests of sound alerts.<p>

The letters went to New Commodore Cruise Line Ltd,. Holland America Line, and Carnival Cruise Line. J. Robert Jumonville, deputy port director of corporate affairs, said executives at all three lines said they would discuss the change with attorneys and report back.<p>

The port is also asking them (cruise ships) to stage  life-boat drills once they have passed the Esplanade Avenue Wharf rather than at the terminal. This change still allows them to comply with Coast Guard regulations which require a drill within 24 hours of sailing.<p>

<H3>Little boats have mighty burden</H3>
<h4>By Joanna Weiss</h4><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

The VHF radio Channel 67 covers navigation along the Mississippi River and is always a buzz of activity. Ship pilots call each other as daily traffic moves along. In emergencies, the radio becomes more vital and the tones more urgent. The pilots ban together as colleagues.<p>

For four excruciating minutes last Saturday, as the Bright Field floated helplessly toward the Riverwalk, Channel 67 was a main conduit of information and a crucial signal for help. When the ship slammed the dock, pilot Ted Davisson called, "Get some tugs over here right now!" Within three minutes  the Bright Field was surrounded by smaller boats - tugs and tows working to keep the ship wedged in its tight parking spot between the cruise ship Niew Amsterdam and the Flamingo casino. <p>

As Davisson and his crew steered the ship to its narrow bert, the "regulars of the Mississippi River" the tug boat captains who jump from job to job and the radio operators who patrol ship traffic played a critical role in preventing further damage by the freighter.<p>

Tugboats are about 100 feet long and propelled by powerful engines. They plow through the Mississippi water helping larger vessels dock in narrow ports. Each tug is usually part of a fleet, dispatched out of a  central office to handle jobs both upstream and downstream. Algiers-based Crescent Towing owns 26 boats which do contract work along a 240-mile stretch of the river from mouth of the river to Baton Rouge.<p>

Though constantly at work, tugboat captains monitor the navigation channel to be alert to dangers and are quick to help in emergencies. Federal employees , all of them experienced river pilots, moderate radio conversations from towers with grand panoramic views.<p>

Mike Doyle 48, of Algiers, was working the control room Saturday at "Governor Nick," one of two federal watchtowers that guide traffic through the bends in the river at New Orleans. It was to have been his day off, but a friend wanted to go duck hunting. Doyle, an 18-year river pilot agreed to fill in. His shift started at 1:30 pm, 40 minutes before the Bright Field wreck.<p>

Governor Nick and the upstream unit, Gretna, are known in Coast Guard lingo as "traffic lights." With the flip of a switch, an operator can turn a light red or green to stop ship traffic or allow it to pass.<p>

On Friday (Dec. 20) , Doyle was in the Gretna tower, a mushroom shaped structure atop the West bank Levee. His swivel chair faced a semicircle of blue Formica countertop and a smattering of equipment: a radio speaker and mouthpiece, a huge pair of binoculars. Out the windows he can see a wide swath of the river, which curves out of sight around Algiers Point.<p>

He pointed toward a huge foreign ship headed toward the Crescent City Connection. As it slipped beneath the bridge it turned sharply to the left. That is standard procedure, Doyle said, as the boat maneuvered its way around the river's twists.<p>

When Davisson made that turn in the Bright Field a week ago, "he looked good', Doyle said."He looked like he was supposed to look." But when the ship lost its power, Davisson lost his ability to make the next step: turning the ship toward the right in time for the river's next big curve.<p>

From Doyle's vantage point south of the bridge, it looked like the ship was heading straight for the Flamingo. "I got on the phone knowing in my mind that there wasn't going to be time for the Flamingo to get away," he said.<p>

Doyle called the Flamingo first, then sent a radio message to the next ship heading downriver, hoping it would contact the Flamingo as well. He called the Coast Guard and told them to send ambulances.<p>

"I wanted everyone to know just how grave the situation was," Doyle said.<p>

Doyle said several tugboats and towboats in the area rushed to the scene. If those boats hand't held the bright Field in place, "something would have washed back out," Doyle said, "Just to hold him there so he can't go anywhere else."<p>

The six tug boats that motored to the Bright Field's side are all owned by Crescent Towing. Roy Spencer, a dispatcher at the company's Patterson Street headquarters had left his post for a moment, "They must have heard the signal," he said. "I got up to go get a Coke , and I came back and they were gone."<p>

Compared to the freighters and barges, the 90 to 100 foot tugboats are small, but powerful. The average tugboat weights about 98 tons and has a 3600-horsepower engine, Crescent Towing President Charles Andrews said. Unlike a tow boat, a square-fronted boat that pushes barges a long the river, a tug boat has a ship-like, tapered bow.<p>

It takes a bout eight minutes for a tug to cross the river at 12 to 15 mph, Andrews said. The Bright Field was probably traveling about 8 to 10 mph, Andrews said. When the Bright filed hit, several of Crescent Towing's tugs had recently finished jobs nearby. The <i>Louisiana </i>traveling on the river directly behind the freighter had just competed a job in Westego. The <i>Mississippi </i>was heading back to the dock for fuel.<p>

It was an amazing coincidence Spencer said. "We never have had five or six boats in this area."

Five minutes after the accident, Spencer's phone started ringing. The first call was from a lawyer who had spotted Crescent Towing's tugs on the scene and wanted to know if the company needed legal assistance. Subsequent calls came from wives of tugboat captains wanting to make sure their husbands were all right.<p>

The next day, some of Crescent Towing's European customers called the company, Andrews said, surprised that photographs of Crescent's boats had made front pages around the world.<p>

At one point, Crescent Towing had six tugs on the scene. Later Saturday evening the number dropped to four, and then to three on Tuesday. As of Thursday there have been two tugs on the scene. Andrews said the company is still running a bill for its services.<p>

That bill could get a hefty, a 3,600-horsepower tug likely costs about $500 an hour, said Don Scafidi, operations manager of Morill and Associates, a marine transportation company.<p>

In a conference room at Crescent Towing two plaques herald Crescent employees who assisted in a 1979 marine crash.<p>

Tugboat captains are prepared Andrews said. But "it doesn't happen on a daily basis, thank God."<p>

<b>Foreign Controversy</b><br>
Bright Field crash turns spotlight on the quality of foreign-flag ships<br>

Foreign Controversy
</H3>

Summary of article by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

This article focuses on the "flag of convenience" issue as a result of crash of the Bright Field , a ship owned by a Chinese company,  manned by a Chinese crew, under the direction of an American pilot, sailing under the Liberian Flag, going down the Mississippi River with a cargo of US crops bound for Japan.<p>

"The Bright Field operates as a "flag of convenience vessel" - a maritime category often involving a mixed bag of nationalities and a complex layer of international laws. Through the years, the practice has sparked controversy and bitterness and caused a line to be drawn along the shore between U.S. ship owners and the mariners who operate this country's dwindling merchant marine fleet."<p>

"A flag-of-convenience vessel is a ship controlled by owners in one nation who register their vessels in a smaller foreign country and operate under its flag. The practice exits primarily because flag-of convenience countries are cash-hungry emerging nations that charge lower taxes and ship-registry fees than industrialized countries, including the United States."<p>

Some say they are a cover to avoid taxes, allow the hiring cheaper foreign labor, get by with poorer training standards, and get by with marine safety standards  that fall below the Coast Guard's stringent requirements.<p>

Most vessels calling on the Lower Mississippi are foreign flagged vessels, one person estimated that 90 to 95 percent were foreign flagged.<p>

The article provides data on the number of U.S. flagged ships in the merchant marine fleet since 1970 as well as the number of billets (one job on a ship is a "billet", laws restrict crews to 6 months at sea so one billet actually employs  about 2.1 persons). The data indicates a decline in the number of U.S. ships from 843 in 1970 to 319 in 1996 and a decline in the number of billets on those ships from 40,248 to 8,603 over the same period.<p>

The paper visited with some industry experts who felt that the U.S. Seamen were the among best trained. "But on ship safety, many experts say some flag-of convenience vessels are well-maintained, while others aren't. " <p>

"The Bright Field is registered with the Liberian Maritime Office in Reston, Va., which has registered about 2,000 convenience ships since 1948. Efforts to reach administrators there for comment on the Bright Field incident were unsuccessful. But Brinson (J. Ron Brinson, president of the Port of New Orleans) said he was impressed with what he saw on the Bright Field even after it plowed into the Riverwalk. 'They were in the wrong location when little problems became big problems,' Brinson said, 'But initial reports are that maintenance was good and the crew was well-trained.'"<p>

The article goes on to discuss "classification societies", organizations that inspect ships registered around the world. The Bright Field's classification was issued after inspections by Det Norske Veritas, a Norwegian classification society. In the U.S. many inspections are performed by the American Bureau of Shipping.<p>



A representative of the California Maritime Institute (Mr. Sears) said, "U.S. flagged vessels are obviously in better shape because they fall under the Coast Guard's stricter inspection requirements but you're a Pollyana if you think ships that has been classified as unseaworthy end up as scrap. They just go somewhere else and keep on sailing."<p>

Mr. Davis at the Marine Engineers Union said accidents similar to the Bright Field are far more common that many people believe. 'They happen all the time," he said, "You just never hear about them, because they don't smash into a high-population area like the Riverwalk. But if you want safety,  you've got to pay for it. Ships are simple entities, until something goes wrong."<p>

The article included a graphic titled "Familiar Flags Along the River" that referenced data from the New Orleans Board of Trade for November 1 to 30, 1996. It said, 'Merchant ships flying the flags of 50 nations sailed into ports of the lower Mississippi in November" and then went on to list the top registries.<p>

<H3>
Built in Harm's Way</H3>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Along the riverfront and beneath the feet of passing tourists is a solid concrete wall that marks the end of land and the beginning of the river. The Riverwalk / Hilton Riverside Hotel complex is the only significant development that is built over the line. As the developers begin to rebuild, some warn that it is time to move to higher ground.<p>

15 years ago it was suggested that pavilions be built along the river from barges tied along the 1984 World Fair site. The port director, Edward Reed cited records showing  oceangoing ships had smashed into wharves lining the fair site 22 times in the last 7 years. His concerns and those of river pilots has led to an informal practice of discouraging developments of pedestrian heavy attractions on the portion of wharf that extends beyond the riverbank. When he, Reed, retired in 1986, he wrote, "This appears to provide a realistic margin of protection."<p>

After that guideline was established, one glaring exception was allowed, the Poydras Street Wharf, site of the Bright Field crash.  In the aftermath of this disaster which destroyed Riverwalk retail shops, Hilton Riverside hotel rooms, and parking spaces for One River Place  condo tower the discussion of locating public places beyond the river bank is being reopened.<p>

"Beneath the wharfs and buildings on the riverfront is a concrete bulkhead that marks the line between land and water. All of the devastation caused by the Bright Field occurred in that part of the Riverwalk and Hilton that extends beyond that concrete wall. The ship ran aground on the bank well before it reached the wall, which runs beneath the central mall walkway and landside shops in the down river half of the shopping mall."<p>

Other structures on the riverfront with the exception of Algiers Landing Restaurant stop at or shy of the bulkhead. Ron Brinson, president of the Port of New Orleans, is pushing Hilton executives for a risk assessment before rebuilding riverfront rooms. He points out that if the crash had occurred late at night when people were sleeping in those rooms the disaster could have been much worse. <p>

"'Lester Kabacoff, the top executive of International Rivercenter Inc., which built the riverfront project was joined by Hilton Hotel General Manager, Paul Buckley in saying that the complex will be rebuilt, quickly and at the same site.'"<p>

"'One major accident shouldn't jeopardize on the city's prime development spots', Kabacoff said."<p>

Buckley who spent a harrowing couple of hours Saturday afternoon before establishing that his wife and children were not trapped in the rubble of their apartment was equally adamant. "'I'm rebuilding the building. I'm putting my home back over there and I'm moving in there with my family.' he said."

"The complex that includes Buckley's apartment sits on wharf pilings directly over the river, well beyond the concrete bulkhead."<p>

Stopping construction at the "bankline" increases safety because it forces the boat to actually dig into the soil bank before hitting a building. The combination of hitting a wharf and running aground would absorb the ships impact in most cases. <p>

In the 1970's (before the World's Fair discussion) Kabacoff, developer of the Hilton Hotel, secured a 100-year lease of the Poydras wharf from the Dock Board. The lease permitted the building of the Hilton Hotel, the city's first riverfront hotel complex, and retailing space for the Rouse Co.'s Riverwalk mall. The development was largely fashioned out of "stout, decades-old wharf buildings."<p>

Kabacoff said he was struck by the difference in the New Orleans' wharf covered riverfront and the dense residential and retail developments along riverbanks in other port cities. His complex came to within  20 feet of the wharf's edge, and reached 100 feet beyond the levee bulkhead that roughly coincides with Reed's "bankline" which was felt by some to be outer limit of safe construction.<p>

As construction began in late 1981 river pilots began to voice their concerns. City Hall had no objections to the construction and the paper points out "the riverside development would still be legal under today's building codes."<p>

One argument used to promote the construction was that it would use an existing structure (wharf) and would at least initially be still used for its maritime construction purpose as a cruise ship terminal was going to be included in the development. Kabacoff, now 83, doesn't recall anybody questioning the wisdom of building the hotel and shop space well out onto the wharf. <p>

Another early 1980's deviation was the Algiers Landing 2  1/2 story restaurant built above the WOrld War II-era Bermuda Street Wharf. The restaurant has spectacular views of the downtown skyline and also of barges and freighters passing nearby. It was built by California-based Specialty Restaurants Corp just before the 1984 World's Fair  under a 1974 Dock Board Lease. During the restaurant's development barges rammed the old wharf twice causing $300,000 in damages. Algiers Landing is currently closed awaiting renovation and a planned reopening in 1997. Executives had no comment on the implications of the Bright Field incident.
Several agencies are looking into the danger posed to the restaurant by river traffic but no local or national regulations govern how close to a river public developments can be located.<p>

Treacherous River a Test of Pilot's Wisdom</H3><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

This article describes a ride down the river on ship. It discusses the difficulties along the path the Bright Field and many other ships take.<p>

Two men, one an expert on the river, and the other an expert on the ship meet on the Mississippi River. Their job is to maneuver the ship from St. James Parish to New Orleans,through  70 miles of narrow bends, roiling currents, fast eddies, shifting winds, little boats, and barges. Usually this journey runs smoothly hundreds of journeys a week, round-the-clock, year-round.  Hauling grain, chemicals, produce and petroleum  along the Mississippi River makes little news until a disaster like the Bright Field strikes.<p>

The paper makes a ride with Capt. Bobby Solar. Shortly before 5am Thursday he climbs onto the bridge of the Nord Jahre Target, a Norwegian tanker with a crew of 28, all but one from India. It is a crude oil tanker, 882 feet long, 145 feet wide, 142,000 dwt. It is one of the biggest ships on the river and is 150 feet longer and 80,000 tons heavier than the Bright Field.. The ship had been docked at the St.James Koch refinery for the last 2 days unloading 700,000 barrels of crude oil for Equatorial Guinea on the West coast of Africa. Now it is to head down river to the gulf, pickup a load of crude on the east coast of Mexico and deliver it to a refinery on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.<p>

Patil is the crews captain. He and his crew spend 4 months at sea at a time. <p>

"For Solar, it's a seven hour shift, his 182nd trip of the year, the 4,839th since winning his pilot's commission in 1974."<p>

The two captains have a very business like meeting reviewing the ships paperwork, dimensions, safety features, and wheelhouse.
Maritime law puts Solar here. Patil is internationally licensed to guide the tanker of the open ocean. Once inside the territorial waters of the U.S. he must yield navigational control to a federally commissioned pilot. There are more than 200 of them on the Mississippi. The purpose is to put the vessel in the hands of someone who knows the local waters, currents, conditions, and other idiosyncrasies. <p>

They lock into the Mississippi River communication channels and announce their position (nearing College Point) as they move down the river. Technical right of way rules don't mean much to a 142,000 ton ship. It cannot be stopped once its gets going. The paper translates the radio transmission as, "If you are anywhere near College Point you better get out of the way."<p>

Solar points our the variables involved in handling the ship: the river bottom, the eddy, and the wind. "It's almost like driving on ice." When I turn she's going to slide. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains a channel 500 feet wide all the way downstream for the big ships to travel in. They police themselves, there is  no equivalent to an air traffic control, just constant radio messages.<p>

Solar now 57 has three sons that are river pilots. He wears a crisp white uniform, black tie, captain's cap and captain's stripes. The uniform is optional and rare among other captains. Many wear jeans, baseball caps, and windbreakers. He finds it brings more respect and professionalism to his job. He enjoys eating whatever the foreign crews are eating and getting to meet people from all over the world. <p>

Along the route to New  Orleans they pass 3 ships moored and grounded because they lost power or steering coming up or down the channel. Solar said he could not count the number of times he has lost power or steering. At nearly every spot on the river he has a story of losing power there. "Its a feeling you never get used to . Everything gets quiet. The vibrating stops and you wonder: How am I going to get our of this?"<p>

"We  call it stand-up time. you get out of the chair and get up by the window and give it a little body English."
"Mostly things turn out all right. Tugs save the day, maybe the anchor drags the ship to a hault. Often the ship hits the mud, then the bank, knocking over a few trees maybe, but no shopping malls."<p>

Solar pointed out potential problems when he spotted a Turkish Freighter, Gengiz-K with no flag to indicate an association pilot on-board and no accompanying tugs, and with slack dock lines. Deckhands were along the rail trying to tie her down. He recognizes that a large wake could bust her loose and cuts the Target's engines. Shortly later he sees a fleet of barges 10 across and 5 deep, 800 tons each holding 1400 tons of cargo each held by a single anchor line. He once again cuts his speed to reduce his wake.<p>

As they pass the Riverwalk the crew members all gaze at the site of the recent Bright Field crash. Meanwhile, Solar is focusing on Algiers Point. This turn is so bad the Coast Guard has placed a control tower and traffic signal over the river on the Governor Nicholls Wharf. Seeing the massive Nord Jahre Target bearing down on them the tower operators hold all traffic to the south so the Target's stern can swing out and wide so broad that she keeps all comers at bay. Then she straightens out and kills her engines. Solar's job is done. Along the east bank at the Chalmette battlefield, a little schooner meets up with the drifting Target and Capt. Eric Short of the Crescent Pilots Association climbs aboard . It is the changing of the guard. The river pilots association runs the river from Arabi north to Baton Rouge and Crescent runs it from her south to the mouth of the river.  <p>

Solar greets the new captain, introduces him to his Indian counterpart, says goodbye to Patil, boards the little schooner and heads for shore. <p>

The article has 4 photos. Three of them are wheelhouse photos and one shows the tanker going under the Crescent City Connection bridge. None of them were scanned.<p>

Freighter had 2 emergency options</H3><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Not one, but two emergency operations could have boosted power to the Bright Field, this was learned by the U.S. Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board investigators for the first time Saturday when they hear of a <b>"crash maneuver" button.</b><p>

Guo Guang Qin the freighter's second engineer said the chief engineer could have used that button to restore power more quickly. It does not restore power as fast as the switch that overrides the automatic system, but it is quicker than the method Fang Jin Yun, chief engineer, used. when the automatic system started to slow down the engine after it detected a problem with a lubricating oil pump. <p>

The "crash maneuver button" would damage the engine, but not as severe as the override button, Guo said. <p>

The bridge  and the engine room both have both buttons and none of the options were used. Guo said, he';s never received specific instructions on how to use the override system and that no company protocol exists for when to use the crash maneuver button.<p>

After the accident the chief engineer said he was to use the crash button, "if and only if the bridge instructs the engine room for such a use," Saturday via interpreters. Fang testified he did not know the vehicle was faced with a crisis.<p>

The revelation of the "crash maneuver button" was the high point in Saturday's proceedings. The joint hearing will reopen January 6th.<p>

Investigators said it is too early to determine if using either button might have avoided the crash. "What we are seeing is a chain of events," Capt. Tony Regalbuto said, "There are so many variables. We are not even sure of the sequence of events at this time."<p>

Regalbuto said earlier witnesses (master and chief engineer) may be recalled for questions about this new button. When asked to elaborate on any discrepancies in testimonies, Regalbuto declined.<p>

The Coast Guard hopes to wrap up technical inspections of the ship's automation system and other components by January per Cmdr... Ken Parris. Today' s focus will be unloading corn from a damaged cargo hold and is expected to take about 15 hours.<p>

Saturday the hearing focused on technical details surrounding the engine and its components. The main lube pump and its maintenance schedule were scrutinized. Inspections, showed it noisy and hot to the touch.<p>

Rob Henry of the NTSB pressed Guo about the frequency of repairs to engine cylinders or pistons in the last four months. There were 9 separate repairs and two cylinder pistons had been repaired three times, he said.<p>

"Is this normal or is this excessive?" Henry asked.<p>

"Not very normal," Guo answered. He said the parts were damaged because the main engine exhaust temperature was too high - a problem fixed while the Bright Field was anchored at LaPlace prior to starting down the river last week.<p>

When questioned by lawyers from Clearsky Shipping Corp. of Liberia and COSCO of Hong Kong, the vessels owners and operators, Guo said he was satisfied with the repair. <p>

When the engine room received the order to reverse directions, the pre-existing forward motion of the large ship caused resistance, slowing the response. Fang, chief engineer said Friday the order was for full astern, not emergency full astern.<p>

"With respect to the crash maneuver button, would you ever punch it without getting an emergency full astern order?" asked lawyer James Roussel, who represented the shipowners.

"No," Guo answered.<p>

Tourist survived freighter crash</H3>
<h4>Kansas woman trapped in room</h4><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Overland Park KS- Rachel Gifford was trapped in her Hilton Hotel room for 30 minutes after the Bright Field crash and escaped with only a tiny bruise  on the inside of her right hand. <p>

Gifford is a professional education manager at a Kansas City MO pharmaceutical company and was on a business trip to New Orleans. He and a colleague, Lori Martin were approaching the end of a two-day training seminar when she went to her room to grab her luggage and store it with the bell captain for checkout.<p>

She decided to change her clothes. "I threw my shorts on the bed and went into the bathroom, and that's where I was when I heard the ship's horn," said Gifford who lives in Overland Park.<p>

She thought the horn meant a ship might be in trouble, but had not idea it was about to crash through her wall. When Bright Field hit the mall her fifth-floor room shook. At first she thought a generator was causing the vibrations. Then the ceiling broke and fell on her and she thought she was in an earthquake. <p>

"So I remembered to get to the door jamb," she said, "I slammed the door and stood against it....Everything started breaking."<p>

Water pipers burst. Mirrors shattered and flew off the walls. With glass flying, she stood with her back against the door, hands over her face, in a flooding room with a broken floor slanting at a 20-degree angle toward the river below.<p>

"Then I realized, 'Forget the door jamb; I have got to get out of here' ", she said.<p>

The broken ceiling blocked the bathroom door. She was scared, but trying to think of the right thing to do. Meanwhile here colleague, Martin was in the conference center where the conference was being held. 'I saw all these people running like a stampede of animals, but I didn't know what was happening," Martin said.<p>

Gifford said the because of her faith in God when was not scared of dying. "What scared me was that it would be a bad way  to go and it was going to hurt," she said. "I asked God, 'Is this it?' and a feeling came that everything would be all right. Then I asked 'If it's all right could you please open the door?"<p>

About 30 minutes later two fire fighters used an ax to open the wall between the bathroom and the hotel hallway. After she was pulled to safety and wrapped in a sheet, she ran five flights of stairs to the lobby.<p>

Martin said Gifford was shaken but calm. She gave Gifford some clothes. Gifford said her purse, credit cards, luggage, and briefcase were lost in the river.<p>

"My mother cried when she heard, and kept saying , 'I almost lost my daughter,' " Gifford said. "But I told her the key word is 'almost.' "

<b>BRIGHT FIELD MAY BE MOVED FRIDAY<br>
Reuters 23 December 1996</b>
<hr>

<H3>Ship that hit New Orleans pier may be moved Friday</H3>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, The Reuters World Service : Crews are working
at night to move 64,000 tons of corn from a crippled freighter that slammed into
a riverfront shopping mall nine days ago, the Coast Guard said Monday.</P>
<P>
If the corn can be moved to barges in time, the ship may be moved Friday, a
spokesman said.</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were injured when the M/V Bright Field lost power and
ploughed into the Riverwalk shopping strip Dec. 14, but no one was killed,
officials said.</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Tyler Johnson told Reuters <b>workers began moving the
corn in the bow of the ship Sunday evening. They work at night to lessen impact
from the clouds of grain dust caused by the transfer</b>, he said.</P>
<P>
Experts are continuing to assess how much of the debris from collapsed sections
of the multi-story mall and an overhanging wing of the Hilton Hotel are resting
on the ship, Johnson said.</P>
<P>
Since the accident, tugs have held the damaged freighter in place against the
damaged wharf. The bow of the ship is aground on the Mississippi River bank
beneath the Poydras Street Wharf near the historic French Quarter.</P>
<P>
``We're estimating now that the ship will be moved Friday,'' Johnson said. He
said maritime traffic, curtailed severely after the accident, was flowing
smoothly.</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard Board investigation into the causes of the accident was suspended
Saturday and will resume Jan. 6.</P>
<P>
Business owners and shoppers filed suit against the ship in U.S. District Court
here last week. Its owners, Clearsky Shipping Co. of Liberia and Cosco Hong
Kong, filed petitions in the same court under an 1851 maritime law to limit
their liability to the $16 million they say the damaged freighter is worth.</P>
<P>
Lawyer Daniel Becnel, who filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of businesses
in the damaged shopping centre, <b>said property damage from the accident was
estimated at $250 million, with at least an equal sum estimated for business
losses.</b> REUTER@</P>

<H3>Unloading corn is first step to moving Bright Field</H3><p>

Article summary by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Stevedores began unloading 3,000 long tons of corn from the bow of the Bright Field Sunday, the first step to moving the freighter. A crane from the Cooper/T Smith stevedoring firm scouped up the grain from the forward Number 1 hold and dumped it on a nearby barge. <a href="../photos/23corn.gif"><b>(see photo)</b></A><p>

The Coast Guard hopes to be able to re-float the vessel by removing 3,000 of the 7,000 long tons of corn in the  forward hold, one of seven on the ship, Lt. Cmdr. Doug Blakemore of the Coast Guard said.<p>

As the grain is removed, the ships ballast tanks are being filled with water to avoid undermining the support the ship may be giving the wharf. The corn is being removed because water ballast can be removed much faster. "When we decide to move the vessel, we want ot be able to do it quickly." Blackemore said.<p>

The grain unloading should be completed today (Dec. 23) and a decision on when to move the freighter should be made by Friday," Blakemore said. He also said, "It's seaworthy enough to move to another location in the port."<p>

A minor shifiting of the Riverwalk earlier Sunday did not delay the operation. Workers in the building were evacuated for about an hour when it was discoverd that a support beam inside the building near Cafe Du Monde had shifted slightly about 11am. Workers were allowed back in the building when it was determined the problem was not serious.<p>

Inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took samples of the grain to see if it had become contaminated. Tests will be completed today.<p>

Dauphin (<i>RBBI Note - from the article it is unclear who Dauphin is</i>)  said both the freighter and the cargo are likely to wind up in Japan. "I just don't know whether they'll go together," he said.

Riverwalk Businesses sue tanker owner; property damage, lost profits claimed <br>

<H3>
Riverwalk Businesses sue tanker owner; property damage, lost profits claimed in New Orleans
</H3>

<P>
Business Insurance. : NEW ORLEANS-Business owners on the New
Orleans Riverwalk are looking to owners and insurers of the M/V Bright Field to
make up lost holiday profits and pay for damages caused when the freighter lost
control on the Mississippi River and rammed into the popular shopping area
earlier this month.</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a monumental claim," said Joseph M. Bruno, an attorney with
Bruno &amp; Bruno in New Orleans, which is representing plaintiffs in one of the
suits. "Not in the usual case of fear and fright and personal injury. This case
will be the business interruption. This time of year is their bread and
butter."</P>
<P>
At least three lawsuits were filed last week as investigators from the U.S.
Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board were trying to determine
why the Liberian-registered ship carrying 61,600 tons of corn lost its ability
to steer and crashed into the wharf Dec. 14.</P>
<P>
The ship ripped into the 182,000-square-foot shopping area owned by The Rouse
Co. and came to rest between the Flamingo Casino gambling boat and the Nieuw
Amsterdam cruise ship. At least 116 people were injured, including some who were
evacuating the gambling boat and cruise ship as the Bright Field headed for the
wharf. No fatalities were reported as of late last week.</P>
<P>
An NTSB inquiry last week focused on language problems between the river pilot
and the Bright Field's Chinese-speaking crew as a possible contributor to the
accident. The pilot, Ted Davisson, testified that the crew was nonchalant about
responding to his orders as the ship veered out of control. The captain of the
vessel, however, later testified that he had declined to follow some of the
pilot's commands immediately because he felt it would have put the cruise ship
at risk.</P>
<P>
At least nine stores suffered significant damage when the ship rammed the wharf,
and a parking garage for residents of One River Place condominiums was damaged,
according to New Orleans Mayor Marc H. Morial's office. A section of about 40
rooms at the New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel collapsed, according to a
statement released by the hotel.</P>
<P>
Although only a small number of stores were damaged, business interruption
claims are expected from many of the mall's 120 stores and restaurants, because
the entire development was closed after the accident and remained closed late
last week.</P>
<P>
Property owners were not releasing damage estimates last week, but sources in
New Orleans have said they think the Hilton and One River Place each sustained
about $9 million in damages, while it will cost about $5 million to repair the
shattered wharf.</P>
<P>
"It could have been much worse," said Robert Martin, risk manager for the City
of New Orleans. "That big ship stopped about 50 feet from the gambling boat. It
could have been a catastrophe."</P>
<P>
Mayor Morial said it is a "Christmas miracle" that "no one was killed or
severely injured in this accident."</P>
<P>
The ship remained at the wharf late last week, held in place by tugs and helping
support the mall structure that hung above the river. A 15-foot hole was ripped
into the ship's bow, and twisted mini-blinds dangled from its prow.</P>
<P>
Two lawsuits seeking class certification were filed in state and federal court
in New Orleans. The suits were filed on behalf of Riverwalk business owners and
anyone who suffered injuries as a result of the accident. The suits seek
undetermined amounts for property damage, business interruption and personal
injury.</P>
<P>
Defendants in both suits are COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co. Ltd., Clearsky Shipping
Corp. and/or Cordiality Shipping Corp. S.A. All are foreign corporations
identified as having ownership or other interests in the Bright Field. The
defendant corporations also are listed as employers of the master and crew,
though it is unclear from the lawsuit exactly who employed them.</P>
<P>
An attorney close to the case said the original filings named the wrong
liability insurer for the ship but would be amended to name the correct
underwriter, West of England Ship Owners Insurance Services Ltd., a London-based
protection and indemnity association.</P>
<P>
The suit filed in state court names Mr. Davisson and Dixie Machine Welding &amp;
Metal Works Inc. of New Orleans. The machine shop is believed to have performed
repairs on the ship.</P>
<P>
A third suit was filed in U.S. District Court against the ship's owners by
residents of One River Place.</P>
<P>
West of England provides the ship's owners with scoverage for personal injury,
property damage and business interruption exposures, according to Michael
Kelleher, claims director at the club. The P&amp;I club's limit for 1996 is $20
billion.</P>
<P>
Mr. Kelleher declined to reveal the coverage's deductible but did say it was
very small. "The deductibles in P&amp;I are habitually modest."</P>
<P>
Hull coverage is written for undetermined limits by The Ming An Insurance Co.
(H.K.) Ltd., a Hong Kong-based insurer.</P>
<P>
It appears only a small amount of the cargo of corn was lost, according to
William E. O'Neil of the New Orleans law firm of O'Neil &amp; Eichin, which
represents owners of the cargo.</P>
<P>
He said the entire shipment, bound for a Japanese port, was valued at about $7
million. The corn, owned by several Japanese interests, whom Mr. O'Neil declined
to name, is insured by Tokyo-based insurers Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co.
Ltd. and The Nippon Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., according to Mr. O'Neil.</P>
<P>
Clearsky filed proceedings in U.S. District Court in New Orleans last Wednesday
seeking to limit its liability to the value of the vessel.</P>
<P>
Maritime law limits a shipowner's liability to the amount of the value of the
vessel and its cargo if it is found that the owner had no awareness of
negligence that led to damages.</P>
<P>
Liability is not limited if it is found the owner knew or should have known
about negligence that leads to damages.</P>
<P>
"Limitations are successful one in a hundred times; they are very, very rare,"
said Michael Delesdernier, a New Orleans attorney who filed the suit on behalf
of One River Place.</P>
<P>
Estimates of the value of the vessel have ranged from about $10 million to $17.5
million.</P>
<P>
When the ship plowed into the wharf, the damage affected several property
owners.</P>
<P>
The wharf on which the Riverwalk and the Hilton Hotel is built is owned by the
Port of New Orleans, according to a spokesman at the authority.</P>
<P>
He said the port authority has $20 million in property coverage placed by Aon
Risk Services with Lloyd's of London syndicates managed by QBE Underwriting
Agency Ltd. Excess property insurance with limits of $600 million to $700
million is written by Protection Mutual Insurance Co. to cover the 25 miles of
wharf along the river.</P>
<P>
The Port of New Orleans' liability limits reach $51 million, with the first $1
million written by Lloyd's syndicates and the remainder by American Home
Assurance Co. in New York, the spokesman said. The liability coverage carries a
$100,000 deductible.</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he believes the port authority is not "liable in any way
whatsoever,9 for the accident. "We are victims in this."</P>
<P>
The port authority has contractual agreements that call for property owners on
the wharf to accept responsibility for any repairs to their property, he added.</P>
<P>
The Rouse Co., based in Columbia, Md., owns the Riverwalk complex of 120 shops
and restaurants that was damaged in the accident. The company would not
speculate on what it will cost to repair damage to the complex but indicated
that adequate insurance is in place to cover the loss.</P>
<P>
"The company maintains comprehensive (casualty) and business interruption
insurance at all its properties, including Riverwalk, and therefore does not
anticipate any financial issues in terms of rebuilding the project nor any
adverse impact on the company's operating income," said Anthony W. Deering,
president and CEO of The Rouse Co., in a statement released last week.</P>
<P>
Hilton Hotels Corp. would not estimate the cost for repairs to the 1,600-room
hotel, which remained open after the accident.</P>
<P>
Hilton also owns the Flamingo Casino riverboat, which was not damaged.</P>
<P>
The hotel chain estimated there were about 650 customers and crew on board and
about 30 sustained minor injuries during the evacuation.</P>
<P>
The accident will mean river safety in the area likely will get a closer look,
but some observers say that much of the initial controversy over the danger of
operating on this part of the Mississippi River was overblown.</P>
<P>
"There will always be a concern when you mix people with machinery," said the
port authority spokesman. "There's no doubt that the river can be a very
dangerous place to work."</P>
<P>
However, he added: "This is the most heavily trafficked river in the world," and
mixing passenger boats and commercial ships is nothing new. I don't know if
there will be any kind of movement to limit it. I'm sure there will a lot of
rhetoric coming out of it."</P>

<b>Most of Riverwalk Reopen by Super Bowl</b><br>
Times-Picayune 24 December 1996  pages A1 and A7<br>
by Pamela Coyle<hr>

<H3>
Most of riverwalk likely to reopen by Super Bowl'</H3><p>


Article was summarized by Gary Polson RBBI<p>

Almost all of the Riverwalk's 100 stores should reopen by the week before the Super Bowl. The most heavily damaged businesses will reopen late in the summer per Mall officials in a Monday media tour of the riverside center.<p>

"We feel the (dates) are achievable but not definite," said Brian Lade, the Riverwalk's vice president and general manager. The mall's managers and merchants had hoped to reopen for the Sugar Bowl (Jan. 2nd) but the work to stabilize the building made that impossible. In addition to 90 stores about half the stalls in the Levee market on the mall's upper level and 30 pushcart merchants should be open the week of Jan. 20. <p>

Monday workers continued to stabilize the building. A support column in the malls atrium had moved another inch Sunday. Workers also tried to restore utilities to the dark and damp shopping center. Stores in the middle sustained the most damage. Rouse Co., the mall's owner and operator will build a temporary corridor to connect the ends of the mall.<p>

Unloading of the corn from the damaged cargo holds was halted Monday night after stevedores found they were digging into wet corn, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Work stopped at 7:30 pm after 400 tons had been removed , said Lt. Lonnie Harrison marine inspector. Water had seeped in through a 1-by-3 foot gash below the hold, he said.<p>

Before the Bright Field can be moved special sonar must determine whether debris resting against the hull. If it is and the ship is moved the rest of the structure may come down said Bob Darcy, deputy chief with the New Orleans Fire Dept.<p>

Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Doug Blakemore had said the freighter might be moved today if engineers conclude it is safe. It would be taken to Boland Marine on the West bank for repairs.<p>

The freighter's owners, Clearsky Shipping Corp. of Liberia and COSCO, a Chinese shipping company have estimated in court papers that repairing the Bright Field will cost about $2 million. There have been no public estimates for the mall, hotel, condominium, and other properties, but one attorney has predicted property damage will top $250 million. <p>

Monday, attorneys for the mall, the hotel, the merchants, the port, the Flamingo Casino, customers, bystanders, insurance companies, and the shipowners met for nearly three hours in federal court to iron our preliminary details in the main lawsuit over the 
crash.<p>

<TITLE>Bright Field Times Picayune 27 Dec - Ship's hold is 'Swiss cheese'</TITLE>

<b>Ship's hold is 'Swiss cheese'</b><br>
Times-Picayune 27 December 1996  pages A1 and A7<br>
by Chris Gray<hr>

<H3>
Ship's hold is 'Swiss cheese'</H3><p>

Patchwork on the Bright Field moved slowly Thursday as officials and marine inspectors discovered more holes and a shakey concrete beam inside the freighter's flooded cargo hold.<p>

"It looks like Swiss cheese in there," said Robert Garcia, a technical adviser at the Riverwalk accident site. At least four major holes have been found beneath the waterline of the damaged vessel and more may be discovered during an inspection by divers, he said.<p>

The hold contains a bout 15 feet of water and 20 feet of mushy corn, cargo that has turned to a semisolid substance like rice or pudding, officials said.<p>

The ship contained 128 million pounds of corn when it smashed into the Riverwalk shopping mall, the Hilton Hotel, and a parking garage Dec. 14. Workers started unloading the cargo earlier this week, but stopped when the new holes were found.<p>

Officials with Cargill Inc. have not placed a value on the lost yellow corn, which was loaded in Reserve before the accident, company spokesman Allen Holbert said.<p>

Coast Guard officials had hoped to start patching holes with divers from Pac Brian Industrial Divers of Baton Rouge Thursday morning. But the operation hit a snag when workers found a concrete beam lying diagonally across the cargo hold.<p>

Until the beam was stabilized, no divers would go down for inspection, said Pac Brian, owner of the dive company.<p>

The company also had to finish setting up a hoist for the diver. The company planned to connect a winch to an internal cable and lower the diver from a 14-foot boat inside the cargo hold, Garcia said.<p>

The diver would first inspect the inside and tabulate the size and number of holes, Garcia said. If the holes are small, they can be patched with wood shingles, he said. Bigger holes will have to be welded shut.<p>

"If we can patch it, we can patch it today," Garcia said Thursday.<p>

But by 3:30 pm, diver Rick Buhrnes had yet to don his suit for the job. Along with hard hatted Coast Guard officials and technical advisers, he plotted the best way to approach the mass of water and gelatinous corn.<p>

"This is going to be a first.," he said.<p>

Last week Buhrnes was exploring the outside of the freighter when a small pipe fell of his arm pinning him underwater for about five seconds. Three people pulled him up by his "umbilical" diving cord, Brian said.<p>

So Buhrnes was skittish about the unstabilized concrete beam. "I don't want to get under that now," he said.<p>

Once the holes are patched workers will start pumping water out and getting the Bright Field ready to sail upriver, officials said. But no one is taking any bets on when the freighter will push away from the wharf because the vessel is partially supporting the damaged buildings.<p>

"We're waiting for engineers to get back to us on the  stability of the building," Coast Guard officer Patrick Cuty said. "It's got no schedule.

<b>Ship that hit New Orleans Riverwalk to be moved<br>
Reuters  6 January 1997</b>
<hr>

<H3>Ship that hit New Orleans Riverwalk to be moved</H3>

<P>
NEW ORLEANS, The Reuters World Service : Crews were working
on Monday to refloat and move the grounded freighter that slammed into a popular
shopping mall on the banks of the Mississippi River last month, the Coast Guard
said.</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were injured when the M/V Bright Field, carrying 64,000
tonnes of corn, lost power and ploughed into the Riverwalk shopping strip on
Dec. 14. Coast Guard officer Patrick Cuty told Reuters the freighter will be
moved 18 miles (30 km) downriver for repairs in a 90-minute operation.</P>
<P>
Since the accident, tugs have held the freighter in place against the damaged
wharf. The bow of the ship had been aground on the Mississippi River bank
beneath the Poydras Street Wharf near the city's historic French Quarter.</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m. CST (1700 GMT), three hours after crews began pumping out 1.5 million
gallons (6 million litres) of water that had flooded the forward cargo hold
through a massive gash in the hull, the ship was beginning to float, Cuty said.</P>
<P>
He said the ship's power had been restored but eight tugs were standing by to
assist it. The river will be briefly closed to traffic as the crippled 735-foot
(224 metre) freighter is backed away from the wharf and barges are moved in to
help support the sagging Riverwalk.</P>
<P>
Engineers and heavy equipment were on standby in case the collapsed sections of
the structure and a parking garage shift when the vessel is moved, Cuty said.</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard Board investigation is still working to determine the cause of the
accident.

<b>Crews ready to move freighter across the Mississippi River<br>
AP 6 January 1997</b>
<hr>

<H3>Crews ready to move freighter across Mississippi River</H3>

<P>
NEW ORLEANS - Workers Monday began pumping out the ballast tanks
of the crippled freighter <strong>Bright</strong> <strong>Field</strong> - the last step in preparing
to move it from the spot where it rammed the Riverwalk mall three
weeks ago.
<P>
&quot;It's all emptied out underwater, so what you see is a bunch
of Coast Guardsmen standing around watching marks on the hull,''
said Patrick Cuty, on-scene coordinator for the U.S. Coast Guard.
<P>
The marks, called Plimsoll lines, indicate how many feet of hull
remain underwater.
<P>
Cuty said officials expected to need up to six hours before the
735-foot ship was light enough to ease away from the Hilton Hotel
and wharf it rammed on Dec. 14. Eight Coast Guard tugboats were
on hand to tow the freighter to a shipyard in Violet, on the other
side of the Mississippi River. The trip itself should take about
90 minutes, Petty Officer Aaron Holton said.
<P>
Monday's operation was to involve several precautions: closing
the Riverwalk to onlookers, creating a &quot;no-fly zone'' around
the freighter, sending the Flamingo riverboat casino on a cruise
while the <strong>Bright</strong> <strong>Field</strong> was moved, and closing the Mississippi
River to all traffic.
<P>
Officials decided to move the freighter after they abandoned a
plan to patch a gaping hole below the water line while the <strong>Bright</strong>
<strong>Field</strong> remained at the Riverwalk. More than 1.5 million gallons
of water had flooded a damaged cargo hold, turning tons of corn
into mush.
<P>
The <strong>Bright</strong> <strong>Field</strong> was en route to Japan with 128 million pounds
of corn when it apparently lost power and sliced into the crowded
Riverwalk mall, demolishing part of the mall, the hotel and a
condominium garage. No one was killed, but more than 100 people
were injured.
<P>
At the same time that the pumps began working Monday, the Marine
Safety Board resumed its hearing into the crash.

<li>CENSUS DATA<p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the data found in the <i>STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE U.S.</i> (Step 2.1) back to the original source. There is often more information there.<p>

<li>Use the annual <i>CENSUS CATALOG AND GUIDE</i><br>
Identify the specific census reports needed.<p>
</ol>

In addition to the Population Census the government regularly (each 5 years) conducts extensive censuses of business areas. 1987 and 1992 are the two most recent business census years. Some of the 1992 data is still being processed.<p>

Different Censuses cover these areas:Construction, Retail Trade, Manufacturing Industries, Service Industries, Transportation, Mining, and Agriculture.<p>


Older census data is available at the OSU Library Federal Documents area.<br>
Current Census information is available on-line. It is usually easier to find the older documents in paper form and learn more about their content and exact titles and then begin searching for the online updated versions. The 4 major online sources are: <p>

<ol>
<li><A href="http://www.census.gov">Census Bureau</A> on the web.<p>

<li><A href="http://www.fedworld.gov">FEDWORLD</A> on the web.<br>
Fedworld is a web site with a lot of federal information on it. From this site you can Telnet to fedworld.gov and get to the fedworld bulletin board. This site has about 150 government databases on it. You can go to the Bureau of Economic Affairs bulletin board for the latest census data. You can also post questions and interact with the census people to learn even more.<p> 
 
<li><A href="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/cir/www/">Current Industry Reports (CIR)</A> are U.S. government prepared reports on many industries and provide a great deal of current information. A somewhat similar set of reports filed by the Canadian government, <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_indps/engdoc/homepage.html">Canadian Industry Statistics</a>, is also a great resource.<p>

<li>Some Oklahoma Census Data is available on-line in the ORIGINS Database at 405-325-5883  N-8-1. It is also available by telnet at: tel-origins.uoknor.edu.  It is <a href="http://www-nt.cba.ou.edu/departments/origins/">described</A> on the web.<p>
</ol>


<li>Proposed and recent <b>Government Regulations </b>for the industry can usually be found at THOMAS on the web. The other sites listed below can be used to look for existing laws.<p>

<li>Annual Corporate Reports<br>
These provide a great deal of general industry information as well as specific company information. They also identify government regulations effecting the industry and often give market share information.<p>

Look up reports from several companies in the industry to get a feel for the reoccurring issues. <h3>Use this information and any other issues found from the literature to develop a list of the industry's current concerns.</h3> If you are only investigating a specific company, look up its direct competitors as well.<p>

Annual reports are available locally from 4 sources:<p>

<ol>
<li>Write the company and request one. You can use the CD-ROM Disclosures index at OSU to find their corporate address. You can also search it by SIC code to determine their competitors and others in the same industry. If you will write several of them you can use their reports to put together a very good profile of the industry.<p>

<li>OSU Microfilm Library has a SEC Microfiche collection which includes annual reports.<p>

<li>OU Microfilm Library has a larger and more current SEC Microfiche collection.<p>

<li>A few companies are now putting their annual reports on the web. A listing of them is provided by <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Markets_and_Investments/Corporate_Reports">Yahoo Corporate Reports</A><p>

If you wish to follow the company long term, consider purchasing stock in the company. It will assure you get current annual reports and stockholder mailings. Some brokers specialize in odd-lot (single share) purchases.<p>

<li><i>PREDICASTS</i>, an index of forecasts<br>
TULSA PUBLIC LIBRARY 4th Floor Business Desk<br>
This is an excellent resource. We rarely turn to it as we must go to Tulsa to use it. It is an index of hundreds of business periodicals and only indexes those articles that make forecasts about industries.<p>

<li><i>PREDICASTS F&S Index</i><br>
This is a printed index of business periodicals. It is printed in different frequencies (weekly and monthly). The weekly version is the fastest printed index available to cover current issues. It is indexed by both company name and by SIC code which makes it easy to follow an industry. OSU no longer receives the weekly. An online version is continuously updated and available on a fee basis. <br>
OSU# 016.332 F9821 (monthly version) in Second Floor Reference area<br>

<li>Trademarks are very important in some industries. They can also be searched at the OSU Patent and Economic Development Library. Trademarks have to be registered with other countries to be recognized internationally.<p>



<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> Has one company or even a few individuals led the industry in patents? or especially in the more significant patents? Is the number of patents being granted each year in the industry increasing, decreasing, or remaining the same? You can check some specific patent classifications and search single years by class on the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">USPTO</a> site.<p>

<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> Are there a few very significant patents in the industry (such as drug patents). When do these key patents expire? How might the industry change when they expire? Do licensing agreements currently allow others to make the product?  What are the terms (lengths) of those agreements? Significant patents will be pointed out in the marketing literature describing the features of the product. If one company's product has a very important feature and no one else's product does, they have a competitive advantage. This competitive advantage may be due to intellectual property.<p>

<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> Determine Specific Individuals (and their driving factors)  Involved in the Company<p>
<ul>


<li>Assemble a list of the officers and  members of the board of directors of the company. You probably have already acquired this information in your review of  CD-ROM Disclosures, SEC, Dunn & Bradstreet, other company profiles, or the annual corporate report. If you have difficulties finding officers of smaller companies, try the state corporation commission. In addition to identifying the individuals, see if you can determine how long the major executives have been in office, their age, and their expected term of office. Also see if they are known for any special management techniques (re-engineering, major layoffs, cut throat competition, growth by acquisition, downsizing, etc.) This information will usually turn up in news clips and articles about the company or companies the execs worked for in the past. If the leaders are long term execs of the same company in a slow moving industry the inference is for more of the same in terms of management techniques and product introductions. If a new C.E.O. with very dynamic background has just been hired and the industry is in turmoil, a radical future might be anticipated. <p>

<li>What is the compensation plan for the C.E.O. of the board of directors. Do they own significant amounts of company stock? These questions  are usually answered in the annual report. The C.E.O.'s compensation package, age, and stock position may help predict his/her actions in certain situations. <p>


<li>Does the board take an active part in management of the company? What kind of a relationship do they have with the C.E.O.? What percentage of the board members are insiders (work for the company)? Is the board composed of high quality people that can give proper guidance to the company? How many boards does each board member serve on? Are they spread to thin to be of value to this company? The annual report plus news clips on the company will usually answer these questions.<p>


<li>Are there other individuals that significantly impact the operations of the company? Sometimes a single inventor may be responsible for a company's new products (check the patents), a great financial mind might be calling the investments for a brokerage house, a prize winning architect may be drawing business to the company. Would the company be significantly impacted by the death or departure of a few key individuals?<p>

<li>What is the status of the work force? Age? Well trained? Union/ non-union? Major labor contract problems? Availability of more workers?  Use of teaming and cross training? Employee turnover? Employee satisifaction? Many of these items can be answered from an annual report, others may require visiting with the company. <p>

Employee satisfaction is an important but tough variable. It might be inferred from employee turnover rates, number of employees working there for a long time, human resources dept that provides training and the latest programs, good pay relative to other similar companies, low warranty levels, no recent or anticipated layoffs, etc. But, it is difficult for an outsider without access to the company to make a real determination.<p>

<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> If you are using this outline only to learn about a specific company, you can take the industries the company is in and use the some of the other sections of the outline to develop a wider picture of where the company operates. Select the sections you think will be most relevant and be sure to use the <a href="#general">Seek General Industry Information</A> and <a href="#competition">Define the Type of Competition in the Industry</A> sections. 
</ol>


<hr><p>
<a name="competition"></A>
<li>Define the Type of Competition in the Industry<p>

<ol>
<li>During the "Seek General Industry Information" and the "Find Information About Specific Companies in the Industry" steps you should have developed a list of industry competitors and have some concepts of their market shares. You can now use that information to Define the Type of Competition in the Industry by classifying it as one of the types below.<p>

<ul>
<li>MONOPOLY<br> 
Only one firm selling a particular product. Usually the result of patent, trade secret, or government protection. Examples are newly developed and patented drugs, coca-cola, and local utility companies.<p>

<li>OLIGOPOLY<br>
A few firms, generally large, comprise most of the industry's sales. They try to get consumers to perceive their brand as distinctive. The market is usually large and broken into segments. Examples are the auto industry, breakfast cereals, cigarettes, and outboard engines.<p>

<li>MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION<br>
Several firm, each trying to offer a unique marketing mix. Firms try to obtain advantage through a mix of marketing variables. Examples are Service Stations, Beauty Salons, and Shoe Retailers.<p>

<li>PURE COMPETITION<br>
Many firms, all selling identical products. Examples are commodities such as wheat and soybeans.<p>

</ul>

The Manufacturing Census also provides information about the concentration of certain industries (what percentage of the total industry sales are due to the largest 5,10,25,50 companies).<p>


 "Concentration Ratios"  indicate what percentage of the total business in a four digit SIC code is being done by the largest firms in the industry. The Manufacturing Census  report is called "Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing" and is numbered MC(yr)-S-6 (where yr is last two digits of the census year). It indicates the percentage of business done by the top 4, 8,20, and 50 companies in each four digit SIC code industry. The full 1992 printed report is expected to be available in December of 1996; however, some of the data is already available on-line in Fedworld at the Census Bureau site. More information about the Census of Manufactures is available at <a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/ma0100.html">http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/mc0100.html</A>. You can read the page and then you can click on "VIEW" in the top left corner to move on into the census.<p>

Similarly the Retail Census has a report called 1992 Establishment & Firm Size Subject Series #RC92-S-1. This report provides information on the size of the companies, sales statistics, employment size, multi-unit info, payroll, and concentration of the largest firms.<p>

As you examine this data you need to remember it is from 1992 and the situation may have changed sinced then. Anyway, concentration data provides an interesting view of the industry.<p>

The type of competition and the current and anticipated future growth rates of an industry are major factors in determining the approaches its companies take to new products, marketing, expansion, relocation, and other matters.

<li>Describe the overall industry as currently growing, stable, or shrinking.<p>

<li>Describe the future prospects for the overall industry as growing, stable or shrinking.<p>


<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> Look at the product line of the competitors in the industry (found in annual reports, marketing literature, advertisements). How do the competitors vary in terms of depth (different models or sizes of a product) and breadth (different products).<p>

<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> How do the various competitors distribute their products (distributors, direct sales, mail order, online sales). Do they all use the same distribution channels, does one company employ channels not used by others?<p>

<li> <img src="../artwork/new.gif"> How do the companies in the industry try to differentiate themselves from their competitors (features, distribution, service, added value, resale value, durability, high performance, low initial cost, easy availability, prestige, identify stars or professionals with their product, affiliate with sports teams or events, etc) ?

<hr><p>
<a name="interview"></A>
<li>Interview People From the Industry<p>

After becoming familiar with the industry by gathering data in the earlier steps, now we begin to try to interact, interview, or find prior conversations with distributors, end users, and others in the distribution chain.<p>

<ol>
<li>Internet news groups offer an excellent opportunity to read the postings of end users of many consumer products. The appropriate news groups to examine can be found using the <a href="http://www.cen.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/find-news">FIND NEWSGROUPS SITE</A>. This site can be searched by newsgroup topic (not by the actual postings themselves). Then you can subscribe to the group and read what has been posted. The actual postings themselves can be word searched by <a href="http://www.dejanews.com">DEJANEWS</A>. Using Dejanews you can search for specific company names or products to locate recent postings using those words.<p>


<li>Personally interview people associated with the industry. This is an excellent source of information. Try to interview 3 or more at each distribution level. Make up a list of questions to try to fill in any gaps in the earlier research and to learn about the product and its competitors. If you ask the same questions each time it gives you a good cross section of responses.<p>

<center>
<h3>PROCEDURE<p></h3>
</center>

Typically we perform steps 1 through 4 and then select some of the other steps depending upon the particular situation.<p>

Often a considerable amount of information is gathered as the study is conducted.<p>
<ul>
<li>Separate it into folders by category (by step).
<li>Identify the major competitors in the industry and their market shares.
<li>Identify the current concerns of the industry.
<li>Identify government regulations effecting the industry (existing and proposed).
<li>Identify trends in the industry.
<li>Determine the life stage of the industry. (Technological Forecasting)<p>

<li>Prepare the above information in a graphical format.<p>

<li>Write a short overall report and a short summary of each category. Take a binder and put the overall report and the graphics at the front, follow it with the category summary and the background materials for each category. Prepare tabs to make the binder easier to use. Large reports may need to be split into two or more binders.<p>


<li>Make zerox copies of the final report as necessary.<p>
</ul>

<h4>A Polson Enterprises Web Site<br>
<i>Last Update 28 December 1996</i></h4></CENTER>


It is our belief that "Home Pages" for specific industries will develop on the internet to bring the web content (or links to it) for that industry to a central point. This page will provide links to those Industry Home Pages. This page can be used by those in industry searching for their "Home Page",  by business researchers, and by webmasters of industry "Home Pages" looking for additional ideas to use on their sites. <p>

These sites typically begin life as a list of web sites useful to a specific industry, then the individual or firm running the site begins to secure advertising and the site expands. Typically individuals or firms maintain only one industry specific site, however; one group, <a href="http://www.findlinks.com/index.html"> Find Links</A> hosts a number of these sites in various stages of growth. We have included their sites in the lists below.<p>

A group of similar non-U.S.A. "industry sites" is provided below the USA list, as is a brief general industry site list.<p>


<h4>
If you are aware of any "industry site"  that is not listed, please E-mail us the URL at

<center><h4>Industry Research Desk</h4>
<h3>North American Industry Classification System<br>
<b>NAICS</b></h3></center>


<hr>
A new classification system, <b>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</b>, is being prepared to replace the old <b>Standard Industry Classification (SIC) system</b>. This new system will update the classifications to include many categories that did not exist in the past. It also allows one system to cover goods as they move through NAFTA. <p>

Researchers familiar with using the old SIC codes will have to use the new codes and industries relying on SIC series trade data (production, shipment, import, export data for each month) for<b> forecasting</b> and other purposes may be in for some surprises as the systems blend together and the new classification emerges.<p>

Approval for the new codes is expected by January 1, 1997.<p>

We are listing some web sites with information on the new NAICS system and some articles describing the system for your use in preparing for the new system.

<hr>

<h4>OnLine NAICS Resources</h4><p>
<ul>
<h4>
<li><a href="http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/sep/sic.htm">The SIC are Dying</A> published in Sept. 1996 Searcher Magazine<p>

<li><a href="http://www.ntis.gov/business/sic.htm">NTIS (National Technical Information Service) NAICS site</A><p>

<li><a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/epcd/www/naics.html">U.S. Bureau of Census NAICS site</A></p>

<li><a href="gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu:70/11/socsci/econ/naics/">University of Michigan NAICS gopher site</A></p>
</h4>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4> NAICS Articles</h4><p>

The 2 December 1996 issue of <i>Industry Week</i> has an article titled, "No NIX on NAICS", on pages 47-48. <p>
<ul>
<li>It explains the proper pronunciation of NAICS as "nakes"<p>

<li> They explain the new structure to be much more logical and categorizes similar things closer together. Many of the "not elsewhere used" categories have been broken into several new categories. The switch also ensures the proper classification of some industries like warehousing and logistics. The relatively new areas of computers, televisions, software, and information are updated or included for the first time.<p>

<li>They suggest you maintain your business prospects lists in both the SIC and the NAICS classifications for the short term. <p>

<li>The article points out the system will be able to track goods through the NAFTA area.<p>

<li>The new codes will be 6 digit numbers instead of the old 4 digit SIC codes. <p>

<li> Approval for the new codes is expected by January 1, 1997<p>
</ul>

Which search engine to use  become a matter of personal preference and the exact task at hand. <b>Yahoo </b>is the time honored favorite for general searches and coming up with relevant links. It is more of a directory of groups of sites than a search engine. <b>Hotbot </b>and <b>Alta Vista</b> seem to be currently leading the pack of true search engines. They will search for specific terms and the responses may or may not be relevant. I also frequently use <b>Lycos</b>, <b>Excite,</b> and <b>WebCrawler</b>. I suggest you give them a try and see which ones work best for you. The additional engines are for special cases, searching more than one database, or have additional capabilities.<p>

<h4>A Polson Enterprises Web Site<br></h4>





<hr>

This a brief introduction to the internet for those doing research in the areas of industry, manufacturing, manufacturing processes, and specific companies.
<hr>

<h3>Recommendations For Providers and Browsers</h3><p>

There are basically 3 groups of providers. The on line services like America On Line, Compuserve, Prodigy, and Microsoft Network offer their own content in addition to internet access. The National Internet Service Providers like AT&T WorldNet Service, Global Network Navigator (AOL's Internet Only service), MCI Internet, Netcom, and Sprynet offer local access in hundreds of cities across the country. Some of the National providers require special browsers. Local / regional Internet Service Providers are the little guys providing access to the net in their area of the country. Local providers typically allow the use of the latest browser software.  <p>

Below are two different recommendations for providers and browsers. The first is for those just wanting to do very basic business research on the web and gain access to E-mail. The second is for those who want to "be out front" experiencing the new technologies and envisioning how they might be applied in business and other areas. <p>


<h4>Basic Business Research</h4><p>

Just about any provider including the on line services can provide this capability. If you use one of the online services be sure to predetermine their internet use charges for prime time, off time, total hours, etc.<p>

As with the provider, Just about any browser (except the caching Lotus Notes) can work for your needs.<p>

<pre>
Lotus Notes saves pages to a local server and continues
to serve them. If the web site is frequently updated, in 
addition to not begin able to use the latest tools, you are 
looking at last weeks' news.
</pre>


<h4>Power User Business Research and Other Applications</h4><p>

We strongly recommend use of a stable local internet provider. Local internet providers supply you with a local phone number and your support will help them stay in business against the major national providers. We always support local businesses when possible. If no local providers are available, try the National Internet Service Providers and be sure to select one that has a local phone number and allows you to run the latest release of Netscape as a browser.<p>


The on line services (America On Line, Compuserve, Prodigy, Microsoft Network) will bill you extra for internet access time and will not allow you to run all the latest and greatest tools (frames, Java, movies, sound, gif animations, VRML (3-D Virtual Reality), internet phones, desktop conferencing, white boards, real audio) They are unable to use "cookies" to store information about prior visits to a site, and will not accept the hundreds of unique plug-ins being written for more popular browsers such as Netscape. As of December 1996, <b>AOL and Compuserve are still using 16 bit browsers !! </b> Netscape has been offering 32 bit browsers for a year (Initially in beta versions). AOL is thought by many to be the leader of this pack, but it is like saying the Sante Fe Railroad is the leading railroad in the Air Freight Business - it don't mean much. <p>


If you are a serious researcher, you need unlimited access time. Local providers typically provide it for $20 to $30 per month and throw in some space for you to put a home page on. You can't be watching the clock or trying to do your work at "off peak" time when your talking about "chump change" as the difference between a cheap limited rate and  unlimited access from a local provider. Some of you live way out in the sticks and may be forced to use an (800) number for access. They will bill you contact time to pay for the call. Cable TV and Satellite dishes are on their way as alternative connection methods.<p>


As for browsers, we are very strong supporters of Netscape. The latest beta versions can be downloaded from their site <a href="http://www.netscape.com"> http://www.netscape.com</A> which when combined with beta software from "plug ins" you will be surfing with the best of them. You will be able to view and run everything you encounter on the web. <b>If you are not running the latest version of Netscape, you are information super-highway road kill.</b> Can your non-Netscape browser support: frames, Java, mpeg, sound, gif animations, VRML, white boards, cookies, real audio, full 32 bit operations, and hundreds of "plug ins"? I thought not.<p>


<h4>E-mail and Newsgroups</h4><p>

Most services provide E-mail. Be sure to get one has a convenient reader (such as Netscape Mail). Also, make sure your provider gives you access to industry related newsgroups and that you have a good Newsgroup Reader (such as Netscape News). The news groups should have a considerable backlog of data stored locally on your provider (not just todays news). <p>

Some of the online services are providing multiple e-mail addresses to single accounts which allow either more than one person to use the machine, or you to have separate mailboxes for separate activities.<p>

If your e-mail address is from Compuserve, AOL, MSN, etc you will be viewed as a second class citizen in many circles. You will not be considered a serious participant in the net. Learning to use the full tools and establishing a functioning working connection with a provider is  a "rite of passage" and you have not been through it. You are an outsider.<p>





<h4>Parting Thoughts About Providers</h4><p>

A list of local and national providers as well as "the list" (full list) is provided on <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi/links/netl.htm#provider">RBBI </A>(our sister web site).<p>

<hr>


<h3>Hardware</h3><p>

If you are running on a dial up account you need a 486 with 28.8 (or faster) modem. To do video conferencing or VRML (Virtual Reality) a pentium 100 or better may be needed. It goes up from there. I'm running a 486 50 with 28.8 modem and  get by just fine anything except video conferencing or intense VR. In the near future it looks like faster modems, ISDN phone lines, and satellite receivers will be providing the faster links with cable TV coming along later. Be alert for any special high speed connections in your area.<p>


<hr>

<h3>Mechanics of Getting Hooked Up</h3><p>

If your not working at a business or institution that provides you with access, get help, we all had too. Talk to your friends, see who the good local providers are. Visit with the local providers. They will provide you with some connection software and will help you with setup problems. Bottom line is, "Its Hell but Worth It." Learn as much as you can as your friends and others help you through the process. While your "in there" make sure the e-mail and newsgroups work too.<p>

<hr>

<h3>How to Navigate</h3><p>

At the top of the screen your browser will have a number of icons. You only need to figure out 6 of them. 
<ul>
<li>Home - always brings you back to a designated home page (usually defined in setup or preferences)
<li>Back - takes you where you just left
<li> Forward - takes you one step forward of here if you have been there before
<li>Stop - stops loading
<li>Reload - loads the page again
<li>Bookmark - allows you to save the current address, so you can come back with just one click next week.
</ul>
<p>

You may be able to take a "Beginning Internet " class at a local University, or your provider may have training sessions. They typically only last a couple of hours, show you how to Navigate, and visit some of the popular and local web sites.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Basic Tools and Sites to Visit</h3><p>

If you are looking at a paper copy of this web site,  get online and "surf" from the most recent version at <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/industry/intro/intro.htm"> http://www.virtualpet.com/industry/intro/intro.htm</a>

For beginning industrial research give our <a href="../index.htm">Industry Research Desk </A>a visit. It will provide you with a set of tools for industrial research including an online  guide  called, <b>'How to Learn About an Industry or a Specific Company"</b>.<p>

For additional industry research links, visit our sister web site, <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi">RBBI</A> (Recreational Boat Building Industry Home Page), and check out the <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi/links/otherl.htm">"Other Links"</A>. A list of categories is provided or you can just scroll on down through the actual site links.<p>

Once you have been through these materials you will have a pretty good idea how to find industry, manufacturing,  manufacturing process, and specific company information online.<p>

<hr>

<h3>What's Next?</h3><p>

You begin to set your own course. You accumulate special software and "plug ins" for applications that interest you. You begin running a Netscape beta software browser.  You find some newsgroups that interest you and you begin to participate and develop some friends in cyberspace. You think learn HTML and set up your own page. Just one word of advice on that - Learn HTML, don't use one of those "sissy" conversion programs as you need to update it or run into problems later on you will be glad you did. <p>

<hr>
<h3>Reference Material</h3><p>

A local Oklahoma State University Librarian, Dan Chaney, has written an excellent general introduction to the internet titled <A HREF="http://www.okstate.edu/library/index.htm">Dan Chaney Internet Training Page </A>. It covers a lot more background information and shows you some of the popular sites.<p>

<title>Stern Drive The Invention of the Stern Drive</title>

<BODY>
<center> <h3>The Invention of the Stern Drive</h3></center>
<hr>
<pre>
The information below comes from patents and the book,
<i> Iron Fist</i>, by Rodengen. It is a biography of the life of 
Carl Kiekhaefer the founder of Mercury Marine. Chapter 26 
(pages 360 to 379) is titled, "The Great Stern Drive Conspiracy."
</pre>
<hr>

When Charles Strang was working towards his masters degree at M.I.T. in 1948 he was an avid outboard racing enthusiast. He became interested in mounting an assault on the American outboard speed record (78.121 mph). He realized that horsepower was holding back the record as the largest American OB was the 33.4 HP Evinrude <i>Speedifour.</i><p>

He found an aluminum car racing engine in Europe called the "Coventry Climax" and was going to mount it to the lower end of an OB and hand in all outside of the boat to be still considered an "outboard."  When he discovered it wouldn't be legal, he continued to refine the idea of an automotive engine with an outboard lower unit, but this time with the engine inside the boat and drive unit outside. In his engineering, "invention ledger" he drew various versions of his design and then dated and signed the pages which was M.I.T. procedure. One of those entries in 1948 was for the final version of a modern stern drive complete with the "universal joint" linkage which would ultimately be patented, not by Charlie Strang , but by Jim Wynne. In the explicit drawing he identified the universal torque transmitter by its scientific name, "Hookes Coupling" and labeled and identified the tilt and swivel pin features within the coupling exactly as they would appear on the patent application submitted ten years later by Jim Wynne.<p>

Strang couldn't decide what to call his new drive, he had been a comic book fan in his younger days and remembered a voluptuous siren named Apacinata Von Climax. Since he had considered joining his drive to the Coventry Climax engine, he named the stern drive the AVC drive.<p>

In the summer of 1951 after working only two weeks for the Kiekhaefer Corporation, Charlie Strang disclosed his idea to Carl Kiekhaefer. These were great times for Carl. He was in transition between the two-cylinder <i>Lightning </i>models and the more powerful four cylinder <i>Thunderbolt </i>models. He was having great success with his 25 horsepower model and was setting his sights on OMC and their even larger horsepower outboards.  Strang was passionate about the idea, but Carl wan't the least bit interested. He not only was not interested, but went on to call Strang, nuts and  call the idea ridiculous. Then he told Strang it was a "horse _ _ _ _ idea."<p>

Charlie got caught up the all the activities at Kiekhaefer including road racing. He kept thinking about his AVC drive and his new experiences with powerful Chrysler, Ford, and Chevrolet engines being used in stock cars.<p>

In 1955 aboard Kiekhaefer's Beech-18, Charlie Strang and Jim Wynne were flying to Texas to testify in an outboard product liability case. They listened to the Sugar Ray Robinson vs Carl "Bobo" Olson boxing fight on the radio and afterwards the conversation drifted to engineering and the potential speeds of outboard motors. On this flight the greatest conspiracy in the history of the marine industry began.<p>

Charlie sketched up his AVC drive idea who got very excited about it. He talked to Charles "Alex" Alexander about it. "Alex" had been promoted to engineering VP and reported directly to executive VP Charlie Strang. Wynne also reported directly to Strang. A series of secret conversations between Strang, Alexander, and Wynne began discussing the AVC drive and its possibilities. They made the decision to develop the new product themselves, without the knowledge of Carl Kiekhaefer.<p>

Carl and Jim Wynne were close friends at this time (an event involving a woman would end this in 18 months) and he (Jim) was appointed chief engineer of the proving grounds. Charlie was second in command as executive VP, and Alex held the highest engineering position in the company. These three men were actively conspiring to build what would become the most significant product in marine manufacturing behind Carl's back.<p>

In the spring of 1958, Jim Wynne left Kiekhaefer Mercury and in less than 90 days, "invented" the stern drive. Charlie Strang and Charles Alexander remained at Kiekhaefer Mercury and continued to support his development of a prototype AVC drive. A company was formed, Hydro Mechanical Development, headed by Wynne. Unable to raise the huge funds required to tool and produce the drive they began looking for help. In early 1958 they met with John Buehler president of Indiana Gear Works and also the U.S. licensee of the Hamilton Jet Drive of New Zealand. The book tells of the unusual meeting, Buehler was a large man in a boy scout uniform and his huge office had the rear end of animals mounted on the walls with arrows sticking in them. Buehler was convinced that Hamilton Jet Drives were going to take over the industry, so he was not interested.<p>

In Florida, Wynne completed the "cobbled together" prototype in his parents garage. Remembering the importance of secrecy learned from Kiekhaefer, he covered the garage windows and spoke to no one about it until the prototype was completed and tested.  He borrowed a 20 foot fiberglass boat from Woody Woodson (founder of Thunder Boat Company in Miami) and installed the new drive. He covered it up and trailered it to Pelican Harbor on the intracoastal waterway in Miami before dawn.  After a few trial runs and some adjustments, he was satisfied that the concept would work.<p>

Shortly later John Jarnmark, the New Jersey based general sales manager for Volvo Penta made a routine sales call on Wynne following up on a 80 horsepower engine delivered without the reverse gear. Wynne told him he was working on a new application for the engine that could produce a lot of sales. Jarnmark was interested, but Wynne could not disclose more until filing the patent applications. After they were filed, he invited Jarnmark back and he was very impressed. Jarnmark sent diagrams, photos, and descriptions of the device to Volvo in Sweden.<p>

Wynne was asked by Ole Botved the manufacturer of Botved-Coronet outboard boats and cruisers in Denmark to join him as one of three pilots trying to cross the Atlantic in an outboard boat.  He flew to Copenhagen for the preparations and then traveled to Sweden to meet with Harald Wiklund the president of Volvo-Penta from 1949 to 1977. When Jim walked into his office in 1958 he had already been president for 9 years and the company had been growing dramatically. Wiklund was very impressed by the idea. Wynne was still thinking that Charlie Strang would leave Mercury soon and join him in the venture. Now that Volvo was seriously interested, he called Strang. Carl had just proposed that Strang head up a public Kiekhaefer Corporation as president. The war with OMC was in critical stages, and he was very busy; but, he knew the potential of the new drive.  If he chose to leave Kiekhaefer, Jim would negotiate to buy Volvo engines at a volume discount, if he stayed Jim would negotiate a license agreement with Volvo for them to produce the drive and market it with their engines. Strang told Wynne, "Jim, do what you want with it."<p>

Wynne met again with Wiklund to proceed to negotiate the licensing agreement. The initial agreement was $7 for each unit produced by Volvo over the lifetime of the patent and 12 1/2 percent of any license income Volvo might receive from other builders. Sales initially faltered and $3.50 per drive was agreed upon. Later Wiklund felt the agreement was too much in Wynne's favor as all he brought was the idea. They had to develop and produce it.  <p>

Strang and Wynne agreed that Wynne would receive credit for the invention of the drive to protect Strang's position with Carl Kiekhaefer. They understood that Strang could be held liable for disclosure of the idea while still on Kiekhaefer's payroll. The bond of secrecy between Strang, Wynne, and Alexander would last over 30 years. <p>

At the conclusion of the outboard crossing of the Atlantic, Wynne appeared on the TV program, "I've Got A Secret" and stumped the panel. "Little did they realize, Jim Wynne and Charlie Strang both had an explosive secret that would remain hidden for thirty long years."<p>

As Volvo-Penta began a crash program to produce the AVC drive which they called the <i>Aquamatic</i>, Wynne found he was unable to answer many of the technical questions being posed by Wiklund and their chief marine engineer, Neil Hanson. Wynne had to disclose that he was not the original inventor, that Charlie Strang was, and swore them all to secrecy. During the late summer of 1958 a series of clandestine meetings between them were arranged. Often they were in motels near boat races. Strang was very concerned about Kiekhaefer's spies and his volatile nature. Wiklund said he felt he spent more time that summer in an airplane than behind his desk in Gothenburg Sweden. With Strang's guidance , the drawings were finalized and Swedish engineers rushed to complete tooling in the fall and early winter of 1958.<p>

The Aquamatic was unveiled with a lot of fanfare at the 1959 New York Motor Boat Show in early January. It had taken the Volvo engineers less that 6 months to produce the tooling for the prototype unit. Jim Wynne was a guest in the booth to help answer questions about "his new invention." Ingemar Johansson, the Swedish heavyweight boxing champion made an appearance to pose with Wynne. Carl Kiekhaefer was stunned to see the huge crowds in the Volvo booth and was miffed at dealers asking him about  the merits of the new drive. Almost a year later, Carl got his hands on an Aquamatic and installed it on an 18 foot Dunphy Boat and tested it himself at Lake X.<p>

His report, sent to Charlie Strang before the end of January 1960 "was perhaps the most biased, unfair, and clouded evaluation that an engineer could ever have made. " He was steaming over the drive because he considered the concept without merit and because Jim Wynne was involved. He never recalled talking to Charlie Strang about the AVC drive years earlier.  Carl's comments on the test report were contrary to just about everybody elses opinion of the new unit.


<ul>
"Volvo engine: Extremely noisy, even though compartmented with sound-absorbing material as liner. Noise is combination of intake and mechanical. Gear whine noticeable at part throttle although not at high speed.<p>

"Steering extremely dangerous. Spun out boat at first hard left turn. Except for center position, steering force so violent as to twist wheel out of hand. ...<p>

"Installation costs must run considerably higher than an outboard since one large hole must be cut into the transom to take the engine mount. .. A water pickup, in addition, must be installed on the underside of the boat. ...<p>

"The Volvo outboard-inboard drive, aside from its cost and weight disadvantages, has all the other disadvantages of an inboard installation and while a certain segment of the public might go for it, I do not believe it is a threat to outboard motors at this time. .. Gone too is the stimulant of annual model changes. Styling plays no part. The product does not advertise itself, being hidden, and has all the romance of a 371 diesel power plant!<p>

"I believe a destruction test at wide-open throttle at normal engine rpm is in order."
</ul>

This test report was only part of a nearly 2 year long tirade by Carl. He was irritated by Volvo's advertising entering into his two territories of speed and endurance. Wynne had learned of the importance of racing and endurance marks while at Kiekhaefer. He obtained one of the 10 prototypes and secretly prepared another Woody Woodson 18 foot Thunderbird Boat for the Miami-Nassau race. He was afraid Volvo would not let him run one of their precious "boat show" prototypes in a race. He took on board as co-pilot  Bill McKeown, editor of <i>Popular Boating </i>magazine. That magazine is today called <i>Boating</i> and was very popular at that time. Later Harald Wiklund, Volvo president told him that if he had any idea he was going to race it he would have personally came over and taken it away from him. They won their class in the race and were 4th overall, and received a landslide of favorable publicity for the<i> Aquamatic</i> drive.<p>

As Volvo sales began to eat away some of Carl's 70 HP OB sales and dealers and distributors kept asking when Mercury would come out with a stern drive, Carl asked Charlie Strang to begin thinking about the concept of a Mercury stern drive (we can only imagine how this made Strang feel, as he was actually the secret original inventor of the drive).<p>

In June 1960 Carl tried to negotiate an agreement with Volvo to be their exclusive sales agents for the <i>Aquamatic </i>in the U.S. Carl wanted Volvo to actively enforce its patent to keep others (OMC) out of the stern drive business (out of competition for his OB sales. The deal unraveled when Volvo wanted a guaranteed minimum of 10,000 units a year. If Carl had been successful in his reasoning he would have prevented the expense of tooling up for another drive and protected  large HP OB sales.<p>

Sales of the Aquamatic floundered at first. The initial run of 10,000 units only sold 3,000 by the end of 1959. The drive was being highly touted in the press and people liked it but it wasn't moving. It was easy for boat builders to sell boats without engines and the consumer would buy and OB and put it in the boat. Wiklund turned to Ole Botved who had crossed the Atlantic with Wynne in the outboard boat. He agreed to make Aquamatics available interest free for a full year, if he would install them in his line of Coronet boats. It was a great success.<p>

In the fall of 1960 in a Mercury sales meeting, Carl admitted the possibility of a Mercury stern drive, but characterized the concept as a pure loser. In a speech to distributors on January 13, 1961 he finally broke down and told the public that if they wanted it he would build it. Charlie Strang continued to develop the project and Carl didn't notice how easy it was for him (the original inventor). Carl was concerned Volvo would force them on the patent, Strang knew they would not due to secrecy surrounding the original inventor.<p>

Kiekhaefer learned that OMC was also working on a stern drive and would be announcing it at the Chicago Boat Show on March 25, 1961. He moved up Mercury's announcement two days to March 23 followed by a large display in Mercury's booth on the opening day of the show March 24. A week before the press announcement, the name <i>MerCruiser </i>was selected for the stern drive.<p>

OMC's V-4, two cycle 80 HP stern drive called the<i> OMC-480 </i>paled by the <i>MerCruiser </i>four cycle automotive engines with 125 to 200 HP.<p>

Carl took the conservative approach and only sold the drive to engine manufacturers who sold the engine and drive package to the boat builders. Mercury dealers couldn't care less about the drive because they could not market it themselves. Strang remembered when he first got Carl to take the drive seriously. He told him that he and his mother had seen a little 4 cylinder Chevrolet in a local dealership. He took Carl in the next day and told him they needed to put that engine with the stern drive. Carl told him to contact GM. That afternoon they flew to Detroit and brought back the first engine. Carl was still dragging his feet on the idea and Strang told him if he didn't like it to price it and he would buy him out on this project. "Never heard another complaint from him'" Strang said.<p>

Carl wasn't aware that Strang and Charlie Alexander had already tried to raise money to fund the project with Jim Wynne. Carl was about to take care of the strategic errors made by Volvo and OMC of marrying the drive to low horsepower engines. GM's 110 to 140 HP engines greatly raised the market appeal of the drive.<p>

As horsepowers moved up, Kiekhaefer had Strang design two more drives, the <i>MerCruiser I </i>and the <i>MerCruiser II</i> to handle 225 HP and even 310 HP engines. By late 1961, Mercury had captured the bulk of the market by offering two models and a wide range of engines. Mercury began to receive orders from nearly every boat builder in the country.<p>

By 1962, only 3 years after the introduction of the Aquamatic, 16 manufacturers were producing stern drives. When Mercury opened up to direct sales to boat builders they eventually captured 80% of the world market. The conspiracy between Wynne and Strang actually worked to Carl's advantage. This secret relationship let someone else go first and test market while eventually making possible Mercury's entry.<p>

Wynne's patents wouldn't actually issue for ten years because another inventor, C.E. Mac Donald of Seattle had actually constructed a prototype before Wynne's in Miami. MacDonald filed his application just two weeks after Wynne. They claim to be unaware of each others activities and independent discoveries of the same idea. Wynne was awarded the patent (3,376,842) on April 9, 1968. Wynne was rewarded with substantial amounts of cash from the Volvo agreement that was in effect until the patent expired in 1985. Charlie Strang would never accept a penny for his invention and went on to become board and chief executive officer of OMC during Carl Kiekhaefer's lifetime but never disclosed the story of the invention of the stern drive while Kiekhaefer was still alive.<p>

<hr>
The patent itself, #3,376,842, is quite interesting. It was filed on May 11, 1960 (probably actually filed a couple of years earlier and this is the version that survived) and granted on April 9, 1968. It is titled Boat Propulsion Mechanism, lists James R. Wynne of Miami FL as inventor and assigned to A.B. Volvo Penta. It is a well written patent with some very nice drawings and 33 claims. This is an unusually large number of claims. The large number of claims very strongly define the patent and helped in the issuing of licenses. For those wishing to see a full copy of the patent and or patent drawings we refer you to the methods listed at the top of the <a href="pat.htm">Patent Folder</A> page.<p>

<hr><b>
What follows is my condensing of the article plus some RBBI Editorial Comments.
<hr></b>

This article discusses how Internet technology and the World Wide Web are about to "turn engineering on its ear."  The Web speeds up communications, allows decentralized organizational structures, and "exponentially boosts the information available for any given project." They present an example of a pilot project at an automaker.<p>

In the past, engineers discussed design details on a component by marking up drawings and faxing or delivering them to a Cad Designer, then they met with or called the supplier with questions. Simple changes might only take a week.<p>

In the pilot program, the engineers accesses the CAD model from the company database on their desktop PC, viewed it in full 3-D, cut sections and visually compared old and new versions, and marked the model with the changes. One option is to transform it to VRML (3-D web graphics format) and E-mail it to a Web server at the supplier company. Engineers at the supplier view it using Netscape (in full 3-D). <p>


***************<br>
Editorial Comment From RBBI<br>
<i>
This sounds great and may come to pass. I have personally been involved in similar efforts and found many CAD 3-D models to be in excess of 30 meg. Its very tough to load them on a PC to convert them to VRML and if you could the resulting file is to big for you to view at once. It is so huge you could probably mail it to them by the postal service before the e-mail transfer ended (slight exaggeration). As compression technologies develop and transfer speeds go up, hopefully this will become a more viable alternative.<br>
</i>
*************<br>

Another alternative is for simultaneous viewing of by both parties across the network. This allows the engineers, suppliers, purchasing, tooling, etc to review the issues in real time and agree on changes in a few minutes.<p>

One great idea mentioned by the article is to set up a "home page" for each major new project and allow access by participants and suppliers. Firewalls and password protection can limit access and allow participants to schedule meetings, review the design, send drawings and models to each other, and solicit bids.<p>

New product information is now being placed on line as soon as products are released by potential suppliers. You don't have to wait for trade shows and magazine coverage to obtain information about new products.<p>

***********************<br>
<i>
RBBI Editorial Comment<br>
Some Trade Shows are taking advantage of this movement and going on-line themselves. Many are establishing web sites to promote a real trade show and some are establishing virtual trade shows.<br>
</i>
**********************<br>

VRML can be used to load 3-D models into online parts catalogs and assembly views. Parametric Technology Corp (PTC) is using the modeling language in a new module called Pro/Interface for VRML. It lets users export Pro/E parts and assemblies into online VRML catalogs of parts and assemblies."<p>

***********************<br>
<i>
RBBI Editorial Comment<br>
Woah! !!  I personally talked to a PTC rep almost a year ago asking if they were doing any work in this area and was told they weren't interested.<br>
</i>
************************<br>

PTC then goes a step further and combines the Pro/Interface module with another called Pro/Fly-Through to give users a stand alone navigator to view and manipulate large assemblies. It lets users export Pro/E parts and assemblies into online VRML catalogs of parts and assemblies. The software will also allow users to pull VRML components into PRO/E for modifications.<p>

Java Applets are potentials for performing calculations, sizing and selecting components on web sites and for searching large databases.<p>

A virtual feedback device called the Phantom Haptic Interface invented in 1993 at M.I.T. fits the thumb and index finger of one hand. Thomas Massie, founder and chief technology officer of SensAble Technology describes how that through a series of gimbals, linkages, and servomotors it provides the tactile feedback that would exist if the object were in your hand.The hardware uses software called "Ghost" to interpret the surface position, texture, and weight of the VRML model. "Massie says the device can accurately represent smooth surfaces, sharp corners, textures, solid or rubbery spheres, and friction."<p>


***********************<br>
<i>
RBBI Editorial Comment<br>
Wow! !! <br>
</i>
************************<br>

The three Phantom Haptic Interface units work in workspaces of 5 X 7 X 10 inches, 7.5 X 10.5 X 15 inches, and about a cubic yard.<p>

Applications include examining the feel and size of hand held designs and ease of assembly. They even have their own web site <a href="http://www.ele.vtt.fi/projects/vrp/vrp.htm">http://www.ele.vtt.fi/projects/vrp/vrp.htm</A><p>

Another development is hooking PDA's (Personal Digital Assistants) to the web. Mercedes-Benz has announced plans to connect their cars to the net. Those disconnected from their desks could continue their work and car assistance could be obtained as well.<p>

Intergraph's Imagineer Technical product is a 2-d drawing package with parametric features that can be used with Microsoft's web browser (Internet Explorer) to link with technical sites. <p>

Micro-Station (% by Bently Systems developed a web browser that runs within their CAD package which allows dragging and dropping drawings or specs from manufacturers web sites.<p>


Search engines such as Lycos, AltaVista, Yahoo, and HotBot are making it easier to find the piece of information you need on the net.<p>

***********************<br>
<i>
RBBI Editorial Comment<br>
They did not point out that many industries have their own web sites such as RBBI. We have links to a few <a href=" ../../links/otherl.htm#industry"> industry specific sites</A> on our Other Useful Links Page. You should find sites of this nature in your industry and support them. They will save you a great deal of time in "ferreting out" the information you need.<p>
</i>
************************<br>



The article goes on to explain that by making corporate databases web accessible, the use of Netscape's browser, rather than proprietary tools will allow users to navigate and access databases for information, documents, parts drawings, part information, and bills of material.<p>



***********************<br>
<i>
RBBI Editorial Comment<br>
Great article, timely, with some real content. Presents some novel concepts. In the future we may look back and find this article to have been a real catalyst in promoting the Engineering use of the web. A couple of technologies seem left out or shorted a bit. The use of whiteboards, internet phones (especially for international collaborations),  webcams to monitor activities in an area (construction of prototypes or on test units themselves),  real time data feed sharing, remote control of prototypes or testing, and real time sound.<br>

<H2>How Creativity Can Take Off<br>
When Poised at Edge of Chaos</H2>
<p><b>By T<font size="-1">HOMAS</font> P<font size="-1">ETZINGER</font> J<font size="-1">R</font>.</b></p>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO</b> -- Three brain-teasers
to start your day:</p>
<p>Each of Northern Telecom's 40 business units performs best when it
operates autonomously, but the actions of one may help or hinder others in
unpredictable ways. How can the company ensure the net effect is
positive?</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps uses computers to simulate battles. But the
computers work logically, while the battlefield is inherently illogical.
How can the generals create more realistic simulations?</p>
<p>Unilever wants to foster innovation, but the company is structured to
bring to market products it already knows it wants. How can Unilever
nurture breakthrough thinking?</p>
<p>Maybe Stuart Kauffman can help.</p>
<p>Dr. Kauffman is a molecular biologist who has devoted his career to the
science of "complex adaptive systems." A cell is a complex adaptive system.
So is an immune system, or a rainforest -- any system that interacts and
evolves with its surroundings.</p>
<p>Is a corporation a complex adaptive system? An economy? If you read this
column regularly, you know what I think. From the shop floor to the design
lab to the supply chain, we've seen smart companies profiting from some of
the same methods by which nature organizes itself. (But don't confuse this
with the faddish use of biology jargon in management. We're talking about
models here, not metaphors.)</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Kauffman is moving to establish a consortium to use Nortel,
Unilever and the Marine Corps as laboratories. "We are looking for real
tools," he says. "We're going to do real science about living in a creative
world."</p>
<p><b>HOW THE</b> 57-year-old medical doctor
evolved into a would-be business guru is a complex tale in its own
right.</p>
<p>As a medical student in the early 1960s, Dr. Kauffman was vexed by the
mystery of how the 256 cell types in a newborn human could emerge from a
single cell. He marveled that genes, while switching each other on and off
like so many tiny toggle switches, always remained within a boundary of
workable combinations. From where, he wondered, did this order spring?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, researchers were deploying powerful computers to unravel
complexity elsewhere in the sciences -- the turbulent flow of fluids, for
instance, and the population dynamics of insects and fishes. When sampled
sufficiently, many seemingly random movements in nature exhibited
stunningly structured patterns.</p>
<p>Dr. Kauffman tapped into these investigations in his search for the
origins of biological order. He began to see that living systems operated
at their most robust and efficient level in the narrow space between
stability and disorder -- poised at "the edge of <B><FONT COLOR="#660000">chaos</FONT></B>." It was here, it
appeared, that the agents within a system conducted the fullest range of
productive interactions and exchanged the greatest amount of useful
information. People recognize this in everyday life: A slightly messy
office is a productive one; rollicking families are happy; economies
flourish under scant regulation. The edge of <B><FONT COLOR="#660000">chaos</FONT></B>, but not quite <B><FONT COLOR="#660000">chaos</FONT></B>
itself.</p>
<p>Dr. Kauffman discerned mathematics that described these dynamics.
Systems seemed to ignite, to take <B><FONT COLOR="#660000">wing</FONT></B> suddenly, when the density of the
connections between agents in the systems reached a critical value. He
published articles about the dynamics of "webs" and "networks" long before
these terms had entered the vernacular. He also joined the Santa Fe
Institute, a think tank for complexity studies, where he crossed into new
disciplines with physicists, economists, mathematicians and computer
scientists.</p>
<p>Finally, last year, he published a book for laymen called "At Home in
the Universe," speculating (among other things) that the natural world and
the economy might share some of the same deep laws.</p>
<p><b>AMONG THOSE</b> struck by the book was
Christopher Meyer, director of Ernst &amp; Young's Center for Business
Innovation in Boston. Mr. Meyer mailed 15,000 copies of "At Home in the
Universe" to clients and drew dozens of companies to a three-day symposium
here called "Embracing Complexity."</p>
<p>It was at the conference that officials of Nortel, Unilever and the
Marines discussed establishing a research consortium with Dr. Kauffman and
Ernst &amp; Young. Negotiations are still under way. (Another possible
member, the Electric Power Research Institute, wants help studying the
complexity of the power grid.)</p>
<p>If a group does form, the open flow of information, just as in any
complex adaptive system, will be key. "We'll learn from them and they'll
learn from us," says Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, the top combat strategist at
Quantico. "The real power is in the sharing." (Yes, this is the Marine
Corps talking.)</p>
<p>Dr. Kauffman is the first to allow that his ideas may not bear up in
business. But already, the futility of prediction in a complex world is
proving the virtue of adapting from within. Managers couch this concept in
safe terms -- "change management," "continuous improvement," pick your
buzzword. But if Dr. Kauffman and his partners succeed with the science,
business leaders may come to realize that the safest place of all lies at
the edge of <B><FONT COLOR="#660000">chaos</FONT></B>.</p>

To: polsong@best.com<br>
Subject: Re: Chaos<p>

Dear Mr. Polson:<p>

	Many thanks for responding to the "Front Lines" column on complexity theory
in business. As promised, here is a bibliography of recommended reading on the
subject with a brief comment on each book. I've taken the liberty of
including a few Web addresses at the bottom.<p>

      This list is hardly exhaustive, but you will find most of the major
popular published works here. These books vary a lot in scope, tone and
approachability, despite their sharing a narrow subject. I have arranged them
with the uninitiated in mind, ranking them by breadth and overall
accessibility.<p>

	You ought to find most of these books at any big bookstore. Read around the
edges before you buy; some may suit you more than others. Most are available
in paperback.<p>

	Please feel free to duplicate or circulate this list. And I hope you won't
hesitate to share your reactions--on this or any other subject. As always,
you can reach me at Tpetzinger@aol.com.<p>

Cheers,<br>
Tom Petzinger<p>

	"Chaos: Making a New Science," by James Gleick. Viking Press, 1987. Still
the classic work in the field, it introduced the lay audience to the
complexities of complexity. A tad imponderable in a few spots--all these
books are, at least to me, I confess--but mostly accessible. The writing is
sometimes downright elegant. (You'll find Gleick's Web page at
http://www.around.com.)<p>

	"At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and
Complexity," by Stuart Kauffman. Oxford University Press, 1995. The subject
of the Oct. 18, 1996, Front Lines column. A bit daunting in spots, it goes
further than other books in exploring what complexity theory might mean for
the future of economics and organizations. And Kauffman's speculations on the
origins of life are thrilling. (Kauffman makes his professional home at the
Santa Fe Institute, whose home page is at http://www.santafe.edu.)<p>

	"Leadership and the New Science: Learning about Organization from an Orderly
Universe," by Margaret J. Wheatley. Berrett-Koehler Publishers Inc. Though
this book provides only a broad overview survey of the so-called new science
(quantum mechanics as well as complexity theory) its speculations on the
relevance to leadership and organization are thoroughly stimulating. This is
not a how-to book, but you can't read it without changing your sense of how
organizations really do--and ought to--work. <p>

	"Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the
Economic World," by Kevin Kelly. Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1994. This is a
fun book by a fun writer, who is the executive editor of Wired magazine. It
lacks the scientific precision of other books on this list but is broad and
free-wheeling in its explorations. Wired magazine itself, by the way, is
essential for anyone following the advent of the digital economy.<p>

     "Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity," by John Holland. Helix
Books, 1995. This book is pure science--no history, no flag-waving--but it is
startlingly clear and thoughtfully concise at 172 pages. John Holland is the
father of genetic algorithms, which I wrote about in a 1995 Front Lines column
 on complex shop scheduling at Deere & Co. But you'll find much more here
that explains how systems adapt in both the nature and the man-made world.<p>

<pre>

on our <a href="../../folders/tech/business/genetic.htm">Genetic Algorithms Page</A>. I have placed an order for
"Hidden Order" and will report on it later.

	"Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos," by M.
Mitchell Waldrop. Touchstone, 1992. A clear, cogent and well written overview
of the origins of complexity theory through the eyes of the explorers.
Features among others Brian Arthur, whose breakthrough thinking in economics
foretold the strategy by which Netscape and others are now marketing on-line
products. Stuart Kauffman is extensively discussed as well.<p>

	"The Third Culture," by John Brockman. Touchstone, 1996. An oral history
featuring the "scientific intellectuals" of the age in their own words--a few
of the obvious people (Stephen Jay Gould, Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins) but
also some less trendy figures whose ideas may be more relevant to business
and economics, such as Stuart Kauffman, Christopher Langdon and Doyne Farmer
on complex adaptive systems. <p>

	"Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos" by Ian Stewart. Blackwell
Publishers, 1989. It helps to bring some math to this book--I didn^t,
unfortunately--but it is a worthy overview mostly suitable for the layman.
This recitations on the history of mathematics are especially enjoyable,
particularly in the credit accorded the earliest explorers of chaos.<p>

	"Exploring Chaos: A Guide to the New Science of Disorder," Nina Hall.,
editor. W.W. Norton, 1991. A collection of essays originally appearing in New
Scientist magazine, each investigation a specific application--chaos in
engineering, chaos on the trading floor, etc. <p>

	"Complexity and Creativity in Organizations," by Ralph D. Stacey.
Berrett-Koehler, 1996. A book that seems to take great pains in describing
the obvious--until you realize that most organizations fail to pursue the
obvious. Highly academic, but thoughtful throughout.<p>

	"The Turning Point: Science, Society and the Rising Culture," by Fritjo
Capra. Bantam Books, 1982. New Age before anyone said  "new age," this book
deserves attention for its seminal role in the application of new science to
society and for the clarity of its exposition. The ruminations about medicine
and psychology are provocative. Unfortunately the book carries some political
baggage from the anti-industrial era of 15 years ago.<p>

       Nothing on the Web, I find, equals any of these books in introducing
the rudiments of complexity theory. But you may want to bookmark some of
these sites for papers on areas of specific interest.<p>

       One of the very best sites is maintained by the U.S. Marine Corps,
with an extremely well-done glossary of complexity jargon and many links to
other sites. Check it out at
http://138.156.204.100/WWW/MCRC/LIBRARY/BEYOND.HTM<p>

       You may want to poke around the site maintained by the citadel of
complexity studies, the Santa Fe Institute, at http://www.santafe.edu. This
is where Stuart Kauffman hangs his hat.<p>

        A great many potential business applications are treated at length in
a University of Pittsburgh site at http://www.pitt.edu/~malhotra/Systems.htm<p>

         A British researcher has posted some fascinating papers on
complexity as applied to knowledge and management at
http://www.lissack.com/writings/.<p>

         The Chaos Metalink is at

         Thanks again for your interest.<p>

<center><h3><b>A New Science for Business Strategists: <br>
Complexity, chaos, and the 'natural laws' of business"</b></h3>
<b><h4h>by Jon Mariotti</h4></b></center>


<hr><pre>
Industry Week October 21, 1996 page 12
Below is a summary  of the article
<hr></pre>

The author,  John Mariotti, has long been interested in applications of the natural world and science to business. Years ago he met Prof. Stuart Pimm at the University of Tennessee and discussed parallels between species in their environments and companies in their industries. The professor introduced him to two others working in the field; Roger Lewin, author of <i>Complexity - Life at the Edge of Chaos</i> (Collier Books 1992), and Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. <p>

Kauffman has recently published two books; <i>The Origins of Order</i> and <i>At Home in the Universe</i>. both books were published by Oxford University Press. The second book probes the parallels between natural and economic systems.<p>

The author notes there may be an optimal transition zone between complexity and chaos. This would be where things happen faster and yet are not thrown into chaos by minor events.He mentions the growth of Microsoft. To move to far forward is to risk chaos, but to remain or slip backwards would result in death.<p>

This emerging new science of business, economics, and the natural sciences considers the "adjacent possibilities", things that could emerge that are similar to others.<p>

In biological sciences, organisms are seeking resting places where they can prosper. Species adapt and survive or die and become extinct. It is very similar to the world of business.<p>

The Kauffman points our that a new wave of consultants and buzzwords may emerge from this science as people try to profit from its application to industry. The science is still in its infancy and a great deal is yet to be learned. There are some things there we are searching for but they have not yet become apparent to us. <p>

The author agrees and say the parallels are numerous and profound. Natural laws may one day reveal the future of the competitive world.<p>

<center><h3>Genetic Algorithms Page</h3></center>
<hr>
The first national exposure of this concept was a Wall Street Journal column on 14 July 1995. The article was titled, <a href="geneticw.htm"> "At Deere They Know A Mad Scientist May Be A Firms Biggest Asset"</A>. This article describes the initial application of the method to forecasting by a Mr. Fulkerson and its early application in a John Deere Planter factory. It is also a great human interest article about a fine man laboring in the trenches all his life and finally bursting into prominence.<p>


Another Wall Street Journal article covered it and some other "Nature" Technologies . It was a front page article on 16 January 1996. The article describes some of the current uses of the technology: scheduling events, picking stocks, and  face recognition. The title of the article was "Back to Darwin - In Sunlight and Cells, Science Seeks Answers to High-Tech Puzzles".<p>

<a href="5319781.htm">Patent 5,319,781</A> was assigned to Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (see the first Wall Street article). The patent is titled, "Generation of Schedules Using a Genetic Proceedure."  The beginning and end of the patent are quite interesting. The middle includes about 50 pages of computer code.<p>

<title>Boater Demographics and Participation Data</title>

<BODY>

<center><h3>Boater Demographics and Participation Data</h3></center>

Why do certain people adopt boating as a leisure activity? How many are thinking about adopting boating? Do we have enough facilities (marinas, lakes, launch sites) for them? Why do some quite the activity? What kind of people like boating? We have the
<b><a href="funnel/funnel.htm">FUNNEL CHART</A></b> which graphically illustrates a number of these concepts. Thinking about this chart and how people are flowing through the funnel could provide you with some marketing ideas.<p>
<hr>
There are number of sources of demographic information about boaters. Some of the ones I have used are listed below.<p>

The annual January issue of Boating Industry magazine has a report on the industry in it. The report has a section on demographics. The data is from the National Sporting Goods Association. A copy of the January 1996 issue's graphic is presented below.<p>


<img src="95demo.gif">

<p>
<br>


The Lifestyle Market Analyst<br>
An annual published by SRDS (800) 851-SRDS<br>
It provides information on how people spend leisure time and money<br>
It has 7 pages of "Boating/Sailing" statistics of the nature of age, sex, home ownership, income, geographic distribution and other activities enjoyed by boaters. It has similar studies of many other recreational activities.<p>

Margaret Ambry and Cheryl Russell have authored a number of Demographic books, some independently and some together.  I suggest you find any books by them that are available to you. "The Official Guide to the Household Spending" 2nd edition. OSU call#658.834 A496c 1993 (2nd Floor Reference Area) indicates how leisure dollars are distributed through various activities and different income and age levels.<p>

One incredible study is the annual "Study of Media and Markets" by the Simmons Market Research Bureau. It is a very large multi volume set with participation, purchase, and media consumption data. One volume (P-9) covers Sports and Leisure. This volume extensively covers boating, water skiing and fishing. The study is quite expensive. Locally, an aged copy is donated to the University of Oklahoma library after the new annual is out. OU library call #HF 5415.3 S542 199_. PT.9. The "_" is the last digit of the year. It has frequency of participation by sex, age, education, job, geography, income, etc. One of the most interesting things is it has relative frequency data of participation for readers, listeners, or watchers of media by specific newspaper, TV show, Radio show, etc. This data can be used to profile boaters by what they like and don't like.<p>

<hr> 
Marine Matrix puts out a "Boat Ownership Satisfaction Survey". It provides statistics on overall experience with the boat, satisfaction with the dealer, satisfaction with the handling and ride of the boat, the need for and severity of repairs, and brand loyalty. <p>
<pre>
Marine Matrix
1800 Sherman Avenue - Suite 510
Evanstown IL 6201-3789

<hr>

Some states have created some excellent boat use reports. <p>
"1990 Statewide Survey of Boating Use at Public Waterway Access Sites in New York State" is a February 1992 report prepared by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for the Department of Environmental Conservation of New York State.<p>

You might check with state Fish and Wildlife Department officials to see if they are aware of any studies of this nature in your area.<p>
<hr>

In the spring of 1991 <i>Motor Boating & Sailing Magazine</i> ran a large study on boaters. One of their findings addressed the segmentation issue. They identified two types of boater which they labeled, "the Committed Boatman" and "the Casual Boater". It is an excellent study.

<title>Boat Building Industry Census Data</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<center><h3>Boat Building Industry Census Data </h3></center>

The place to begin most census information quests is the annual U.S. Statistical Abstract. It contains a great deal of data. The paper copy has a lot of references in it that will lead you to additional statistics. An on-line partial version is available, <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/stat_abstract/">1995 Statistical Abstract of the U.S.</A>.<p>
<hr>

In addition to the population census, the government regularly (each 5 years) conducts extensive census of business areas. The years straddle the population census dates. 1987 and 1992 are the two most recent business census. They  will be taken again in 1997. The 1992 data is now available. <p>

General areas are covered by different census, they include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Construction
<li>Retail Trade (Boat Dealers)
<li>Wholesale Trade
<li>Manufacturing  (Boat Builders, Engine Manufacturers)
<li>Service Industries 
<li>Transportation (Ferry Boats and Cargo Boats, Marinas)
<li>Mining
<li>Agriculture
</ul>
 
If you are looking for one of our specific industries, it often helps to have the SIC (Standard Industrial Classification Code). Here are some SIC codes you may find useful:<br>
<pre>
SIC Code         Industry
3732         Boat Building and Repair
37322        Outboard Motor Boats
37323        Inboard Motor Boats
37324        Inboard-Outdrive Motor Boats

3519         Internal Combustion Engines
35683 94     Inboard Marine Propulsion Gear Transmissions
35683 96     Outboard Gear Drives (Inboard Prime Mover)
4493         Marinas

555          Boat Dealers
7699         Outboard Motor Repair
7997         Yacht Clubs
</pre>

The actual Census Documents can be found either on-line at the <a href="http://www.census.gov">Census Bureau WWW site</a>, on-line at the Census Forum on the BEA (Bureau of Economics Affairs) Bulletin Board on the Telnet Fedworld site, at your local <a href="gopher://UMSLVMA.UMSL.EDU:70/11/LIBRARY/GOVDOCS/GDEP">Federal Depository Library</A>, or on this site. Much of the data is now available on CD-ROMS and may be available at you local library as well. <p>
<hr>


The major census report on the Boat Building Industry is in the Census of Manufacturing: Transportation Equipment. The 1992 edition is now available. <br>
<B>MC92-I-37C</B> Ship and Boat Building, Railroad and Miscellaneous Transportation Equipment<br>
(Industries 3731, 3732,   3743, 3751, 3792, 3795, and 3799) <br>
$6.00<p>
 803-018-00160-6     GPO  96pp.  rel. 05/03/95 <P>

<b>Availability:</B> Order from the Government Printing Office (GPO), 202-512-1800. Reference twelve digit stock numbers. Also available on <a href="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/mp/www/rom/msrom7a.html"> CD-ROM </a>.<P>

The paper versions are little easier to understand, but the bureau posts a spreadsheet version (using tables) on the web. It is at: <a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/epcd/www/mc92ht37.html"> http://www.census.gov/pub/epcd/www/mc92ht37.html </A> 

<hr>
Another frequently used report is <b>MA 35L</b>. This annual report, covers Engines nec (Not elsewhere classified) and includes marine engines. The last few years reports are available on the census bureau site at:<a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/ip2100.html"> http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www.ip2100.html </A>. When you get to the page, select "VIEW" at the top of the page and you will be given links to the last few years reports.<p>
<hr>

The Boat Dealers information is shown in the Retail Census report. It can be found at:<a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/epcd/www/rc92h55x.html"> http://www.census.gov/pub/epcd/www/rc92h55x.html</A>. Note you can divide some of the numbers by the number of dealers and compare your firm to the average.<p>
<hr>

General census information on foreign trade is available on the <a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/foreign-trade/www/"> U.S. International Trade Statistics Page</A>. If you begin to look for the "B Commodity Export Codes" you will find our industry in the range between 8407 and 8412. You can find the exact code you are looking for and then go to the Oregon State University <a href="http://govinfo.kerr.orst.edu">U.S. Imports and Exports site</A> and look at some of the 1991 to 1995 data on CD ROM for items shipped to or from Specific Countries and for Specific U.S. ports. The Oregon State Import Export  site is also word searchable. After you input a word and another screen appears, you may need to scroll down to see the data. It will also present specific country and port options to you. Additional, even more up-to-date data, can be found on U.S. Import Export CD's in many public libraries. <p>
<hr>

The census bureau also publishes "Concentration Ratios" that indicate what percentage of the total business in a four digit SIC code is being done by the largest firms in the industry. <p>

The Manufacturing Census  report is called "Concentration Ratios in Manufacturing" and is numbered MC(yr)-S-6 (where yr is last two digits of the census year). It indicates the percentage of business done by the top 4, 8,20, and 50 companies in each four digit SIC code industry. The full 1992 printed report is expected to be available in December of 1996; however, some of the data is already available on-line. We have copied the information pertaining to boat builders to our <a href="concent.htm">Concentration Ratio Page</A>. If you tried to look at the Engines nec data it is clouded by a number manufacturers of non-marine engines (lawn mowers, etc) and is not as specific as the boat builder data. <p>

Similarly the Retail Census has a report called 1992 Establishment & Firm Size Subject Series #RC92-S-1. This report provides information on the size of the companies, sales statistics, employment size, multi-unit info, payroll, and concentration of the largest firms. We have copied the concentration information pertaining to Boat Dealers to our <a href="concent.htm">Concentration Ratio Page</a>.<p>
<hr>

The Manufacturing and Retail Census provide a world of additional data and some of it is available at the county and state level. Use the Census Bureau search engine to find if what you are looking for is available.<p>
<hr>


One nice place to enter the census web site for current trends and census data is the <a href="http://www.census.gov/pub/econ/www/">U.S. Official Statistics Page</A>.

<hr>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous Information</b></h3><p>

<h4><b>NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) to replace SIC codes</h4></b>

A new system is being prepared to replace the SIC (Standard Industry Classification) system. You might want to gain a basic understanding of it and make sure those who report your data or use SIC data in creating forecasts for your operation are aware of what is coming . We have a <a href="http://www.virtualpet.com/industry/naics/naics.htm">NAICS page</A> on our sister site, The Manufacturing Industry Research Desk.<p>


<hr>
 
<h3><b>Industry Forecasts</b></h3><p>


<h4><b>U.S. Industrial Outlook</b></h4><p>

The "U.S. Industrial Outlook " is printed annually by the U.S. Dept of Commerce and has hundreds of short term industry forecasts. It also references a large number of other government publications. The materials are organized by SIC codes (look in section 37 for the boating industry). This source is often the basis of other industry forecasts. Oklahoma State University call # ECP 155 U583 IN35 (in Federal Documents). <p>

<hr>

<h4><b>Cahners</b></h4><p>

"Cahners 19<u>xx</u> Economic Outlook" Printed by Cahners Publishing Company , a division of Reed Publishing, is about a 60 page annual report that discusses the general economy, and specific industries. It has a one page Boating / Sailing report. "xx" refers to the last two digits of the years. It is available from:<p>

<hr>


<h3><b>Forecasting Techniques</b></h3><p>


<h4><b>CFAR</b></h4><p>
 
Business Week 21 Oct 1996 has a story on page 140 titled, "Clearing the Cob Webs From the Stockroom." The story describes a new Internet software and scheme called CFAR (Collaborative Forecasting and Replenishment). It offers a standardized way for manufacturers and merchants to work together on forecasts across the Internet. The parties exchange a series of written comments and supporting data electronically. They describe an allergy pill example in which they swap weather analyses to gage how bad the hay fever season would be. <p>

The "see-far" acronym implies more reliable longer-term views in to the future. A group called Benchmarking Partners developed CFAR with funding from Walmart, IBM, SAP, and Manguistics.<p>

<i>The process is currently being evaluated for high volume consumable items, but it appears it could certainly apply to the boating industry as well.</i>

<hr>

<h4><b>Genetic Algorithms</b></h4><p>

Genetic Algorithms are finding use in forecasting demand in complex situations, especially in those with lots of options. Deere is using it in alleviating problems they had in forecasting demand of combines. We have a <a href="../../../folders/tech/business/genetic.htm">Genetic Algorithms Page</A> which follows developments in this area.<p>

<hr>




<h3><b>Prediction Variables</b></h3><p>

<h4><b>Weather</b></h4>

1995  found many in the boating industry blaming the weather for poor financial performances. It wasn't just the boating industry but industries in general were claiming bad weather for poor performances.  An April 22, 1996 Wall Street Journal article, "A Chill Wind Blows Through the Pages of Earnings Reports" described the national phenomenon. One weather forecaster thought the weather really wasn't that unusual and was being used as a scapegoat. <p>

Some think we are not able to forecast the long range weather accurately enough to adjust forecasts and production schedules based on the anticipated impact of the weather. Now a number of long range "commodity type" weather predictions are being made available on the web for both the U.S. and international sites. Technological developments and better computer models are improving their accuracy. It is time to utilize this information, anticipate the long range weather trends and adjusts your forecasts and build rates, rather than reacting to the weather trends after they occur. We suggest you start trying this "on paper" and "get your feet wet" while the long range forecasts continue to improve in accuracy. This will allow you to be able to apply the methods as soon as you feel confident in them. It will also force you to quantify the impact of weather upon your sales. Depending upon the geography of your sales (local dealer vs. international builder) you may have to divide you sales areas into regions and consider the weather impacts in each one. You can use recent sales data and recent weather trends to estimate future impacts of weather trends.<p>

Some commodity weather forecast information is available in the <a href="../../../links/otherl.htm#climate">Climate Segment</A> of our Other Useful Links Section. Also, there are professional meteorologists who will aid you in doing determining future weather trends in the areas of concern to you. Some of them sell general reports and others will make a report specifically for your needs. A few of these of these firms are also represented in the Climate Segment Links<p>

Be sure to remember we are not talking about hurricanes or a few big storms. We are talking about long term periods of cold, damp, rainy, or cloudy weather that reduce or prevent the frequency of boating activities over large portions of your sales area. Or in the case of drive manufacturers, over large portions of the sales areas of your customers. Any trend away from the normal number of warm sunny days in the area will effect boat sales. Notice, they can also be positively effected in abnormally long sunny warm spells. Not to play Dilbert, but historically management blames poor financial performance on bad weather and then when sales blossom due to long extended periods of great weather, good sound management is credited.  A number of references for weather data are in the <a href="../../../folders/lib/lib.htm">Library Folder</A>. If anybody wants to really try this, we can link you to U.S. and International historical weather data and share a few more related ideas. Just e-mail us at

<h4><b>Business Indicators</b></h4><p>

For those trying to forecast future sales based on past trends in government indicators (some feel the boating industry leads or lags certain indicators), there is a web site that allows you access to government indicators historical data. You can find  the various elements you want and download them. Later you can create your own spreadsheet, weight the variables, and even put them on different time lines (lead or lag each other) in an attempt to predict swings in boating industry sales. <A HREF="http://www.cris.com/~netlink/bci/bci.html">Business Cycle Indicators</A> is the site you need for these types of calculations.<p>

<b>BEM - Big Emerging Markets<p></b>

The U.S. Dept. of Commerce has printed an excellent book, "Big Emerging Markets: 1996 Outlook and Sourcebook" some of which is online. It discusses the emerging markets in China, Asia, and other areas of the world. It is a "must have" book for those doing business in these areas.

<b>China <p></b>

An excellent background article on the new large dam (Three Gorges Dam) being built in China appeared on the front page of the 18 April 1994 Wall Street Journal. The article was titled, "Dammed Yangtze - Despite Vast Obstacles Chines Move to Tap Power of Historic River". The 550 foot tall dam is expected to take two decades to build. It will stretch from Sandouping, a village in Hubei Province to Chongqing in Sichuan Province. The resulting lake will be about as long as Lake Superior, but narrower. <i>This coming huge lake plus the improving economy may do significant things to the boat market there??</i><p>

On this page we will provide some tools and discuss some of the current theories that may have a bearing on the boat building industry.<p>
<hr>

<b><h4>Baby Boomer Lifestyles</h4></b>

We have recently seen a few articles on the "aging baby boomers" saying they may not age (go to rocking chairs) like prior generations. Many intend to continue their active lifestyles into retirement. This could have significant positive effect upon the boating industry. We find those articles and reference them here. <p>
<hr>


<a name=firefly></A>
<b><h4>Firefly</h4></b>

A web site, <a href="http://firefly.com">firefly.com</A> has created a stir about psychographic marketing. There is an excellent article about the site and this situation in the Oct. 7, 1996 Business Week beginning on page 100. The article is titled, "Why Firefly Has Mad Ave. Buzzing" . The site began by allowing people to enter their preferences in movies and records. As a large database developed, they began to be able to sort the people and find those with similar likes. They use that ability to help you find additional movies or records you would probably like (other with your similar likes, liked them). The site was launched in January of 1996 and already has an estimated 300,000 users. They are selling CD's online as well as selling advertising space to others.<p>

The search engine, a special agent software, said to be a year ahead of others, is the secret to the site's success. The site never even asks you for your name. You sign in with an alias and it begins to build a profile for you. You can contact others with your similar likes, chat on-line, and write reviews.<p>

<i>This kind of technology and site might be able to identify potential boaters??</i>

<pre>We will be posting the latest / newest ideas 
at the top of the page</pre>
<hr>


<h4>Boat Trailer Backup Flag</h4><p>

Imagine a coiled spring about 3/8 inches in internal diameter and 18 inches long. Take a 2 foot long 3/8 inches in diameter fiberglass rod and jam about 6 inches of it into the open end of the coiled spring. Put a cheap tyvek or plastic flag on the other end of the rod. Provide a mounting for the other end of the coiled spring vertically about 6 inches behind the trailer hitch on the boat trailer. Now you have a fiberglass rod with a flag on it that reaches about 3 feet above the trailer hitch which makes it much easier to imagine where the hitch is as you back up the tow vehicle. Provide a "catch" that allows you to bend the coiled spring over toward the rear of the trailer and latch the fiberglass rod under a "catch". This catch could have the cross section of a "C" with the rod first going down past in and then allowing it to spring back up into the open end of the "C" .  This would be a storing position for getting the rod out of the way during normal operation. To release the rod, just push it down out of the "C" catch and pull it slightly to the side as it comes up around the catch. If this doesn't make sense drop us an e-mail (see top of page) and we'll post a sketch.<p>


<hr>

<h4>Combination Engine / Water Jet</h4><p>


This idea still needs some help, but the basic concept is to use a very slow rpm piston engine and to have some of the pistons firing like normal and some of them pumping water. The water comes from below the boat and is expelled out the back as a water jet. The water also cools the engine as it flows through it. Perhaps there is a better way to integrate an engine and a water jet? They seem to both run on a horizontal bearing supported rotating shaft or crank. If you could get the jet water to also function as engine coolant it seems like it would be a nice package. Maybe one of the development type engines (as seen in the <a href="../links/otherl.htm#engines">Engine Links</A> on our Other Useful Links page) has a better fit to this application than conventional automotive type engines?<p>


<hr>


<h4>Tapered Boat Butt</h4><p>

Canoes and kayaks glide through the water because of their long thin shape which tapers back to a narrow area at each end. Recreational boats are wide (for passengers and space) and then chopped off bluntly to hang and outboard or stern drive off the back. Inboard are often put in boats that were basically designed for outboards and stern drives so they also have blunt sterns. "What if" their was a "well" in the boat where the drive is now, and they hull wrapped on around it and tapered back together at the rear. You would need to have a "step" to allow the water to come up to where the drive is and remain at that height as it exited that would form a line down the middle of the boat. <p>

Currently the recreational boat hull have a huge amount of drag caused by the turbulence of the blunt stern. In addition to this, their is a large drag cause by the propeller trying to pull water away from the transom and a large suction drag due to the transom constantly trying to break loose from the water behind it (this creates a vacuum over the water covered portion of the transom, which creates a sizeable drag.<p>

You could form some kind of appendage hull to test this concept and see if it bears any merit. If you want to really think wild, what it this add on were inflatable? <p>

Here is a related clip you might find interesting from the November 14, 1994 issue of Business Week, page 79.<br>

"To cut wind drag and boost mileage on a bus, try a 12-foot inflatable tail, say Texas Tech University engineer Herbert J. Carpenter. Its approved for use in Arizona."<p>

There is another clip in the August 1990 issue of NASA Tech Briefs on page 56, titled "Reducing Aerodynamic Drag of Bluff Bodies". It describes using two thin flat vertical panels to reduced aerodynamic drag of road-transport type vehicles.<p>


Obviously there are a lot of center of gravity, turning, and stability issues to worry about, but it just might work????
<hr>

<h4>"Smart" Boat Seat Eliminates Bouncing</h4><p>

How about a boat seat that stays put while the boat hull bashes up and down in rough water? It would make the ride much easier on older folks and might lure some more people into boating.<p> 

Some similar work has been done in cars, see Business Week 5 December 1994 story titled, "Smart Car Seats that Meet Potholes Halfway". It tells of engineer Farid M.L. Amirouche of the University of Illinois at Chicago developing a seat for people who spend a lot of time on the road. News of every pothole is relayed by electronic sensors in the suspension system to an on-board computer that compares data with mathematical models. The computer then orders actuators under the seat to absorb the shock before it reaches the driver. The article also says he is working on a system that compensates for the way road bumps affect the upper body. The system uses seat belt sensors and dashboard lasers to measure changes in the drivers head and body orientation.<p>

Also snowmobiles are working in the area. The October 1996 issue of Popular Science page 17 shows a, "Suspension of Disbelief",  from Bombarier that allows you to flip a switch "on the fly' to adjust the high-performance rear suspension system for different loads or trail types. The switch operates and air compressor that corrects the air pressure in the shocks. <p>

As "baby boomers" age, they may no longer like getting beat to death by rough water. Women don't like being "all shook up". High end yatch types may be willing to pay for comfort. How about it???

<hr>


<h4>Stealth Prop Guard</h4>

"Prop Guard" has been a bad word in the industry. Companies fear that they might be required, that they will reduce performance, that boats without them might be considered dangerous, that they might cause even more or greater injuries, that they cost money, etc. The boating accident literature indicates that a large percentage of prop injuries occur when the boat is stopped or backing up and the prop is "in gear". Today's technology is developing all kinds of non contact sensors (light, motion, mass, sound, laser, heat, etc) to detect things and people in certain areas. Why not try to apply this technology to the transom area of the boat and if you detect people in the "danger zone" near the prop in the water and either electronically shift to neutral, set off an alarm, or handle it however you wish. It seems like a low cost "black box" with a few sensors might be and "add on" product that could sell like hotcakes??? It could also show the boating industry is really concerned about the issue instead of just trying to defend its position in court. The project would have to address the hot, wet, noisy environment plus the fact the boat is sometimes started up near a pier or some other inanimate object.  Perhaps the technology could be refined to be forward looking as well and sense people in the water in front of the boat?<p>

A small "black box" of potted electronics and sensors with an output connector or an  internal horn could be marketed similar to depth finders. <p>

If your still having trouble imagining this, check out these two stories. <br>
"Miniature Radar". Nasa Tech Briefs October 1996 page 24<p>

"Radar Revolution" by Joe Constance on pages 37-40 of the September 1996 issue of Compressed Air<p>

'Radar Revolution" (above) includes photos of a unit in a car tail light to detect objects behind a car.<p>

And if you still don't think "it's time has come" check out the "Pet Department" heading on page 6 of the November 1996 issue of Sensors. It talks of a<i> Catscram</i> product offered by Alsto's Hand Helpers that uses passive infrared motion detectors to respond to the approach of a cat and responds with an ultrasonic horn. <i>Catwatch </i>is the outdoor version of the same device.

<hr>

<h4>Water Rescue Device</h4><p>

The October 1995 issue of NASA Tech Briefs on pages 82 -84 describes an "Inflatable Pole" gun looking device that fires an extendable "hand". When not in use it collapses to 3 to 5 percent of its length. A nitrogen bottle inflates the 2 inch diameter fabric covered collapsed tube. Their unit can reach 20 feet and only weights 7 ounces. The reach can be controlled by a trigger as the unit is deployed.  Doesn't this sound like a boat / lifeguard rescue device?? NASA has filed patents on the basic unit and is offering licensing for commercial development. A couple of photos are below.<p>

<BODY>

<center><h3><b>Editorial Page</b></h3></center>

We will be posting some of our own ideas and views about the industry here <p>
<hr>

<b><h3>MARKETING SECTION</h3></b><p>

Some general marketing areas we think the industry may have a shortfall in are segmentation of the end users, collecting data on used boat sales, and creating a model for the boat market.  We hope to try to bring about some improvements in these areas. <p>

<h4>Market Segmentation</h4><p>

Many companies in the industry just consider the "end user" a boater and try to lump them all together. When you look at the wide span of powerboats from small fishing boats, to ski boats, to pontoon boats, to large cruisers and high performance boats it is apparent that not all of the end users share the same personal characteristics or have the same needs. We think some work could be done in the area of segmenting the industry and getting better descriptions of the customers of the various segments. This could allow you to  identify potential customers in your segments and communicate with them. Drive Companies and Boat Builders could get their inputs into new designs. Boat Dealers could sell them the products they really want.<p>

<h4>Used Boat Sales Data</h4><p>

Currently used boat sales data is not easily available. This data (size, type, and number of used boats being sold, seller (individual or dealer), purchaser information (dealer, new boater, experienced boater), etc.) needs to be collected. It will be very difficult to move onto the next step (Modeling the Boat Market) without the availability of used boat sales data. When new people come into boating what percentage of them buy a new vs. a used boat???? How does this ratio change as some of the industry driving forces change and as new boats begin to slash their prices when the market is tough??<p>


<h4>Boat Market Model</h4><p>

A model of the industry that showed how the various groups interacted with one another and what the driving forces of the industry really are (low interest rates, consumer confidence, good weather, available water, good facilities, ??????) could be of great use to the industry. It could show how changes in one area would effect another. It might have to be done on a SEGMENT by SEGMENT basis. It could also show which areas of the country have the greatest potential for boating growth if only one variable was influenced. It should also show where the market is the easiest and the toughest today. <p>


<h4>Quit Keeping the Cost of Boating a Secret</h4>

Another area I think needs some more research is the actual cost of boating. Some basic information in this area is available in some on the <a href="../folders/econ/econ.htm">Economic Boating Studies</a> in the Economics Folder. Boating is obviously an expensive leisure activity and the public needs to better understand that before they pick it up and are forced to drop out due to the high cost of participation. You do not want to use the cost of participation data to "run people off". You just need to be honest with them and find ways of presenting the data and comparing it to other leisure activities. You might try showing costs on a per hour basis?<p>

A good reference in this area is, "Recreation Economic Decisions: Comparing Benefits and Costs" by Richard G. Walsh at Colorado State University. This 600 plus page 1986 book published by Venture Publishing in State College PA shows many ways of calculating and comparing the costs of various leisure activities. It also includes quite a bit of data, but the data is now old. The calculations can be redone with today's data and some interesting insights can be gained. <p>


<h4>Partnership Ownership of Boats</h4>

Why not more partnership or group ownership of boats. It is prevalent in small airplanes. It seems like dealers and others could do some work to find those in their area interested in pursuing joint ownership, bring them together,  and help them with some legal forms, etc. This would seemingly introduce a lot more people to boating by lowering the participation costs?? 


<h4>Subsidize Fun and Needed Boating Activities</h4><p>

How about some of the big companies in the industry subsidizing some "mom and pop" operations that help make boating more fun. Things like "boat in" hot dog stands at the lake,  "boat in" movies, people to organize and manage on water activities such as boat rallies, people to train marinas in how to keep their places clean, provide "day care" facilities near the water, provide aerobic classes on a floating dock, teach swimming lessons, people to assist rangers in very busy times, teach ski lessons, floating pop stand, drive in theater for families to go to at night, provide religious services on or near the water, etc. Many of these operations cannot financially sustain themselves. With a little help from the big manufacturers they could make boating much more fun, which would result in many more boats being sold. One family might actually be able to provide several of the activities.<p>

<h3>Freightliner's  Use of Computers in Customer Service 
</h3>
<hr>
This article describes many computer applications at Freightliner, the large truck manufacturer. The article discusses being able to link an ECM (engine control module) to a cell phone which can relay stored and actual running data to diagnosticians while the truck is still rolling down the road. People and parts can be prepared for its arrival. Minimal downtime results in happy customers.<p>

<h3>Truck Makers' Operations <br>
Gain From High Technology</h3>

<pre>
The Wall Street Journal 
Technology Supplement pages R18 and R20
November 18, 1996</pre>

By AARON LUCCHETTI</p>

When it comes to making and selling heavy-duty trucks,<b> Freightliner
Corp.</b> believes it has hit upon a basic truth: Computing power is just as
important as horsepower.</p>

The Portland, Ore., manufacturer, a unit of Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG, has invested millions of dollars
in computers over the past few years -- building networks to connect
dealerships to headquarters, developing on-board devices that help diagnose
mechanical problems, and using workstations to streamline the manufacturing
process.</p>

<p>''Today's truck driver is paid based on his efficiency,'' says
Freightliner President and Chief Executive Officer James L. Hebe. ''We're
using technology to allow that customer to move more competitively and
efficiently.''</p>

<p>It's a philosophy that has spread through the truck industry since
deregulation increased competition among manufacturers in the mid-1980s.
The half-dozen or so major U.S. truck makers have abandoned their
long-standing aversion to high-tech and are beginning to integrate
computers into their operations, from tracking inventory to fixing
engines.</p>

<p>But experts say Freightliner has been most aggressive in marketing its
innovations to dealers and fleet operators. ''Every one of the truck
companies has [computerized] systems, but Freightliner is more vocal about
these things,'' says Bill Leasure, executive director of the Truck
Manufacturers Association in Washington, D.C. ''They're out in front'' with
promotion.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>Big Wheel</b></p>
<p>And the strategy has worked. Freightliner has increased its share of the
competitive market for king-size trucks for each of the past seven years:
The company currently sells 29.5% of all king-size trucks, up from 23.1% in
1992, when it wrested the No. 1 spot from
Navistar International  Corp. The
surge is due in large part to the technology push, company officials
say.</p>

<p>The effort began in the late 1980s, when Freightliner moved to integrate
computers into every stage of its business. Take buying a truck. Customers
used to order the vehicles from dealers by perusing a four-inch-thick
binder that offered thousands of options. It typically took a dealer about
two hours to process an order, and a few more days for the order to reach
headquarters by mail.</p>

<p>Then the company decided to streamline the process, using a computer
network to link dealers to headquarters. The new system, which is currently
being updated to Windows, replaces the catalog with an easily accessible
database and gives salespeople information on the compatibility of parts at
the click of a mouse. And when an order is ready to go, it can simply be
zapped over phone lines.</p>

<p>Ordering parts has also been simplified using a Windows-based system.
Not only does the computer cut about 30 minutes off the processing time for
each order, say dealers, but it doesn't take as long to train salespeople:
only about one to three days, down from several weeks before the
system.</p>

<p>The technology can be expensive -- up to $36,000 a year for larger
dealerships. ''You've got to have a fairly healthy business to afford the
technology,'' says Jack W. Porter, general manager of the Valley
Freightliner Inc. dealership in Pacific, Wash.</p>

<p>Yet, he says, there are unquestionable benefits. The Portland
Freightliner Inc. dealership, Portland, Ore., has seen its truck sales
triple since installing the system, and it has reduced its sales staff to
five from seven. Nationwide, Freightliner has increased its after-market
parts sales by 52% since 1992, due in part to the success of the ordering
system.</p>

<p>Customer satisfaction has also gotten a boost, dealers say. With
on-screen diagrams helping salespeople pinpoint the correct part for each
truck, there are fewer mistakes.</p>

<p>''Some years ago, it wasn't uncommon to have a customer say, 'You always
give us the wrong part,' '' says Michael McBride, general manager of the
Portland dealership. ''Now, it still happens, but not as often.''</p>

<p>This year, at an estimated cost of $1 million, the company will try to
duplicate that success in parts sales to truck fleets. Currently, fleets
can buy parts from independents and other suppliers, but Freightliner
thinks it can grab more of that parts business by offering fleet shops a
computer link to Freightliner dealers.</p>

<p>Modeled after inventory-control systems at retailers such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Freightliner's inventory system
speeds the ordering process and allows for more efficient just-in-time
shipments. For
US Xpress Inc.,
a Chattanooga, Tenn., trucking company that uses 2,350 Freightliner trucks,
the test version of the automatic ordering system allowed eight fleet shops
to cut inventory to $100,000 from $500,000 -- at a cost of about $6,500 for
computer terminals and software.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>Driving Logic</b></p>
<p>Freightliner is also using computers to overhaul its repair system. Like
many truck makers, Freightliner equips its vehicles with diagnostic
computers that keep track of engine performance. When drivers pull in to
the company's service stations, mechanics can simply plug a computer into
the truck and download detailed information about the engine to check for
problems.</p>

<p><b>But Freightliner has taken the concept a step further. In addition to
safety features such as electronic braking, speed control and a radar-based
collision-warning system, the company now offers an optional on-board
computer, installed behind the driver's seat, that records 50 types of
diagnostic information. When the device detects a problem -- from rapid
deceleration to high oil temperature -- it alerts the driver on a two-line
dashboard monitor and starts recording data. If the driver gets to one of
the 155 Freightliner service stations that has compatible computer gear,
the mechanic's computer will not only download the diagnostic data, but
also suggest possible causes of trouble based on the readings.</b></p>

<p>This system considerably lessens mechanics' role in tracking down
malfunctions -- and also reduces the need to hire seasoned, and expensive,
journeymen. ''I could diagnose the problem in this truck, and I'm not even
a truck person,'' says Brett Clancy, a systems coordinator at Portland
Freightliner.</p>

<p>Freightliner says that having mechanics try to puzzle through problems
was just too time-consuming and imprecise. And some mechanics agree. ''It's
just too complex to work on [advanced new trucks] without some type of
computer,'' says Danny Wilson, a mechanic at Portland Freightliner.</p>
<p>The price? Max Fuller, co-chairman of US Xpress, says the extra
technology on the truck alone adds $4,000 to $7,000 to the truck's overall
price of $70,000 to $100,000. But ''if we avoid an accident or deliver a
load on time'' as a result of technology, it is worth the extra cost, Mr.
Fuller says.</p>

<p>Although Freightliner predicts the systems will eventually reduce
warranty-repair costs, the short-term expense has been huge -- in fact,
says Mr. Hebe, the CEO, the service changes have been among the most costly
initiatives Freightliner has undertaken. The manufacturer has had to hire
three software companies to put together and update its database. Moreover,
the company has struggled to teach tradition-bound mechanics how to use the
machines.</p>

<p>''It's a major change,'' says Mr. Wilson. ''Some want to learn something
new; others say they screw up an ATM, so keep it away. [But] sooner or
later, they'll have to learn.''</p>

<p><b>The company is currently trying to streamline the diagnosing process
even further. The idea: A truck driver would use a cellular phone or
satellite link to transmit the on-board computer's diagnostic information
to a service station, however far away. The mechanic's computer would then
analyze the data and suggest a solution -- or pose further questions to ask
the driver to pinpoint the problem. The mechanic could even order parts
before the truck pulled in for repair.</b></p>

<p>To offer the service -- which Freightliner says is at least a year away
from completion -- the company hopes to piggyback on fleet operators'
existing cellular and satellite-based networks. <b>Currently, about half of
the bigger fleets give their drivers cellular phones or satellite links to
let them know about future routes or changes in instructions</b>, says Robert
D. Pritchard, director of regional economic analysis for the American
Trucking Association's policy-research foundation in Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Screen Savings</b></p>

<p>Internally, Freightliner is pursuing computer enhancements that speed up
production. Over the past two years, the manufacturer has installed a
computer network -- comprising 1,180 terminals -- in four out of its five
North American assembly plants.</p>

<p>The network essentially replaces the old system of distributing truck
plans to workers. Every vehicle that came down the assembly line meant a
new set of plans to be drawn up and distributed to workers; last-minute
changes slowed the production process by forcing managers to redraw plans
and distribute those. Now all plans are stored on a Windows-based system,
and can be updated easily, or called up by employees when needed.</p>
<p>The company expects the $10 million network will shave about 1.8 hours
off production time for each truck. Already, officials say, <b>warranty claims
for manufacturer errors have been reduced 20%. </b>(The company won't say how
much money that comes to.)</p>

<p>In the long term, Mr. Hebe thinks computer-based efficiencies will help
Freightliner diversify and go global. The company is opening plants in
Saudi Arabia, Israel and South Africa, and has already started diversifying
into making firetrucks and school buses.</p>

<p>But the newest systems will take years before providing a return on the
company's investment, Freightliner officials say.</p>

<p>Moreover, continuing the innovations might prove 
even more difficult down the road. Officials at Freightliner say technological improvements
were made possible by a comfortable profit base. But the cyclical trucking
industry is currently in a downswing, and many companies have laid off
workers in the face of declining sales.</p>

<p>At Freightliner, where sales leveled off near 30,000 units through July,
about 800 workers have been laid off nationwide. And officials acknowledge
the hard road ahead. ''Technology isn't free,'' says Mr. Hebe, ''and it's
very difficult.''</p>

 SUMMARY
 
 This article is derived from a telegraphic report dated 12 May 1993,
 prepared at the American Embassy - Brussels (USEC).  It discusses European
 Community regulations affecting marine recreation equipment.  The article
 consists of 2 pages.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12 MAY 93
 
 USEC BRUSSELS
 
 SUBJECT: THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S RECREATIONAL CRAFT AND
 MARINE EQUIPMENT LEGISLATION -- AN UPDATE
 
 1.  SUMMARY.  FCS USEC SENIOR FSN MET WITH COMMISSION DG
 III/E/4 HEAD OF DIVISION CARVALHO AND TECHNICAL EXPERT
 KASPER RE: THE COMMISSION'S WORK IN THE AREAS OF
 RECREATIONAL CRAFT AND MARINE EQUIPMENT.  WHILE THE
 RECREATIONAL CRAFT DIRECTIVE IS WELL ON ITS WAY TO BEING
 ADOPTED, THE MARINE EQUIPMENT LEGISLATION IS STILL IN
 ITS INFANCY.  END SUMMARY.
 2.  RECREATIONAL CRAFT DIRECTIVE.  THE PROPOSED
 RECREATIONAL CRAFT DIRECTIVE WAS PUBLISHED IN
 MAY 1992 (OJ C 123, 1992) AND DISCUSSED IN THE COUNCIL
 AT THE END OF 1992.  IT WAS AMENDED IN FEBRUARY 1993 (OJ
 C 59, 1993) TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WORDING CLARIFICATIONS
 PROPOSED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
 COMMITTEE.  A COUNCIL COMMON POSITION IS EXPECTED IN
 JUNE 1993, WITH ADOPTION SOMETIME THEREAFTER.  THIS
 TIMEFRAME MAY BE OPTIMISTIC: APPARENTLY THERE REMAIN
 DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN MEMBER STATE REPRESENTATIVES OVER
 UNSPECIFIED DETAILS.  INDUSTRY, THROUGH THE
 INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF MARINE INDUSTRY ASSOCATIONS
 (ICOMIA) AND ITS U.S. MEMBER NATIONAL MARINE
 MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (NMMA), HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN
 THE DRAFTING OF THIS DIRECTIVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
 AND SUPPORTS ITS IMPLEMENTATION.
 3.  MARINE EQUIPMENT LEGISLATION.  WORK ON MARINE
 EQUIPMENT LEGISLATION HAS NOT PROGRESSED MUCH.
 WORK IN DIRECTORATE GENERAL III HAS BEEN ON
 HOLD SINCE THE TURN OF THE YEAR DUE TO THE DEPARTURE OF
 THE TECHNICAL EXPERT FROM THE U.K., DR. MORRALL.  WITH
 THE ARRIVAL OF MR. KASPER FROM DENMARK, DIVISION HEAD
 CARVALHO HOPES THAT WORK ON THE EXISTING DRAFT
 LEGISLATION WORKING PAPERS WILL ACCELERATE.  AS
 DESCRIBED IN REFTEL A, THE COMMISSION IS STILL LOOKING
 AT THREE TO FOUR PIECES OF LEGISLATION (INCLUDING NEW
 APPROACH) TO COVER THIS IMPORTANT SECTOR.
 4.  COMMISSION COMMUNICATION ON MARINE SAFETY.  WORK IN
 THE MARINE AREA IS NOW GUIDED BY A RECENT
 DIRECTORATE-GENERAL VII (TRANSPORT) COMMUNICATION
 (COM(93) 66 OF FEB 24) ON "A COMMON APPROACH TO MARITIME
 SECURITY," IN WHICH THE FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE WORK IN THE
 MARINE AREA WILL BE BASED.  THE COMMUNICATION (NOT YET
 AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH DUE TO TRANSLATION DIFFICULTIES) IS
 BASED IN PART ON THE REALIZATION THAT THE COMMUNITY
 CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE THE VARIOUS IMO RULES APPLIED
 DIFFERENTLY BY THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY.  THE
 COMMUNICATION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR THE
 HARMONIZED APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARITIME
 ORGANIZATION (IMO) CONVENTIONS AND FOR HARMONIZED EC
 RULES COVERING THOSE AREAS NOT ADDRESSED BY IMO.
 5.  OTHER MARINE RELATED WORK.  CONTRARY TO THE WISHES
 OF INDUSTRY, THE COMMISSION IS TAKING A CAUTIOUS
 APPROACH TO LEGISLATING ON PLEASURE <STRONG>BOAT</STRONG> EMISSIONS.
 RECENT GERMAN LEGISLATION ON RECREATIONAL CRAFT
 EMISSIONS FOR THE BADENSEE LAKE HAD PROMPTED INDUSTRY TO
 CALL FOR EC-WIDE LEGISLATION COVERING EMISSIONS.  THE
 COMMISSION, HOWEVER, HAS DECIDED THAT, BECAUSE ONLY ONE
 MEMBER STATE HAS TAKEN SUCH AN INITIATIVE, IT WOULD BE
 PRECIPITOUS TO START LEGISLATING AT THE EC-LEVEL.

     These categories are used to inventory the combustion and refueling

     emissions from the use of pleasure craft and commercial boats.  The

     results of this inventory are presented in Tables II, III, IV, and V.



     The methodology for these combustion categories is taken directly

     from a study conducted in 1977 by KVB, Inc. for the Air Resources

     Board.  The 1977 KVB fuel consumption estimates were used to

     estimate those in 1987.  Based on data from boat registration, an

     increase of 23 percent from 1983 to 1987 was assumed for fuel use.



     In the study by KVB, pleasure craft were defined as boats used for

     cruising, water skiing, sport fishing, and other recreational

     activities.  These include:



        inboard/outboard motor boats

        jet powered craft



     as well as the following boats while using auxiliary power:



        rowboats

        sailboats

        Canoes



     Commercial boats were defined by KVB to include the following:



        commercial and party fishing boats

        tug boats

        work boats

        lightering barges

        excursion boats

        miscellaneous small commercial utility craft

        U. S. Coast Guard vessels

        passenger and cargo boats





     The methodology to inventory emissions from both recreational and

     commercial boats is detailed in the KVB study and is summarized

     here as follows:



     1. determine boat population

     2. locate areas of operation

     3. determine average boat usage

     4. calculate the fuel consumption of the various classes of boats

     5. apply emission factors to calculate the emissions



     KVB reported emissions by four types of waterways:  Lakes, rivers,

     deltas and coastal regions.  Table I gives the diesel and gasoline

     emission factors for both pleasure craft and commercial boats for

     each waterway type, for each county.  Table I also gives the gasoline

     powered refueling emissions which are uniform for each county and

     waterway type.



     The county wide emissions for each category are obtained by

     multiplying the fuel combustion by the respective emission factors

     and then summing the emissions of different waterway types.  This is

     illustrated in the Sample Calculations.



ASSUMPTIONS



     1.  The number of days used per year by boats and the patterns of

         occurrence of boats used in the KVB study are valid for 1987.



     2.  Fuel consumption values for both pleasure and commercial boats

         are relative to boat registration.



     3.  All pleasure boats are registered with DMV.



COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



     The KVB's methodology may be followed to develop original emission

     estimates for 1987.  This will produce results that are more

     representative of 1987 and possibly show the magnitude of

     year-to-year variations of boating activities.



CHANGES IN METHODOLOGY



     There are no changes in methodology between the 1983 and 1987

     inventory.  The 1977 KVB fuel consumption estimates for boat types

     were used to estimate the 1987 emissions.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1983 AND 1987 EMISSION ESTIMATES



     The 1987 emission estimates are higher than the 1983 due to an

     increase in boat population.



TEMPORAL ACTIVITY



     The annual activity occurs primarily during the late spring, summer,

     and fall.  The weekly activity occurs seven days per week, but with

     most of the activity on weekends.  The daily activity occurs mostly

     during daylight hours.

  <B>COAST GUARD ISSUES WARNING<BR>
  ABOUT UNAPPROVED LIFE JACKETS</B>
  <P>
  
     The U.S. Coast Guard today warned of a potential problem with certain unapproved
  inflatable life jackets.
  <P>     The problem does not exist with inflatable life jackets approved by the Coast Guard. 
  Inflatable life jackets are also known as personal flotation devices or PFDs.
  <P>
     Halkey-Roberts, a manufacturer of inflator mechanisms for the  PFD industry, has
  reported that its manual-automatic mechanisms, Mark II (product number V80000) and Mark III,
  (product number V83000), when used in combination with carbon dioxide cylinders with a half-
  inch threaded neck produced by Nippon Tansan Gas Company (NTG) and distributed by either
  NTG or Leland Limited, sometimes fail to pierce the cylinder when activated automatically by
  water.  The same potential condition holds for United Moulders, Ltd., (UML) Mark III manual-
  semiautomatic mechanisms when used in combination with the NTG/Leland CO2 cylinder.  
   <P>
     According to the Coast Guard, the Halkey-Roberts inflators are not marked with an
  identifying product number and are made in the color of black only.  Likewise, Leland/NTG
  cylinders are marked  Leland  or  NTG  but may be coated, making the marking invisible.
  <P>
     The Coast Guard emphasized that the products named are not faulty in themselves, but
  that they may not work well together.  No problems have been reported to the Coast Guard in the
  manual operation of these devices, nor have any problems been reported with these parts when
  used in combination with other inflators or cylinders.
  <P>
     Consumers who want more information should contact the manufacturers of their
  inflatable PFDs.  The following manufacturers have informed the Coast Guard of affected
  models and would like owners of these models to call:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  Manufacturer/PFD Name       Telephone Number    PFD Model Numbers
  Lifesaving Systems/Pro-Lite (813) 645-2748      481-AO, 481-AN
  Mustang/CrewFit             (800) 526-0532      C10171, C11601,     
                                                  C10173, C11603 
                                                  (with harness)
                                                  C10014, C10019
                                                  (recharge kits)     
  Sporting Lives/SOSpenders   (800) 858-5876      120A, 120AH, 123A
  Stearns/Secumar             (800) 783-2767      1140, 1150
  Survival Technologies/Techvest(800) 525-2747         B01322, B01325,
  Survival Technologies/Techfloat                 and B01615
  </PRE>
     The Coast Guard urged owners of Techvests and Techfloats to check their model number against
  those listed because Survival Technologies coats its cylinders and  NTG  is not visible on the cylinders.
  <P>
     The list includes only information that has been provided by manufacturers.  As a result, the
  Coast Guard noted that manufacturers not listed may have inflatable PFDs with this inflator-cylinder
  combination and urged owners of inflatable PFDs to check their equipment for this combination of
  inflator and cylinder.
  <P>
     Because the products involved are not Coast Guard-approved, the Coast Guard cannot give
  authoritative instructions on how they should be handled.  Owners of affected PFDs should be aware that
  unless the manufacturer is contacted and corrective action is taken, these devices might not provide any
  flotation unless they are inflated manually.
  <P>
     Coast Guard-approved PFDs are expected to be available to the public before the 1997 boating
  season begins, and they will be marked with a U.S. Coast Guard approval number starting with 160.076.

<h3>COAST GUARD RED FLAGS SOME UNAPPROVED PFD'S"</h3><p>

<P>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Coast Guard today warned of
a potential problem with certain unapproved inflatable life jackets.
The problem does not exist with inflatable life jackets approved by
the Coast Guard. Inflatable life jackets are also known as personal
flotation devices or PFDs.</FONT></P>

<P>Halkey-Roberts, a manufacturer of inflator
mechanisms for the PFD industry, has reported that its
manual-automatic mechanisms, Mark II (product number V80000) and Mark
III, (product number V83000), when used in combination with carbon
dioxide cylinders with a half-inch threaded neck produced by Nippon
Tansan Gas Company (NTG) and distributed by either NTG or Leland
Limited, sometimes fail to pierce the cylinder when activated
automatically by water. The same potential condition holds for United
Mouldes, Ltd., (UML) Mark III manual-semiautomatic mechanisms when
used in combination with the NTG/Leland C02 cylinder.</FONT></P>

<P>According to the Coast Guard, the Halkey-Roberts
inflators are not marked with an identifying product number and are
made in the color of black only. Likewise, Leland/NTG cylinders are
marked "Leland" or "NTG" but may be coated, making the marking
invisible.</FONT></P>

<P>The Coast Guard emphasized that the products named
are not faulty in themselves, but that they may not work well
together. No problems have been reported to the Coast Guard in the
manual operation of these devices, nor have any problems been
reported with these parts when used in combination with other
inflators or cylinders.</FONT></P>

<P>Consumers who want more information should contact
the manufacturers of their inflatable PFDs. </FONT></P>

<P>Because the products involved are not Coast
Guard-approved, the Coast Guard cannot give authoritative

these devices might not provide any flotation unless they are
inflated manually.</FONT></P>

<P>Coast Guard-approved PFDs are expected to be
available to the public before the 1997 boating season begins, and
they will be marked with a U.S. Coast Guard approval number starting

<title>Brunswick buys Igloo</title>

<H3>
Igloo Products Corp. Signs Deal with Brunswick Corp.
</H3>

<pre>Houston Chronicle 20 November 1996
By Charles Boisseau Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News</pre>
<HR>


<b>Igloo Products Corp. is warming up to new owners.</b></P>
<P>
The Houston company -- founded nearly 50 years ago as a maker of metal water
coolers for oil-field and construction workers -- said Tuesday it signed an
agreement to sell to Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp. for about $154
million in cash.</P>
<P>
Brunswick is the world's leading maker of pleasure boats and marine equipment,
operator of one of the largest bowling chains and a top maker of bowling
equipment.</P>
<P>
Privately owned Igloo would become part of a public company with $3.04 billion
in sales last year.</P>
<P>
The sellers are a group that includes majority owner Metropolitan Life and the
management team at Igloo, which owns a small interest in the company, Igloo
Chief Executive Jonathan Godshall said.</P>
<P>
Igloo's officers have stock options, some of which will be cashed in as part of
the purchase while others will be converted into shares of Brunswick, Godshall
said.</P>
<P>
Igloo will become part ofBrunswick's growing Outdoor Recreation Group based in
Tulsa, Okla. The group includes Zebco fishing tackle; newly acquired Nelson
Weather-Rite, maker of camping equipment; and Roadmaster Industries, maker of
bicycles and Flexible Flyer sleds and wagons.</P>
<P>
Brunswick has been expanding this group so it is less reliant on the cyclical
boating business, which makes up about three-quarters of its sales.</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal for Brunswick," Jill Krutick, an analyst with Smith Barney in
New York, said of the purchase. She said the sales price is typical for such a
transaction, equal to Igloo's annual sales of about $150 million.</P>
<P>
Brunswick corporate spokesman Ross Stemer said the purchase "fits in with
products we have." He noted every fisherman and camper takes along an ice chest
or cooler.</P>
<P>
Investors pushed up shares of Brunswick Tuesday by 1/8 to 25 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</P>
<P>
The companies said the transaction is expected to be completed early next year.</P>
<P>
In Igloo, Brunswick is buying the leader in the more than $400 million U.S.
market for ice chests, beverage coolers and jugs.</P>
<P>
Igloo has about 42 percent of the U.S. market, ahead of No. 2 Coleman Co. and
No. 3 Rubbermaid, said Ash Jaisin, president of Sports Market Research Group, a
Boston sporting goods market research firm.</P>
<P>
Unlike its rivals, which are involved in all manner of outdoor and storage
products, "Igloo is focused on only one thing: ice chests, coolers and jugs,"
Jaisin said.</P>
<P>
He added that, in contrast to Brunswick's recent purchases of camping and
bicycle companies, "this time they bought a leader, so the money was
well-spent."</P>
<P>
Igloo has operated as a private company since it was bought by a group of
investors in a 1987 leveraged buyout, led by Godshall and Igloo managers and
backed by investors Metropolitan Life and the investment banker First Boston,
which later sold its interest.</P>
<P>
Godshall said Igloo hired an investment banker and began searching for
acquisition partners earlier this year after Metropolitan Life officials said it
was time for them to cash in their investment.</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Life officials did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday.</P>
<P>
The option of selling shares to the public was explored but rejected, partly
because investors often shy away from highly seasonal businesses such as
Igloo's, in which sales during its busiest month -- June -- are 10 times those
in its slowest months, Godshall said.</P>
<P>
Igloo entertained purchase offers from several companies, but in the end decided
on Brunswick "because it made sense," he said. Among other things, he cited
Brunswick's promise to keep Igloo as an autonomous operation. Also, Brunswick's
other outdoor products divisions could offer Igloo expertise in marketing and
other areas.</P>
<P>
Godshall also said Brunswick could benefit from Igloo's stability during
economic doldrums. Unlike sales of boats, which typically sink during economic
downturns, sales of coolers and ice chests are aided by bad times, when people
often do more camping, picnicking and similar outdoor activities, he said.</P>
<P>
Igloo's roots go back to 1947, when it was founded as a metalworking shop called
Igloo Manufacturing Co. to make metal water coolers used on the job.</P>
<P>
While Igloo claims to make the only metal water cooler produced in the United
States, it has expanded mostly in plastics, making the world's first all-plastic
cooler in 1962.</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1970s, Igloo was purchased by a series of new owners, including
Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co., the Houston consumer products company that also made
such things as Chiffon margarine and Seven Seas salad dressings.</P>
<P>
In 1987, a year after Anderson, Clayton was bought by Quaker Oats, Igloo was
sold to the current owners.</P>
<P>
Today, Igloo produces nearly 1,000 products -- if you count the various colors
and configurations, including coolers on wheels and ones that plug into a car's
cigarette lighter.</P>
<P>
Thousands of motorists each day pass Igloo's water tower and manufacturing
buildings at its headquarters at West Sam Houston Parkway and Interstate 10. Its
other manufacturing plant and warehouse -- with about 500,000 square feet of
space -- is located in Katy.</P>
<P>
While sales slow down this time of year, Igloo's production operation is going
full blast, churning out next year's product line.</P>
<P>
Godshall and Vice President Lee Stranathan on Tuesday showed off one of two new
1,300-ton, $800,000 plastic injection molding machines -- the largest such
machines in the Houston area, they say -- used to make insulated liners for
Igloo coolers.</P>
<P>
In the morning, Godshall had met with Igloo's employees to reassure them they
expect no reduction in employment and operations. The company has about 1,500
workers, counting about 800 temporary workers it relies on during peak periods.</P>
<P>
"We told them today the impact will be zero," Godshall said.</P>
<P>
Stemer of Brunswick reiterated that message.</P>
<P>
"Igloo people will continue to operate independently. They're not going to be
merged into something else or swallowed up," Stemer said.</P>
<P>
In fact, in a rare interview, Godshall said the company hopes to gain employment
and business from Brunswick's other divisions, which do not have the plastics
design and production expertise that Igloo has built over the years.</P>
<P>
"We actually think it could be a growth opportunity," said Godshall, 48, a
Harvard business school graduate who came to Houston in 1973 to work at
Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co.</P>
<P>
It's the old adage, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," Stranathan said. "This
isn't a turnaround. This isn't a fix-up."</P>

Note 4 - Acquisitions

On March 8, 1996, the Company acquired the Nelson/Weather-Rite
camping division of Roadmaster Industries, Inc. for $120.0
million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.  The
Company acquired assets, including goodwill that will be
amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.  This
operation has been named the American Camper Division and is 
part of the Brunswick Outdoor Recreation Group of the Recreation
segment. 

On May 31, 1996, the Company acquired the assets related to the
Boston Whaler line of boats from Meridian Sports for $27.4
million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities.  The
Company acquired assets, including goodwill that will be
amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years.  This
operation is a part of the Sea Ray Division of the Marine
segment.   

On September 6, 1996, the Company acquired the assets related to
the Roadmaster bicycle business and other outdoor products,
including the Flexible Flyer line of sleds and wagons, from
Roadmaster Industries, Inc. for $197.7 million in cash and the
assumption of certain liabilities.  The Company acquired assets,
including goodwill that will be amortized using the straight-
line method over 40 years.  This operation has been included in
the Brunswick Outdoor Recreation Group of the Recreation segment. 

These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and have been
recorded using preliminary valuations of the opening balance
sheets.  Operating results are included in the Company's results
of operations since the dates of acquisition. 

<hr>

Note 5 - Discontinued Operations

On April 1, 1996, the Company announced its intention to divest
its freshwater fishing boat operations, which comprised
substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the
Fishing Boat Division in the Marine segment and included the
Starcraft, Fisher, MonArk, Spectrum, Astro and Procraft brands. 
Certain assets and liabilities of discontinued operations which
are being retained by the Company are reflected in the Company's
continuing operations in 1996.  In the second quarter, the
Company completed negotiations for the disposition of these
operations and in the third quarter has completed these
transactions.  These disposition transactions did not have a
significant effect upon the Company's consolidated results of
operations.  The net sales of the businesses divested for the
quarter ended September 30, 1995 were $46.9 million and for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 and 1995 were $80.4
million and $147.7 million, respectively.  Intercompany sales
between the continued and discontinued operations that were
previously eliminated in consolidation have been included in the
results of continuing operations.  

<hr>

Note 6 - Dispositions

In the second quarter of 1995, the Company announced its
intention to divest its golf club shaft business and the Circus
World Pizza operations in the Recreation segment and recorded a
$25.8 million restructuring charge to cover estimated losses on
the dispositions.  The Circus World divestiture was completed in 
1995 and the sale of the golf club shaft business was completed
in the second quarter of 1996. The losses associated with these 
transactions, including the estimated exposure on retained
liabilities, were adequately covered by the 1995 restructuring
charge. The net sales and operating earnings(losses)(excluding
divestiture provisions) of the businesses divested for the
quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 and 1995
were as follows (in millions):
                                 Quarter        Nine months 
                               1996      1995     1996     1995
Net sales                     $ 0.0     $ 4.6    $ 9.9    $16.4
Operating earnings(losses)    $ 0.0     $(1.9)   $ 1.4    $(5.8)

              Management's Discussion and Analysis

Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management assesses the Company's liquidity in terms of its 
overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and
investing activities.  Of particular importance in the management
of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities;
cash used to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
strategic activities; cash needed to service existing short- and
long-term debt and pay dividends; and the Company's ability to
secure long-term capital at reasonable terms.  

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, cash and cash
equivalents decreased $268.3 million to $76.0 million.  The
decline was primarily due to the Company's investing activities,
which included $354.4 million for acquisitions, $106.5 million
for capital expenditures and $42.8 million advanced to boat
manufacturers in connection with long-term engine supply
contracts.  These activities were funded with available cash
balances, cash generated from operating activities and commercial
paper borrowings.  

Cash generated from operating activities in the first nine months
of 1996 totalled $153.4 million versus $178.8 million in 1995.  
The primary components of cash generated from operating
activities include the Company s net earnings; the level of
noncash revenues and expenses included in net earnings; the
timing of cash flows relating to operating expenses, sales, and
income taxes; and the management of inventory levels.  The
decrease between periods reflects the impact of higher levels of
inventories and accounts receivable, primarily resulting from
increased sales volume.  During the first nine months of 1996,
the Company's net earnings increased to $156.7 million from
$105.0 million in 1995.  Net earnings in 1995 include a $40.0
million pretax ($24.4 million after-tax) restructuring charge and
a $7.0 million after-tax loss ($11.0 million pre-tax) on the
disposition of discontinued operations recorded in the second
quarter. 

During the first nine months of 1996, the Company invested $106.5
million in capital expenditures, an increase of $25.2 million
from 1995 levels.  This increase reflects the Company's continued
emphasis on investing to achieve improved production efficiencies
and product quality, supporting new product development
activities and maintaining existing production capacity. 
Management anticipates that 1996 capital expenditures may exceed
$160 million.

The Company also spent $354.4 million on acquisitions in the
first nine months of 1996, including the purchase of the
Roadmaster bicycle business for $197.7 million and American
Camper, formerly the Nelson/Weather-Rite camping division, for
$120.0 million from Roadmaster Industries, Inc.  The Boston
Whaler line of boats was purchased from Meridian Sports for $27.4
million.  Management continues to evaluate acquisition 
opportunities as it continues to reposition the Company's sales
and profit mix towards a higher contribution from consumer
recreation products that offer more stable growth opportunities.
<PAGE>
Total debt at September 30, 1996, was $408.0 million versus
$318.9 million at December 31, 1995, with debt-to-capitalization
ratios at those dates of 25.8% and 23.4%, respectively.  The
Company issued commercial paper during the third quarter of 1996
and $88.8 million was outstanding at September 30, 1996.  The
Company s debt structure at September 30, 1996, included $100.0
million of 8.125% notes due April 1, 1997, which Management
intends to refinance prior to maturity with long-term debt.  

The continued increased levels of capital expenditures and normal
operating cash requirements will be funded through existing cash
balances, cash generated from operating activities and short-term
commercial paper borrowing, if necessary.  Additional significant
acquisition activity or changes in business conditions would
require the Company to increase its borrowing levels in the near-
term.  The Company can provide the necessary liquidity from
various sources, including a revolving credit agreement,
commercial paper offerings, existing cash balances, and cash
generated from operating activities.  The Company continues to
maintain a $400 million long-term line of credit with a group of
banks.  For an explanation of the agreement and a discussion of
the specific covenant restrictions, see Note 8 - Debt.  In
addition, the Company filed a universal shelf registration in the
third quarter of 1996 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
for the issuance of up to $600 million in various equity and/or
debt securities.

Results of Operations - Third Quarter and the First Nine Months
of 1996 versus 1995

Consolidated

In the third quarter of 1996, consolidated sales increased 10% to
$763.6 million from $694.6 million, while year-to-date sales
increased 5% to $2,360.8 million from $2,240.8 million a year
ago.  In both 1996 periods, the Company benefitted from stronger
sales of its large boat units and from the contribution of the
newly acquired American Camper and Roadmaster bicycle businesses. 
The Company's results for the third quarter of 1995 and nine
months of 1996 and 1995 have been restated to account for the
recently divested freshwater fishing boat operations as
discontinued operations.  

International sales for the third quarter decreased 6% to $169.8
million in 1996 from $181.3 million in 1995.  In the year-to-date
periods, 1996 international sales declined to $570.1 million from
$606.8 million in 1995.  The reductions in both periods were
primarily due to the continued decline in the sales of bowling
capital equipment to the mature Korean and Taiwanese markets,
where new center development has substantially slowed, partially
offset by rapidly expanding sales volumes in China and other East
Asian countries, where volumes are not yet adequate to compensate
for the decline in the Taiwanese and Korean markets.  Based on
current market conditions, management expects this trend in
bowling capital equipment sales to continue throughout 1996.

The Company's consolidated operating earnings in the third
quarter increased 23% to $66.0 million in 1996 compared to $53.6
million in 1995, while nine-month operating earnings levels 
rose 40% to $255.9 million in 1996 from $182.9 million in 1995. 
The increase in the current year-to-date period versus prior
year's was partially attributable to a $40.0 million second
quarter charge for restructuring and management transition
expenses recorded in 1995.  Absent this charge, nine-month
operating earnings would have increased 15% to $255.9 million in
1996 from $222.9 million in 1995.  The gain for both periods
reflects the impact of higher sales levels and improved Marine
and Recreation segment operating margins.

Interest expense increased in the third quarter to $8.3 million
in 1996 from $8.0 million in 1995, while year-to-date interest
expense increased to $24.3 million in 1996 from $23.9 million in
1995 due to the issuance of short-term commercial paper in
September 1996.  Interest income and other items, net declined in
the quarter to $3.2 million in 1996 from $8.2 million in 1995,
reflecting lower interest income due to decreased cash balances
and an unfavorable swing in the accounting recognition of foreign
currency transactions between periods.  In the nine-month period,
Interest income and other items, net increased to $15.2 million
in 1996, from $14.7 million in 1995, on stronger 1996 earnings
from the Company's marine and bowling joint ventures.  These
gains were partially offset by an unfavorable swing in the
accounting recognition of foreign currency transactions between
periods and lower interest income.

The estimated effective tax rate for the full year 1996 was 36.5%
at September 1996 versus 36.0% at September 1995.  In the third
quarter of 1996, the estimated effective tax rate for 1996 was
reduced from 37.5%, reflecting the reinstatement of the research
and development tax credit by the Congress.

Marine Segment

In the third quarter, sales of the Company's Marine segment
increased to $566.1 million in 1996, representing a 9%
improvement over 1995 levels.  In the nine-month periods, sales
of the Marine segment were 5% ahead of 1995 levels, increasing to
$1,751.5 million in 1996 from $1,671.4 million.  The Company
recorded sales gains in both periods in this segment despite the
marine industry overall having a flat year.  These gains occurred
in the Sea Ray and US Marine Divisions' large boat operations, as
a result of enhanced marketing efforts, new product
introductions, recent acquisitions and a more favorable product
mix.  The Mercury Marine Division reported sales slightly above
prior-year levels in the quarter and below prior-year levels in
the year-to-date period.  Sales gains in stern drive engines,
which are primarily used on larger boats, were offset by a
reduction in sales of outboard engines, reflecting a slowdown in
sales of smaller boats where outboards are used, and retail
inventory reductions by dealers.
                          
Marine segment operating earnings increased 19% in the 1996 third
quarter to $65.0 million versus $54.7 million in 1995.  In the
nine-month period, Marine segment operating earnings increased
12% to $228.3 million in 1996 from 1995 levels.  This performance
reflects improved sales of the Sea Ray and US Marine Divisions
discussed above, along with the favorable shift in sales mix to
larger boats.  The Mercury Marine Division posted an improvement
in operating earnings in the third quarter, primarily due to a
more favorable sales mix and improved pricing and cost
management.

<P>


   KEY WEST, Fla. (Nov 9, 1995 - 20:30 EST) -- Marine authorities began investigations Thursday into two accidents at the Key West World Championship that left one offshore power boat racer dead and three others hospitalized.<P>

   Wind and sea conditions at the time of the Wednesday accidents were well within racing parameters, officials of Super Boat Racing, which runs the event, said Thursday.<P>

   The event's final heat will go on as scheduled Sunday, said SBR president John Carbonell.<P>

   "Unfortunately this sport is very dangerous," Carbonell said. "As a former racer, I know your life is on the blade of the sword at all times out there and anything can happen. Maybe that's why a lot these guys want to race."<P>

   Two racers remained hospitalized in critical condition and another in stable condition Thursday.<P>

   Carlos Gonzalez, 35, of Miami, navigator of Mr. K/Frank's Marine, was airlifted to Miami's Cedars Medical Center after his 33-foot boat slammed into a wave and broke apart about 3 1/2 miles southwest of Key West.<P>

   The boat's throttle man, Jose Fereira, 41, of Miami, was pronounced dead on the scene. Funeral services for Fereira are scheduled for Friday.<P>

   The boat's driver, Rolando Garcia of Hialeah, was in stable condition at Lower Florida Keys Health System hospital.<P>

   James Finkl, 32, of Chicago, was in critical condition with head, neck and shoulder injuries. He was injured in a separate collision of two boats and was airlifted to Cedars.<P>

<H3>Man killed in accident with Gloria Estefan's boat</H3>

<P>
MIAMI BEACH, Florida (CNN) -- Singer Gloria Estefan and her 
producer-husband, Emilio, are not to blame for a deadly 
boating accident, police said.</P>

<P>
A man was killed and a woman injured Sunday when the personal 
watercraft they were riding collided with the Estefan's 
pleasure boat off Miami Beach.  Both accident victims were 
students at Howard University in Washington, D.C.</P>

<P>
According to police, Howard Clark, 29, may have been jumping 
boat wakes and came too close to the Estefan's 33-foot 
vessel, which was traveling less than 20 mph.  Clark was sent 
airborne by the wake and was thrown into the boat's 
propeller, police said.  Clark's passenger, Tisha Greene, 22, 
is in stable condition with head bruises.</P>

<P>
In 1990, Gloria Estefan broke her back in a bus accident and 
needed nearly a year to recover.</P>

Fatal incident risk factors in recreational boating in Ohio.

FATAL INCIDENT RISK FACTORS IN RECREATIONAL BOATING IN OHIO

<p>Synopsis

<p>To identify risk factors predicting the involvement of boat operators in
incidents resulting in at least one fatality, the authors obtained data from
a mail survey of registered boat owners in the State of Ohio and from the
Boating Accident Report (BAR) files for 1983-86 compiled by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, they reviewed Ohio death
certificates for those years to identify cases missed by the BAR system.
Forty percent of the fatal incidents would have been missed by a search of
death certificates alone.

<p>During the period studied, 107 boating incidents resulted in 124 deaths.
There were 0.9 fatal incidents per million boat-operator hours. Factors
found to be associated with an increased risk of a fatal boating incident
were the operator being younger than 30 years, having fewer than 20 hours of
boat operating experience, and lacking formal boat safety training. Canoes,
kayaks, rowboats, and inflatables were associated with a higher rate of
fatal incidents per million hours of use than were motorboats. Young age and
lack of experience were associated independently with increased risk,
explaining some of the effects associated with types of boats and with lack
of training.

<p>The findings suggest that supervised experience, safety training programs
aimed at young operators, and interventions specific to certain types of
boats are likely to reduce boating fatalities.

<p>RECREATIONAL BOATING INCIDENTS account for more than 1,000 deaths and $20
million in damage to boats each year in the United States, according to the
U.S. Coast Guard (1). Injuries related to water transport, most of which
occur during recreational boating, are among the top 10 causes of years of
life lost from unintentional injury (2).

<p>Risk factors associated with fatal injuries incurred during recreational
boating use have not been well characterized. Estimates of the numbers of
boats, numbers of <U><strong>boaters,</strong></U> and hours of use of boats are needed to study the
occurrence of recreational boating injury. Ohio is one of seven States (with
Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island)
requiring <U><strong>registration </strong></U>of all recreational watercraft, including canoes,
kayaks, sailboats, most rubber or vinyl rafts, and motorboats (3), providing
a means to obtain data on a random sample of boats and <U><em><strong><A NAME="BestHit">boaters </A></strong></em></U>in Ohio.
<U><strong>Registration </strong></U>data were obtained, together with data collected by the State
of Ohio, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Watercraft, on
incidents leading to fatal boating injuries. The data were combined for the
purpose of describing the risks of reported fatal boating incidents in
relation to characteristics of the operators and the types of boats
involved. The results were used to estimate the possible effects of various
injury-prevention interventions on the number of fatal incidents.

<p>Methods

<p>In Ohio, a new boat must be registered within 30 days of purchase, and
<U><strong>registrations </strong></U>must be renewed every 3 years. Each boat is given a unique
<U><strong>registration </strong></U>number, and a current <U><strong>registration </strong></U>must be displayed at all
times. Failure to register a boat is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of
up to $100. Compliance with the <U><strong>registration </strong></U>procedure is high, as evidenced
by the fact that no boating incidents investigated by the Division of
Watercraft involved unregistered boats.

<p>A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 1,200 boat owners
registered in Ohio in 1986 (0.3 percent of the total number). The survey was
limited to one mailing because the questionnaire, which asked about reported
as well as unreported boating incidents, was anonymous. Owners were asked
about the number and types of boats they owned; about the age, experience,
and training of the person who usually operated the boat (the primary boat
operator, not necessarily the owner); and about features of the boats they
owned, such as type, length, means of propulsion, and horsepower.
Respondents were asked to estimate the amount of time the primary operator
had spent boating during the past year. Data from the survey were
extrapolated to estimate the size and characteristics of the population of
boat operators in Ohio during the study period.

<p>Data on boating incidents were obtained from Boating Accident Reports (BAR)
compiled by the Division of Watercraft. By Ohio law, boating incidents are
reportable to State officials if there is associated loss of life, personal
injury requiring medical treatment beyond first aid, damage to the vessel or
other property exceeding $200, or loss of the vessel. All vessels registered
in the State are subject to the reporting requirement.

<p>In the BAR system, incidents are considered to be related to recreational
boating if the boat was being used for noncommercial transportation at the
time of the incident. Examples of such use include water skiing, fishing
(moored and drifting), and river float trips. Incidents are not included if
the boat was being used as a fixed platform for other activities, such as
swimming. The BAR system contains information about the boat operator at the
time of the incident, the boat, and the circumstances surrounding the
incident. The investigating officer, usually a Division of Watercraft
investigator, records a judgment about factors contributing to the incident;
one option is alcohol use. Objective measures of alcohol use, such as blood
alcohol levels or breath testing, usually are not obtained. The officer's
judgment about alcohol use is based mainly on observation of the <U><strong>boater'</strong></U>s
behavior, the presence of open alcohol containers, or other, indirect
evidence.

<p>Questions in the mail survey about boat operating experience and training
were modeled directly on corresponding questions in the BAR form. Experience
was categorized on the BAR form as fewer than 20 hours, 20 to 100 hours, 101
to 500 hours, and more than 500 hours. Training was categorized in a
check-box format as none, U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadron,
American Red Cross, State, or other.

<p>We analyzed data on all reported recreational boating incidents resulting in
death and occurring in Ohio waters in the 4-year period January 1, 1983,
through December 31, 1986. To estimate the completeness of the BAR data, we
reviewed Ohio vital statistics records. Death certificates with
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) (4) external cause of
injury codes (E-codes) denoting deaths related to water transport, which
includes recreational boating, were matched to BAR incidents for the period
1983-86 to detect deaths reported on death certificates but not to BAR. To
find drownings resulting from boating incidents, but not classified as
boating-related deaths by E-code, and not included in the BAR system, we
reviewed death certificates for drownings (ICD-9-CM code E910) occurring
during the study period.

<p>Using the estimated numbers of boats and boat operators during the study
period, we calculated the numbers of hours of boat operation by types of
boat and by characteristics of operators and calculated the ratios of the
number of fatal incidents per million operator hours (MOH). The numerator
for each ratio was the number of fatal incidents, with each fatal incident
counted but once, regardless of the number of fatalities in an incident.
Characteristics of the boat operator, not of the deceased, at the time of
the fatal incident, were tabulated. The estimates were stratified by
self-reported operator age, operator experience, operator training, and type
of boat.

<p>To assess relationships among those variables, data from the BAR and the
survey were analyzed as case-control data using a multi-variate logistic
regression model. Cases were an operator of a boat at the time of a fatal
incident; controls were a primary operator identified in the survey who had
not been involved in an incident during the previous 4 years. We calculated
adjusted odds ratios for each variable and used the odds ratios, as well as
the prevalence of risk factors, to make calculations of the percent and
number of fatal incidents associated with each variable (5).

<p>Results

<p>Boating population at risk.  Of the 1,200 questionnaires sent, 922 were
returned (76.8 percent). Of the 922 questionnaires returned, 759 were
complete and appropriate for analysis. The distribution of the types of boat
reported as owned by survey respondents was similar to that for all
registered boats. Ownership of a canoe was reported by 11.9 percent of
survey respondents and canoes were 12.1 percent of all boats registered.
Ownership of a sailboat or motorboat was reported by 74.3 percent of survey
respondents and those types were 72.5 percent of all boats registered.
Ownership of a rowboat was reported by 10.9 percent of survey respondents
and 6.2 percent of registered boats were rowboats. Other types were reported
by 2.9 percent of survey respondents and were 4.2 percent of other types
registered.

<p>The 759 respondents owned a total of 1,124 boats, a mean of 1.48 boats per
responding owner. There was an average of 346,673 boats registered during
the study period. Thus, we estimated there were approximately 234,239 boat
owners in Ohio at any time during the study period. Boat operators who
reported use of their boats averaged 117.7 hours of use per year (a range of
1 to more than 1,000 hours).

<p>Mortality.  There were 127 non-duplicated recreational boating deaths
reported in either the BAR files or on death certificates during the study
period. Of these, 124 were reported (98 percent) in 107 fatal incidents
recorded in the BAR system, whereas only 76 were reported (60 percent) on
death certificates as being associated with water transport.

<p>Of the three deaths detected on death certificates that were not recorded as
deaths in the BAR system, one was recorded on a BAR as a nonfatal injury,
and two involved falls overboard. There were 51 deaths found on the BARs but
not coded on death certificates as related to boating. Thirty nine were
coded as drowning (76 percent), and one each was coded on death certificates
as trauma, hypothermia, and &quot;cause unknown.&quot; There were no Ohio death
certificates for 9 of the 51 BARS; in 6 cases the body was not recovered, 2
bodies drifted into other States and were recorded elsewhere, and 1 <U><strong>boater
</strong></U>was a resident of and died in another State. No additional recreational
boating fatalities were found in a review of Ohio death certificates for all
571 persons who were recorded as drowning during the study period.

<p>Ninety-nine of the 124 deaths (80 percent) reported on BARs were classified
as drownings. The cause of death given for the other 25 deaths included
disappearance, burns, smoke inhalation, electrocution, or &quot;other.&quot; Fatal
incidents occurred most often between noon and 8 p.m. (55 percent of
incidents), on weekends (50 percent on a Saturday or Sunday), and during the
summer (47 percent in June or July). Thirty-seven of the fatal incidents (36
percent) occurred on Lake Erie, 23 on another large lake or reservoir (22
percent), and 21 on a river (20 percent).

<p>Alcohol use was listed as a contributing cause in eight of the incidents (7
percent). Review of the written BAR reports showed that alcohol was
mentioned in a total of 22 of the incidents (21 percent), but most often the
box on the form was not checked.

<p>All types of boats, except motorized sailboats and houseboats, were involved
in fatal incidents. Open motorboats most frequently were involved in fatal
incidents (51 percent), followed by canoes (18 percent), rowboats (13
percent), cabin motorboats (11 percent), and other categories. The
distribution of horsepower of motorboats involved in fatal incidents was
similar to that for all motorboats registered in Ohio. Fatal incidents
occurred primarily while cruising (36 percent), drifting (17 percent), and
fishing (15 percent). Capsizing was a factor in 41 percent of the incidents
and falling overboard was a factor in 28 percent of the incidents. Speeding,
as assessed by the investigating officer, was identified as a cause of only
five (5 percent) of the fatal incidents. Water-skiing resulted in only one
fatal incident.

<p>Risk estimates.  The ratio of fatal incidents to operator-hours ranged from
0.34 fatal incidents per million operator-hours (Fl per MOH) in the age
group 70 years and older to 8.1 FI per MOH in the age group 10 to 19 years
(table 1). The ratio for the highest risk age group was 23.6 times as large
as that for the lowest risk age group. Similarly, operators with fewer than
20 hours of experience were involved in fatal incidents at a rate 132 times
greater than operators with more than 500 hours of experience (table 2).

<p>Differences in ratios by operator training were less striking. Untrained
operators were 2.0 times more likely per operator-hour to be the operator in
fatal incidents as trained operators. Motorboats were involved in the
largest number of fatal incidents, but the ratio of the number of fatal
incidents to the number of hours of motorboat operation was only a third to
half of the ratio for non-powered boats (figure 1).

<p>To determine the effect of operator age on fatal incident rates by
experience, training, and boat type, we stratified cases by the age group of
the operator (figures 2-4). Because of the small number of cases, risk
groups were combined. Younger operators had higher ratios within each group,
but ratios were higher also for less experienced operators, for operators
without safety training, and for operators of small, non-powered boats,
regardless of age. For operators ages 50 years and older, however, training
and boat type had little effect on the ratio.

<p>Multivariate analysis from the case-control study gave relative risk
estimates similar to those from the analyses of risk per million
operator-hours (table 3). Operator age and experience were independently
associated with risk of being the operator in a fatal incident. Training
(entered as none versus some) and boat type (entered as powered versus
non-powered) were not associated significantly with risk of being the
operator in a fatal incident when age and experience were controlled for,
although the point estimates of risk were elevated.

<p>Potential Impact of Preventive Measures

<p>Attributable number estimates are shown in table 3. We found that reducing
the risk of operators younger than 30 years to the level of risk of
operators aged 30 years or older could potentially have prevented 34 of the
107 fatal incidents. Similarly, reduction of risk among inexperienced
operators to that of experienced operators potentially could have prevented
23 of the 107 fatal incidents. Risk reduction among untrained operators and
operators of a canoe, kayak, or rowboat potentially could have prevented 10
fatal incidents in each of the two categories. Because age, experience,
training, and boat type are all correlated, the overall impact of preventive
measures aimed at all those variables would be less than the sum of the
number of attributable incidents taken separately.

<p>Discussion

<p>The study findings demonstrate that the occurrence of boating incidents
resulting in fatal injuries, like the occurrence of motor vehicle crashes,
is related to the age, training, and experience of the operator and to
features of the vehicle. While these general relationships were expected by
analogy with other transport-related injuries, the study findings specific
to boats have not been reported previously. One of the strengths of this
study is that the risk of a fatality is related to hours of exposure,
stratified by characteristics of operators and of boats, rather than simply
to numbers of boats or operators.

<p>The principal findings of this study are that small boats, such as canoes
and rowboats, apparently have a higher fatal incident rate per hour of use
than large boats, and that operator age and experience are independent
predictors of the risk of a fatal incident. The increased risk with small
boats is in part explained by the age of the operators, which is younger
than that of operators of large boats; thus, in the multivariate analysis,
boat type was associated only weakly with risk of a fatal incident. The
increased risk associated with small boats may have to do with how they are
used, rather than with intrinsic properties of the boats themselves.
Operator training was associated in the stratified analysis with a reduced
risk of fatal incident among those ages younger than 50 years, but again the
association was weak in the multivariate analysis, suggesting that age and
experience account for much of the apparent effect of training.

<p>Our review of the BAR reports suggests that alcohol consumption may have
played a role in up to 21 percent of the incidents, while most published
reports cite alcohol as a factor in at least 35 percent of incidents (6-8).
Our lower estimate may result from the fact that alcohol played a relatively
small role in fatal incidents during that time, or because Ohio law
enforcement officers were reluctant to record alcohol use unless it could be
documented by physical evidence or witness testimony. Alcohol determinations
were not consistently performed by Ohio county coroners on decedents
eligible for this study, in part because of the unreliability of the tests
among persons whose bodies are recovered after several days in water. While
it seems plausible that alcohol use by the operator increases the risk of a
fatal incident, data on the frequency of alcohol use by operators not
involved in fatal incidents are not available for Ohio <U><strong>boaters.</strong></U>

<p>In Ohio, 98 percent of all fatal recreational boating incidents are included
in the BAR system, while up to 40 percent of fatalities resulting from such
incidents are not coded on Ohio death certificates as such. Studies of
boating fatalities should include information from BARs as well as from
death certificates.

<p>Our estimates of exposure are based on a sample survey of boat owners, who
were asked about the characteristics of the usual boat operator and the
hours of operation of the boat. While the response rate from the
questionnaire was not as high as expected, it was high for a single mailing.
The survey provided a unique opportunity to make estimates of the risk per
hour of operation, stratified by operator age, experience, and training.
Respondents showed a distribution of types of boats owned similar to that
among all boat owners, suggesting that non-responding and responding
operators may have had similar characteristics. Unfortunately, the design of
the study, in which the numerator of the rates is an actual count of number
of incidents and the denominator is an estimate of the size of the
population at risk, does not allow calculation of confidence limits around
our estimates of rate ratios.

<p>We assumed that the primary operators described in the survey responses
corresponded to the operators of the boats on BAR reports. To the extent
that operators of boats involved in fatal incidents were not the primary
operators of these boats, estimates of the ratios may be biased. The
direction of that bias most likely would be to increase the ratio estimates
for young and inexperienced operators. The size of the bias cannot be
estimated directly as the BAR reports do not distinguish between primary and
non-primary operators. A similar bias might be introduced if small,
non-powered boats were less likely to be registered than power boats. While
this is possible, observations on Ohio waters by the authors suggest that
unregistered boats very rarely are seen in use.

<p>We calculated the potential impact of reducing the risk of young or
inexperienced operators to that of older or more experienced boat operators.
For the reasons cited, the estimate of impact may be overestimated. While
such a reduction would have the greatest impact on the number of fatal
incidents, it is not clear how such a risk reduction would be accomplished.
Age and experience can be acquired only with the passage of time. Supervised
experience or training of younger operators might reduce the risk associated
with inexperience and youth, but careful evaluation of such approaches is
necessary to assess their effectiveness. Safety training programs already in
place should be reviewed to see if they are focused on the groups at highest
risk and if they actually change operator behavior and reduce risk of
injury. Experience with other classes of injury suggests that reduction of
alcohol use by boat operators through education and enforcement would lead
to a reduction in boating injuries and deaths.

<h4>"Engines That Run on Water"</h4> Business Week  August 8, 1994<p>

In 1994 a half water, half gasoline fuel starting getting some press. One of the first articles was in the August 8, 1994 issue of Business Week on page 47. The article was titled, "Engines That Run on Water." It described the 66 year old, Rudolph W. Gunnerman and his 7 years of development work on this project. He claims the mixture gets 40% better mileage from the gasoline it contains and emits significant less pollution because the engine runs cooler. In early July Caterpillar formed a joint venture with A-55 LP, Gunnerman's tiny 9 person company in Reno Nevada. The key ingredient is .5% of a secret emulsifier that enables fuel and water to mix - and stay mixed. Also a small piece of nickel must be attached to the top of the cylinder heads. The process has powered a city bus for 5 months in Reno and the Air Force put 6 vehicles through a 14 week test.<p>

Two related news clips in the February 10, 1996 Tulsa World also talk about the current status of the project. "Fuel Passes Tests, May Be Breakthrough" and "Water, Naptha Blended." The reports claim a 60 reduction in EPA monitored emissions. It says that last November, Nevada certified it as a clean alternative fuel. It says it is really a mixture of Naptha  (an earlier stage of petroleum refining) and water with a milky appearance. It also has a vapor pressure about 1/5 that of gasoline. It gives the name of the partnered firm between Gunnerman and Caterpillar as Advanced Fuels. The new fuel is being called A-21.<p>

<b><P>
  On the phone, German-born inventor Rudolf </b>Gunnerman is cordial, witty and savvy. He is the meister of the sound bite, eminently quotable and not the least bit shy about his accomplishment: He's the person, he says without reservation, who found a solution while others pointed to  problems.
<P>
     Inventors like Gunnerman believe that one of the world's most common compounds - good old tap water - can be blended with fuel to power your car, truck or lawn mower. If they're right, you could pay much less at the gas pump. But scientists caution to not believe the hype, which overstates a few, limited benefits of the new fuel.
<P>
     Gunnerman claims to have devised a means to blend water with naphtha in order to power engines in a cleaner, cheaper, more efficient way.
<P>
      "New ideas and better ideas are not necessarily found by universities or by large companies. New ideas and better ideas are found by people who look for them," says Gunnerman, 68.
<P>
     And others are making claims similar to the Reno inventor. A pair of men working out of a garage in the shadow of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport  say they mix water with fuel from the gas pump to give race-car drivers "impressive horsepower gains."
<P>
     Elsewhere, passions flare. Gunnerman's contentions have drawn the ire of scientists who say adding water to fuel is hardly a new invention. The engine types Gunnerman chooses for his demonstrations, they add, are quite forgiving of his fuel mix. More importantly, mixing water with fuel decreases - not increases - fuel efficiency, they say.
<P>
     David Kittelson, University of Minnesota director of the Center for Diesel Research sighs mightily when called. Kittelson, a  professor of mechanical engineering, calls Gunnerman's claims "absolute nonsense. They're violating the second law of thermodynamics."
<P>
     Water does not burn. Dissociating it into its hydrogen and oxygen parts to attain a burn takes as much - or more - energy than you'd receive.
<P>
     "It sort of opens up a Pandora's box - that's why I sighed when we first started talking," Kittelson added. "People in universities have an awful lot to do. We're going through periods where we're having dramatic changes in funding structures . . . because of that it's very difficult to do what we're supposed to do and that is sort of seek out the truth. Getting into this water-fuel issue involves a lot of time . . . a lot of time . . . and not much payback."
<P>
     Michael Seal, director of the Vehicle Research Institute at Bellingham's Western Washington University, agrees. Seal conducts engine research and built an award-winning hybrid vehicle that runs electrically and on natural gas. 
<P>
     Adding 10 gallons of water to 10 gallons of fuel might give only nine gallons of power, Seal said. "I could be wrong - but I'd like to know how I'm wrong. It's pretty well-known that water doesn't burn and there's no way of getting energy from it," Seal said. "Basically,  you lose in some way. The best you could hope to do is break even."
<P>
     "In a way, they are right. In another way they are totally wrong," Gunnerman countered. "They're incorrect in the point they think every fuel burns alike," he said. "I have achieved a better combustion pattern than you get with straight gas or straight diesel."
<P>

<P><B>Infusion of credibility</B><P>


     "Caterpillar" is the single word that brings a degree of credibility to Gunnerman's claims.
<P>
     The Peoria, Ill.-based heavy- equipment manufacturer entered a joint venture with Gunnerman in July 1994. Together, under the name Advanced Fuels, they've conducted experimental uses of the A-21 fuel - made up of 70 percent naphtha, a crude-oil byproduct, and 30 percent water.
<P>
     And now, Paccar Inc. is throwing its trucking weight in Gunnerman's corner.
<P>
     The Bellevue-based manufacturer of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks recently sent a truck to Peoria for testing with the A-21 fuel. Paccar changed out the engine to add a Caterpillar engine and modified the cylinders and fuel injectors to handle more fluid volume.
<P>
      They also did a series of baseline tests of noise, cooling, drivability and fuel economy, said Jim Reichman, Paccar's technology-development manager.
<P>
     Back at Paccar's Mount Vernon technical center, Reichman is enthused.  "We're pretty pleased with it," he said. "We've actually had it out and driven it and are in the process of doing some tests on it."
<P>
     Paccar's goal is to get the truck in a customer's hands to get  continuing feedback on its performance.
<P>
     Caterpillar would not allow photographs to be taken of the beige vehicle, saying the exterior looks no different than any other Peterbilt and the interior changes and specific test results are proprietary information.
<P>
     Secrecy is not uncommon on the A-21 project or on a local endeavor financed by a South King County pair, Tim Shadduck, 42, and Rick Course, 49. For a demonstration, they fetched a gallon of regular unleaded gas from the station down the street and water from the garden hose, run through a charcoal filter.
<P>
     "I've got a more exotic filtration. But for demos, this will work fine. We'll do it real backyard style here so there's no question," Shadduck said.
<P>
     Shadduck uses a clear, viscous emulsifier to suspend water within the fuel. Injecting the "magic bullet" into a container turns the water-fuel mixture milky white. Like Gunnerman, Shadduck reveals little about the biodegradable substance.
<P>
     He said Gunnerman's fuel "kind of brought down the walls of disbelief,"  but skeptics abound. "I keep waiting for that big brick wall to come up in front of me and say, `You can't do this.' "
<P>
     Shadduck eases a brown 1975 Nova, "Injection Research" etched on its side, onto the roadway. He uses a laptop computer to regulate fuel intake and punches the gas pedal to nudge the speedometer arm from 60 mph to 80 mph within seconds.
<P>
     The pair are targeting race-car drivers, who now pay $5 a gallon for racing fuel.
<P>
     Gunnerman is expanding his reach to governments that run municipal bus systems, agencies increasingly mindful of more stringent emissions standards in the coming years. For that reason, some are willing to investigate a fuel - and even pay a bit more for higher fuel usage - to meet new guidelines.
<P>

<P><B>A cooler burn</B><P>


     Engineers have known for years that adding water to fuel brings benefits. Water was used in World War II for fueling aircraft. And in the 1970s, General Motors used a water-injection system for its Corvair model, keeping the water in a separate tank, said Dave Schwartz, spokesman for the Society of Automotive Engineers.
<P>
     Water cools the fuel's flame in the combustion chamber, Schwartz said. A cooler burn reduces the chances of engine-damaging explosions, known as detonations - a fact that hasn't escaped Formula One racers.
<P>
     And the cooler burn produces less pollutants - especially Oxides of Nitrogen. Known as NOx, Oxides of Nitrogen are produced from elements in the air, in response to heat.
<P>
     "NOx is a big issue," the University of Minnesota's Kittelson said. "I think the motivation Caterpillar has is the concern about NOx emission. They're trying to get any possible technology for NOx control under their wing so they have options available to them. . . . Faced with very stringent emissions standards that might materialize in the next century, you want to have all the technology."
<P>

<P><B>Plans for expansion</B><P>
     
     The Regional Transportation Commission in Reno has been running one of its Citifare buses on the A-21 fuel. This fall, they will decide whether to switch more coaches to the mixture, said Michael Steele, Citifare manager.
<P>
     Dick Cooper, Gunnerman's spokesman, said the company is hoping to extend use of its fuel to West Coast bus fleets including markets in California, Oregon and Seattle. They're estimating fuel costs of 60 to 65 cents per gallon for the naphtha blend, not including local, state and federal taxes.
<P>
     The Reno coach, equipped with the Detroit Diesel 277-horsepower engine, posted reduced emissions while using the A-21 fuel. Oxides of nitrogen and unburned hydrocarbons, two emissions that are precursors to smog, were below results with diesel fuel. And particulates, a carcinogen, were also reduced. Fuel use increased.
<P>
     "We did lose some performance; our miles per gallon dropped," Steele said. "The cost could be comparable, or increased, but it's an emission benefit."
<P>
     But Seal was less giddy. Dramatic improvements are not difficult because federal regulations for diesel engines are lax.
<P>
     "It's a very easy test to pass, which is why you see diesel trucks belching black smoke on the highway and they're legal," he said. The A-21 test results are "not that exciting."
<P>
     Using natural gas gives even lower emissions, with negligible readings of unburned hydrocarbons, Seal said.
<P>
     But burning natural gas brings a new set of distribution headaches.
<P>
     Paccar has looked at alternate fuels since 1991. Compressed natural gas is slow to fill up and the tanks are heavy. Liquefied natural gas is very cold, about minus 260 degrees, and you've got to go to Canada or Portland to get it.
<P>
     A-21 "certainly represents a non-diesel energy system that is a lot simpler," Reichman said.

Not exactly &quot;renewable&quot;, but of some interest to
alternative-fuels types:

--------------------------------------------------
 Rudolph W. <B>Gunnerman</B> lives here in town (Reno, Nevada).
 I met him about 5 years ago at a conference on air quality.
 Since then I have followed the issue in the local press, thru
 contacts at local air quality agencies, and friends in Nevada
 Division of Mines.

 Best I can figure is he is using the water to generate steam,
 another working fluid. Engine and exhaust temperatures are low.
 Fuel economy improves about 20-25%. The trick is the emulsifier.

 He's used his techniques with gasoline, diesel, and naptha.
 He has been in partnership with Caterpillar since 1994.
 Blending plants in Reno and the Sacramento Valley, 35,000
 gallons/day, are in progress. He is targeting large users:
 fleets and such.

 I have not financial relationship with the company.

 Here is a recent article:
-------
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Mar 16, 1996 12:27  p.m. EST) -- A new
petroleum-based fuel that promises to cut vehicle smog by nearly half has
won federal approval to be become the first &quot;primary fuel&quot; on the market
since the invention of gasoline and diesel more than a century ago.

   The Reno inventor of the creamy white fluid says it can be used in
existing cars with minor modifications costing less than $500, and may sell
for less than half the price of conventional fuel.

   &quot;It's cheaper and cleaner,&quot; said Rudolf <B>Gunnerman</B>, who has invested
seven years and $7 million of his personal fortune to develop the &quot;A-21&quot;
formula, or &quot;advanced fuel for the 21st century.&quot;

   The fuel, up to 55 percent water, also has been shown to be much more
fire-resistant than gasoline and diesel.

   Sacramento area air pollution officials have taken a strong interest in
the fuel because of its potential for reducing oxides of nitrogen emissions
from vehicles, the chief culprit in the region's summer smog problem.

   &quot;It's not a commercial technology yet, but we have high hopes that it
will succeed and get on the market,&quot; said Ranson Roser, an engineer with
the Sacramento Air Quality Management District.

   The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday declared the &quot;A-21&quot; formula a
&quot;primary fuel,&quot; clearing the biggest regulatory hurdle for its use in
government fleets and eventually private vehicles.

   The action means the fuel can now be sold just like gasoline and diesel
without further federal review, energy department officials said.

   &quot;We're extremely excited,&quot; said Peter <B>Gunnerman</B>, director of Advanced
Fuels, a partnership with the Peoria, Ill.-based truck manufacturer
Caterpillar Inc.

   Representatives of the oil industry and environmentalists remain
   skeptical.

   &quot;A number of options have come and gone in the past two decades, said
Jason Mark, a transportation analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists
in Berkeley. &quot;We've learned that there's no such thing as a silver bullet.&quot;

   Peter <B>Gunnerman</B>, the inventor's son, said the fuel must satisfactorily
complete several more rounds of customer-acceptance tests and pass
California's environmentally stringent fuel certifications.

   Under federal rules, engines modified to use the fuel are legal as long
as they don't increase emissions.

   Those modifications will cost consumers no more than $500, Peter
<B>Gunnerman</B> said. Diesel bus and truck modification would cost about $1,000.
Modified vehicles could still run on gasoline or diesel, he said.

   The company first wants to market the fuel as an alternative to diesel
for the heavy-duty trucks and construction equipment in smoggy areas.

   Fleet operators at the state and large companies are highly motivated to
find a fuel like A-21, says Kurt Ettinger of the Department of Energy's
Alternative Fuels Hotline.

   &quot;It's probably close to half again cleaner than regular gasoline, at
least,&quot; says Ed Glick, a planner in charge of the mobile sources section of
the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, which has studied A-21.
&quot;It'll meet the 2005 standards -- the gasoline that we're all using now
wouldn't.&quot;

<BR>
   While large trucks would be more expensive to modify to use A-21, that
cost is not nearly so expensive as the modifications that will be required
when new regulations on diesel fleets go into effect in 1998.

   Moreover, the fuel is produced at oil refineries and can be transported
in existing pipelines and trucks, giving it what is referred to in the oil
industry as &quot;transparency.&quot;

   Now the developers must market the technology to the oil giants. Right
now,  the company's blending facility outside Reno is making 35,000 gallons
of A-21 daily, with the capacity to produce three times that much. A second
blending station opened recently in Woodland.

   Don Patterson, a truck engine account manager with Tenco, the
Caterpillar dealership for 10 counties surrounding Sacramento, has used
A-21 to fuel a three-axle, 300 horsepower tractor truck, and he's
impressed.

   &quot;It felt exactly like diesel, good acceleration, no smoke,&quot; he says.
&quot;You could not tell you were driving an alternative fuel truck. The other
alternative fuels, compressed natural gas, liquid natural gas, you do get a
horsepower and torque loss. Not with this. I've been a journeyman mechanic
for 25 years, and I've never seen anything like it.&quot;

   At the <B>Gunnerman</B>'s modest operation in downtown Reno, a sample of the
fuel is mixed in a bucket and then run through both a V-8 automobile engine
and a 350 horsepower diesel engine, with a marked reduction in smoke from
the tailpipes, but no apparent reduction in power.

   With blowtorch in hand, <B>Gunnerman</B> demonstrates another one of A-21's
remarkable properties: because of its low volatility, a tray full of the
fuel fails to ignite under the flame. Thus, the fuel will not explode in
automobile crashes.

   A-21 has also been successfully used in boilers, specifically by the
city of Reno, which receives 250 kilowatts of electricity a day from an
A-21-fueled generator stationed on the <B>Gunnerman</B>'s property.

<h3>Computer Power Allows Ford
To Bridge International Gulfs</h3>

<pre>Wall Street Journal
Special Technology Section
Pages R14 and R17
November 18, 1996</pre>


<p>By OSCAR SURIS</b>
<p>DEARBORN, Mich. -- Guiseppe Delena, a 43-year-old vehicle-design chief
working at a Ford
Motor Co. studio in Turin, Italy, is about to do in seconds what
used to take him hours -- and sometimes days -- to do. He is going to share an idea with his staff in the U.S.

<p>"Do you see this part here?" asks a small, grainy image of the bearded
Mr. Delena flickering on a computer monitor here. "We should probably
change it. It would allow us to change the edge of this door." Mr. Delena's
scribbles on a graphic of a vehicle appear as bright red marks on the
computer's 21-inch screen.</p>

<p>"That would make all the difference, actually," says Gary Morales, a
36-year-old design manager in Dearborn who is watching Mr. Delena's
trans-Atlantic brainstorm unfold. Another member of Mr. Delena's staff
offers his thoughts by touching Mr. Morales's monitor with a stylus, his
suggestions showing up on the screen as lime-green streaks.</p>

<p>This impromptu, 100%-interactive staff meeting between Ford designers in
Europe and the U.S. would never have happened without the help of two
$250,000-plus workstation computers -- one in Italy, another here.</p>

<p>The computers are all part of Ford's drive to bridge geographical gulfs
with tools more powerful than electronic mail. Ford is assembling a
collection of computing networks through which it hopes to conduct most of
its international product-development efforts without the help of travel
agents. The goal is to cut vehicle-development time and costs.</p>

<p>There is a broader purpose. Having cut more than 3,000 workers from its
product-development ranks, and looking to trim 6,000 more jobs by the end
of next year, the No. 2 auto maker is counting on these networks to help it
accomplish more with fewer workers.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>No More Planes</b></p>
<p>"We need to get our people off of airplanes -- it's as simple as that,"
says Paul Blumberg, director of product-development systems for Ford's
U.S.-based automotive operations. "If we are going to be global, we are
going to need this."</p>

<p>"This," as Mr. Blumberg puts it, is a multibillion-dollar corporate
infrastructure that includes hundreds of high-powered computers, including
the two Silicon
Graphics Inc. workstations used by Mr. Delena and his staff. More
are on the car maker's shopping list.</p>

<p>Additionally, Ford's computing setup includes a companywide intranet, or
private network that lets the company distribute information internally; a
reserve of supercomputers that rivals some of the nation's most influential
research labs; dozens of optical-fiber networks; and software that should
allow Ford employees to conduct the kind of virtual engineering and design
that is needed to shave months from the typical vehicle-development
cycle.</p>

<p>Ford's rivals at General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler
Corp. have also been investing heavily in this kind of equipment. But none
of the Big Three has devoted so much attention to the question of achieving
international synergies as Ford, where the electron-powered exchanges of
information across continents and oceans have been made a top priority.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>Global Mind-Set</b></p>

<p>Structurally, the car maker moved in this direction two years ago when
it began its "Ford 2000" reorganization, a cost-focused effort that imposed
a global mind-set on the company's product-development activities. No
longer would Ford engineers in Europe or anywhere else have a parochial
mandate; they would be expected to work with their peers in the U.S. and
elsewhere to develop products that could be sold anywhere. Before the
restructuring, the international units were mainly concerned with doing
business in their respective countries.</p>

<p>A precursor of the new philosophy was Ford's 1993 Mondeo sedan. The
result of a much-maligned $6 billion effort, the European-made car
nonetheless became the basis a year later for Ford's Contour and Mercury
Mystique sedans in the U.S., and should spawn more offshoots for sale
outside Europe by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>To pull off more Mondeos, Ford is fostering more of the international
communication that is allowing designers like Mr. Delena to expedite and
refine product-development decisions on computer screens before they are
realized in clay, fiberglass or steel.</p>

<p>The time savings are a major plus. Ford designers can already transmit
sophisticated, three-dimensional computer images of vehicle prototypes to
the auto maker's studios in Turin, where computers read their designs with
exacting precision. Top Ford executives on both continents, after studying
these computer-animated previews, give the go-ahead to devise clay models,
or full-size versions. The designers' work, now translated into numerical
data, is then fed into a machine that etches the computer sketches into
clay. Because engineers want to see what a car actually looks like before
work begins on an assembly line, clay models remain an essential stage in
vehicle development.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>No More Redundancy</b></p>

<p><b>Ford also hopes powerful information channels will eliminate redundancy
within its product-development culture. Because of the sharing of
information, a steering wheel designed by the company's engineers in
Dunton, England, won't have to be designed again in Dearborn. A fix
concocted in the U.S. for a defective brake part would be accessible to any
Ford engineer with a laptop, a phone line and a password. Already, Ford has
purchased more than 5,000 copies of Netscape Communications
Corp.'s Web-browser software so its employees can prowl around the
company's intranet.</b></p>

<p><b>"We haven't done too well with maintaining our corporate memory," says
Mr. Blumberg. Whether Ford employees work in Merkenich, Germany, or
Hiroshima, Japan (home of Ford's Japanese partner, Mazda Motor Corp.), they
can access intranet sites that detail blueprints of rival vehicles,
engineering methods for problems such as door closures, corporate-approved
design styles and specs for hundreds of thousands of parts.</b></p>

<p<b>>Given the millions of dollars that go into the making of any vehicle,
the potential productivity gains from this new equipment are
considerable.</b></p>

<p>Emil Sims, a 25-year-old suspension engineer, is developing an all-new
light truck from his desktop in Dearborn, the center of Ford's light-truck
efforts. But because his vehicle is also a front-wheel-drive model, Mr.
Sims often uses his workstation to work with colleagues in Europe, the home
of Ford's vehicle-development center for front-wheel-drive small cars.</p>
<p>"I've been designing with European parts, and I've only been on one trip
to Europe," Mr. Sims says.</p>

<p class="subhed"><b>Pothole Specs</b></p>

<p>From his desktop, Mr. Sims can confer with his German colleagues about
topics as arcane as the spatial relationships between suspension and brake
parts. They can tinker with designs and see their results instantaneously
in full-color, animated form. A separate piece of software takes linear
drawings of Mr. Sims's work and converts them to three-dimensional form,
allowing him to see what a suspension system bouncing and springing on the
screen looks like. The vehicle is even rolling over Ford's official
depiction of a typical U.S. pothole.</p>

<p>"Here's the name of the person who actually calculated it," says Mr.
Sims as he looks up the specs of Ford's U.S. pothole on one of the auto
maker's many intranet sites.</p>

<p>Used in designing these linear drawings are some of the world's most
powerful computers -- air- and water-cooled machines by Cray Research Inc.
that can compute the calculations Ford needs to conduct on-screen vehicle
crashes, wind-tunnel simulations, durability testing and fuel-economy
forecasting.</p>

<p>Cheaper computer power has helped reduce the cost of these expensive
simulations. Ford executives estimate that in 1984, a crash simulation cost
$60,000 to perform on a Cray supercomputer. Today, the cost of a
Cray-calculated crash test is about $1,000. Ford estimates crash-simulation
costs will drop to $10 by 2001 as the company doubles its computer power
each year.</p>

<p>Still, the Ford Taurus sedans that populate America's highways today
aren't the direct result of such wizardry. Despite a penchant for high-tech
spending at Ford that dates back several years, the company, typical of an
industry that is slow to change, is just now starting to use its best
hardware and software in vehicle programs. In fact, this year, only three
vehicles in development at Ford were making full use of the auto maker's
computer-aided engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities. All
vehicle-development programs are expected to do so starting next year.</p>

<p>That means the American public won't see the first fruits of Ford's
trans-Atlantic, high-tech efforts until the year 2000. That is when Ford's
next Escort small car should be hitting the road, a vehicle currently being
developed at the auto maker's small-car product-development center in
Europe.</p>

Steven Lough won a $1.5 million judgment when the boat and motor builder began using an engine part similar to the one he had invented.<p>

In 1988 as Steven Lough of Sarasota stood in his garage at his grandfather's 1936 Craftsman metal lathe, he had no idea the seal he had just designed would land him in a court battle with Mercury Marine, one of the nations's largest boat and motor builders.<p>

He definitely didn't know it would bring him a $1.5 million judgment, either.<p>

Lough just wanted to fix a chronic problem with his boat: Water kept leaking into the drive mechanism that turns the propeller.<p>

"I just decided I was going to fix that thing in my boat," Lough said. "By golly, I put a piece of brass in there, whittled out a brass bushing that held seals to keep the water out of the shifting component of the drive, and I made myself one and put it in my boat."<p>

The seal sealed.<p>

What followed was a multi-year cruise across rough seas that had ended - for the moment - with a federal jury in Tampa deciding that Mercury and its parent company, the Brunswick Corp. improperly used Lough's deal design.<p>

A jury awarded him $1.5 million after a three-week trial in January, said Ward Dahlgren, one of Lough's attorneys with the Sarasota firm, Dickson, Gibbons. The judgement was not entered until August 18th.<p>

Attempts to contact Mercury's attorneys or a company representative were unsuccessful, Dahlgren said Mercury has indicated it will appeal the verdict. Lough's rough voyage began in the late 1980's when he took a job in a Sarasota marine. He planned to stay two months but lasted two years. Lough, now 42, has lived in Sarasota since 1954 and has spent his life working with aluminum and ding carpentry and boat repair.<p>

He took the marina job to learn how to fix the drive on his 1967 Hurricane boat, which has a 250-horsepower, 6-cylinder Chevrolet engine, with a Mercruiser sterndrive. The problem was that water kept seeping into the drive's shifting component and the universal joints.<p>

He became proficient at working on the drive and eventually figured out a way to keep water out.<p>

After building a seal for himself he built another for a friend. He asked around at other marinas, found out the leaking was a common problem with the drive units, and built a few more seals for friends.<p>

Lough got a patent for his design on July 18, 1989, and had Sun Precision , a Sarasota metal works company, make him a few thousand at $6 each. He began selling them in January 1989 to boat yards around the state for $25 each.<p>

lough said a representative from Mercury at the firm's test plant in Placida called in the spring of 1991, asking about the seal. Lough said he jumped on his motorcycle and delivered a handful.<p>

In April 1991, he said , a Mercury executive called and wanted to buy the patent. The representative offered $50,000, Lough said, but he realized he had something valuable. He wanted $750,000 for the patent and rights.<p>

The executive refused, Lough said, telling him "If I didn't take the $50,000 for the patent they would go ahead and make the seal anyway and we would end up in a big court battle."<p>

In September 1991, Lough took a call from a Sarasota marine operator.<p>

"He said what kink of a lucky guy I was," Lough said, "He said, 'You ought to be rich by now, because the new Mercury boat coming in has your seal in it.' "<p>

Lough examined the Mercury seal, believed it mirrored his design with a few insignificant modifications, and went straight to his attorney's office.<p>

In December 1991, Mercury began mass producing the seals, selling them for about $8. Six months later, Lough said he was out of the seal business.<p>

He filed suit in federal court in Tampa in 1992.<p>

In January, Lough won the first round of the case in federal court.<p>

"I won everything I could win, except they didn't give me triple damages," he said. "They awarded me $1.5 and I still own the patent."<p>

The jury found that Mercury's seal was not a "willful infringement" of the patent, meaning Mercury "didn't do it recklessly or intentionally," Garland said.<p>

Lough said the jury awarded hi $15 per seal for each of the 120,000 seals Mercury sold. The company produced 130,000 seals, he said.<p>

Dahlgren, whose firm will receive 33% of any judgement, said that the interest and costs will be added to the judgment if Mercury appeals to a federal patent appeals court in Washington, D.C.<p>

Lough is obviously pleased by the verdict, but still cannot understand why Mercury was so obstinate in the beginning.<p>

"They could have had the whole package for $750,000," Lough said. "I don't know how much they paid for attorney fees, or how much I'll end up with when the total comes. I don't understand why they keep this thing going."<p>

Brunswick appealed on the court denying their Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and its Motion for a New Trial after the jury verdict of infringement of U.S. Patent <a href="4848775.htm">#4,848,775</A> June 12, 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled on the appeal. The ruling said, "Because the court erred in denying Brunswick's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, we reverse in part and vacate in part." The full text of the ruling is available at our <a href="../../ftp/ftp.htm">FTP Site</A> in Microsoft Word format and in Word Perfect format. You can FTP one of them, print it out, and read the 36 page document. Microsoft Word is the original format and looks best. The Word Perfect version is not able to maintain the proper page break locations, but the document is all there.<p>

It is a very interesting case that will have significant impact upon future individual inventors. It describes Lough making six prototypes in the Spring of 1986 for his own boat and 3 months later giving one to  a friend who installed it on his boat. He gave the other prototypes to longtime friends who were employees at another marina in Sarasota. He did not charge anyone for these prototypes. For over a year following the installation of these prototypes, he neither asked for nor received any comments about the operability of the prototypes. During the same time he did not attempt to sell any seal assemblies.<p>

On June 6, 1988 He filed the patent application, "Liquid Seal for Marine Stern Drive Gear Shift Shafts" which issued July 18, 1989.<p>

When Lough sued Brunswick on June 12, 1993 alleging infringement on the patent, Brunswick counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of patent noninfringement, invalidity, and/or unenforceability. The Jury found that Brunswick failed to prove that Lough's invention was in public use before the critical date of June 6, 1987 (your invention cannot be in public use before one year prior to obtaining a patent. If so, the patent is invalid.)  The jury also found that Brunswick infringed on claims 1-4 of the patent both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents. Based on the infringement finding the jury awarded Lough $1.5 million in lost profits. After the trial, Brunswick filed a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law in which it argued  that the claimed invention was invalid because it had been in public use before the critical date. Brunswick also filed a Motion for a New Trial on damages. The court denied Brunswick's motions without any comment. Brunswick appealed.<p>

Brunswick argued that the 6 early prototypes were not experimental. Lough did not control their use, failed to keep records of the alleged experiments, and did not place the parties involved under any obligations of secrecy. Lough countered that the six prototypes were necessary experiments, that he received no compensation for them, and that he did not place the seal assemblies on sale until after he filed his patent application. The prototypes were given only to his friends and personal acquaintances who used them in such a manner that they were unlikely to be seen by the public. He also argues that to verify the operability of the seal, they had to be installed by mechanics of different levels of skills in boats exposed to different conditions.<p>

The trial centered on the issue of the six prototypes, were they experimental or public use? After providing the 5 prototypes to third parties, Lough neither asked for, nor received any comments concerning the operability of the prototypes. The court found Lough's use of the invention was not "experimental" which would negate a conclusion of public use. He received no compensation for them, at lest one boat was later sold to strangers and lost track of, he kept no records. The Court found, "We conclude the jury's determination that Lough's use of the invention was experimental so as to defeat the assertion of public use was incorrect as a matter of law. The court thus erred in denying Brunswick's JMOL motion on the validity of claims1-4 ..." Finding the patent invalid eliminated the need to consider any of the other matters before the court. The full report includes a rather lengthy dissention opinion from one judge.<p>

<title>Volvo vs. Mercruiser Patent Case</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<center><h3> Volvo Duo-Prop vs. Brunswick<br>
Mercruiser Bravo-Three Patent Case</h3></center>


This page details the fight between the Mercruiser Dual Propeller Bravo-Three and the Volvo Duo-Prop. The actual fight was over patent Volvo <a href="4741670.htm">#4,741,670</A>, or more properly - over its reissued version as <a href="34011.htm">Re.#34,011</A>.

The basic facts were that :
<ul>
<li> The portion of the patent causing the conflict was the claiming of an area of certain propeller design parameters<p>

<li> Volvo filed for the original patent on Sep. 12, 1986. Patent #4,741,670 was issued May 3, 1988.<p>

<li> Volvo filed for a reissue of the patent on May 2, 1990. The Reissue patent Re #34,011 was issued on July 28, 1992.<p>

<li> The re-issued patent added 18 new claims (claims 10 through 27) and also updated several of the earlier claims.<p>

</ul>

Reissued patents are done when an error has been made in publishing the patent. Sometimes an important word such as  NOT is left out and drastically changes the meaning of a sentence. Patents can also be reissued when the inventor forgot to put something in that they meant to put in. Reissued patents rarely are allowed to broaden the claims of the original patent. Only about 1/3 of 1% of all patents get reissued and a small percentage of them have broadened claims.  You must file for reissue within 2 years of the issue of the patent if the claims are being broadened.  In this situation Volvo asked for a quite unusual amount of changes including broadening of claims in the patent and did it on the very last day of the 2 year period in which they could request a broadening reissue.<p>

After the original patent was issued, Mercruiser designed the Bravo-Three propeller configuration to specifically avoid the Volvo patent and went into production. Then sometime later (July 1992) the Volvo patent was reissued and the broadened the claims in the area of propeller parameters to include the area Mercruiser was operating in (or at least Volvo said it did). If the reissued patent is valid and everybody agrees on the facts, the attorney's call this situation, Intervening Rights. The actual law on who is right, wrong and how to handle the issue has changed several times during the life of the patent system. Under current law, the situation is to go to court and the court is to determine the outcome. The court is to make sure the company that invested money and efforts to legally produce a product during the "Intervening" time between the patent and its reissue has opportunity to recover its investment. The results are somewhere on a sliding scale from the company being forced to get all the units back they ever made and destroying them, or convert them to non-interfering units, through being able to sell what it has already sold, sell all it currently has made, sell all it currently has parts to assemble, to manufacturing and selling more in the future. Some kind of licensing agreement is often reached. Very few cases have been tried in recent years in this particular doctrine. Typically companies try to get the patent or reissue declared invalid, or claim they are not infringing.<p>

In real life, and in this case, often the alleged infringer will counter-suit the company claiming infringement claiming their patent is invalid. It is usually much better to be on the prosecution side. The prosecution drives the case. You get to direct the trial and to pick the venue (site to be sued in), while the company being sued is stuck to responding to the issues you bring up. You "yank their chain" which is more fun than having your chain yanked.<p>


If the results are ever published (and I doubt that), they might make a nice legal brief in the patent textbooks.<p>

<h3>Specific Technologies In The News</h3><p>


 <h4><b><img src="../../../links/new.gif"> Flying on Water - WIG (Wing In Ground Effect)</b></h4><p>


The  January 1997 issue of Popular Science has an article titled, "Flying on Water" on pages 50-54 that has some great photos and test describing the current wave skimming WIG craft that use the added lift wings receive near the water to make a boat truly fly at a short height above the water. We scanned a <a href="../../../artwork/photos/wigfig.gif">figure from the article</A> that shows a "takeoff" and explains the ground effect. The Russians did a lot of work with this technique on very large craft a few years ago. Now the technology is being moved to smaller potentially recreational craft.  The model featured in the story is a "Flarecraft". <p>

Flarecraft Corporation was formed by Bill Russell who has spent 9 years developing the "ground effect" planes. Flarecraft now has 5 working prototypes and the author rode in one on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. A water jet from a jet ski is used to steer the craft on the water and to assist in "taking off".  A 225 horsepower aircraft engine provides the power for "flight" and propells the Flarecraft to speeds in excess 100mph. This winter prototypes will be flying  in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Miami. Ticom Corp a division of Northrop AIrcraft and Merifield Roberts Corp are beginning to manufacture a "hundred or so" of the 5 seaters with a retail price in excess of $200,000.  Russell is already working on a two seater personal version that would fit on a trailer and sell in the $10,000 range. <p>

<h4><b>Composite Propellers</b></h4><p>

December 5, 1996 - A lab in England has established a <a href="http://www.tech.plym.ac.uk/sme/prop.htm">web page</A> describing their research in the area of composite propellers. <p>
<hr>

<h4><b>Ventilated Water Jet Propulsion and Gas Cavity Hull Resistance Reduction</b></h4><p>

The Russian Krylov Shipbuilding Institute in St. Petersburg has been working on Ventilated Water Jet Propulsion and Reducing Hull Friction by the use of Gas Cavities. The status of their research is given in a <A href="krylov.htm">U.S. Navy Technology Newsletter</A>. Note! They are looking for U.S. Partners in the continuing development of the Ventilated Water Jet.<p>

<hr>

<h4><b>High Tech Hulls</b></h4><p>

<A HREF="http://marinesurvey.com/yacht/material.htm">"High Tech Materials in Boat Building"</A> is an excellent article on the use of new boat hull materials.<p>
<hr>


<h4><b>Bubble Jet Propulsion</b></h4><p>

The August September 1993 issue of International Boat Industry had an article titled, "Blowing Bubbles", that described a new water-jet propulsion system, the Bubbly Jet, currently under development in Israel. Gas is injected to water that is already moving through a jet due to the motion of the craft. The air or gas expands and increases the exit velocity of the water. There are no moving parts interfacing with the water. The pressure of the gas regulates the speed of the craft. The concept had been under development for 9 years and the project was being led by Professor Alon Gany with the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) in Hafa. Development had reached the stages of both static and dynamic testing in the laboratory and they were hoping to soon develop a full size version for practical trials.<p>
<hr>

<a name=robo></A>
<h4><b>Robo-Tuna</b></h4><p>

A Michael S. Triantafyllou and his brother George S. Triantafyllou at M..I.T. have been working on a Robotic version of a Tuna. They received patent #5,401,196 and quite a bit of press in 1995. The March 1995 issue of Smithsonian magazine had a very lengthy article which was also their cover feature. The article was titled, "An Efficient Swimming Machine". The header line said, "Instinctive control of vortices lets fish swim the way they do. A robotic tuna has also managed it; boats and submarines may be next." <p>

One of the basic concepts is described in a sketch caption, "Fish encountering vortices senses the pressure variations of the spinning eddies as they move along its side. To capture energy from the vortices and boost its swimming efficiency, the fish instinctively times the flapping of its tail to counter rotating whorls that meet and weaken the encountered ones. <p>

Another article was in the February 23, 1995 issue of Machine Design on pages 18-20. The 44 inch long 'Robo Tuna" with 2,843 parts is described and its testing in a 120 foot test tank is explained. <p>

A brief article, "Mechanical Tuna", appeared in the December 1994 issue of Popular Science on page 17. It talks of the design focusing on trying to transfer natural fish like movements to underwater craft. <p>
<hr>

<h4><b>Heat Shielding</b></h4><p>

The August 1996 issue of NASA Tech Briefs describes the use thermal blanket insulation from the space shuttle to help insulate the drivers compartment of a NASCAR race car. Work was done on a Penske Ford Thunderbird using the Thermal Protection System (TPS) blanket material. Bobby Allison started the work and used one of his friend's (Roger Penske's) cars. In actual track conditions the temperature under the drivers foot went from 145 degrees F to 108 degrees F. The temperature under the drivers left elbow went from 260 degrees F to 120 degrees F. These readings were obtained with only the external insulation in place. Greater changes were expected when running with some interior insulation in place. Rockwell is negotiating a business development contract with Penske Racing to develop a commercial product for the NASCAR application. The article say to call Bruce Lockley at Kennedy Space Center (407) 861-5381 for more details. You can also read more of the article on the NASA Tech Briefs web site. <p>

These materials might be applicable to high performance and race boat applications today and perhaps later to more applications as they become more commercially available. <p>
<hr>


<h4><b>Hybrid Electric Car</b></h4><p>

The September 23, 1996 issue of Business Week Has an article titled, "Batteries Not Included" on pages 78-80. It describes and electric car without the normal huge batteries. It uses a 60 HP gas turbine engine and a flywheel. The flywheel can add in as much as 200 HP. Harold A. Rosen, age 70 and his brother Benjamin Rosen, age 63 are the men behind it. Harold led the team that built the first geo-stationary satellite at Hughes Aircraft in 1963 and Ben  is ex-chairman of Campaq Computers. They have converted a few cars to their method and have only recently "came out of the closet" to expose their designs. <p>

Sounds like a method that might someday be applied to boating? The flywheel helps you get "over the hump" to get on plane and then you cruise on the gas turbine with the flywheel being a big help to "pop up" skiers. They mention a composite flywheel (light weight and no rust?) Might be food for thought?<p>

<hr>


<h3>Synergistic Technologies</h3><p>

<h4><b>Water Turbines</b></h4><p>

Since most recreational boats are propeller powered, There is an opportunity to learn from others using propeller type devices. Airplane propellers have been studied very thoroughly, but they run in a much different medium. Water turbines have very similar operating characteristics and problems as ducted  propellers. One difference is that many turbines are designed for single speed operation, however, some are not. Two excellent articles to start with in this area are:<br>
<ul>
 <li>"Hydromechanics of Variable Speed Turbines"  Cesar Farell and John Gulliver. Journal of Energy Engineering, Vol. 113 No. 1. May 1987. Pages 1-13.<p>

<li> "Submergence Factors for Hydraulic Turbines".  J.L. Gordon. Journal of Energy Engineering. Vol. 115 No. 2. August 1989. Pages 90-107.<p>
</ul>
It seems like these two industries should open some communication lines between each other for mutual benefit.<p>
<hr>

<h4><b>Tank Agitators, Industrial Mixers, Stirring Devices</b></h4><p>

Tank agitators, industrial mixers, and stirring devices are another field from which drive manufacturers could learn.  Some large industrial mixing devices look incredibly like outboard motors. They operate like huge kitchen mixers. Some interaction with the body of knowledge associated with these devices could provide some new ideas for both fields.<p>

<title>Harley Sound Trademark Filing</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<enter><h3>Harley Hopes to Add Hog's Roar<br>
 to its Menagerie of Trademarks</h3></center>

<pre>
Wall Street Journal
23 June 1995
By Anna D. Wilde
</pre>

Harley-Davidson is cruising toward a new frontier: It's trying to trademark a noise.<p>

The Milwaukee motorcycle maker, already the owner of the copyright for the word "Hog," has filed a petition with the U.S. patent Office for exclusive rights to its engine sound.<p>

If the company succeeds, the aural emission of its "45 degree V-twin single crankpin motor" would join the roar of the MGM  Lion and the NBC chimes as trademarked sounds. The patent office recently invited opposition to Harley's application, one of the final steps before a new trademark is approved.<p>

But experts say Harley may have a hard time proving its engine noise if both unique and closely associated with its brand, the standards for trademarking as sound. "There's nothing intrinsically impossible in saying when you have this sound,  its a Harley-Davidson," says Arthur Miller, an intellectual-property expert at Harvard law School. "But they have to prove that."<p>

Harley fans insist ther is a distinctive Hog call, "It's something no other engine has," explains Matthew Pachi, the director of an 800-member Harley-Davidson owners group in Milwaukee. Describing that sound isn't easy, though. Mr. Pachi hears a "low, guttural growl" when he revs up his bike. Johnathan Goldstein, an economics professor at Bowdoin College and a Hog owner since 1971, describes it as two long vrooms followed by four shorter vrooms.<p>

David Edwards, editor in chief of Cycle World magazine, describes the Harley sound as syncopated and adds that some riders have likened it to saying "potato-potato-potato."<p>

Harley-Davidson claims that the trademark is needed because rival manufacturers are already trying to mimic the noise. "We feel there's a competitive threat," says Steve Piehl, a Harley spokesman. "A lot of our owners tell us they buy a Harley just for the sound."<p>

So far, 13 individuals and companies including rivals Suzuki and Kawasaki, have requested a delay in the patent office's ruling so they can present their own arguments. Prof. Miller worries trademarking sounds like Harley's engine noise could lead to monopoly. "How about Rice Krispies?" he says, "Do you think they can trademark the snap, crackle, pop?"<p>

<HR><B><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></B><HR>
<P>A lower unit of a marine outboard drive has a unique shape which inhibits
 boundary layer separation within the water flow stream over the lower unit
 regardless of the trim position of the lower unit. The lower unit includes
 a nacelle. The front nose of the nacelle blends smoothly into a supporting
 strut in a vertical direction to form a generally teardrop-like
 cross-sectional shape. The front end of the strut fairs the nacelle body
 from its sharp leading edge to give the lower unit a streamline shape at
 trim angles approaching a full trim up position of the lower unit. The
 leading edge of the strut also slopes rearward away from the front nose of
 the nacelle. The shape of this junction between the upper side of the
 nacelle and the strut front end gives the front end of the lower unit a
 generally constant streamline shape as the lower unit rotates through a
 range of trim angle positions.

<P>A hydraulic cylinder provided in its piston with axial channels with check
 valves permitting fluid flow in one direction from one cylinder chamber to
 the other. Constricting means in the form of a spring-biased plate
 displaceably mounted on the piston rod covers, after a certain
 displacement of the piston, a portion of the outlet openings of the axial
 channels to reduce the flow-through cross-sectional area and brake the
 piston movement.

<B>Abstract:</B> A transmission for a counter-rotational propeller system of a watercraft outboard drive provides an increased flow area for exhaust discharge behind the transmission within the lower unit. The transmission includes a pair of counter-rotating gears. A front clutch selectively drives an inner propulsion shaft by engaging the front gear. A rear clutch selectively drive an outer propulsion shaft by engaging either of the gears. The front clutch lies forward of the front gear and the rear clutch is interposed between the gears. The clutching mechanism thus entirely lies forward of the rear gear to provide more space for exhaust discharge flow behind the transmission. <P>
<HR>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<P><P>1. Field of the Invention<P><P>The present invention relates in general to a marine propulsion system, and in particular to a transmission for a propulsion system of an outboard drive.<P><P>2. Description of Related Art<P><P>Many outboard drives of marine watercrafts employ forward/neutral/reverse transmissions together with a dual propeller propulsion system. Such transmissions are common in both outboard motors and in outboard drive units of inboard/outboard motors.<P><P>These transmissions typically include a driving bevel gear and a pair of oppositely rotating driven bevel gears. Each driven gear includes a hub that is journaled within a lower unit of the outboard drive. A front dog clutch of a dual clutch assembly is interposed between the pair of oppositely rotating gears. In this position, the front dog clutch moves between positions in which the clutch engages the gears. The front dog clutch selectively couples an inner propeller shaft to one of the driven gears to rotate a rear propeller in either a forward or a reverse direction.<P><P>The transmission also includes a second dog clutch that is positioned to the rear side of the rear driven gear hub. The rear clutch selectively engages corresponding teeth formed on the rear side of the hub of the rear gear to drive an outer propeller shaft. The outer propulsion shaft in turn drives a front propeller.<P><P>Such prior transmission designs tend to occupy a significant amount of space in the lower unit on the rear side of the drive shaft. The lower unit also houses an exhaust passageway for the discharge of engine exhaust.<P><P>The large size of prior transmissions used with counter-rotational propulsion systems commonly leaves less space for the exhaust passage though the lower unit. Inadequate exhaust flow area can result in higher back pressure, and engine exhaust tends not to discharge smoothly. Engine performance consequently suffers. This problem becomes more acute with larger engines. It becomes necessary to increase the flow area of the exhaust passage through the lower unit in order to discharge exhaust gas smoothly.<P><P>Lower units thus have increased in size to accommodate the larger exhaust passages with current transmission designs. An increased size in the lower unit, however, undesirably increases the resistance to fluid flow around the lower unit, i.e., undesirably increases the drag on the lower unit.<P><P>Another disadvantage associated with prior transmissions used with counter-rotational propulsion systems is that such systems rotate the rear propeller when driving the watercraft in the reverse direction. The front propeller, however, tends to block the thrust stream produced by the rear propeller and thereby inhibits the performance of the outboard drive when operated in reverse.<P><P>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<P><P>A need therefore exists for a transmission for a counter-rotation propulsion system which provides space for an adequately sized exhaust passage through a lower unit to discharge engine exhaust smoothly, as well as improves reverse thrust when driving in reverse.<P><P>In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a transmission for a watercraft outboard drive selective couples a drive shaft of the outboard drive to first and second propulsion shafts. Each propulsion shaft extends from the transmission to drive a propulsion device. The transmission comprises first and second counter-rotating gears that are driven by the drive shaft. A first clutch is connected to the first propulsion shaft on a side of the first and second gears opposite of the propulsion devices. A second clutch similarly is connected to the second propulsion shaft and is coupled to the first clutch. The second clutch is interposed between the first and second gears. This arrangement of the transmission components provides more space behind the transmission for exhaust discharge than prior transmission designs do.<P><P>According to another aspect of the present invention, a transmission for a watercraft outboard drive comprises first and second counter-rotating gears and a first clutch interposed between the first and second gears. A second clutch is coupled to the first clutch and is positioned on a side of one of the gears opposite of the first clutch. An actuator is coupled to the clutches to selectively actuate the clutches to engage the gears. The actuator is positioned adjacent to the second clutch on a side of one of the gears opposite of the first clutch.<P><P>An additional aspect of the present invention relates to an outboard drive for a watercraft. The outboard drive comprises first and second propulsion shafts which extend in a rearward direction from a transmission. The first propulsion shaft drives a front propulsion device and the second propulsion shaft drives a rear propulsion device. The transmission is configured to selectively couple the propulsion shafts with a drive shaft of the outboard drive to establish a forward drive condition with both front and rear propulsion devices being driven, and to selectively couple the first propulsion shaft with the drive shaft to establish a reverse drive condition with only the front propulsion device being driven.<P><P>Yet another aspect of the invention involves a transmission for a outboard drive which comprises first and second counter-rotating gears and first and second clutches which selectively engage the gears. The clutches are adapted to reciprocate between a first position, where the first and second clutches engage the first and second gears, respectively, to a second position, where only the first clutch engages the second gear. The first clutch has fewer clutching teeth on a first portion, which engages the first gear in the first position, than on a second portion, which engages the second gear in the second position. <P>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<P><P>FIG. 1 illustrates a marine outboard drive 10 configured in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the outboard drive 10 is depicted as an outboard motor for mounting on a stern 12 of a watercraft 14. It is contemplated, however, that those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the present invention can be applied to stern drive units of inboard-outboard motors and to other types of watercraft drive units as well.<P><P>In the illustrated embodiment, the outboard drive 10 has a power head 16 which includes an engine (not shown). A conventional cowling 18 desirably includes a lower tray 20 and a top cowling member 22. These components 20, 22 of the protective cowling 18 together define an engine compartment which houses the engine.<P><P>The engine is mounted conventionally with its outward shaft (i.e., a crankshaft) rotating about a generally vertical axis. The crankshaft (not shown) drives a drive shaft 24 (FIG. 2), as known in the art. The drive shaft 24 depends from the power head 16 of the outboard drive 10.<P><P>A drive shaft housing 26 extends downward from the lower tray 20 and terminates in a lower unit 28. As known in the art, the drive shaft 24 extends through and is journaled within the drive shaft housing 26.<P><P>The engine includes an exhaust system which discharges exhaust gases through an exhaust pipe (not shown). The exhaust depends from the engine, which is positioned within the cowling 18, into an exhaust expansion chamber (not shown) formed in the drive shaft housing 26.<P><P>A steering bracket 30 is attached to the drive shaft housing 26 in a known manner. The steering bracket 30 also is pivotally connected to a clamping bracket 32 by a pin 34. The clamping bracket 32, in turn, is configured to attach to the transom 12 of the watercraft 14. This conventional coupling permits the outboard drive 10 to be pivoted relative to the steering bracket 30 for steering purposes, as well as to be pivoted relative to the pin 34 to permit adjustment to the trim position of the outboard drive and for tilt up of the outboard drive 10. Although not illustrated, it is understood that a conventional hydraulic tilt and trim cylinder assembly, as well as a conventional hydraulic steering cylinder assembly could be used as well with the present outboard drive 10.<P><P>The lower unit 28 houses a transmission 36 which selectively establishes a driving condition of a propulsion device 38, such as, for example, a propeller, a hydrodynamic jet, or the like. The transmission 36 advantageously is a forward/neutral/reverse type transmission. In this manner, the propulsion device 38 can drive the watercraft in any of these three operating states.<P><P>The present transmission is particularly well suited for use with a counter-rotational propulsion device 38. In the illustrated embodiment, the propulsion device 38 is a counter-rotational propeller device that includes a first propeller 40 designed to spin in one direction and to assert a forward thrust, and a second propeller 42 designed to spin in an opposite direction and to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>FIG. 2 illustrates the components of the front and rear propellers 40, 42. The rear propeller 40 includes a boss 43 formed in part by an inner sleeve 45 and an outer sleeve 47 to which the propeller blades 49 are integrally formed. A plurality of radial ribs 51 extend between the inner sleeve 45 and the outer sleeve 47 to support the outer sleeve 47 about the inner sleeve 45 and to form a passage P.sub.1 through the propeller boss 43. Engine exhaust is discharged through the passage P.sub.1, as known in the art.<P><P>An inner propulsion shaft 44 drives the rear propeller boss 43. For this purpose, the rear end of the inner propulsion shaft 44 carries an engagement sleeve 53 which has a spline connection with the rear end of the rear propulsion shaft 44. The sleeve 53 is fixed to the rear end of the inner shaft 44 between a nut 55 threaded on the rear end of the shaft 44 and an annular retainer ring 57 positioned between the front and rear propeller 40, 42. An elastic bushing 59 is interposed between the engagement sleeve 53 and the rear propeller boss 43 and is compressed therebetween. The bushing 59 is secured to the engagement sleeve 53 by a heat process known in the art. The frictional engagement between the boss 43 and the elastic bushing 59 is sufficient to transmit rotational forces from the engagement sleeve 53, driven by the inner propulsion shaft 44 to the rear propeller blades 49.<P><P>The front propeller 42 likewise includes a front propeller boss 61. The front propeller boss 61 has an inner sleeve 63 and an outer sleeve 65. Propeller blades 67 of the front propeller 42 are integrally formed on the exterior of the outer sleeve 65. Ribs 69 connect the inner sleeve 63 and the outer sleeve 65 to form an axially extending passage P.sub.2 between the sleeves 63, 65. The passage P.sub.2 communicates with the passage P.sub.1 of the rear propeller boss 43 so as to form a continuous exhaust discharge passage 48 through the propulsion device 38.<P><P>An outer propulsion shaft 46 carries the front propeller 42. As best seen in FIG. 2, the rear end portion of the outer propulsion shaft 46 carries a front engagement sleeve 71 and drives the engagement sleeve 71 thereabouts by a spline connection. The front engagement sleeve 71 is secured onto the outer propulsion shaft 46 between the annular retaining ring 57 and the lower unit 28.<P><P>A front annular elastic bushing 73 surrounds the front engagement sleeve 71. The bushing 73 is secured to the sleeve 71 by a heat process known in the art.<P><P>The front propeller boss 61 surrounds the elastic bushing 73, which is held under pressure between the boss 61 and the engagement sleeve 71 in frictional engagement. The frictional engagement between the propeller boss 61 and the bushing 73 is sufficient to transmit a rotational force from the sleeve 71 to the propeller blades 67 of the front propeller boss 61.<P><P>As also seen in FIG. 2, the drive shaft housing 26 and the lower unit 28 together define an exhaust discharge duct 46 which delivers engine exhaust from the expansion chamber of the drive shaft housing 26 to the exhaust discharge passage 48 formed within the propulsion device 38, as known in the art. The outlet end of the exhaust discharge passage 48 is located behind the propulsion device 38.<P><P>The individual components of the present transmission 36 will now be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 3-7. Additionally, in connection with the description of the components, &quotcfront&quoth and &quotlrear&quoth are used herein in reference to the bow of the watercraft 14.<P><P>With reference to FIG. 3, the drive shaft 24 carries a drive gear 50 at its lower end, which is disposed within the lower unit 28 and which forms a portion of the transmission 36. The drive gear 50 preferably is a bevel type gear.<P><P>The transmission 36 also includes a pair of counter-rotating driven gears 52, 54 that are in mesh engagement with the drive gear 50. The pair of driven gears 52, 54 preferably are positioned on diametrically opposite sides of the drive gear 50, and are suitably journaled within the lower unit 28 as described below. Each driven gear 52, 54 is positioned at about a 90.degree. shaft angle with the drive shaft 24. That is, the propulsion shafts 44, 46 and the drive shaft 24 desirably intersect at about a 90.degree. shaft angle; however, it is contemplated that the drive shaft 24 and the propulsion shaft 44, 46 can intersect at almost any angle.<P><P>In the illustrated embodiment, the pair of driven gears 52, 54 are a front bevel gear 52 and an opposing rear bevel gear 54. The front bevel gear 52 includes a hub 56 which is journaled within the lower unit 28 by front thrust bearing 58. The thrust bearing 58 rotatably supports the front gear 52 in mesh engagement with the drive gear 50.<P><P>As seen in FIGS. 3 and 4, the hub 56 has a central bore 57 through which the inner propulsion shaft 44 passes when assembled. The inner propulsion shaft 44 is suitably journaled within the central bore 57 of the front gear hub 56. The front gear 52 also includes a series of teeth 60 on an annular front facing engagement surface 61, and includes a series of teeth 62 on an annular rear facing engagement surface 63 (FIG. 3). The teeth 60, 62 on each surface 61, 63 positively engage a portion of a clutch of the transmission 36, as discussed below.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 3, the rear gear 54 also includes a hub 64 which is suitably journaled within a bearing casing 66 of the lower unit 28 by a rear thrust bearing 68. The rear thrust bearing 68 rotatably supports the rear gear 54 in mesh engagement with the drive gear 50. A front end ring 70, attached to the lower unit 28, secures the bearing casing 66 to the lower unit 28.<P><P>With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, hub 64 of the rear gear 54 has a central bore 69 through which the inner propulsion shaft 44 and the outer propulsion shaft 46 pass when assembled. The rear gear also includes an annular front engagement surface 71 which carries a series of teeth 72 for positive engagement with a clutch of the transmission 36, as discussed below.<P><P>The rear gear 54 also includes a plurality of lubricant passages 73 that extend from the annular front engagement surface 71 to a location outside the bearing hub 64, proximate to the rear thrust bearing 68. These passages 73 allow lubricant flow from a main lubricant sump between the driven gears 52, 54 into the area outside of the bearing hub 64 of the rear gear 54 so as to lubricate the rear thrust bearing 68 as well as to provide a lubricant flow passageway into the bearing casing 66.<P><P>As best seen in FIG. 3, the bearing casing 66 rotatably supports the hollow outer propulsion shaft 46 within the lower unit 28. A front needle bearing 74 journals a front end of the outer propulsion shaft 46 within the bearing casing 66. A rear needle bearing 76 supports the outer propulsion shaft within the bearing casing 66 at an opposite end of the bearing casing 56 from the front needle bearing 74.<P><P>With reference to FIG. 2, on the front side of the front gear 52, a needle bearing assembly 77 journals the front end of the inner propulsion shaft 44 within the lower unit 28. The inner propulsion shaft 44 extends rearward through the front gear hub 56 and the rear gear hub 64, and is suitably journaled therein. On the rear side of the rear gear 54, the inner propulsion shaft 44 extends through the outer shaft 46 and is suitably journaled therein by a rear needle bearing assembly 78 which supports the inner shaft 44 at the rear end of the outer shaft 46.<P><P>A first pair of seals 80 (e.g., oil seals) are interposed between the bearing casing 66 and the outer propulsion shaft 46 at the rear end of the bearing casing 66. Likewise, a second pair of seals 82 (e.g., oil seals) are interposed between the inner shaft 44 and the outer shaft 46 at the rear end of the outer shaft 46. Lubricant within a lubricant sump flows through the gaps between the bearing casing 66 and the outer shaft 46, through the apertures 83, 85 in the inner and outer shafts 44, 46, and between the outer shaft 46 and the inner shaft 44 to lubricate the bearings 68, 74, 76, 78 supporting the inner propulsion shaft 44 and the outer propulsion shaft 46. The seals 80, 82, which are located at the rear end of the bearing casings 66 and at the rear end of the outer shaft 46, substantially prevent lubricant flow beyond these points.<P><P>With reference to FIG. 3, the front end of the inner propulsion shaft 44 includes a longitudinal bore 84. The bore 84 extends from the front end of the inner shaft 46 to a bottom surface which is positioned on the rear side of the axis of the drive shaft 24. The longitudinal bore 84 communicates with the lubricant opening 83 of the inner shaft 44. A front aperture 86 extends through the inner shaft 44, transverse to the axis of the longitudinal bore 84, at a position forward of the front bevel gear 52. The inner shaft 44 also includes a rear aperture 88 that extends transverse to the axis of the longitudinal bore 84 and is generally symmetrically positioned between the front bevel gear 52 and the rear bevel gear 54.<P><P>As best seen in FIG. 3, the transmission 36 also includes a front clutch 90 and a rear clutch 92 coupled to a plunger 94. As discussed in detail below, the front clutch 90 selectively couples the inner propulsion shaft to the front gear 52. The rear clutch 92 selectively couples the outer propulsion shaft 46 either to the front gear 52 or to the rear gear 54. FIG. 3 illustrates the front clutch 90 and the rear clutch 92 set in a neutral position (i.e., in a position in which the clutches 90, 92 do not engage either the front gear 52 or the rear gear 54). In the illustrated embodiment, the clutches 90, 92 are positive clutches, such as, for example, dog clutches; however, it is contemplated that the present transmission could be designed with friction-type clutches.<P><P>The plunger 94 has a generally cylindrical rod shape and slides within the longitudinal bore 84 of the inner shaft 44 to actuate the clutches 90, 92. The plunger 94 may be solid; however, it is preferred that the plunger 94 be hollow (i.e., a cylindrical tube), especially where a neutral detent mechanism of the type described below is used.<P><P>The plunger 94 includes a front hole 96 that is positioned generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the plunger 94 and a rear hole 98 that is likewise positioned generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the plunger 94. Each hole 96, 98 desirably is located symmetrically in relation to the corresponding apertures 86, 88 of the inner propulsion shaft 44.<P><P>The transmission 36 also may include a neutral detent mechanism 99 to hold the plunger 94 (and the coupled clutches 90, 92) in the neutral position. FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the neutral detent mechanism 99 used with a hollow plunger 94 in which the detent mechanism cooperates between the plunger 94 and the inner propulsion shaft 44, and is located at the front end of the inner propulsion shaft 44.<P><P>The neutral detent mechanism is formed in part by at least one, and preferably two, transversely positioned holes in the plunger 94. These holes receive detent balls 101. The detent balls each have a diameter which is slightly smaller than the diameter of each hole.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 3, the inner propulsion shaft 44 includes an annular groove 103 which is formed on the inner wall of the bore 84 through which the plunger 94 slides. The groove 103 is positioned within the bore 84 so as to properly locate the clutches 90, 92 in the neutral position when the detent holes of the plunger 94 coincide with the axial position of the annular groove 103. A spring plunger 105, formed in part by a helical compression spring, biases the detent balls 101 radially outwardly against the inner wall of the inner propulsion shaft bore 84. The plunger 94 contains the spring plunger 105 within its bore.<P><P>The spring plunger 105 forces portions of the detent balls 101 into the annular groove 103 when the plunger 94 is moved into the neutral position. This releasable connection between the detent balls 101 carried by the plunger 94 and the groove 103 of the inner propulsion shaft 44 releasably restrains movement of the plunger 94 relative to the inner propulsion shaft 44, as known in the art. Because the detent mechanism 99 is believed to be conventional, further description of the detent mechanism 99 is thought unnecessary for an understanding of the present transmission 36.<P><P>FIG. 4 illustrates the dog clutches 90, 92 and the front and rear driving gears 52, 54 in isolation. As seen in FIG. 4, the front dog clutch 90 has a generally cylindrical shape that includes an axial bore 100 which extends between an annular front end 102 and a flat annular rear end 104. The bore 100 is sized to receive the inner propulsion shaft 44. Internal splines 106 (shown in FIG. 5) are formed on the wall of the bore 100, the purpose of which will be explained below. FIG. 4 does not illustrate the internal splines 106 in order to simplify the drawing.<P><P>The rear end surface 104 of the clutch 90 extends generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the clutch 90. The rear surface 104 of the front dog clutch 90 is substantially coextensive in area with the annular front surface 61 of the front gear 52. Teeth 108 extend from the clutch rear surface 104 in the longitudinal direction and desirably correspond to the teeth 60 of the front surface 61 of the front gear 52 in size (e.g., axial length) and in configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the front clutch 90 and the front gear 52 each includes three teeth 108, 60, respectively, on their corresponding ends; however, it is contemplated that the clutch 90 and gear 52 could have any of a variety of number of teeth in order to suit a specific application.<P><P>A pair of annular grooves circumscribe the exterior of the front clutch 90. A front groove 107 is sized to receive a retaining spring, as discussed below. The rear groove 109 is sized to cooperate with a portion of an actuator mechanism, which also will be described below.<P><P>As seen in FIGS. 3 and 5, the front clutch 90 includes a transverse hole 111 that extends through the clutch 90 at the location of the front annular groove 107. The hole is sized to receive a pin 113 which, when passed through the front aperture 86 of the inner propulsion shaft 44 and through the front hole 96 of the plunger 94, interconnects the plunger 94 and the front clutch 90 with the front clutch 90 positioned on the inner propulsion shaft 44. The pin 113 may be held in place by a press-fit connection between the pin 113 and the front hole 111 of the clutch 90 or by a conventional coil spring 115 (see FIG. 5) which is contained within the front annular groove 107 about the exterior of the front clutch 90.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 4, the rear clutch 92 is disposed between the two counter-rotating driven gears 52, 54. The rear dog clutch 92 has a tubular shape that includes an axial bore which extends between an annular front end 110 and an annular rear end 112. The bore 117 is sized to receive a portion of the outer propulsion shaft 46 positioned about the inner propulsion shaft 44.<P><P>The annular end surfaces 110, 112 of the rear clutch 92 are substantially coextensive in size with the annular engagement surfaces 63 of the front and rear gears 52, 54, respectively. Teeth 114 extend from the front end 110 of the rear clutch 92 and desirably correspond to the respective teeth 62 of the front gear 52 in size (e.g., axial length), in number, and in configuration. Teeth 116 likewise extend from the rear end surface 112 of the rear clutch 92 and desirably correspond to the respective teeth 72 of the rear gear 54 in size (e.g., axial length), in number, and in configuration.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 4, the front engagement end 110 of the rear clutch 92 carries a greater number of teeth than the rear engagement end 112 of the rear clutch 92 and a greater number of teeth than the rear engagement end 104 of the front clutch 90. In the illustrated embodiment, the rear engagement end 104 of the front clutch and the rear engagement end 116 of the rear clutch 92 desirably include the same number of clutching teeth 108, 116, respectively. The front engagement end 114 of the rear clutch 92 desirably includes twice as many teeth 114 than that carried by either the rear engagement end 104 of the front clutch 90 or the rear engagement end 112 of the rear clutch 92. In the manner, the torque load per tooth 114 when the rear clutch 92 engages the front gear 54 is almost half of the torque load per tooth 108, 116 when the front clutch 90 engages the front gear 52 and the rear clutch 92 engages the rear gear 54. In addition, the fewer number of teeth involved where the clutches 90, 92 simultaneously engage the gears 52, 54 eases shifting because registration between the corresponding teeth is achieved quicker.<P><P>With reference back to FIG. 3, the rear clutch 92 is splined to the outer propulsion shaft 46. The clutch 92 thus drives the outer propulsion shaft 44 through the spline connection 118 between the rear clutch 92 and the shaft 46, yet the clutch 92 can slide along the axis of the shaft 46 between the front and rear gears 52, 54. The rear clutch 92 specifically includes internal splines within the bore 117 that mate with corresponding external splines 120 on the outer periphery of the outer propulsion shaft 46 to from the spline connection 118.<P><P>The rear clutch 92 also includes a counterbore 122. The counterbore 122 is sized to receive a pin 124 which extends through the rear aperture 88 of the inner propulsion shaft 44 and through the rear hole 98 of the plunger 94 when assembled. As seen in FIG. 5, the ends of the pin 124 desirably are captured by an annular bushing 126 which is interposed between a pair of roller bearings (not shown). The assembly of the bushings and bearings is captured between a pair of washers and locked within the counterbore 122 of the dog clutch 92 by a retaining ring (not shown in FIG. 5). The roller bearings journal the bushing and pin 124 assembly within the counterbore 122 of the rear dog clutch 92 to allow the bushing 126 and pin 124 to rotate in an opposite direction from the rear clutch 92. The pin 124, being captured within the counterbore 122 of the rear clutch 92, couples the plunger 94 and the rear clutch 92 together in order for the plunger 94 to actuate the rear clutch 92, as discussed below.<P><P>With reference back to FIG. 3, an actuator mechanism 128 moves the plunger 94 of the clutch assembly from a position establishing a forward drive condition, in which the front and rear clutches 90, 92 engage the first and second gears 52, 54, respectively, to a position of non-engagement (i.e., the neutral position) and to a position establishing a reverse drive condition, in which the rear clutch 92 engages the front gear 52. The actuator mechanism 128 positively reciprocates the plunger 94 between these positions. FIGS. 3 and 5 best illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the actuator mechanism 128.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 3, the actuator mechanism 124 includes a cam member 130 that connects the plunger 94 to a rotatable shift rod 132. In the illustrated embodiment, the shift rod 132 is journalled for rotation in the lower unit 28 and extends upwardly to a transmission actuator mechanism (not shown). The actuator mechanism 128 converts rotational movement of the shift rod 132 into linear movement of the plunger 94 to move the plunger 94 and the clutches 90, 92 generally along the axis of the propulsion shafts 44, 46.<P><P>As best seen in FIG. 5, the cam member 130 is affixed to the lower end of the shift rod 132. The cam member 130 includes an eccentrically positioned drive pin 134 which extends downwardly from the cam member 130. The cam member 128 includes a cylindrical upper bearing 136 and a smaller diameter, cylindrical lower member 138. The upper bearing 136 is positioned to rotate about the axis of the shift rod 132 and as seen in FIG. 3, is suitably journaled within an upper bore of the lower unit 28. The lower member 138 is eccentrically positioned relative to the axis of the shift rod 132 and the upper bearing 136.<P><P>FIG. 5 also best illustrates a follower 140 of the actuator mechanism 128. The follower 140 has a generally rectangular block-like body 142 with a retention arm 144 depending from one end. The retention arm 144 advantageously depends from a leading edge of the body 142 relative to the designed rotation of the clutch 90. In the illustrated embodiment, the retention arm 144 depends from the right side of the body 140 where the clutch 90 is designed to rotate in the counter-clockwise direction. As best understood from FIG. 7, the retention arm 144 holds the follower 140 on the clutch 90 with the follower body 142 captured between the clutch 90 in the rear groove 109 and the lower end of the lower cylindrical member 138 of the cam member 130.<P><P>The follower 140 also includes an aperture 146 which, as best seen in FIG. 5, extends into the body 142 from the end from which the retention arm 144 depends, and, which, as best seen in FIG. 7, extends through the body 142 in a transverse direction. The aperture 146 has a width generally equal to the diameter of the drive pin 134 of the cam member 130. When assembled, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the drive pin 134 extends through the aperture 146 and is captured between the walls of the follower body 142.<P><P>As best understood from FIG. 3, the follower body 142 has a width which generally equals the width of the rear annular groove 109 on the exterior of the front clutch 90. And, as best seen in FIG. 7, the follower body 142 has a height which generally matches the depth of the rear annular groove 109 of the front clutch 90. In this manner, the clutch groove 109 receives and captures the follower 140 of the actuated mechanism 128.<P><P>The drive pin 134 moves both axially and transversely with rotation of the cam member 130 because of the eccentric position of the drive pin 134 relative to the rotational axis of the cam member 130. The aperture 146 of the follower body 142 thus desirably has a sufficient length to accommodate the transverse travel of the drive pin 132 as the cam member 130 rotates between positions corresponding to the forward and reverse drive conditions. The axial travel of the drive pin 134 causes the follower 140 and the coupled clutch 90 to move axially, sliding over the inner propulsion shaft 52.<P><P>With reference to FIG. 3, the front clutch 90 is coupled to the cam member 130 with the follower 140 cradled between the walls of the rear annular groove 109 on the front clutch 90. The actuator mechanism 128 configured accordingly positively moves the front clutch 90 along the axis of the inner propulsion shaft 44 with rotational movement of the cam member 130 operated by the shift rod 132. The coupling between the actuator mechanism 128 and front clutch 90, however, allows the clutch 90 to rotate with the inner propulsion shaft 44 relative to the follower 140 and the cam member 130.<P><P>The following elaborates on the previous description of the operation of the present transmission 36. FIG. 3 illustrates the front and rear clutches 90, 92 in a neutral position, i.e., a position of non-engagement with the gears 52, 54. The detent mechanism 99 retains the plunger 94 and the coupled clutches 90, 92 in this neutral position.<P><P>To establish a forward drive condition, the shift rod 132 rotates the cam member 130 in a manner which moves the drive pin 134 axially in the reverse direction. In the illustrated embodiment, counterclockwise rotation of the shift rod 132 moves the eccentric driving pin 134 axially in that direction. The follower 140 thus follows the drive pin 134 to slide the front clutch 90 over the inner propulsion shaft 44. The actuator mechanism 128 thereby forces the front clutch 90 into engagement with the front gear 52, with the corresponding clutch teeth 60, 108 mating. So engaged, the front gear 52 drives the inner propulsion shaft 44 through the internal spline connection between the clutch 90 and the inner propulsion shaft 44. The inner propulsion shaft 44 thus drives the rear propeller 40 (FIG. 2) in a first direction which asserts a forward thrust.<P><P>The forward motion of the clutch 90 also causes the plunger 94 to slide within the longitudinal bore 84 of the inner propulsion shaft 44 in the reverse direction due to the direct coupling by the drive pin 113. The plunger 94 moves the rear drive pin 124 in the rearward direction to force the rear clutch 92 to engage the rear gear 54 with a corresponding clutching teeth 72, 116 mating. So engaged, the rear gear 54 drives the outer propulsion shaft 46 through the spline connection 118 between the rear clutch 92 and the outer propulsion shaft 46. The outer propulsion shaft 46 thus drives the front propeller 42 (FIG. 2) to spin in an opposite direction to that of the rear propeller 40, and to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>With reference back to FIG. 3, to establish a reverse drive condition, the shift rod 132 rotates in an opposite direction so as to move the cam member 130 and the eccentrically positioned drive pin 134 in a direction which moves the drive pin 134 axially in the forward direction. Again, in the illustrated embodiment, clockwise rotation of the shift rod 134 eccentrically rotates the drive pin 134 so as to move the drive pin axially in the forward direction. The forward movement of the drive pin 134 is transferred to the plunger 94 through the follower 140, the clutch 90, and the corresponding drive pin 113. The forward motion of the plunger 94 positively forces the rear clutch 92 into engagement with the front gear 52 with the corresponding clutching teeth 62,114, mating. So engaged, the front gear 52 drives the outer propulsion shaft 44 through the spline connection 118 between the rear clutch 92 and the outer propulsion shaft 44. The outer propulsion shaft 44 thus drives the front propeller 42 (FIG. 2) in a direction which asserts a reverse thrust to propel the watercraft 14 (FIG. 1) in reverse.<P><P>The present outboard drive 10 is capable of producing a sufficient thrust to drive the watercraft in a reverse direction by rotating the forward propeller 42 rather than the rear propeller 40 when under a reverse drive condition. Unlike prior transmissions, the second propeller (i.e., the rear propeller 40) does not block the flow of water through the front propeller 42 when the propulsion device 38 is operated in reverse.<P><P>FIGS. 8-11 illustrate additional preferred embodiments of the present transmission with component variations relating to the bearing assemblies for the driven gears, to the actuator mechanism used with the transmission, and to the coupling arrangement between the clutching elements of the transmission. The embodiments illustrated by these figures, however, are otherwise identical to the transmission 36 described above. Accordingly, the foregoing description of the transmission should be understood as applying equally to the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 8-11, unless specified to the contrary.<P><P>FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present transmission which is actuated by another type of actuator mechanism. Where appropriate, like numbers with an &quotea&quots suffix have been used to indicate like parts of the two embodiments for ease of understanding.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 8, the actuator mechanism 128a involves a conventional bell crank mechanism that includes a bell crank 200. A pin 202 supports the bell crank 200 in a manner that allows the bell crank 200 to pivot about the pin 202.<P><P>An arm 204 connects one end of the bell crank 200 to a lower end of the shift rod 132a. An aperture 206 formed in the lower portion of the arm 204 receives the end of the bell crank 200 in a manner which allows the bell crank end to rotate within the aperture 206 when operating the bell crank 200, as known in the art.<P><P>A follower 208 captures the lower end of the bell crank 200 in a manner which allows the lower end to rotate relative to the follower 208. The follower 208 is rotatably coupled to a plunger 94a. The rotatable coupling between the follower 208 and the plunger 94a allows the plunger 94a to rotate relative to the follower 208.<P><P>In the illustrated embodiment, the plunger 94a is a solid rod which slides within a bore 84a of an inner propulsion shaft 44a. The front end of the plunger 94a projects beyond the front end of the inner propulsion shaft 44a to couple with the follower 208 in front of the inner shaft 44a. The plunger 94a carries the drive pins 113a, 124a which coupled the front and rear clutches 90a, 92a to the plunger 94a.<P><P>The front clutch 90a in the present embodiment has a simplified configuration from that shown in FIG. 3. In the illustrated embodiment, the front clutch 90a generally has a sleeve-like body with clutching teeth 108a formed on a rear engagement end 104a. The clutch 90a is sized and configured to engage the clutching element carried on the front side of the front gear 52a.<P><P>Vertical movement of the shift rod 132a rotates the bell crank 200, which in turn moves the follower 208 and the coupled plunger 94a along the axis of the inner propulsion shaft 44a. In the illustrated embodiment, upward movement of the shift rod 132a establishes a forward drive condition in which the front clutch 90a engages the front gear 52a and the rear clutch 92a engages the rear gear 54a.<P><P>FIG. 8 also illustrates another bearing assembly arrangement to support the front gear 52a. In the illustrated embodiment, a needle bearing assembly 58a journals the hub 56a of the front gear 52a within the lower unit 28a. Thrust bearings 210 also are positioned between the front gear 52a and the lower unit 28a to take the trust loading on the front gear 52a.<P><P>FIG. 9 illustrates an additional embodiment of the present transmission system which is substantially identical to the transmission illustrated in FIG. 8, except for the bearing assembly which supports the rear driven gear. Where appropriate, like reference numerals with a &quotcb&quotp suffix have been used to indicate like components between these embodiments.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 9, a rear needle bearing assembly 68b journals the hub 64b of the rear gear 54b within the bearing casing 66b. A closure plate 212 supports the needle bearing assembly 68b within an enlarged forward portion of the bearing casing 66b to function as an outer race of the bearing assembly 68b. Needle-like thrust bearings 214 also are positioned between the rear gear 54b and the closure plate 212 to take the trust loading on the rear gear 54b.<P><P>FIG. 10 illustrates an another embodiment of the present transmission. The transmission illustrated in FIG. 10 is substantially identical the transmission illustrated in FIG. 3 with the exception of the actuator mechanism and the coupling between the clutches. Where appropriate, like reference numerals with a &quottc&quoto suffix have been used to indicate like components between these embodiments.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 10, the front clutch 90c of the transmission 36c has a generally tubular shape and defines an inner bore 110c between a front end 102c and a rear engagement end 104c. The rear engagement end 104c carries a plurality of teeth 108c to engage the front side of the front gear 52c. The inner bore 100c receives the inner propulsion shaft 44c when assembled, and includes a plurality of interior splines which extend from the wall of the inner bore 106c. The inner splines mate with external splines on the exterior of the inner propulsion shaft 44c to establish a spline connection between these components 44c, 90c. The clutch 90c thus can slide axially over the inner propulsion shaft 44c and can rotatably drive the shaft 44c.<P><P>A cam member 130c connects the front clutch 90c to a rotatable shift rod 132c. The shift rod 132c is journalled for rotation in the lower unit 28c and extends upwardly to a transmission actuator mechanism (not shown) for reciprocating the cam member 130c and the front clutch 90c between the neutral position (shown in FIG. 10), a forward drive position where the front and rear clutches 90c, 92c engage the front and rear gears 52c, 54c, respectively, and a reverse drive position where the rear clutch 92c engages the front gear 52c.<P><P>The cam member 130c is affixed to the lower end of the shift rod 132c. The cam member 130c includes an eccentrically positioned drive pin 134c which depends from a cylindrical lower member of the cam member 130c. The cam member 130c also includes a cylindrical upper bearing 136c which is suitably journaled within the lower unit 28c, as known in the art. The drive pin 134c is eccentrically positioned in relation to the axis of rotation of the shift rod 132c.<P><P>The front clutch 90c includes an annular groove 109c which circumscribes the tubular body of the clutch 90c. The width of the groove 109c substantially matches the diameter of the drive pin 134c. When assembled, as seen in FIG. 10, the drive pin 134c extends into the groove 109c and is captured between the side wall of the groove 109c. The drive pin 134c, however, does not interfere with the rotation of the clutch 90c which freely rotates relative to the cam member 130c when in the forward drive position.<P><P>As understood from FIG. 10, the drive pin 134c moves both axially and transversely with the rotation of the cam member 130c because of the eccentric position of the drive pin 134c relative to the rotational axis of the cam member 130c. For this purpose, the drive pin 134c freely moves within the groove 109c in the transverse direction while maintain engagement with the front clutch 90c. The axial travel of the drive pin 134c causes the front clutch 90c to move axially, sliding over the inner propulsion shaft 44c.<P><P>The rear clutch 92c also has a tubular body which defines an inner bore 117c. The inner bore 117c extends between front and rear engagement ends 110c, 112c, each of which carry a plurality of clutching teeth 114c, 116c configured to engage the corresponding clutching teeth 60c, 72c of the front and rear driven gears 52c, 54c. The inner bore 117c has a sufficient size to receive the inner propulsion shaft 44c and a portion of the outer hollow propulsion shaft 46c which is coaxially positioned about the inner propulsion shaft 44c. Internal splines extend from the wall of the inner bore 117c proximate to the rear engagement end 112c of the clutch 92c, and mate with corresponding external splines on the exterior of the outer propulsion shaft 46c. The internal splines extend only partially over the axial length of the inner bore 117c. The spline connection 118c drivingly connects the clutch 92c to the outer propulsion shaft 46c, while allowing the clutch 92c to slide over the outer propulsion shaft 46c for operation, as explained below.<P><P>A biasing member 216 is disposed within the inner bore 117c and extends between the front end of the outer propulsion shaft 46c and a retaining washer 218 fixed to the rear clutch 92c at the front end of the inner bore 117c. In the illustrated embodiment, the biasing member 216 comprises a helical compression spring which slips over the inner propulsion shaft 44c and operates within the inner bore 117c, as described below. The biasing member 216 desirably is compressed in the neutral position to assert a forward biasing force on the rear clutch 92c.<P><P>A clutch actuation mechanism couples the clutches 90c, 92c together for simultaneous operation. The clutch actuation mechanism includes a bushing sleeve 220 which passes through an inner bore 57c of the front gear 52c and surrounds a portion of the inner propulsion shaft 44c in this position. The bushing 220 is sized to smoothly slide over the inner propulsion shaft 44c and through the inner bore 57c of the front gear 52c, as discussed below. In the illustrated embodiment, the bearing sleeve 220 desirably is fixed to the inner shaft 44c in a manner which allows the sleeve 220 to slide over the shaft 44c in the forward and rearward directions, but which causes the sleeve 220 to rotate with the inner shaft 44c. The bushing 220 thus journals the shaft 44c within the inner bore 57c of the front gear 52c.<P><P>The bushing 220 extends between a rear engagement surface 104c of the front clutch 90c and the retaining washer 218 at the front end 110c of the rear clutch 92c, and contacts the clutches 90c, 92c in a manner which does not interfere with the clutching operation and the front and rear clutches 90c, 92c.<P><P>The following elaborates on the previous description of the operation of the present transmission 36c. FIG. 10 illustrates the front and rear clutches 90c, 92c in a neutral position. The bearing sleeve 220 acts as a spacer between the front and rear clutches 90c, 92c and prevents the rear clutch 92c from moving in the forward direction, despite the bias in this direction produced by the biasing member 216. The biasing member 216 urges the retaining washer 218 of the rear clutch 92c into contact with the bearing sleeve 220, and inhibits movement of the rear clutch 92c in the rearward direction. In this manner, the combination of the bearing sleeve 220 and the biasing member 216 couple the rear clutch 92c with the front clutch 90c such that these clutching elements move together, as well as maintain the position of the rear clutch 92c relative to the front clutch 90c.<P><P>To establish the forward drive condition, the shift rod 132c rotates the cam member 130c in a manner which moves the drive pin 134c axially in the rearward direction. The drive pin 134c moves the front clutch 90c rearward to slide the front clutch 90c over the inner propulsion shaft 44c and force the front clutch 90c into engagement with the front gear 52c with the corresponding clutching teeth 72, 116 mating. So engaged, the front clutch 90c drives the inner propulsion shaft 44c through the spline connection between the clutch 90c and the inner propulsion shaft 44c. The inner propulsion shaft 44c thus drives the rear propeller 40c in a first direction to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>As understood from FIG. 10, forward motion of the front clutch 90c also slides the bearing sleeve 220 over the inner propulsion shaft 44c and through the front gear 52c to actuate the rear clutch 92c. The bearing sleeve 220 thus positively forces the rear clutch 92c to engage the rear gear 54c with the corresponding clutching teeth 72c, 116c mating. So engaged, the rear clutch 92c drives the outer propulsion shaft 46c through the spline connection 118c between the rear clutch 92c and the outer propulsion shaft 46c. The outer propulsion shaft 46c in turn drives the front propeller 42c to spin in an opposite direction to that of the rear propeller 40c and to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>To establish a reverse drive condition, the shift rod 132c rotates to move the drive pin 134c and front clutch 90c in the forward direction. The preloaded biasing member 216 urges the rear clutch 92c to follow the forward motion of the front clutch 90c. The bearing sleeve 220 slides over the inner shaft 44c between the clutches 90c, 92c as the clutches 90c, 92c simultaneously move in the forward direction. The biasing member 216 forces the rear clutch 92c into engagement with the rear clutching surface 61c of the front gear 52c. The corresponding teeth 62c, 114c of the front gear 52c and the rear clutch 92c mate to establish a drive condition between these elements. So engaged, the front gear 52c drives the outer propulsion shaft 46c through the spline connection 118c between the rear clutch 92c and the outer propulsion shaft 46c. The outer propulsion shaft 46c thus drives the front propeller 42c to spin in a direction to assert a rearward thrust and drive the watercraft 14c in reverse.<P><P>FIG. 11 illustrates an additional embodiment of the present transmission system which is substantially identical to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 10 except for the clutch coupling mechanism between the front and rear clutches and for the addition of a neutral detent mechanism. Where appropriate, like reference numerals with a &quotid&quotr suffix have been used to indicate like components between these embodiments.<P><P>As seen in FIG. 11, the ends of the bearing sleeve 220d are fixed to the front and rear clutches 90d, 92d. The front clutch 90d includes a counterbore 222 which extends into the tubular body of the clutch 90d from its front engagement end 104d. The counterbore 222 is sized so as to create an interference fit with the front end of the bearing sleeve 220d. This coupling interconnects the front clutch 90d and the bearing sleeve 220d without interfering with the ability of these elements slide over the inner propulsion shaft 44d. The coupling also eliminates the need for additional fasteners so as to simplify assembly and disassembly.<P><P>The rear end of the bearing sleeve 220d is captured within the inner bore 117d of the rear clutch 92d at its front end 110d. In the illustrated embodiment, the bearing sleeve 220d includes a flared rear end 224 which is captured between a pair of retaining washers 226 which are detachably fixed within the inner bore 117d of the rear clutch 92d. The rear clutch 92d can rotate relative to the bearing sleeve 220d with the flared rear end 224 of the bearing sleeve 220d captured between, but not attached to the washers 226. The flared end 224 can freely rotate within the space defined between the washers 226 and the inner bore 117d of the rear clutch 92d.<P><P>The bearing sleeve 220d links the clutches 90d, 92d together with its ends coupled to the clutches 90d, 92d. The bearing sleeve 220d thus causes the rear clutch 92d to follow the movement of the front clutch 90d.<P><P>The present transmission 36d also includes a neutral detent mechanism 228 to retain the front clutch 90d in the neutral position. In the illustrated embodiment, the neutral detent mechanism 228 is formed by a plurality of detent balls 230 positioned within a transverse hole 232 in the inner propulsion shaft 44d. The detent balls 230 cooperate with an annular groove 234 formed within the inner bore 100d of the front clutch 90d. A compression spring 236 urges the detent balls 230 to partially protrude beyond the outer surface of inner propulsion shaft 44d and to engage the annular groove of the front clutch 90d, as known in the art.<P><P>To establish a forward drive condition, the shift rod 132d rotates the cam member 130d in a manner which moves the drive pin 134d axially in the rearward direction. The drive pin 134d moves the front clutch 90d rearward to slide the front clutch 90d over the inner propulsion shaft 44d and to force the front clutch 90d into engagement with the front gear 52d with the corresponding clutching teeth 60d, 108d mating. So engaged, the front clutch 52d drives the inner propulsion shaft 44d through the spline connection between the clutch 90d and the inner propulsion shaft 44d. The inner propulsion shaft 44d thus drives the rear propeller 40d in a first direction to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>As understood from FIG. 11, forward motion of the front clutch 90d also slides the bearing sleeve 220d over the inner propulsion shaft 44d and through the front gear 52d to actuate the rear clutch 92d. The bearing sleeve 220d thus positively forces the rear clutch 92d to engage the rear gear 92d with the corresponding clutching teeth 72d 116d mating. So engaged, the rear clutch 92d drives the outer propulsion shaft 46d through the spline connection 118d between the rear clutch 92d and the outer propulsion shaft 44d. The outer propulsion shaft 46d in turn drives the front propeller 42d to spin in an opposite direction to that of the rear propeller 40d and to assert a forward thrust.<P><P>To establish a reverse drive condition, the shift rod 132d rotates to move the drive pin 134d and front clutch 90d in the forward direction. Rearward motion of the front clutch 90d also slides the bearing sleeve 220d over the inner propulsion shaft 44d and through the front gear 52d to actuate the rear clutch 92d in this direction. The bearing sleeve 220d thus positively pulls the rear clutch 92d to engage the front gear 52d. The corresponding teeth 60d, 114d of the front gear 52d and the rear clutch 92d mate to establish a drive condition. So engaged, the front gear 52d drives the outer propulsion shaft 46d through the spline connection 118d between the rear clutch 92d and the outer propulsion shaft 46d. The outer propulsion shaft 46d thus drives the front propeller 42d to spin in a direction to assert a rearward thrust and drive the watercraft in reverse.<P><P>As common to all of the embodiments described above, the clutching mechanism of the transmission lies forward of the rear gear so as to reduce the axial length of the transmission. This configuration thus provides more space within the lower unit behind the transmission. The increased flow area behind the transmission at the transition of the exhaust discharge duct within the lower unit to the exhaust discharge passage formed through the propellers allows for a smoother discharge of exhaust gases from the engine. The increase flow area also increases the capacity of the exhaust system of the outboard motor to accommodate larger engines.<P><P>The present transmission design also drives the front propeller, rather than the rear propeller, when operated under a reverse drive condition. As noted above, the thrust stream from the front propeller is not blocked by another propeller as with prior designs. The efficiency of the propulsion device when operated in reverse thus is improved.<P><P>Although this invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art are also within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by the claims which follow. <P>

<B>Abstract:</B> A foam lined pontoon log in which polyurethane flotation foam is sprayed onto the interior surfaces of the pontoon log and adheres to the interior surfaces of the pontoon log. The flotation foam is built up to a desired thickness, but does not completely fill the interior of the pontoon log. The foam lining of the pontoon log interior surface provides the pontoon log with improved resistance to water leakage through the outer shell of the log, improved structural rigidity, and improved sound dampening. The pontoon log may have a nose cone section at its bow end with splash guard plates. The interior of the nose cone section is filled with flotation foam to a height above the splash guard plates to prevent water ingress associated with pin-sized holes resulting from welding of the splash guard plates to the pontoon log body. <P>
<HR>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<P><P>The present invention pertains to pontoon boats, and more particularly, pertains to pontoon logs for providing flotation support of pontoon boats.<P><P>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<P><P>Pontoon boats, using pairs of pontoon logs as flotation devices for supporting the deck of a pontoon boat, are a popular recreational water item. The deck of a pontoon boat is typically large enough to accommodate several people simultaneously during travel of the pontoon boat across a body of water.<P><P>Traditionally, pontoon logs used to support a pontoon boat deck were a generally hollow enclosure, with the air entrapped in the hollow enclosure providing the requisite buoyancy to maintain the boat afloat. The hollow enclosure is typically formed of a thin sheet of metal. To provide increased structural integrity to the thin sheet of metal forming the hollow enclosure, billets of polystyrene foam have been inserted into the hollow enclosure in a T-shaped configuration, extending the length of the pontoon log.<P><P>While the billets of polystyrene foam are buoyant and therefore provide some degree of flotation in the event of a puncture of the metal forming the hollow enclosure of the pontoon logs, the polystyrene billets do not prevent water from flooding the log interior through the puncture opening. The flooding of the interior of the pontoon log displaces the air therein and thereby significantly reduces the buoyancy of the pontoon log.<P><P>Accordingly, there is a need for a pontoon log having a structural support for its interior which prevents the influx of water into the pontoon log in the event it is punctured. This is desired to assure that the pontoon boat remains steadily afloat in the event of a puncture to one of its pontoon logs.<P><P>U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,898 discloses a pontoon log in which the entire interior of the pontoon log is completely filled in with flotation foam. While this construction provides the desired protection against influx of water into the pontoon log interior in the event of a puncture, this construction suffers several shortcomings. Principally, the quantity of flotation foam required to completely fill the pontoon log interior adds considerable expense to the pontoon logs. Additionally, the large volume of foam required to completely fill the pontoon log interior adds considerable undesirable weight.<P><P>There is a need for a pontoon log having the ability to withstand a puncture to its shell without resulting in flooding of the pontoon log interior which is less expensive and lighter in weight than pontoon logs having their entire interior filled with flotation foam.<P><P>Still further, there is a need for such a pontoon log which also lends itself to welding of a top cover to seal the top of a pontoon log without affecting the watertight integrity of the pontoon log.<P><P>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<P><P>In accordance with the present invention, a pontoon log is provided in which a layer of flotation foam is applied to the interior surface of the shell of the pontoon log. The layer of flotation foam does not completely fill in the main body portion of the pontoon log, but rather is of a generally uniform thickness inwardly from the pontoon log wall.<P><P>The layer of flotation foam is built up to the desired thickness, with the initial application of foam adhering to the interior wall of the pontoon log and subsequently applied foam adhering to the previously-applied foam. Since, in accordance with the present invention, the foam all adheres directly to the interior surface of the pontoon log, the flotation foam serves as a sealant to prevent leakage of water into the pontoon log interior in the event of a rupture of the pontoon log. The layer of flotation foam also provides the desired added structural integrity or stiffening of the pontoon log. In accordance with the pontoon log structure of the present invention, these advantageous characteristics are provided in a pontoon log which is considerably less expensive and which weighs less than prior pontoon logs.<P><P>The pontoon log of the present invention lends itself to use with any of a wide variety of differently-shaped pontoon logs. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the pontoon log is generally U-shaped, having an open upper end. The open upper end of the pontoon log is sealed by welding a top cover sheet over the open upper end of the pontoon log. The upper end of the sealed pontoon log has a flange which is fastened to structural members on the underside of a deck to form the completed pontoon boat, such as by bolting the flange of the pontoon log to the underside of a deck. In this illustrative and preferred embodiment, the flotation foam terminates approximately two inches from the upper end of the U-shaped shell. Thereby, the flotation foam is not exposed to the heat associated with welding of the top cover to the pontoon log. Also, with pontoon logs of the type having a splash guard, the flotation foam is applied to the pontoon log interior to a height above the splash guard, whereby the flotation foam blocks the entry of water into the pontoon log interior in the event of pinholes created during welding of the splash guard to the pontoon log body. <P>

<B>Abstract:</B> Stern drive for boats, including a drive shaft housing rotatably journalled in a pivotal fork-shaped support bracket. Trim cylinders between a carrier on the boat transom and the support bracket, and steering cylinders between the support bracket and a cavitation plate on the drive shaft housing having engagement locations on the bracket, are situated in close proximity to each other. <P>
<HR>
TECHNICAL FIELD<P><P>The present invention relates to a marine propulsion arrangement comprising a carrier which is intended to be affixed to a boat transom and a propeller drive shaft housing which is carried by a fork-shaped support bracket, shanks of which bracket are journalled to the carrier to permit pivotal movement of the support bracket about a pivot axis extending transversely to the drive shaft housing, said pivotal movement being effected by first pressure-responsive manoeuvring means, the drive shaft housing being journalled for pivotal movement relative to the support bracket about a substantially vertically disposed steering axis.<P><P>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<P><P>Marine propulsion arrangements as described above come chiefly in two types, i.e. purely outboard motors in which the engine is rigidly connected to the upper end of the propeller drive shaft housing, and so-called stern drive installations in which a stern drive unit outboard of the transom is connected to a motor located inboard of the transom. In the first-mentioned type, the carrier is usually in the form of a clamp arrangement which clamps over an edge of the transom. The motor and drive shaft housing are carried by the fork-shaped support bracket. In the second type, the carrier is normally in the form of an attachment plate or frame which is mounted in an opening in the transom and to which the fork-shaped support bracket is pivotally journalled to impart pivotal movement to the drive shaft housing relative to the transom.<P><P>Particularly in stern drive installations, pivotal displacement of the drive shaft housing for steering purposes is achieved by rotation of a steering spindle to which a steering arm is affixed. The spindle is nonrotatably attached to the drive shaft housing and journalled in the support bracket. By means of a push-pull cable connected directly to the steering arm, or a hydraulic servo-unit, rotation of the steering wheel of the boat effects displacement of the steering arm, with consequential rotation of the steering spindle and displacement of the drive shaft housing relative to the transom. Due to the relatively short steering arm, in this type of construction high steering forces are required, particularly at high engine power levels, thereby leading to high stresses. The system must therefore be overdimensioned to prevent deflections and wear from becoming unacceptable.<P><P>In a known arrangement in which longer steering arms are employed in order to reduce the steering forces, use is made of a pair of hydraulic cylinders which are connected to the boat transom and regions of the propeller drive shaft housing at a distance from the steering spindle. Such an arrangement does however suffer from certain problems. The steering arrangement is not fully integrated in the propeller drive unit since one end of each hydraulic cylinder must be attached to the transom. The installation is therefore dependent on the form of the transom and the location of other possible components mounted thereon. The choice of attachment points on the transom is restricted since these should lie along the pivot axis for the trim displacement of the drive unit.<P><P>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<P><P>It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide a marine propulsion arrangement of the type according to the preamble of claim 1 which comprises integrated hydraulic cylinders which provide an effectively longer steering arm and which do not need to be attached to the transom. In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide a propulsion arrangement which permits the transmission of very large steering forces to its support bracket which is attached to the transom without the need for any significant modifications to existing components.<P><P>This object is achieved in accordance with the present invention by means of second pressure-responsive manoeuvring means being connected between the fork-shaped support bracket and the propeller drive shaft housing for effecting pivotal movement of the drive shaft housing about the steering axis.<P><P>In a preferred embodiment, such an arrangement permits the first and second pressure-responsive manoeuvring means to be attached to the support bracket at points positioned closely to each other.<P><P>A propulsion arrangement of this type does not require any special attachment of steering system components to the boat transom. The connection of the steering cylinders to the shanks of the support bracket eliminates the dependence on the trim axis location, whereby the location of the steering cylinder arrangement close to the attachment points of the trim cylinders results in the smallest possible bending moment being induced by the steering forces on the support bracket. <P>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<P><P>The invention will be described in greater detail in the following by way of example only and with reference to the attached drawing which shows a schematic elevational view of an embodiment of a stern drive unit according to the invention. <P>
BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<P><P>A stern drive unit of Aquamatic.RTM. type is shown in the drawing and comprises a carrier or frame 2 which is intended to be mounted on a transom and sealed around its edges in an opening in the transom (not shown). The drive unit includes a drive shaft housing 3 which is pivotally carried in a fork-shaped support bracket 4 via a spindle 5, the central axis 6 of which constitutes the steering axis of the drive unit. At its upper region, the support bracket is journalled to the carrier 2 to permit pivotal movement about a horizontal pivot axis 7. At its lower region, the support bracket engages with a pair of piston-cylinder units 8 arranged symmetrically about the axis 5 (only one unit is shown in the drawing). In the illustrated embodiment, the respective conrods 9 of the units 8 are pivotally connected to the support bracket 4 via a pin 10 in a through-hole 11 in each shank of the bracket, whilst each hydraulic cylinder 12 is pivotally connected to the carrier 2 via a pin 13. The piston-cylinder units 8 serve as so-called trim and tilt cylinders by means of which the angle of the drive shaft housing 3 can be trimmed when the boat is in motion and lifted out of the water when the boat is stationary.<P><P>For a more detailed description of the drive shaft housing 3 and its suspension, reference is made to Swedish patent application no. 8305060-9, which also illustrates an embodiment in which the trim and tilt cylinders are removable from the fork-shaped support bracket. Such an embodiment can provide an alternative to the above-described journalling via a pin 10 in a through-hole 11.<P><P>According to the invention, instead of using a steering arm having a single i inboard-mounted steering cylinder, two hydraulic cylinder units 20 symmetrically arranged with respect to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the drive unit are pivotally connected to the lower end of each shank 21 of the support bracket 4 and to the cavitation plate 22 of the drive unit. In the shown embodiment, the cylinder 23 of each unit 20 is connected to its respective bracket shank 21 via a pivot pin 24, whilst the conrod 25 is connected to an attachment 26 on the cavitation plate via a pivot pin 27.<P><P>The cylinder units 20 serve as steering cylinders and are supplied with hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic pump (not shown) controlled by a steering wheel in such a manner that when a certain volume is supplied to the shown cylinder 23, a corresponding volume is drained from the not-shown opposite cylinder, thereby causing the drive unit to be rotated about the steering axis 6 through an angle corresponding to the volume. Due to the fact that the thrust component F1 of the trim cylinders 8 intersects the thrust component F2 of the steering cylinders 20 at a point P on respective shanks 21, very large forces can be tolerated since the shanks 21 are not subjected to any bending moments.<P><P>Within the scope of the invention and depending of the magnitude of the steering forces and the construction of the drive unit, the shown pair of single-action steering cylinders can be replaced by a double-action cylinder. <P>

<B>Abstract:</B> Propulsion unit for marine vessels with a gear or bearing housing (6) in which a propeller shaft (7) with a surface-breaking propeller (8) is carried. In a horizontal plane the propeller shaft forms an angle (.alpha.) to a guide fin (9) so as to create a resultant force (R) of the pressure force (P) of the propeller and the side force (S), with the resultant force being aligned with the longitudinal direction (C.sub.L) when the vessel is travelling straight ahead. <P>
<HR>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<P><P>The present invention relates to a propulsion unit for marine vessels, the unit comprising a housing connected to the hull of the vessel and the housing incorporating a propeller shaft provided with a surface-breaking propeller.<P><P>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<P><P>Until now, known propulsion units of this type, whether they be purely outboard motors or so called inboard propulsion units with totally submerged or surface-breaking propellers, have had propeller shafts which, when the boat is travelling straight ahead, have been aligned with the longitudinal extension of the boat. In other words, the propeller shaft has always been parallel to the usual steer fin on outboard motors and inboard propulsion units.<P><P>When powered by surface-breaking propellers, water is accelerated both in the axial direction and sideways, whereby the sideways forces generated by the sideways acceleration in previously known propulsion units has solely resulted in pure losses of kinetic energy, which is comparable with the rotation of the slip stream in conventional propellers. The resultant of the propeller pressure force in the longitudinal direction and the sideways force can, when large sideways forces are present, deviate so much from the longitudinal direction that it has been necessary to compensate for this by setting the rudder of the vessel (with fixed drive units), or the entire propulsion unit (with simple steerable units), at an angle, with consequential increase in the flow resistance. In twin installations, the counter-rotating propellers do not require any oblique setting of the propulsion unit or rudder since the side forces act in opposite direction and do not generate any steering forces, though the losses remain and the side forces must be taken up in steering components, tie-rods and suspension members.<P><P>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<P><P>It is an object of the present invention to provide a propulsion unit of the previously mentioned type in which the above mentioned losses and the loading of, for example, the tie-rod arrangements and associated components can be eliminated.<P><P>This is achieved in accordance with the present invention in a manner such that, in the horizontal plane, the propeller shaft forms an angle to a vertical plane of symmetry of a flow-control body connected to, or integral with, said housing, said body being intended to be aligned with the longitudinal extension of the vessel when the vessel is travelling in a straight line. With steerable propulsion units having a steer fin, the propeller shaft is angled primarily with respect to the steer fin so that the fin is aligned with the longitudinal extension of the vessel when the propeller shaft is obliquely set, so that the resultant of the propeller pressure force and the propeller side force will act essentially in the longitudinal direction.<P><P>In a preferred embodiment of the propulsion unit according to the invention, two oppositely rotating propeller shafts are located in the housing in a common, substantially horizontal plane. The shafts form an included angle which is bisected by a steer fin. <P>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<P><P>The invention will be described in greater detail in the following with reference to the embodiments shown in the attached drawings in which<P><P>FIGS. 1 to 5 show schematic plan-views of the hull of a vessel with five theoretical alternative embodiments for a drive arrangement,<P><P>FIGS. 6-8 show schematic elevational views of a steerable propeller drive unit having three alternative angular drive arrangements,<P><P>FIG. 9 is a schematic elevational view of a fixed propeller drive unit with a straight distribution gear arrangement,<P><P>FIG. 10 is an elevational view of a propulsion unit in the form of an outboard motor and<P><P>FIG. 11 is a schematic elevational view of a steerable propulsion unit having four propellers. <P>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<P><P>In FIGS. 1-5, reference numeral 1 denotes a boathull, numerals 2 and 3 denote inboard-mounted engines and numerals 4 and 5 denote steerable outboard drive units, for example of an Aquamatic.RTM.-type (FIGS. 1-3) and Arneson.RTM.-type (FIGS. 4 and 5). Both the engine and the drive installations are of a known type and thus will not be described here in greater detail.<P><P>FIG. 1 shows a drive installation with an engine 2 and an outboard propulsion unit 4 having a gear housing 6 in which a horizontal propeller shaft 7 is rotatably carried. The shaft 7 carries a surface-breaking propeller 8 and is driven by a vertical shaft via an angular gear arrangement (not shown) in the gear housing. The propeller shaft 7 rotates clockwise (seen from astern), whereby the propeller generates a pressure force P and a side force S. The gear housing 6, and consequently also the propeller shaft 7, forms an angle .alpha. to the longitudinal centerline C.sub.L of the boathull 1 and a vertical steer fin 9 arranged on the underside of the gear housing 6. The angle .alpha. is so chosen that the resultant R of the propeller pressure force and the side force is at least substantially parallel to the longitudinal centerline C.sub.L and the guide fin 9 at the centre point of the propeller.<P><P>A boat hull is shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 having twin motors 2, 3 and twin outboard propulsion units 4, 5, the propellers 8 of which rotate in opposite directions. In FIG. 2 the starboard propeller rotates clockwise and the port propeller anti-clockwise (seen from astern). In FIG. 3 the directions of rotation are reversed. Components corresponding to those in FIG. 1 have the same figure reference numerals in FIGS. 2 and 3 as in FIG. 1.<P><P>FIG. 4 shows a propeller drive unit 4 of the Arneson.RTM.-type which presents a bearing support housing 16 in which a propeller shaft 7 with a surface-breaking propeller 8 is rotatably journalled. The bearing support housing 16 is oriented in the same manner as the above-described gear housing 6, i.e. it forms an angle .alpha. to a steer fin 9. The housing 16 is pivotal by means of a hydraulic cylinder 17. The drive from the engine 3 is transmitted to the propeller shaft 7 via a universal joint 18. In FIG. 5 the boat hull is provided with twin engines 2,3 and drive units 4,5. The propellers 8 rotate in opposite directions, corresponding to the installation illustrated in FIG. 3.<P><P>FIGS. 6-8 show a propeller drive unit of the Aquamatic.RTM.-type in a further developed embodiment with twin propeller shafts 7a and 7b supported in a gear housing 26, with each propeller shaft carrying a surface breaking propeller 8. Each shaft 7a, 7b forms an angle .alpha. to a guide fin 9 which, when the boat is travelling straight ahead, is parallel to the longitudinal direction. The propeller shafts 7a, 7b are driven by a conventional upper angular gear arrangement 20 connected to an engine 4 or 5, the angular gear arrangement including a reverse gear mechanism (not shown) and a lower distribution gear arrangement 21.<P><P>In FIG. 6, the distribution gear arrangement 21 comprises a vertical shaft 22 with a lower conical gear wheel 23 meshing with a conical gear wheel 24 and 25 respectively on each of the propeller shafts 7a and 7b. The one propeller shaft 7a is somewhat shorter than the other 7b. The distribution gear arrangement 21 is in the form of a hypoid gear arrangement with spiral-cut gear wheels, whereby the rotational axis of the vertical shaft 22 is sidewardly displaced in relation to the rotational axis of the propeller shafts 7a, 7b, i.e. there is no common intersection point in a single plane. In this manner an optimally compact distribution gear arrangement is obtained, which implies that the volume of the gear housing 26 and thereby its flow resistance is the least possible.<P><P>Two alternative compact embodiments of the lower distribution gear arrangement 21 are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. In the first, the propeller shaft 7a is driven via a second gear wheel 27 on the shaft 7b, which meshes with the gear wheel 24 on the shaft 6a. In the second, the gear wheel 24 meshes with a gear wheel 28 on a second vertical shaft 29 which, via two gear wheels 30, 31, is driven by the first shaft 22. These distribution gears are also formed as hypoid gears.<P><P>A propeller drive unit 40 with a gear housing 46 accommodating a distribution gear arrangement 41 is shown in FIG. 9 and is of the same type as that in FIG. 7, though with the difference that the primary shaft 42 from the engine is horizontal. The gear wheels in the arrangement 41 have the same reference numerals as in FIG. 7. The drive unit 40 can be fixed or steerable. In the latter case, a universal joint (not shown) is required to transmit the power from the engine to the propulsion unit 40.<P><P>The invention can of course also be applied to purely outboard motors, as indicated by dashed lines in FIGS. 1-3, and as is shown in FIG. 10, where the components corresponding to those in FIG. 6 maintain the same reference numerals as in FIG. 6.<P><P>Finally, an embodiment is shown in FIG. 11 having four propellers. The propulsion unit corresponds to that in FIG. 6, though with the difference that two further propeller shafts 7c, 7d are carried in the housing 26. The shafts 7c, 7d are parallel to the shafts 7a, 7b respectively and are driven by the latter by means of toothed belts or a chain transmission 50, 51 respectively. Such a propulsion unit can have its underside shaped so that it acts as a supporting or trimming tab.<P><P>All of the above described embodiments can be provided with more than one steer fin. When using for example two steer fins, these do not need to lie in exactly a vertical plane, but can be angled in opposite directions relative to the vertical plane.<P><P>In the above described embodiment, a steer fin 9 has been presented as an example of a &quotdflow-control body&quote, with respect to whose plane of symmetry the propeller shaft or shafts are obliquely arranged. The expression &quotoflow-control body&quoth in the appended claims does of course also include other parts of the gear housing of the propulsion unit, a support arm, etc., which has a vertical plane of symmetry which is intended to be aligned with the longitudinal direction of the boat hull when travelling in a straight line. <P>

<B>Abstract:</B> A method of molding a boat hull including a screw strip using the resin transfer molding process, the method comprising the steps of wrapping the screw strip with reinforcement, fabricating a rigid mold having a boat-defining surface including a screw strip receiving recess, applying gel coat to the boat-defining surface in a layer including a gel coated recess, positioning reinforcement having interstices along the gel coat layer and with an upper part of the reinforcement extending into the gel coated recess, locating the reinforcement wrapped screw strip in the gel coated recess to capture the upper part of the reinforcement between the mold and the reinforcement wrapped screw strip, and burying the reinforcement and filling the interstices thereof with a resinous layer to produce the boat hull. <P>
<HR>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<P><P>The invention relates generally to the resin transfer molding process. More particularly, the invention relates to forming the gunwale area of a boat hull. As is known, it is common practice to provide the gunwale of a boat with a screw strip which serves as a bumper and which also affords the opportunity of attachment thereto of a decorative stripping around the boat gunwale.<P><P>Still more particularly, the invention relates to a further development of the subject matter disclosed in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 220,110, filed Mar. 30, 1994 and assigned to the assignee of this application now U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,165.<P><P>In the past, in the conventional layup or sprayup process, gel coat was applied or sprayed on the mold in such manner as to cover or overlay the mold flange. During the build up of the laminate, extra resin and fiber glass material built up on the mold flange. When the laminate was as thick as desired, plywood screw strips were clamped in the wet resin along the gunwale. Later, after curing of the resin, the material on the flange was used to help remove the boat hull from the mold. Subsequently, this overhanging material was cut off with a diamond saw and the edge finished by grinding with a disk sander.<P><P>In the usual practice for forming the gunwale area of a boat hull when using the resin transfer process, the flange area of the mold is masked off and gel coat is then applied. The masking on the mold flange is then removed. After removal of such masking, the mold flange provides a good flat surface for the vacuum plenum to seal against. Dry reinforcement material is then loaded so that the upper edge of the reinforcement material is flush with the flange or top of the mold along the gunwale. The vacuum bag is then put in place, a vacuum is drawn to locate the bag in adjacent relation to the mold, and resin is pumped into the space between the mold and the vacuum bag.<P><P>This method suffers from the difficulty that the dry material has a tendency to slide down as the bag is drawn into place. This leads to a thin condition in the gunwale area of the boat hull, and consequently, the hull/deck joint could be weakened. In addition, the thin gunwale is very prone to cracking when removing the boat hull from the mold with the result that reworking in the mold is often required. A screw strip can then be added to the gunwale in the same manner as in the conventional layup process. Attachment of the screw strip in this manner suffers from the absence of something reliable to grab onto or pull on to facilitate removal from the mold of the boat hull because the bond between the screw strip and the mold is insufficient to withstand the shear stress required to pull the boat hull from the mold.<P><P>Attention is directed to the following U.S. Pat. Nos.<P><P>4,544,518-Issued Oct. 1, 1985<P><P>5,059,377-Issued Oct. 22, 1991<P><P>5,080,850-Issued Jan. 14, 1992<P><P>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<P><P>The invention provides a method of molding a boat hull including a screw strip using the resin transfer molding process, which method comprises the steps of wrapping the screw strip with reinforcement, fabricating a rigid mold having a boat-defining surface including a screw strip receiving recess, applying gel coat to the boat-defining surface in a layer including a gel coated recess, positioning reinforcement having interstices along the gel coat layer and with an upper part of the reinforcement extending into the gel coated recess, locating the reinforcement wrapped screw strip in the gel coated recess to capture the upper part of the reinforcement between the mold and the reinforcement wrapped screw strip, and burying the reinforcement and filling the interstices thereof with a resinous layer to produce the boat hull.<P><P>The invention also provides a method of molding a boat hull including a screw strip using the resin transfer molding process, which method comprises the steps of wrapping the screw strip with reinforcement, fabricating a rigid mold having a boat-defining surface including a screw strip receiving recess and a flange area extending from the recess, masking off a portion of the flange area with a mask, applying gel coat to the boat-defining surface to provide a gel coat layer with a gel coated recess, removing the mask from the flange, positioning in the mold reinforcement with an upper part thereof extending into the gel coated recess, locating the reinforcement wrapped screw strip in the gel coated recess, to capture the upper part of the reinforcement between the gel coat layer and the reinforcement wrapped screw strip, sealingly attaching a vacuum bag to the flange area so as to define between the vacuum bag and the gel coat layer a space, applying vacuum to the space between the vacuum bag and the mold, supplying resin into the space between the vacuum bag and the mold during the application of vacuum, curing the resin to produce said boat hull, and removing the boat hull from the mold by engaging the area of the screw strip to apply boat hull withdrawing force to the boat hull.<P><P>The invention also provides a boat hull fabricated by the resin transfer process and comprising a reinforced plastic hull member having an upper periphery with a screw strip buried therein.<P><P>The invention also provides a boat hull comprising a reinforced plastic hull member including an outer gel coat layer having an upper periphery, and a screw strip recess at said upper periphery, a layer of reinforcing material having therein interstices and extending along said gel coat layer and including an upper portion extending into said screw strip recess, a screw strip extending in said recess and engaging said upper portion of said reinforcing layer to capture said upper portion between said screw strip and said gel coat layer, and an inner resinous layer which buries said screw strip and said layer of reinforcing material and fills the interstices thereof.<P><P>Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description, claims and drawings. <P>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<P><P>FIG. 1 is a fragmentary view of a partially constructed boat hull which embodies various of the features of the invention and which is constructed in accordance with the method of the invention.<P><P>FIG. 2 is a view which is similar to FIG. 1 and which illustrates another stage in the boat building process of the invention.<P><P>FIG. 3 is a view which is similar to FIG. 1 and which illustrates another further stage in the boat building process of the invention.<P><P>FIG. 4 is a view which is similar to FIG. 1 and which illustrates another further stage in the boat building process of the invention.<P><P>FIG. 5 is a view which is similar to FIG. 1 and which illustrates a completed boat hull which has been constructed in accordance with the method of the invention. <P>
Before one embodiment of the invention is explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the construction and the arrangements of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<P><P>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<P><P>Illustrated in FIG. 1 of the drawings is a rigid female mold 11 which can be constructed in any suitable fashion and which is employed to produce a molded boat hull or hull member 12 by the resin transfer process. The mold 11 comprises an inner surface 13 including a boat hull defining portion 15, and a screw strip recessed portion 17 which extends from the upper outer periphery of the boat hull defining portion 15. The mold 11 also includes a flange or flange area or surface portion 19 which extends outwardly from the top of the screw strip recessed portion 17 and which includes an inner part 21 adjacent the screw strip recessed portion 17 and an outer part 23 extending outwardly from the inner part 21. The upper periphery of the inner surface 13 of the female mold 11 constitutes a gunwale area.<P><P>Also illustrated in FIG. 1 is a screw strip 31 which is preferably fabricated from wood or other suitable material having suitable cross-sectional dimensions.<P><P>In accordance with the process of the invention, the screw strip 31 is prepared by being cut to length and loaded or pre-wrapped with dry reinforcement material 33, such as fiber glass which, as is known, defines a plurality of interstices. More specifically, the screw strip 31 is preferably completely wrapped in at least one layer of dry reinforcement material 33. If desired, the reinforcing material 33 can be stapled or otherwise fastened to the screw strip 31.<P><P>Also in accordance with the process of the invention, and separately from preparation of the screw strip 31, a release agent is applied to the inner surface 13 of the female mold and to the inner part 21 of the flange 19, and a mask 35 is applied to the outer part 23 of the flange area or surface portion 19. Thereafter, a coat or layer 37 of gel coat is applied to the boat hull defining portion 15 and the recessed portion 17 of the inner surface 13 of the female mold 11 and to the adjacent inner part 21 of the flange area or surface portion 19. The gel coat layer 37 includes, in the area of the screw strip recess portion 17, a gel coated recess. After application of the gel coat layer 37, the mask 35 can be removed.<P><P>Thereafter a layer 41 of dry reinforcing material 41, such as fiber glass which defines a plurality of interstices, is laid upon the gel coat layer 37 with a portion 43 of such dry reinforcing material extending into the screw strip recessed portion 17. Alternatively, if desired, an unwrapped screw strip can be placed in the gel coated recessed portion 17, wrapped with extra material of the reinforcement portion 43, and stapled as already described.<P><P>Thereafter, the screw strip 31, prepared as before described, is placed in the gel coated screw strip recessed portion 17 so as to hold or anchor the portion 43 of the layer of dry reinforcing material which was laid over the gel coat layer 37 on the boat hull define portion 15 of the inner surface 13 of the female mold 11. As a consequence, the layer 41 of reinforcing material will not slide down and away from the upper periphery or gunwale area of the inner surface 13 of the female mold 11. In this regard, friction between the screw strip 31 and the upper portion 43 of the layer 41 of dry reinforcing material, or the fasteners holding the layer(s) of dry reinforcement material 33 on the screw strip 31 will prevent the dry reinforcing material layer 41 from being pulled out of position when the screw strip 31 is captured by the application of the vacuum bag and resin still to be described. Also as a consequence, the layer 41 of reinforcing material will not rest on the inner part 21 of the flange 19 and will not otherwise result in a reinforced layer which must be trimmed off using a diamond saw or other suitable tool after the application of resin and demolding of the part still to be described.<P><P>Thereafter, as indicated in FIG. 3, a vacuum bag 51 which is preferably fabricated from silicone and suitably shaped, and which has an outer peripheral portion 53, is placed in the female mold 11 with the peripheral portion 53 located on the inner part 21 of the flange portion 19 of the inner surface 13 of the female mold 11.<P><P>Thereafter, a seal 59 is provided between the peripheral portion 53 of the vacuum bag 51 and the flange portion 19 of the female mold 11. Any suitable seal known in the art can be employed. In the disclosed construction, a first endless sealing member or seal 61 extends in engagement with and around the outer peripheral portion 53 of the vacuum bag 51, and a second endless sealing member or seal 63 extends, in outwardly spaced relation to the first sealing member 61, in engagement with and around the outer part 23 of the flange portion 19 of the female mold 11. A plate 65 is then placed over the sealing members 61 and 63 and pressure is applied so as to insure that the vacuum bag 51 is tightly sealed to the inner part 21 of the flange area or portion 19. Preferably, the seals or sealing members 61 and 63 are pre-bonded to the plate 65.<P><P>Thereafter, vacuum is applied through a fitting 71 to the space between the female mold 11 and the vacuum bag 51 to draw the vacuum bag 51 into the female mold 11 and into closely adjacent relation to the inner surface 13. After the vacuum bag 51 is located in closely adjacent relation to the layer 41 of reinforcing material and, while the vacuum is maintained, resin is pumped through a fitting 75 into the space between the gel coat layer 37 and the vacuum bag 51, to provide a layer 77 of resin filling the space between the vacuum bag and the gel coat layer 37 so as thereby to bury the layer 41 of reinforcing material and to fill the interstices of the reinforcing material.<P><P>Thereafter, and subsequent to curing of the resin to produce the molded boat hull 12, the seal 59 is broken and removed, the vacuum bag 51 is withdrawn from the boat hull 12, and the molded boat hull or member 12 is removed from the female mold 11 to enable reuse of the female mold 11 and the vacuum bag 51 in another cycle. In the removal process, and as shown in FIG. 4, a hook-like member 81 can be engaged with the under side portion of the boat hull or member 12 in the area of the screw strip 31 to apply force to lift the boat hull or hull member 12 from the mold 11.<P><P>As a consequence of the process just described, there is provided, as shown in FIG. 5, a reinforced plastic boat hull or hull member 12 having an upper periphery with a screw strip 31 buried therein, i. e., captured within the cured resin. More particularly, there is provided a reinforced plastic boat hull or hull member 12 including an outer gel coat layer 37 having an upper periphery with a gel coated screw strip recess therein. The boat hull or hull member 12 also includes a layer 41 of reinforcing material having therein interstices and extending along the gel coat layer 37 and including an upper portion 43 extending into the gel coated screw strip recess. In addition, the boat hull or hull member 12 includes a screw strip 31 extending in the gel coated recess and engaging the upper portion 43 of the reinforcing layer 41 to capture the upper portion 43 between the screw strip 31 and the gel coat layer 37, and an inner layer 77 of resin which buries the screw strip 31 and the layer 41 of reinforcing material and fills the interstices thereof.<P><P>Also as a consequence of the process just described, the screw strip 31 is completely enclosed or captured or buried in the molded boat hull or hull member 12 and becomes an integral part of the molded boat hull or hull member 12. Rotting of the prior screw strips, as commonly occurred in the past, is thereby substantially eliminated. In addition, because the screw strip 31 is now an integral part of the molded boat hull 12, the screw strip 31 can be used to hook under or pull on when removing or demolding the molded boat hull 12 from the female mold 11. In further addition, the previously occurring problem of slippage of the dry reinforcing material away from the gunwale area and undesirable collection thereof in areas toward the bottom of the mold is avoided. Trimming of the gunwale is also reduced or substantially eliminated by use of the disclosed process.<P><P>Another advantage of the invention is the absence of material on the outer part 23 of the flange 19 and the consequent elimination of the prior need to employ a diamond saw or other suitable tool to remove or trim such material.<P><P>While the invention disclosed herein has particular applicability to boat hulls, the invention can also be used in connection with the manufacture of a wide variety of other articles.<P><P>Various of the features of the invention are set forth in the following claims. <P>
<A NAME="CLAIM"></A>
<B>Claim:</B> I claim:<P><P>1. A resin transfer molding method for molding a boat hull including a screw strip, said method comprising the steps of wrapping the screw strip with reinforcement, fabricating a rigid mold having a boat-defining surface including a screw strip receiving recess, applying gel coat to the boat-defining surface in a layer including a gel coated recess, positioning reinforcement having interstices along the gel coat layer and with an upper part of the reinforcement extending into the gel coated recess, locating the reinforcement wrapped screw strip in the gel coated recess to capture the upper part of the reinforcement between the mold and the reinforcement wrapped screw strip, and burying the reinforcement and filling the interstices thereof with a resinous layer to produce said boat hull.<P><P>2. A method in accordance with claim 1 wherein said burying and filling step includes sealingly attaching a vacuum bag to the mold so as to define between the vacuum bag and the gel coat layer a boat hull-defining space, applying vacuum to the boat hull defining space between the vacuum bag and the mold, and supplying resin into the boat hull-defining space between the vacuum bag and the mold during the application of vacuum to bury the reinforcement and fill the interstices thereof and to produce said boat hull.<P><P>3. A method in accordance with claim 1 and further including the additional step of removing the boat hull from the mold by engaging the area of the screw strip to apply boat hull withdrawing force to the boat hull.<P><P>4. A resin transfer molding method for molding a boat hull including a screw strip, said method comprising the steps of wrapping the screw strip with reinforcement, fabricating a rigid mold having a boat-defining surface including a screw strip receiving recess and a flange area extending from the recess, masking off a portion of the flange area with a mask, applying gel coat to the boat-defining surface to provide a gel coat layer with a gel coated recess, removing the mask from the flange, positioning in the mold reinforcement with an upper part thereof extending into the gel coated recess, locating the reinforcement wrapped screw strip in the gel coated recess, to capture the upper part of the reinforcement between the gel coat layer and the reinforcement wrapped screw strip, sealingly attaching a vacuum bag to the flange area so as to define between the vacuum bag and the gel coat layer a space, applying vacuum to the space between the vacuum bag and the mold, supplying resin into the space between the vacuum bag and the mold during the application of vacuum, curing the resin to produce said boat hull, and removing the boat hull from the mold by engaging the area of the screw strip to apply boat hull withdrawing force to the boat hull.<P><P>5. A boat hull comprising a reinforced plastic hull member including an outer gel coat layer having an upper periphery, and a screw strip recess at said upper periphery, a layer of reinforcing material having therein interstices and extending along said gel coat layer and including an upper portion extending into said screw strip recess, a screw strip extending in said recess and engaging said upper portion of said reinforcing layer to capture said upper portion between said screw strip and said gel coat layer, and an inner resinous layer which buries said screw strip and said layer of reinforcing material and fills the interstices thereof.<P><P>6. A boat hull comprising a reinforced plastic hull member including an outer gel coat layer having a screw strip recess, a layer of reinforcing material having therein interstices and extending along said gel coat layer and including a portion extending into said screw strip recess, a screw strip extending in said recess and engaging said portion of said reinforcing layer to capture said portion between said screw strip and said gel coat layer, and a resinous layer which buries said screw strip and said layer of reinforcing material and fills the interstices thereof.<P><P>7. A boat hull comprising a reinforced plastic hull member including an outer gel coat layer having a screw strip recess, reinforcing material having therein interstices and extending along said gel coat layer in said screw strip recess, a screw strip extending in said recess and engaging said reinforcing material to capture said reinforcing material between said screw strip and said gel coat layer, and a resinous layer which buries said screw strip and said reinforcing material and fills the interstices thereof.<P><P>8.

<P>A transmission for a counter-rotating propeller system of a watercraft
 outboard drive includes a reduced friction coupling between the inner and
 outer shafts which permits transfer of the thrust loading on the inner
 shaft to the outer shaft under a reverse drive condition. The inner and
 outer shafts include opposing transverse surfaces which are separated by a
 pair of anti-friction washers. The washers allow the shafts to rotate in
 opposite directions with minimum friction, while allowing the opposing
 surfaces to act on each other through the washers to transfer the thrust
 loading when the watercraft is driven in reverse.

<P>A marine propulsion system for use as a driving means and a progressive
 hull resistance characteristic changing means is herein described. The
 drive can develop a separation of the jet water stream flow field from the
 vessel hull, as well as separate the supporting ocean water flow field
 from the hull. The jet system air cavity doors also act as trim planes and
 hull planing (hydrodynamic) surface structures, and as thrust vector
 application control valves (in this capacity, they have the capacity to
 reduce drag . . . and make a vessel go faster, as well as increase it . .
 . by varying Coanda effect and hull plate fluid friction). The unit can be
 used in conjunction with an automated controlling device (such as a
 computerized control linked to servo motors, feedback potentiometers, and
 linkages) wherein a specific power-up and power-down sequence can be
 followed in response to sensor information. It can allow the placement of
 a jet pump lower in the vessel, thus reducing suction lift and wasted
 hydraulic head pressure losses to the nozzle point.

<title>Patent 5,518,060 Lost Foam Casting Pattern Production</A></title>
</head>
<h3><center>U.S. Patent 5,518,060</center></h3><p>

<HR>
<H3>
Method of producing polymeric patterns for use in evaporable foam casting
(Assignee -- Brunswick Corporation)
</H3>

Patent Number: 5518060</P>

Inventor(s): Cleary, Terrance M.Bilderback, Thomas E.</P>

Abstract: A method of producing polymeric foam
patterns for use in evaporable foam casting. A positive three-dimensional model
of the metal part to be cast is made by a layered prototyping process in which
layers of sheet material are bonded in superimposed relation and the contour of
the part to be cast is cut into each layer as it is applied to preceding layers
to provide the model. A metal, such as copper, is then deposited on the working
surface of the model to provide a rigid self-supporting shell having a surface
which is the negative image of the part to be cast. The shell, after separation
from the model, is then mounted in a die casting mold with the negative surface
bordering a die cavity. Beads of a polymeric material, such as polystyrene, are
introduced into the die cavity and heated to fuse the beads and provide a foam
pattern which is identical in configuration to the metal part to be ultimately
cast.</P>
<P>
Ex Claim Text: A method of producing a polymeric foam pattern for use in a lost
foam casting process, comprising the steps of producing a three-dimensional
model composed of a plurality of superimposed bonded layers of a material and
having a first surface conforming to a portion of the configuration of the
pattern to be produced, applying a layer of a metal selected from the group
consisting of copper, silver and nickel by electro-chemical deposition to said
first surface to produce a rigid self-supporting metal shell having a second
surface that is a negative image of said portion of the pattern, separating the
shell from the model, assembling the shell as a die in a die assembly with said
second surface bordering a die cavity, and introducing beads of a polymeric
material into said die cavity to produce a polymeric foam pattern. into said die
cavity to produce a polymeric foam pattern. into said die cavity to produce a
polymeric foam pattern.</P>

<h4><b>New Loud Speaker Technology</b></h4><p>

The December 2, 1996 issue of Business Week pages 108-109 has an article titled, "The Cookie -Size Concert Hall". It describes a new technology that may soon replace loud speakers. The units are similar to Piezoelectric quartz crystals  that keep time in watches. "This radical departure in sound reproduction, called HyperSonic Sound could be the biggest breakthrough since modern speakers were conceived in 1925. Its inventor, Elwood G. "Woody" Norris, has already filed for three patents and has an additional five applications in the works. "<p>

While normal speakers use electronic signals to vibrate a thin diaphragm to create sound waves that ripple through the air, his crystals pulsate thousand of times faster, emitting a pair of ultrasonic waves at frequencies far beyond human - or animal  -  hearing. But when the ultrasound waves interact, they produce a third sonic wave - and it can be heard. The phenomena is called "Tartini tone" after Giuseppe Tartini an 18th century Italian composer who discovered that when two strong tones were struck, a third tone that was of the frequency of the difference of the two tones frequencies was also heard. <p>

The units are very small (described as oreo cookies with crystals on them) and only one unit is required to cover the entire human range of hearing. Because ultrasonic waves travel in tight paths, the crystals can produce startling special effects by projecting sounds to a specific location. The article mentions they are already looking into <b>active noise cancellation applications</b> in the automobile market.<p>

Norris is developing the technology at his, American Technology Corp in Poway CA.<p>

<i>
Here are a few potential marine applications RBBI can envision: "talking gauges" in multiple languages, horns, boat stereo speakers, active noise cancellation of engine noise, marine radio speakers, and sirens for police, rescue, and fireboats. Don't forget active noise cancellation possibilities in your factories.<p>
</i>


<hr>

<h4><b>Neon Glowing Plastic Fibers</b></h4><p>

The December 2, 1996 issue of Business Week page 111 has an article titled, "Cool Threads That make Cool Light." It reports that engineers at Elam Electroluminescent Industries Ltd. in Jerusalem have  created plastic fibers that emit cold light, like neon, in shimmering shades of turquoise, violet, and rose. You can coil them, tie them in knots and even snip pieces off without causing a blink. The property is called electro luminescence . They coat long strands of copper wire with particles of zinc sulfide , then "sputters" a transparent conductive layer onto them. With two AA batteries applied between the coating and the core wire, the particles stay lit as long as 40 hours.<p>

The technology is being marketed in th U.S. by Live Wire Enterprises Inc in Brooklyn and will appear in the upcoming Batman movie and on the Rockefeller Center Christmas displays. Fashion designers could weave the fiber into fabrics to add new sparkle to evening attire.<p>

<i>
We (RBBI) can envision applications of sewing it into PFD's for improved night visibility, a low light level light for night fishermen, maybe even glowing fishing lures, "super nifty" exhibitor party wear (jackets with glowing logos, etc), baseball caps with your logo glowing, and possibly as some sort of signaling device if you can turn it off and on. If the fibers work and are offered at a reasonable cost they will have hundreds of uses.<p></i>

<hr>

<h4><b>Body PC's</b></h4><p>

The November 18, 1996 Wall Street Journal article, <a href="bodypc.htm">"IBM Wants Your Body for a Very Personal PC"</A> describes the developing technology of being able to send computer signals through the human body. A computer in your shoe could exchange information with other people's "shoe computer" when you shake hands. Phone numbers, business cards, and 
ds. Phone numbers, business cards, and schedules and other items could be transmitted. They would be viewed on a monitor later. This obviously also opens up additional communication paths between objects and people. <p> 


There is also a brief story about the Body PC in the December 2, 1996 issue of Business Week on page 111 titled, "Tapping the 'Wet Wire' Within". It says IBM demonstrated the device at the recent Comdex show in Las Vegas. It also reports the device to be the brainchild of Thomas Zimmerman  an IBM researcher at Almaden Research Center in San Jose CA and Neil Gershenfeld a professor in the Media Lab of MIT.

<h4><b>Reducing Effects of Gravity</b></h4><p>

The September 30, 1996 issue of Business Week  page 42, has a story, "Take That Issac Newton". It describes the work done by a researcher in Finland who claims to have found a way to partially negate the effects of gravity by using a spinning disk made of a superconducting ceramic. "The claim has yet to be verified, but it's being taken seriously by NASA and scientist elsewhere." <p>

Eugene E. Podkletnov was doing research on high-temperature superconducting materials at Tampre University of Technology and accidentally discovered the anti-gravity shield. The disk is chilled to -334 F and zapped with an electromagnetic field  that causes it to spin. At around 3000 rpm anything placed above it loses some 2% of its weight. If two disks are stacked on top of each other the loss is 4%. <p>

"A gadget that defies gravity would have profound business implications. Built into cars, trains, and planes it could drastically slash fuel consumption and open new vistas for designing vehicles with little concern for size and weight. And if a stack of 100 disks, each providing a 2% weight loss , can produce a cumulative 200% weight loss, that could launch a spacecraft."<p>

Many people are skeptical. Others around the world are trying to duplicate the work now and the issue is expected to be settled in a few weeks.<p>

For some great <b>additional indepth coverage</b> of this phenomena and Podkletnov see a recent issue of <a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~joi/issue4/joitoc4.html"><b>"Journal of Ideas"</b></A> an online Australian magazine. The issue I have linked to has several great articles about the subject and they are posted in full text with some graphics as well.<p>

<h4><b>Basic Properties of Water</b></h4><p>

Since boating is focused on moving through or pushing , pumping, etc water: how about doing some basic research in the elemental properties of water. It is possible that some unusual characteristic of water could lead to the next paradigm shift in boating. Water is a very unique fluid an it does have quite a few unusual properties that most people are not aware of. Here are some references in this area:<p>


An article on page A20 of the Thursday October 31, 1996 Wall Street Journal in the Leisure and Arts section titled, "The Codex Leicester: Gates Shares Leonardo Treasure" discusses the Codex Leicester. It is a Leonardo da Vinci notebook purchased by Bill Gates in 1994 for $30.8 million. The article discusses Gates loaning the notebook to the American Museum of Natural History. The notebook is 72 pages "crammed edge to edge" with Leonardo's hydraulic sketches and little line drawings of rivers, bridges and dams. The notebook was started when da Vinci was going to write a grand treatise on the motion of water. It is his notes for the work that was never done. With all of his great ideas in other fields their might be something interesting in here. I understand the Codex has been converted to CD-Rom. Has anybody out there seen it?? It might hold 'the key"??? <p>

There have been a few more recent publications referencing the Codex. The 7 November 1996 Wall Street Journal Personal Technology Column described some new CD's and discussed it. The column says the original work is actually written "in mirror image" in Italian. The CD offers a tool called a Codescope that can be held over the text to view it in English. The December 2, 1996 issue of Business Week page 26 has an article titled, "A CD-ROM To Make Leonardo Smile" that also discusses the work and the Codescope.

The product above was developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT). They described it working much like a car wax. It makes water bead up and roll off. "They also say that if applied to a ship's hull, the coating would reduce water friction - resulting in greater speed and increased fuel efficiency."<p>

I've been pondering this concept for some time:  What's stopping any of
the major marine propulsion manufacturers from designing &amp; building a
motor/drive combination that is better suited to pleasure-boating than
what is now available ?  We've all followed the proverbial OB vs. I/O
threads and we've identified the advantages &amp; disadvantages of each.  So
why hasn't Mercury, Volvo, OMC or even Yamaha, (before they left the I/O
market) ever combined the best of both worlds (I/O &amp; OB) into a single
propulsion system.  As an alternative to heavy, iron I/O automotive
engines, wouldn't an aluminum alloy V8, either 2 or 4 stroke, be
advantageous ?  All three of the mfrs have a great deal of experience &amp;
history designing &amp; building aluminum engines.  OMC &amp; Merc (&amp; I'm sure
Yamaha isn't far behind) are offering advanced OB fuel injection, so why
not apply that to a two-stroke aluminum V8 coupled to a Bravo/ King
Cobra/ DPX ?  I see MUCH less weight, more power, smaller &amp; more
attractive packaging &amp; better fuel economy.
	Anyone else have any comments on this ?

	Yeah money does talk.  But have you any idea how many engine/drive sets
MerCruiser sells every year ?  More than you can imagine.  Polaris just
developed &amp; built their own motors which are used in nothing except
their lines of snowmobiles &amp; watercraft.  Mercruiser sales &amp; profits
dwarf Polaris sales &amp; profits, &amp; therefore I think it IS feasible for
them to develop an engine or series of engines for the I/O boating
market.  Not to mention that they could carry a lot of the technology
over from the Mercury division.  The same applies to OMC &amp; Yamaha.
	Good point, but I don't believe it's the reason.

Gimme a 4-5 liter, all aluminum, wet oil sump, direct-port injected, 8
cylinder, 2 stroke, fresh-water cooled, 300 - 400 hp engine coupled to a
alpha/bravo/dp/dpx/cobra outdrive.  It'll be MUCH lighter, have more
horsepower &amp; torque than a comparable 4 stroke, rev like a mother and be
able to sustain those revs (no valvetrain, remember), have less moving
parts &amp; probably get better fuel economy (MUCH lighter)  The motor would
also be considerably smaller, leaving more space for passengers &amp; gear.

I see much higher cost, in a market that isn't particularly sensitive to
fuel economy and compact packaging.  A few years ago, Mercury Marine put
Corvette ZR-1 dohc aluminum V-8s in an offshore boat to showcase the fact
they were building the engines for Chevy.  Turned out you could build a
faster boat for less money using cast iron 7.4 liter pushrod V-8s.

Now, in smaller boats, there might be some incentive for compact
packaging, but if that's the case, then why wasn't Bayliner's L-drive a
success?

The small-boat end of the market is very cost-sensitive, and is thus
unlikely to support the cost of the engine you propose.  Not only will
there be high development costs and low volume, but with an aluminum
engine, you'll have to have a closed cooling system for corrosion
prevention.  Currently, one reason I/Os are cheaper than comparable
outboards is that the iron-block automotive engines, which the car
companies produce by the millions, are much cheaper than the exotic,
aluminum, low-production outboard powerheads.

This is at least starting to change for heads.  Aluminum heads are
beginning to be more common in auto land.  I think the current
corrosion solution is to coat the aluminum.  The new 97 generation 
chevy small block v8 is alluminum.  After a few years for the costs
to come down we may start seeing them become more common in boats.
With the decline of big blocks in auto land I doubt we'll ever see
a common production alluminum big block though.

Dave, 
Mercury Marine has experience with Aluminum.  The combination of the
marine enviroment and the cost are the deterent.  Mercury built and
tooled the only &quot;made for the marine enviroment only&quot; engine, so far,
used as an I/O package from the mid seventies until the mid eighties. 
It was a great package.  The fact that it had to have fresh water
cooling and the cost of production killed it.  When OMC introduced the
cobra dive, they were offering a V/6 package for less than it cost
Mercury to put this motor together.  Also the fact that the head was
aluminum and the temprature swings a boat engine encounters a fare
greater instantly than air cooled applications.  It was hard to keep
head gaskets on those things.  They seemed to have mysterious leaks all
the time. The weight to horsepower ratio was good and it made a great
package for small boats especially.

I have always wondered why Honda has been so slow in adapting their auto
engines to OB. Their cars have one of the best and lightest powerplants
for the output and would make great powerheads. Some of the others ie
Nissan has 200+ hp V6 engines that are light and fast. Toyota as well
has a great line of engines. The problem has been market and production
costs do are not justified with the limited marine market in the US. Most
other contries use only diesels on their boats which limits the large
OB to countries with cheap gas. Yanmar has two diesel OB but they are
small and big $$$.

It costs a great deal to design a new engine and to tool up a
production line to manufacture it.  The first question that any engine
manufacturer is going to ask when considering the production of a new
engine is:

&quot;What will the market be for this engine, and how many engines can we
realistically sell?&quot;

When the market is only the small boat market, then the answer to that
question is normally, &quot;Not very many, and certainly not enough to
recover our start up costs.&quot;

This is why nearly every inboard or I/O engine in small boats today
was adapted from another market.  Only a very few have ever been
designed specifically for the marine market.

Even when you get into larger boats and small ships, the engines are
normally adapted from another application:  truck engines, large
industrial stationary engines, and locomotive engines.

You mentioned aluminum as a material for a block and head.  The only
real advantage of that is weight.  Cast iron will normally resist
corrosion much better than aluminum for this application.  I know
people who have been using cast iron engines in boats for over thirty
years with no problems.  Many of them are commercial applications
which exceed 3000 hours per year.  How many aluminum engines have you
seen last like this in a marine application?

Outboards are quite different.  The manufactures sell enough of them
at a fairly high price to justify the production of an engine
exclusively for the marine market.  This does not seem to be true for
the inboard market.

Also, keep in mind that with lower production runs you will also have
higher per unit costs, whcih ultimately can only be recovered from the
consumer.  If outboards were manufactured in the same numbers as
automobile engines, they would be much less expensive.

Out of curiosity, how much lighter is a current production small block

Would that be the 165/170 hp 3.7L engine?

If so that may not be exactly right. Several things probably killed it. 

1) GM 4.3L came along at about the same time that they had most of the 
bugs worked out of the 3.7L. 

2) In an attempt to make the engine nearly beltless, they used a stator 
charging system which was heat sensitive, prone to failures, and 
expensive to replace/repair.

3) Early and mid models had some gasket problems that allowed 
anti-freeze into the oil.

The later models (after about 1986) were decent engines. I really liked 
closed water cooling. Just pull one plug for short term freeze 
protection.

There have been a number of automobile aluminum block engines - the one
that comes first to my mind is that used in the Hillman Imp ( 4 cyl ~
750 cc) which was based on the Coventry Climax fire pump engine - this
little motor, made in the early 1960's until ?? was developed with power
up to about 100 HP. I believe that the Honda Civic motor is/was aluminum
block. Also I believe that Buick had a small block V-8, tooling for
which was sold to Land-Rover and may still be used by them.

The bigger problem appears to be the cooling system - outboards use
aluminum with freshwater cooling, so it is possible. What appears to be
necessary is an effective system to drain down the system when the motor
is stopped. This is only a &quot;technical&quot; problem that could be solved with
a little ingenuity!
