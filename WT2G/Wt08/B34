<P>The Organization, its property and its assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process except in so far as in any particular case the Executive Secretary of the Organization has expressly waived its immunity.

<P>The property and assets of the Organization, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial, or legislative action, except with the consent of and under the conditions agreed to by the Executive Secretary of the Organization.

<B><P>ANALYSIS STATEMENT</B> </P>
<P>(<I>This statement is not part of the Order</I>.) </P>
<I><P>Description</I> </P>
<P>The purpose of the order is to grant the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES), to the extent required for the exercise of its duties in Canada, the privileges and immunities contained in Article II of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, and to grant to the representatives of foreign states that are members of the Governing Council of the Organization, its officials and experts performing missions for the Organization, to the extent required for the exercising of their functions, the privileges and immunities contained in Articles IV, V or VI of the Convention. The Convention is set out in Schedule III to the <I>Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act</I>. </P>
<P>By reference to these Articles of the Convention, the Organization is granted certain privileges and immunities such as the immunity from legal process and the inviolability of its premises and archives. Its assets, income and other property are also granted exemptions from direct taxes, customs duties and from prohibition and restrictions on the import, export and sale of its publications. Also, representatives of foreign states that are members of the Governing Council of the Organization and certain officials of the Organization are granted privileges and immunities such as immunity from personal arrest or detention, exemption from immigration restrictions and immunities in respect of personal baggage. Officials who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada, and the members of their families forming part of their households, also enjoy some privileges and immunities equivalent to diplomatic privileges and immunities. </P>
<P>The granting of these privileges and immunities is required to ensure compliance by the Canadian government with the Headquarter's Agreement granting privileges and immunities to the Organization, between Canada and PICES signed in Victoria, British Columbia, on January 8, 1993 and effective since that date. </P>
<I><P>Alternatives</I> </P>
<P>To allow the government of Canada to fulfill its international commitment, there is no alternative solution. </P>
<I><P>Benefits and Costs</I> </P>
<P>No impact is anticipated on the Canadian economy. </P>
<I><P>Consultation</I> </P>
<P>Discussions took place between Revenue Canada's Provincial and International Relations Division and the Office of the Privy Council's Legal Advisor. </P>
<P>Compliance and Enforcement </P>
<P>None, since this order is convened by an enabling provision found in section 5 of the <I>Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act</I> and its purpose is to implement under internal law a headquarters agreement that is already in force at the international level. </P>

<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
A PICES-GLOBEC Workshop was held during October 15-17, 1994, in
Nemuro, Japan, just prior to the PICES Third Annual Meeting. This
Workshop was sponsored by PICES and the Japan Fisheries Agency,
and was hosted by the Japan Fisheries Agency. More than 100 participants
attended this Workshop. Activities included a welcoming address
by Mr. Takahiro Ishikawa, Deputy Director of the Japan Fisheries
Agency, and keynote lectures by Dr. Brian J. Rothschild (Chairman,
GLOBEC International) and Dr. Warren S. Wooster (Chairman, PICES).
Dr. Daniel M. Ware and Prof. Timothy R. Parsons gave invited lectures
regarding possible approaches to determining carrying capacity
of the North Pacific. The current status of the national GLOBEC
programs was summarized in lectures by Dr. David L. Mackas (Canada),
Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang (China), Prof. Takashige Sugimoto (Japan)
and Dr. Anne B. Hollowed (U.S.A.). Poster presentations on relevant
scientific topics were included both in this Workshop and in the
PICES Third Annual Meeting which immediately followed. Other significant
events included a magnificent Workshop Reception in the evening
of October 15, which was hosted by the Japan Fisheries Agency,
and cultural events hosted by the City of Nemuro.<BR>
<P>
The purpose of this PICES-GLOBEC Workshop was to develop a plan
for a new international science program in the North Pacific.
At the PICES Second Annual Meeting in 1993, the Governing Council
approved development of a PICES-GLOBEC International Program on
<I>Climate Change and Carrying Capacity</I> (CCCC) in the temperate
and subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean. This new scientific
program was envisioned to include: (a) a strategy for determining
the carrying capacity for high trophic level pelagic carnivores
in the subarctic Pacific, and its changes in response to climate
variations, and (b) a plan for a cooperative study of how changes
in ocean conditions affect the productivity of key fish species
in the subarctic Pacific, and in the coastal zones of the Pacific
Rim from China to California. <BR>
<P>
This Workshop was the culmination of an intensive interactive
process used to develop the CCCC Science Plan. A PICES-GLOBEC
Workshop Steering Committee (Endnote 1) was formed during February-March
1994, which included members from all PICES countries, and liaison
members from Russia and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission
(NPAFC). The Steering Committee and Dr. Wooster developed a draft
Science Plan for the CCCC Program during April-May. This draft
was then widely circulated in the international science community
with a request for input and suggested improvements. Many excellent
comments and ideas were received and the Steering Committee used
this input to revise and improve the draft Science Plan. This
process was repeated several times during June-September, resulting
in several major revisions of the draft Science Plan prior to
the Workshop. Plenary sessions at the workshop provided opportunity
for additional review and content suggestions, and the basis for
a final revision by the Steering Committee. (Much of the discussion
before and during the workshop dealt with the need, and possible
ways, to extend the concept of carrying capacity to complex multi-species
interactions.) The resulting Science Plan was subsequently endorsed
by the PICES Science Committees and Science Board, and was approved
by the PICES Governing Council, at the Third Annual Meeting during
October 18-24, 1994 in Nemuro, Japan.<BR>

<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
The North Pacific Marine Science Organization
(PICES) and the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Program (GLOBEC)
agreed in 1993 to jointly organize an international science program
on <I>Climate Change and Carrying Capacity</I> (CCCC) in the temperate
and subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean. A PICES-GLOBEC
Workshop was organized in 1994 to develop a Science Plan during
the PICES Third Annual Meeting in Nemuro, Japan. This proposed
PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan is the result of this Workshop, and
prior input from PICES Working Group and Science Committee members.
<BR>

<P>
Activities in the CCCC Program are anticipated
on two spatial scales:<BR>

<P>
1. Basin-scale studies to determine
how plankton productivity and the &quot;carrying capacity&quot;
for high trophic level, pelagic carnivores in the North Pacific
change in response to climate variations.<BR>

<P>
2. Regional-scale, ecosystem studies
comparing how variations in ocean climate change species dominance
and productivity of key plankton and fish populations in the coastal
margins of the Pacific Rim, from China to California.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Background<BR>
</B>
<P>
Why is PICES interested in studying
Climate Change and Carrying Capacity? The reason stems from the
remarkable changes that have occurred in the North Pacific and
adjacent seas in recent decades, in both the open ocean and coastal
margins. Concurrent changes in atmospheric pressure and ocean
temperatures indicate that in 1976 and 1977 the North Pacific
shifted from one climate state, or regime, to another that has
persisted through the 1980s (Trenberth 1990; Hollowed and Wooster
1992; Kerr 1992; Graham 1992; Trenberth and Hurrell 1994). Analyses
of the North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) and atmospheric
flow (Fig. 1) have identified a pattern of regime shifts in SST,
the atmospheric Pacific/North American index (PNA; Fig. 2), and
the southern oscillation index, lasting several years to decades.
Specifically, since 1976 there has been an intensification of
the Aleutian low during the winter (November through March). The
centre of the low has shifted further east and is now about 4
mb deeper, on average. There have also been associated changes
in wind stress curl, the corresponding Sverdrup transport, a warming
over Alaska, and a cooling in the central and western North Pacific.
The strength of flows in the Alaska and California Currents may
also fluctuate out-of-phase (Wickett 1967; Chelton and Davis 1982;
Chelton 1984; Tabata 1991). Changes in the Aleutian low also affect
the distribution of sea ice in the Bering Sea (Niebauer 1989).
Global modelling studies further suggest that if global warming
is occurring, its effects should be most strongly developed and
initially observed in high latitudes.<BR>

<P>
Although the important linkages are
currently poorly understood, there is growing evidence that biological
productivity in the North Pacific responds to these decadal-scale
shifts in atmospheric and oceanic conditions, by alternating between
periods of high and low productivity. In coastal areas, both the
far eastern and California stocks of Pacific sardine peaked in
abundance in the 1930s, declined significantly in the 1950s and
1960s, then began to increase synchronously in the mid-1970s (Kawasaki
and Kumagai 1984; Lluch-Belda et al. 1989; Fig. 3). Large scale
changes in pelagic fish production in the western Pacific (Terazaki
1989; Kawasaki 1991), and in year class synchrony in recruitment
of numerous important fish stocks (Bakkala 1993; Hollowed et al.
1987; Hollowed and Wooster 1992; Beamish 1993), suggests coastal
production is linked to variations in ocean climate. Paleosedimentary
records indicate that these interdecadal fluctuations have been
characteristic of the California Current system for the last 2000
years (Baumgartner et. al. 1992).<BR>

<P>
Between the late 1960s and mid-1970s,
there was a two-fold increase in the summer biomass of zooplankton
(Brodeur and Ware 1992; Fig. 4), and some higher trophic-level
carnivores such as pomfret and neon flying squid (Brodeur and
Ware 1994) in the eastern subarctic Pacific. Odate (1994) also
reported significant fluctuations in zooplankton biomass in the
Oyashio, Kuroshio and the transitional regions off the coast of
Japan (Fig. 5). The combined, national catches of salmon in the
North Pacific (Fig. 6) also apparently declined steadily from
historic highs in the late 1930s to a low in the mid-1970s. However,
by the late 1970s there was a striking increase and the combined
salmon catches subsequently had risen two- to three-fold, to nearly
the historic high levels for this century (Pearcy 1992; Ishida
1992; Beamish and Bouillon 1993; Hare and Francis 1994).<BR>

<P>
Significant changes in ocean climate
do not affect all ecosystems or species in the same way. Conversely,
it is not established that a species or ecosystem will always
respond in the same way to a specific type of change in ocean
climate. During any particular ocean climate regime the productivity
of some species may be high, while the productivity of other species
may be low. For example, major shifts in the dominant fish species
have occurred among sardine, anchovy and mackerel in the Kuroshio-Oyashio
Current region from the 1970s to 1980s. Productivity changes also
occur in the coastal waters around the Pacific Rim, but also are
not necessarily in-phase with the open ocean, or other coastal
ecosystems. For example, ocean survival of Washington and Oregon
coho salmon was high during the 1960s and early 1970s, then declined
markedly after 1976, opposite to the pattern observed in Alaska
coho (Pearcy 1992; Hare and Francis 1994). Important changes in
ocean climate likely include both physical (water mass structure,
nutrient fluxes, sea ice cover etc.) and biological (primary and
secondary production, predator abundance and distribution, etc.)
components.<BR>

<P>
In addition to the decadal-scale regime
shifts, longer-term global climate change may result in substantial
changes in the biological carrying capacity of the North Pacific.
Several observations are consistent with this possibility. For
example, coincident with the recent increase in salmon catches,
the average size of adult salmon has significantly decreased in
some areas of the North Pacific. The average size of adult Japanese
chum has declined by about 7% in fork length and 20% in body weight
from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, but has been unchanged
since the early 1980s (Kaeriyama 1989; Ishida et al. 1993). The
average size of Russian chum has also decreased (Ishida et al.
1993). The mean body weight of returning pink salmon in British
Columbia has declined 40% since the 1950s (Ricker 1981). There
is also evidence that growth and mortality of some salmon species
and stocks in the high seas may vary with levels of salmon production
(Krogius 1960; Peterman 1984, 1991; Ogura et al. 1991; Ishida
et al. 1993). In some cases the growth rates of abundant stocks
of salmon appear to be inversely related to stock size (e.g.,
pink salmon, Peterman 1987). Some portion of these patterns of
variation may be due to the combined current abundance of salmon
and other high trophic level carnivores approaching the present
&quot;carrying capacity&quot; of the subarctic North Pacific.
<BR>

<P>
By &quot;carrying capacity&quot; we
mean how zooplankton and high trophic level carnivore species
dominance and productivity respond to changes in the ocean climate.
One initiative in the CCCC program will be to develop a new theoretical
and mathematical framework which extends the classical, single
species concept of carrying capacity into the multi-species, ecosystem
domain that the CCCC Program will address. To be relevant, this
extended definition must recognize that the &quot;carrying capacity&quot;
from this point of view changes over time in response to many
factors such as: abiotic conditions, spatial distribution of the
population, the supply of food, and the abundance of predators.
The food supply, in turn, is a function of the productivity of
the prey populations, and competition for that food from both
within and between predator populations. As experience has indicated,
changes in the abiotic environment can affect the distributions
and productivity of populations at all trophic levels.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan<BR>
</B>
<P>
The CCCC Program will address how climate
change affects ecosystem structure, and the productivity of key
biological species at all trophic levels in the open ocean and
coastal North Pacific ecosystems. The physical environmental changes
that have occurred in this century, particularly during the late
1970s, may provide a natural experiment for studying such questions.
<BR>

<P>
At this stage, only the general scope
of the proposed CCCC Program has been discussed. There will be
a strong emphasis on the coupling between atmospheric and oceanographic
processes, their impact on the production of the major living
marine resources, and on how they respond to climate change on
time scales of seasons to centuries.<BR>

<P>
The program shall focus on determining
how the dynamics of the ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific respond
to climate change. The program will include the following elements:
<P>
1. Employ mechanistic process studies
to improve understanding and develop early recognition and prediction
capabilities for regime changes.<BR>

<P>
2. Develop and employ models to guide
research activities, integrate results, and improve capabilities
for forecasting ecosystem responses to climate change.<BR>

<P>
3. Develop broader insights and understanding
through regional comparative studies.<BR>

<P>
4. Support and coordinate CCCC Program
activities with GLOBEC.INTernational and other existing and planned
international (e.g. NPAFC, WOCE, JGOFS, GOOS, NOPACCS, WESTPAC,
YSLME, LOICZ) and national (e.g. CalCOFI, BIOCOSMOS, GLOBEC SPACC,
HUBEC, FOCI, LaPerouse) organizations and research programs in
the PICES region.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
The <B>key scientific questions</B>
to be addressed include:<BR>

<P>
1. How do interannual and decadal variations
in ocean conditions affect the species dominance, biomass, and
productivity of the key zooplankton and fish species in the ecosystems
of the PICES area?<BR>

<P>
2. Evidence exists for climate regime
shifts in the eastern North Pacific, but it is not clear if similar
shifts occur on the same time scales in the western North Pacific.
Are regime shifts in the eastern and western sides of the North
Pacific basin in&#173;phase? Do they have the same or opposite
sign? Methods are required for both short term detection and longer
term prediction of climate regime shifts.<BR>

<P>
3. How are the open and coastal North
Pacific ecosystems structured? Methods are required for both short&#173;term
detection and longer&#173;term prediction of changes in ecosystem
structure, stability and productivity. The biomass spectrum approach
(Platt 1985; Boudreau and Dickie 1992; Fig. 7) may provide a useful
starting point for this activity.<BR>

<P>
4. What impact do variations in flow
and dynamics of eastern and western boundary currents have on
the productivity of Pacific Rim coastal ecosystems? Do the strengths
of the Alaska and California currents vary inversely? How are
their dynamics related to those of the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents?
<BR>

<P>
5. What factors affect current trends
in the productivity of the North Pacific Ocean and their impacts
on salmonid carrying capacity?<SUP>2</SUP> To what extent do the
seasonally migrating species such as Pacific pomfret, neon flying
squid and Pacific saury compete with salmonids in the subarctic
Pacific?<BR>

<P>
6. What factors affect changes in biological
characteristics of Pacific salmon? These characteristics include
growth, size at maturity, age at maturity, ocean distribution,
survival, and abundance? (This is also a critical question for
all key species of the subarctic Pacific.)<BR>

<P>
7. How do responses to regime state
differ among potential dominant species? How do abundances, migratory
patterns, and stock-recruitment relationships change? Is the response
of key species to regime change characteristic and consistent
over several cycles? What limits primary production during each
regime?<BR>

<P>
8. What are the causes and consequences
of spatial shifts in pelagic ecosystems?<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Key research activities </B>proposed
to address fundamental scientific questions include:<BR>

<P>
1. Retrospective analyses<BR>

<P>
Retrospective analyses of existing atmospheric,
physical, biological and paleoceanographic data, to identify recent
(and historical) changes in the subarctic Pacific. For example,
plans are currently underway to:<BR>

<P>
- examine atmospheric and physical oceanographic
time series in the eastern and western Pacific to determine if
regime shifts occurred and if these shifts were synchronous across
the North Pacific;<BR>

<P>
- examine long-term plankton and fisheries
records from the eastern and western Pacific for shifts in species
composition and biomass changes, and determine if these changes
are synchronous on both sides of the Pacific;<BR>

<P>
- analyze plankton and high trophic
level carnivore biomass data from North Pacific ecosystems to
determine the average slope and intercept of the biomass spectra
(Fig. 7) for different ocean regimes;<BR>

<P>
- examine the statistical evidence for
a link between variations in ocean conditions, plankton, and catches
of key fish stocks, and investigate the relationship between fish
catches and total production, or recruitment;<BR>

<P>
- reconstruct interdecadal-through-centennial
scale variability in fish populations and associated environmental
changes for the past one to two millennia;<BR>

<P>
- examine historical variations in salmon
growth through the analysis of their scale patterns;<BR>

<P>
- conduct comparative studies of somatic
growth of fish populations around the Pacific Rim (e.g., Wada
and Kashiwai 1991);<BR>

<P>
- compare the dynamics of coastal fish
stocks of the North Pacific;<BR>

<P>
- examine how physical forcing affects
the eastern Pacific marine mammal (e.g., harbor seals and sea
lions) and seabird populations via changes in the abundance and
availability of their food.<BR>

<P>
Other retrospective analyses will be
carried out to meet program requirements.<BR>

<P>
2. Development of numerical models<BR>

<P>
This component of the program will develop
models for ecosystem dynamics research and monitoring. The CCCC
Program will involve scientists from countries on both sides of
the North Pacific, requiring regional and ocean-basin scale models.
PICES Working Group 7 (WG7) is reviewing three-dimensional circulation
models of the North Pacific including nested circulation models
of the marginal seas and shelf areas. PICES-GLOBEC and NPAFC member
countries will be interested in developing regional food web models
to couple with the nested, regional circulation models. However,
reliability of results of complex nested models needs to be investigated
because of the accumulation of errors. The models will be developed
in close cooperation with the Ecosystem Process Studies and will
also serve an important role in focusing and integrating other
CCCC Program activities.<BR>

<P>
The following specific activities are
proposed:<BR>

<P>
- develop a variety of foodweb formulations
representing the appropriate dynamic ecosystem properties of interest
to PICES-GLOBEC;<BR>

<P>
- embed the various formulations of
foodweb models in one-dimensional mixed layer models forced by
surface wind, heat and moisture exchanges typical of the subarctic
Pacific, on time-scales from hours to years;<BR>

<P>
- embed mixed layer dynamics and foodweb
models in the three-dimensional circulation models, and run retrospective
simulations of the last 30-50 years with observed atmospheric
inputs;<BR>

<P>
- develop second generation models to
generate projections of physical and biological responses to possible
future climate variation and large scale environmental change.
<BR>

<P>
3. Ecosystem process studies<BR>

<P>
The CCCC Program will include well-resolved
process studies of hypothesized linkages between target species
and their environment. The process studies will be integrated
closely and iteratively with the regional and basin-scale ecosystem
models described in the previous section. They will also complement
time series studies by allowing quicker evaluation of statistical
significance, identification of important and informative intermediate
variables and linkages, and verification and improvement of model
structure and parameters.<BR>

<P>
The process studies will be conducted
both in the open subarctic, and in selected regional, coastal
ecosystems around the Pacific Rim. They will focus on how environmental
conditions affect primary production; zooplankton production,
distribution, and life history; food web trophodynamics (feeding,
growth, reproduction and mortality rates); life history models;
and the migratory behavior of key zooplankton, micronekton, squids,
fishes, marine mammals and sea birds. Many of these topics are
core components of the GLOBEC.INTernational Program.<BR>

<P>
Because many of the physical and biological
changes of interest to PICES-GLOBEC occur over multi-year to interdecadal
time scales, an important practical objective will be to maximize
the range of environmental conditions examined in the process
studies. This will be done in two ways. The first (and a very
important element of the overall effort to understand how changes
in ocean climate affect the production of coastal ecosystems and
the population fluctuations of key species around the Pacific
Rim) will be between-site comparisons among the numerous regional
GLOBEC and GLOBEC-like studies ongoing or planned by Pacific Rim
countries. These will include parallel and cooperative field studies
comparing and contrasting the eastern and western Pacific in terms
of their physical and geochemical settings, and biological characteristics
of key species, including recruitment and stage specific vital
rates (growth, mortality, fecundity). These measurements will
be combined with parallel applications of trophodynamic and individual-based
models.<BR>

<P>
Second, shorter time scale temporal
variability (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o events)
will also be studied, and the extent to which conditions and outcomes
may be used as proxies or models to understand longer-term climate
change will be examined. For both spatial and temporal variability,
the linkage of diverse national and regional activities by cooperative
process studies will provide opportunities and scientific insights
which would not be gained through research conducted solely by
the individual countries.<BR>

<P>
4. Development of Observation Systems <BR>

<P>
A monitoring program will be developed to collect
new observational data on surface winds, upper ocean temperature
and circulation, nutrient flux, phytoplankton productivity (from
ocean colour sensors and <I>in situ</I> studies), zooplankton,
mesopelagic micronektonic animals and higher trophic level carnivores.
These data will be obtained from satellites, drifting buoys, moorings,
volunteer observing ships, research vessels, and by development
and implementation of required new methods and technology. Intensive
multi-ship, multi-disciplinary surveys on whole ecosystem structure
and dynamics, to understand biological productivity, trophic level
interactions and physical biological interactions, will be developed
in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transitional region. The data will be
used in the numerical modelling and by other CCCC program activities.
Data collection, analyses and exchange activities in the CCCC
Program will also be closely linked and coordinated with survey
and monitoring activities developed in other PICES and international
(e.g., NPAFC) programs. It would be desirable for the CCCC Program
to be coordinated with GOOS activities in the North Pacific, and
to consider the use of models and experimental and statistical
design tools to aid in the design of observational protocols.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Relevance and Expected Benefits of the CCCC Program
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The PICES-GLOBEC International Program on <I>Climate
Change and Carrying Capacity</I> will address major scientific
questions and provide important benefits for the member countries.
These countries are developing national GLOBEC programs, therefore,
it is desirable that the PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan be developed
in a timely manner to guide coordinated planning among the participating
nations. The new information obtained from the CCCC Program to
determine the changes in productivity of each trophic level in
oceanic and coastal ecosystems will provide a stronger scientific
base for rational harvesting and management of living marine resources
in the North Pacific.<BR>

<P>
There are many important consequences of the climate
regime changes that have occurred in the North Pacific during
this century. For example, the current high catches of salmon
in the North Pacific could change significantly when the next
climate regime shift occurs. By identifying changes in productivity
under different ocean climate regimes, Pacific Rim nations could
respond appropriately. There are some indications that the North
Pacific may have undergone another regime shift in the late 1980s
making this study timely and important. Numerous studies have
also found significant relationships between commercial catches
or other indices of year class strength and/or recruitment (e.g.,
juvenile abundance) of individual stocks of marine fish and large-scale
oceanic factors (e.g., El Ni&ntilde;o events, wind stress, upwelling,
temperature, salinity, primary and secondary productivity).<BR>

<P>
Major changes in species dominance and productivity
have also occurred in the marginal seas around the Pacific Rim.
The increases and collapses of both the Asian and California stocks
of Pacific sardine populations during this century provide a striking
example. These large amplitude changes in fish abundance have
important economic and social effects, and appear to be linked
to the general pattern of climate change in the North Pacific.
<BR>

<P>
Large-scale year class synchrony in recruitment of
many fish stocks in the eastern North Pacific also suggests a
climate connection. Development of methods for early recognition
and longer-term prediction of ocean climate regime shifts will
be very valuable, and could become an important basis for more
successful harvesting of short-lived species.<BR>

<P>
Scientific knowledge of the interrelationships between
high trophic level carnivores and carrying capacity would be extremely
useful in improving single species models, and in developing new
multi-species models which could include consideration of the
role of marine mammals, sea birds and non-target fish species
in the ecosystem.<BR>

<P>
The linkage of local, regional, and international
activities by these cooperative studies will provide unique opportunities
and new scientific insights which would not be gained through
research conducted solely by the individual countries.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Time Table<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is an urgent need to initiate the CCCC Program
to provide international coordination between the national GLOBEC
programs. Some national GLOBEC programs are anticipated to begin
in late 1994 or early 1995.<BR>

<P>
The proposed schedule of activities for the CCCC
Program is shown below. This schedule will be modified as the
national GLOBEC programs are approved and implemented, and as
appropriate linkages are established with other international
organizations and programs such as NPAFC, JGOFS, WOCE and GOOS.

<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
The basic description of the PICES GLOBEC-International Program
on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) is contained in
the Science Plan approved at the PICES Third Annual Meeting in
October 1994. The Program will address how climate change affects
ecosystem structure and the productivity of key biological species
at all trophic levels in the open ocean and coastal North Pacific
ecosystems. There will be a strong emphasis on the coupling between
atmospheric and oceanic processes, their impacts on the production
of major living marine resources, and how they respond to climate
change on time scales of seasons to centuries.<BR>
<P>
As the Science Plan emphasizes, activities in the CCCC Program
are anticipated on two spatial scales:<BR>
<P>
1. Basin-scale studies to determine how plankton productivity
and the carrying capacity for high trophic level, pelagic carnivores
in the North Pacific change in response to climate variations.
<BR>
<P>
2. Regional-scale, ecosystem studies comparing how variations
in ocean climate affect species dominance and fish populations
in the coastal margins of the Pacific Rim, from China to California.
<P>
There is not universal agreement on the precise definitions of
several important terms used in the Science Plan and the Implementation
Panel considers it essential to establish a consensus on their
meaning in the context of the plan. <BR>
<P>
1. In distinguishing between regional and basin scales, the former
is understood to mean studies in coastal waters, generally conducted
by scientists of a single country; some of these are identified
as national GLOBEC programs. Basin scale refers to studies in
the open ocean, generally requiring international cooperation
for their conduct. The term subarctic Pacific includes the adjacent
seas of the region, in accordance with terms of the PICES Convention.
<BR>
<P>
2. The terms climate change and climate variation are used interchangeably
to signify low frequency (seasons to centuries) fluctuations in
atmospheric and oceanic conditions, both natural and man-induced.
<BR>
<P>
3. Temporal scales of climate variation of particular interest
to the CCCC Program are scales that have been designated quasi-biennial
(2-3 years), ENSO (5-7 years), bi-decadal (about 20 years) and
near-centennial (60-70 years). A major change in climate and ocean
conditions in the late 1970s associated with major changes in
oceanic ecosystems has been labeled a regime change; such changes
are believed to occur on the bi-decadal or longer time scale.
<P>
4. Ecosystems are assemblages with distinctive food web structure
of organisms in trophic levels extending from primary producers
to top predators. Such systems are forced by climate variations
and human activity. Oceanic ecosystems are characteristically
open so that models must account for fluxes between the ecosystems
and their surroundings as well as for internal dynamics.<BR>
<P>
5. Although their definition is subjective, key species can be
identified by several criteria, including their contribution to
the overall biomass and/or the significance of their role in energy
transfer and trophic structure. Some species are considered dominant
species on the basis of the first of these criteria.<BR>
<P>
6. Productivity, the rate of the production process, is distinguished
from production, the net accumulation of biomass over some specified
time.<BR>
<P>
7. Carrying capacity for a given population is considered to be
the limiting size of that population that can be supported by
an ecosystem over a period of time and under a given set of environmental
conditions. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Scientific Strategy</B>
<P>
<U>Central Scientific Issues</U>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the CCCC Program is to forecast the consequences
of climate variability on the ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific.
To achieve this goal, the following Central Scientific Issues
have been identified as a generalized restatement of the Key Scientific
Questions of the Science Plan (Annex 1 shows the relation between
the statements).<BR>
<P>
<B>Physical forcing</B>
<P>
What are the characteristics of climate variability, can interdecadal
patterns be identified, how and when do they arise?<BR>
<P>
<B>Lower trophic level response</B>
<P>
How do primary and secondary producers respond in productivity,
and in species and size composition, to climate variability in
different ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific. Note that there
is disagreement over the assignment of some organisms to lower
or higher trophic levels.<BR>
<P>
<B>Higher trophic level response</B>
<P>
How do life history patterns, distributions, vital rates, and
population dynamics of higher trophic level species respond directly
and indirectly to climate variability?<BR>
<P>
<B>Ecosystem interactions</B>
<P>
How are subarctic Pacific ecosystems structured? Do higher trophic
levels respond to climate variability solely as a consequence
of bottom up forcing? Are there significant intra-trophic level
and top down effects on lower trophic level production and on
energy transfer efficiencies?
<P>
<U>Key Research Activities</U>
<P>
The Science Plan describes four key research activities, to which
we have added a fifth, data management. The research activities
described below apply to both basin and regional scales, although
emphases and priorities will differ from project to project.<BR>
<P>
1. Retrospective analyses<BR>
2. Development of models<BR>
3. Process studies<BR>
4. Development of observation systems<BR>
5. Data management 
<P>
These are related as indicated in Fig. 1, which suggests that
retrospective studies are an important precursor to model and
process studies, on which the design of observation systems will
depend. The general role of PICES in these activities is to stimulate
action, coordinate, and improve communication among participants.
In addition, the following is noted about these activities:<BR>
<P>
1. <B>Retrospective analyses</B>: This approach is the only way
whereby observed variability beyond the decadal scale can be studied.
Sets of both physical and biological data are available for the
region, many of which have not yet been fully analyzed. These
studies are relatively low cost and are being actively conducted
by many scientists. To accelerate progress, there is a need for
enhanced communication among investigators and improved access
to data sets. Valuable information on long time scales can be
obtained from proxy, high-resloution records in sediments.
<P>
2. <B>Model development</B>: Model development is called for throughout
CCCC implementation and especially in the first Phase. The activity
includes conceptual/theoretical studies and has the eventual goal
of a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ecosystem model. It will draw upon
the findings of retrospective studies and will guide both process
studies and the development of observation systems. Work on physical
models is being reviewed by PICES Working Group 7. From the biological
point of view, conceptual and modeling approaches will require
identification of ecosystems and key species therein by several
criteria, and should include an accounting of the principal elements
of total system biomass.<BR>
<P>
3. <B>Process studies</B>: These include experimental approaches
to study/test specific mechanisms linking ecosystem responses
to environmental variability. They are very important to both
regional and basin scale studies and should be essential components
of national programs that contribute to the CCCC. Ideally, design
of the process studies should be based on findings of retrospective
and model development studies and should contribute to the design
of observation systems.<BR>
<P>
4. <B>Observation systems</B>: The goal of the CCCC Program is
to understand, and eventually predict, the effects of climate
variation on ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific. This requires
that changes in climate and in ecosystem response be measured
systematically in an appropriate monitoring system, the design
of which draws on the findings of retrospective, process and model
studies. It will be the responsibility of the PICES Working Group
on Monitoring (WG9) to review existing and planned monitoring
systems, including GOOS, and to incorporate the requirements of
the CCCC Program in their recommendations for enhancement of these
systems.<BR>
<P>
5. <B>Data management</B>: There is a need to enhance the availability
of physical and biological data for research in the CCCC Program,
through indices, inventories, compilations, and other appropriate
means. Data will also be generated from CCCC process studies and
observation systems, and quality control of these data (e.g.,
through critical examination of observational, processing, and
analytical methods) is an important concern as is facilitating
archiving and access to these data by scientists participating
in the CCCC Program. The responsibilities of the PICES Technical
Committee on Data Exchange include supporting the data management
needs and recommending data management policy of the CCCC Program.
This should be done in close cooperation with National Oceanographic
Data Centers (NODCs) of the region and with the IOC International
Oceanographic Data Exchange (IODE) program.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<U>Program components</U>
<P>
<B>Approaches to study of Central Scientific Issues</B>
<P>
Examples of approaches to the study of the Central Scientific
Issues are given in Annex II. These encompass the various key
research activities discussed earlier, and will differ from project
to project. <BR>
<P>
<B>Regional and basin scale components</B>
<P>
On the regional scale, comparative studies of ecosystems along
the continental margins of the subarctic Pacific will be of particular
importance in the CCCC Program. The following regional (1-10)
and basin scale (11-12) components have been identified (see Figure
2 for relative locations). First generation models have been developed
for those marked *.<BR>
<P>
1. California Current System, south<BR>
2. *California Current System, Oregon to Vancouver Island<BR>
3. *Southeast, Central Alaska<BR>
4. Eastern Bering Sea<BR>
5. *Western Bering Sea/Kamchatka<BR>
6. Okhotsk Sea<BR>
7. *Oyashio/Kuroshio<BR>
8. Japan Sea/East Sea<BR>
9. Bohai, Yellow Sea<BR>
10. East China Sea<BR>
11. Western subarctic gyre<BR>
12.*Eastern subarctic gyre 
<P>
National programs as of 1995, present and/or planned, are listed
in Tables 1-12; programs included are national GLOBEC programs
or those of equivalent scope and magnitude. Comparable international
programs are also listed. The listing should beupdated annually.
In the case of regional scale components (Tables 1-10), comprehensive
sets of programs are underway or have been proposed for most regions.
National GLOBEC or other program committees should seek ways to
cover gaps in coverage as well as to coordinate programs as they
become active. Cooperative basin scale studies will be based to
the extent possible on program material in Tables 11 and 12.<BR>
<P>
A common set of program outputs is required for successful comparison
of ecosystem properties and responses to climate variability embodied
in the Central Scientific Issues (i.e., physical forcing, lower
and higher trophic level response, and ecosystem interactions).
While such a study will be of particular importance for the regional
scale components (as proposed by PICES WG3 on Coastal Pelagic
Fish, PICES Scientific Report No. 1, 1993), comparison of the
eastern and western subarctic gyres (components 11 and 12)is also
desirable. For such comparisons, the following information is
desired (Figure 3 illustrates relationships in an oceanic ecosystem):

<U>Form and Function of Implementation Panel (IP)</U>
<P>
At the Third Annual Meeting, a Scientific Steering Committee (now
Implementation Panel) was established (PICES Decision 94/S/7)
to initiate development of a Draft Implementation Plan, to determine
how the work of PICES Scientific Committees and Working Groups
can most effectively support the CCCC Program, and to identify
existing or foreseen national and international research programs
with which the Program can be coordinated.<BR>
<P>
Membership of the Implementation Panel was determined by the PICES
Chairman in consultation with the Science Board and with the agreement
of relevant national authorities. In structure, it consists of
two co-chairmen, a representative of each national GLOBEC program,
ex officio and liaison representatives, and three other scientists
from each PICES member country (see Annex III for June 1995 membership).
The Panel reports to the Science Board. The co-chairmen, Science
Board chairman, and national GLOBEC representatives constitute
an Executive Committee.<BR>
<P>
Membership and structure of the Panel are likely to evolve as
implementation proceeds. In any case, a three-year rotation of
members might be appropriate. Task teams and other sub-sets of
the Panel will be established as needed to coordinate key research
activities and to facilitate cooperative efforts. Approval to
convene symposia and workshops will be sought from the Science
Board and Governing Council.<BR>
<P>
<U>Cooperation with international programs and organizations</U>
<P>
Cooperation between CCCC and other international activities has
several facets: 
<P>
1. CCCC is part of GLOBEC International, a program sponsored by
the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR), the Inter-governmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the International Council for
the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the North Pacific Marine
Science Organization (PICES), and proposed for sponsorship by
the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). The relationship
among these organizations and the National GLOBEC Programs is
to be worked out.<BR>
<P>
2. Cooperation is envisaged with several existing international
organizations in the region, including the North Pacific Anadromous
Fish Commission (NPAFC), the International Pacific Halibut Commission
(IPHC), and new organizations concerned with fisheries in the
international area of the Bering Sea and with tuna in the North
Pacific. PICES and NPAFC have agreed to examine jointly (i) the
factors affecting current trends in the productivity of the North
Pacific Ocean and their impacts on salmonid carrying capacity,
and (ii) the factors affecting changes in biological characteristics
of Pacific salmon. In order to promote this joint effort, a representative
of the NPAFC is serving on the Implementation Panel Executive
Committee.<BR>
<P>
3. Other international programs concerned with climate and ocean
changes, including ocean fluxes (JGOFS), ocean circulation (WOCE),
and monitoring systems (GOOS) can make important contributions
to meeting the goals of CCCC, and close liaison, exchange of information,
joint workshops, and invited participation will be sought.<BR>
<P>
<U>Elements of support</U>
<P>
Research efforts to be carried out under PICES auspices will be
funded nationally rather than by the organization. As noted earlier,
the role of PICES is to stimulate and facilitate action; to coordinate
planning and, as appropriate, implementation; and to improve communication
among participants. Elements of support for the CCCC Program include
the following:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>PICES budget for coordinating activities, workshops, symposia,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>National GLOBEC programs related to CCCC and involving international
cooperation,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Institutional programs related to CCCC and involving international
cooperation,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>National research programs related to CCCC and capable of
providing ship time and data,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>International science exchange and cooperation programs with
funds and other resources. 
</UL>
<P>
<U>Communication, Meetings, and Publi-cations</U>
<P>
Because of the multiplicity of component programs, exchange of
information among CCCC participants is of particular importance.
Means to ensure effective communication among the component parts
of the overall program include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>special workshops to review progress and stimulate the exchange
of ideas among the multi-disciplinary teams working in each component,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>establishment of task teams to address important scientific
questions of broad interest to a number of program components
(e.g., large scale atmospheric and oceanic forcing, integrated
atmosphere-ocean-ecosystem models),
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>topic sessions at annual meetings and inter-sessional symposia,
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>publication of workshop and symposium papers. 
</UL>
<P>
PICES should play a central role in the exchange of information,
including use of electronic communications to the extent possible,
for example by establishing a CCCC bulletin board where early
information on research activities and findings would be released.
While the PICES Scientific Report series is appropriate for reporting
of workshop and symposia, it may also be desirable to establish
a separate CCCC Report Series. Most scientific papers resulting
from CCCC will be published in the refereed scientific journals.

Figure 3. Relationships among elements of climate forcing and
trophic structure in an oceanic ecosystem. Note that changes in
air/sea heat exchange affect both mixed layer temperature (MLT)
and depth (MLD) while changes in atmospheric pressure are expressed
through their effects on wind stress, which in turn influences
ocean circulation and mixing. In the trophic ladder, &quot;store&quot;
boxes have been inserted between levels, since the effects of
climate variation may be felt differently by the actual production
process and by the storage and dispersal of accumulated biomass.

<CENTER><B>Guidelines For Oral And Poster Presentations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
This guideline was developed to promote effective international
and interdisciplinary understanding among PICES members who come
from different cultures and speak different languages.  Scientists
who present papers at meetings have a responsibility to present
their information in a way that is easy for the audience to understand.
<P>
The guide provides advice and observations on preparing and delivering a scientific presentation at PICES meetings.  The focus is on both invited and contributed talks.  Studies show that we retain much more of what we see than what we hear and we best retain what we see and hear together.  A speaker brings his subject to life for the audience through personal involvement and familiarity with it. Thus, if a scientific talk presents a balance of visual and verbal stimulus, the audience is in the best position to absorb and retain the information presented.
<P>
<B>Preparation</B>
<P>
1. It is very important to the success of the program that authors
develop a talk that can be given in the allotted time.  Once the
presentation has been drafted authors should rehearse and refine
the talk to ensure the central theme is being clearly presented
in the allotted time.   The more you practice and adjust the talk
to fit the time allowed the better chance you will have that the
audience will understand the talk.  Remember convenors are entitled to hold speakers to their assigned times.

<P>
2. When preparing a talk consider that you must speak slowly
and clearly to be understood. Remember that an English speaking
audience finds it difficult to follow a fast delivery and it is
disastrous for those whose native tongue is not English.  Keep
the word choice simple,  active and sentences should be short
and to the point.

<P>
3. Narrow the focus rather than try to cover a large, complex
topic with generalities in a short period.  Even if the topic
is an overview pull out one or two of the most important points
that support the generality.

<P>
4. Before you begin drafting a talk you must define the purpose,
topic and appropriate depth and scope of the information you will
present.  A successful scientific talk is based on how   clear
the subject is presented.  In preparing your presentation, ask
yourself a few questions (suggestions below), the answers to which
you can incorporate in the talk to help bring the subject to life
and make it memorable.

<UL>
<LI>Why should other scientists be interested?
<LI>How can I generate some excitement for the subject?
<LI>How might scientists from other disciplines use this information?
<LI>Can I spice up the talk by adding an emphasis, illustrative
story or introduce a little humor to the subject.
</UL>
<P>
The talk should stick to the topic of the submitted abstract.
 How well you present your material directly impacts on how well
it is received.
<P>
5. The talk should present your findings sequentially using simple
words;

<UL>
<LI>Outline the hypothesis that was tested,
<LI>Ensure that the facts presented build a clear picture of the
findings,
<LI>Always clearly differentiate between fact and opinion.
</UL>

<P>
6. Prepare a visual piece that can be shown any time to deliver
a closing message or summary.  One should be able to go through
this in no more than a minute or two.  A few word of conclusion
or summary are far better than leaving your audience without a
clear message.  This will be most helpful if for some reason the
allotted time has expired.

<P>
7. Math, equations and symbols do not necessarily strengthen the
aim of the talk.  They do slow the pace, make it hard to understand (even for experts) and create an opportunity for confusion.  If equations, calculations, symbols are crucial to your talk consider preparing a extended abstract for later study by those who want it.  You can then concentrate on explaining the relevance of the mathematics and symbols.  If you must use mathematics, slowly talk your audience through each equation step by step.  Do not assume that the audience grasp their relevance.

<P>
8. Presenting a talk is a chance to face criticism.  If you are
defensive of criticism, the presentation will not likely raise
interest in discussion by the audience.

<P>
<B>Slide and Overhead Preparation<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many public speaking experts contend that visual aids ruin more
presentations than they improve.  The answer lies in the fact
that there is a right way and a wrong way to present visual material.  Visual aids are vehicles for enhancing or facilitating the understanding of the spoken word.

<P>
1. Devote each slide/overhead to a single fact, idea, or finding.
 Illustrate major points or trends, not detailed data. Each visual
aid shown must enhance, support exemplify and/or facilitate understanding of the material covered in the talk. Two or three facts or information points per image are best; six are considered the absolute maximum.  Each slide/overhead should remain on the screen at least 20 seconds.

<P>
2. All information presented should be brief and concise.  It
should be presented in the most comprehensible format and edited
to the minimum number of words possible. Use bold characters and
the absolute minimum number of words in titles, subtitles, captions and key phrases.

<P>
3. Slides/overheads must be well designed, simple and readable
by everyone in the audience.  It is worthwhile to consider getting
professional help to make slides and overheads. It is important
to consider that if the visual aid isn't visible and legible to
all the audience, it isn't an aid.
<UL>
<LI>In most circumstances do not make slides/overheads from illustrations or tables that were prepared for publication.  They are rarely satisfactory.
<LI>Use a uniform bold face type and combine upper and lower case letters.  Do not use fancy fonts.
<LI>Use large type for headings and smaller type for subheadings to show relative importance.
<LI>Use contrasting colors where possible for emphasis, distinction and clarity.
<LI>Readable font size of letters and numbers for slides/overheads is 24 point on letter size paper.
<LI>A good way to test your material is to stand 30 cm away for
every 2.5 cm of original copy width(about 420cm from a letter
size sheet of paper).  If you cannot read it at that distance,
then your audience will not be able to read it either when it
is projected.
<LI>Guide to charts and tables;<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Word charts (lists) of no more than 36 words per visual piece (maximum of six lines with six words each).
<LI>Pie charts for percentages.
<LI>Bar graphs(horizontal)or column charts(vertical) for comparisons and rankings.
<LI>Column or line charts for changes over time and frequency.
<LI>Bar graphs and dot charts for correlation.
<LI>Generally, do not use more than one or two curves on a chart; three or four are maximum but only if well separated.
<LI>Only use tables when it is not possible to use charts.
<LI>Each slide/overhead table should not be more than three
or four vertical columns; six to eight horizontal lines.  Any
more information will not be readable.
<LI>Do not use ruled vertical or horizontal lines in a table as they distract the eye and confuse the reader in understanding
the information on the slide.     
</UL>
</UL> 
4. Do not load too much visual material into a talk.  Use as few
slides/overheads as are really needed and can be properly discussed in the time allotted.  A general rule is one for each 1-2 minutes of presentation.
<P>
<B>Poster Sessions</B>
<P>
Poster presentations are as important as oral presentations. 
Care should be taken to present the material in a clear logical
manner.  Many of the points made above under &quot;Preparation&quot; and &quot;Slide and Overhead Preparation&quot; should be taken into account as you develop your poster. It is recommended that you read these before developing your poster.

<P>
1. Poster boards are set up near to where coffee is served in
order to provide easy access during breaks.  Authors are requested
to be available during these times to explain their work.
<P> 
2. Provide a list of times, other than during breaks, when you
would be there to provide explanation.

<P>
3. Unless otherwise notified by the PICES Secretariat posters
can remain in place throughout the meeting.

<P>
4. The Secretariat will notify each author of the size of the
board available.  This varies from venue to venue.

<P>
<B>Extended Abstract</B>
<P>
1.In order to facilitate understanding by participants, speakers
and poster presenters are required to provide advance copies of
their presentation in the form of extended abstracts.  The number
of copies to be  provided will be notified in the letter accepting
papers for oral or poster presentation.
<P>
2. Extended abstracts are required in addition to the short abstract submitted to the Secretariat for review and acceptance by Convenors planning the program.
<P>
3. Extended abstracts should not exceed 2,500 words plus tables
and graphs.  The extended abstract should include:
<UL>
<LI>Title
<LI>Authors name, affiliation, e-mail and mailing address, 
<LI>What you did,
<LI>How you did it,
<LI>What you found out, and
<LI>What your findings mean.
</UL>
<P>
4. The extended abstracts should reinforce important information,
provide summaries and reading lists, and supply supporting data
such as math, equations, tables, graphs and detailed relational
or organizational information that would help better understand
your paper.

<P>
<B>Helpful Hints</B>
<P>
1. Do not waste time by reading visual aids to the audience instead of giving the talk.
<P>
2. Practice makes perfect so practice, practice, practice.
<P>
3. Out of consideration for other speakers, stay within the time allotted.
<P>
4. Speak slowly and clearly.  Keep the word choice simple, active and sentences short.  Words should reinforce the visual material.
<P>
5. Speak into the microphone towards the audience at all times.
 If you need to see what is being shown on the screen, have copies
with you at the speaker's rostrum.  If available use a hand held
microphone to give you flexibility.

<P>
6. Do not stand in front of the projection and obstruct the view
of the audience from seeing your visual material.

<P>
7. Be systematic in presenting overheads.  Nothing confuses an
audience more than a speaker who is continually searching for
overheads.

<P>
8. Use a pointer to emphasize what you wish the audience to focus
on.

<P>
The Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) has undertaken
the task of assembling a list of important datasets that are relevant
to the study of long term trends in the physical, chemical and
biological environment of the North Pacific. These datasets are
particularly important for the retrospective analyses that are
to be carried out in the PICES Climate Change and Carrying Capacity
(CCCC) studies.
<P>
The primary objective of TCODE in assembling this inventory was
to provide short descriptions and &quot;pointers&quot; to the
locations of the datasets, to assist researchers in selecting
and accessing a diverse set of long term data. The criteria for
inclusion were loose - we were interested in any data that was
considered to be relevant to the PICES area that spanned (or will
eventually span) a period of 10 years or more. We have included
references to some global datasets, as well as references to some
observations in equatorial waters which are know to have impacts
on the North Pacific.
<P>
For convenience, we have classified the datasets into four types:
<OL>
<LI>Biological Oceanographic Data
<LI>Fisheries data
<LI>Meteorological data
<LI>Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data
</OL>

<P>
It is important to note that some datasets are difficult to fit
in this scheme (for example, marine mammal abundance data are
included in the &quot;Fisheries Data&quot; category) and some
datasets span more that one category (e.g. the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmospheric
dataset - COADS contains sea surface temperature data , which
fits in the Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data category
and atmospheric pressure data, which is Meteorological data).
We have placed each dataset in the most appropriate category,
so users may want to scan associated categories when searching
for data. The inventory is organized as SUMMARY pages (one for
each of the above categories) with a DETAIL page for each dataset.
<P>
Where possible, we have included Internet URL (universal resource
Locators) for institutions that provide on-line access to these
data. In general, the URL's presented here are the entry points
to the organization's WWW pages rather than a low-level pointer
to the exact web page where the specified data may be accessed.
It is our view that the Higher level links are likely to be more
robust than the more direct lower level links, which will fail
as the organization re-organizes its WWW pages.
<P>
We attempted to gather the following information about each dataset:
<P>
<B>parameters measured: </B>what exactly is included/measured
in the dataset
<P>
<B>measurement frequency: </B>how often are measurements made
(e.g. hourly, daily, monthly, annually or variable)?
<P>
<B>measurement details: </B>additional information about the measurements,
if required.
<P>
<B>geographic area: </B>text description of the area; may include
latitude and longitude limits
<P>
<B>Start and End dates: </B>continuing datasets noted as &quot;ongoing&quot;
<P>
<B>Custodian: </B>name and address for the person/institution
who are the primary holders of these data
<P>
<B>Publication: </B>list publications that explain or document
this dataset.
<P>
<B>Data Distribution: </B>how does one get the data? Are there
any restrictions or costs involved?
<P>
<B>Other Comments: </B>any important notes that don't fall into
the above categories
<P>
<B>Internet URL: </B>link to Internet &quot;resource&quot; (WWW,

An excellent inventory of cruise schedules, vessel descriptions
and other information is maintained by the Data Information Unit
at the University of Delaware, College of Marine Studies . The
contents include U.S. and international contributions and the
DIU is making a serious effort to provide access to all research
vessel information world-wide. This facility maintains an excellent
searchable database of cruise schedules. This is the best starting
place for vessel and cruise information. All that being said this
database appears to have little information for the PICES nations,
with the exception of the U.S.:
<P>
On April 25, 1996 - the University of Delaware database was searched
(by country) for records of research vessel activities in the
Pacific. The following activity categories were included: Physics/Physical
Oceanography; Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Air. The results are
as follows:
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=2>Canada:         2 entries (John P. Tully); no entries for FRV W.E. Ricker
China:          no entries
Korea:          no entries
Japan:          2 entries (Hakuho Maru); there MUST be many more 
Russia:         no entries
U.S.A.          MANY entries

The present version is not too useful. No vessel information is
included and the schedule is difficult to interpret. Schedule
information for one of two major vessels doing offshore research
(CSS John P. Tully) is included in the University of Delaware
searchable database. Additional contacts are:

of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for Canada:<BR>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates, PICES participants, ladies
and gentlemen. On behalf of the Honorable John Crosbie, the Minister
of Fisheries and Oceans for Canada, it gives me great pleasure
to welcome you to the first annual meeting of this new Marine
Science Organization for the North Pacific, PICES. This is, indeed,
an historic occasion. It is very fitting that we are meeting here
today on the Thanksgiving holiday in Canada. While Canadians are
giving thanks for all the good things they enjoy, we here can
celebrate the formation of this new organization. PICES offers
a new and unprecedented opportunity for scientific exchange and
cooperation in the North Pacific, and we in Canada are immensely
pleased that PICES has established its headquarters in British
Columbia.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In celebrating the formation of PICES, we owe a great deal
to those whose vision and perseverance have resulted in us being
here today. Our Chairman, Dr. Warren Wooster, has played a major
role in the development of PICES from the time when it was just
a glimmer in his eye and we thank you, Warren, for all your efforts.
You have long been an advocate for bringing together oceanographers
and fisheries biologists in a common forum. This organization
provides for such a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling problems
in the North Pacific. Dr. Wooster was encouraged to develop the
PICES Organization by Lee Alverson of the National Marine Fisheries
Service and Dr. McKernan of the University of Washington following
international endorsement of the concept at an FAO meeting in
Vancouver in the early 1970's. Warren held some meetings in the
late 1970's, but efforts to form PICES languished for a number
of years.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Then in 1987 Canada endorsed the need for a new North Pacific
Marine Science Organization in its new ocean policy. In recent
years, a group of Canadians, headed by Dr. Barry Muir in Ottawa,
worked with delegations from China, Japan, Russia and the United
States to finalize the documents which established the PICES Organization.
The dedication of that international group has brought us here
today. Many of those responsible are in attendance at this meeting.
A note of thanks to you all. We all look forward eagerly to seeing
Russia, which participated in the drafting of the PICES convention,
join us at the table as a member. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>It is, however, the science and the activities of our scientists
which will be the very essence of PICES. This scientific perspective
will be essential for dealing with the problems and opportunities
which we are facing in the North Pacific. The public and our clients
will expect answers and action on major issues such as climate
change, stock status, overfishing, environmental degradation and
ecosystem integrity. Stresses on the North Pacific will intensify
as global population, food demand and industrialization increase.
It is evident that individual nations cannot address such issues
effectively without the cooperation of others. PICES provides
the means for such cooperation.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Here at this meeting, our scientists will be identifying the
key issues, challenges and scientific questions which will frame
the work of PICES over the next few years. We are fortunate that
the major symposium on climate change and northern fish populations
is being held in conjunction with PICES. The insights, dedication
and ingenuity of our scientists will be vital to addressing the
challenges which we face in the North Pacific. We have a great
opportunity with PICES - let us resolve to make the most of it!
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Please join me in wishing a most productive meeting to all
the participants in the PICES and the associated functions, including
the scientific symposium on climate change and northern fish populations.
And please enjoy the hospitality of beautiful Victoria.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Warren, I am here in a dual capacity. As Vice-President of
ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,
I have been asked by its President to represent ICES as an observer
at this meeting. Professor Wooster and I have both just come recently
from the ICES statutory meeting in Warnemunde, Germany. ICES this
summer celebrated its 90th anniversary.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>PICES, although involving many fewer countries, is in many
ways modeled on the structure of ICES. Its objectives are similar,
although for a different geographic area.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>On behalf of President David Griffith and ICES Delegates, I
bring you warm greetings and best wishes for the first 90 years
of PICES.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Ji Xu, speaking on behalf of the Chinese Delegation and Mr.
Jian San Jia who could not attend due to illness, expressed congratulations
to the Parties for successfully establishing the PICES organization,
as well as to the Chairman and the Secretariat for organizing
the meeting. He mentioned that the major business now at hand
was developing strong scientific cooperation between the countries
which has important implications for the future. Dr. Xu stated
that PICES will bring great achievements in international marine
science through exploring issues of common interest to the Parties.
It was his fervent hope that PICES would become an effective and
active organization and he stressed that this first Annual Meeting
was important.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Hiroshi Hatanaka welcomed delegates on behalf of Japan, expressing
the gratitude of the Government of Japan to all those who had
worked hard to make the organization a reality. He extended thanks
to the Secretariat, the Government of Canada, China and the U.S.A.
for contributing to the founding of PICES and anticipated the
early accession of Russia to the new organization. Dr. Hatanaka
pointed out that the Pacific Region was one of the most dynamic
areas of the world, both politically and culturally as well as
in a scientific sense. He encouraged cooperation between scientific
organizations in the Region, stressing the fact that even though
the Region was vast in size, close contact between the nations
and the scientists was of utmost importance. Dr. Hatanaka emphasized
that Japan was most pleased with the formation of the new organization,
pointing out that it will strengthen bonds between countries.
Japan will give its full cooperation to PICES and will work to
support the organization. <BR>
<P>
Dr. William Aron spoke on behalf of the United States, emphasizing
that this meeting is a science meeting and that there was nothing
more important than the need to understand the North Pacific ocean
which was a complex system. In these times of budgetary shortfalls
it was most important that countries cooperate on scientific matters.
Dr. Aron stressed that the U.S.A. strongly supports PICES and
its linkages to other organizations and programs like GOOS and
the Bering Sea FOCI initiative. The U.S.A. regrets the difficulties
that our Russian colleagues are having and hopes for their early
accession to the organization. Dr. Aron also pointed out that
the United States would like to see other Parties join the organization.
<BR>
<P>
Dr. Warren Wooster addressed the session in his capacity of Chairman:
<BR>
<P>
<I>After fifteen years of discussions and negotiations, the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) has finally been brought
into the world and is now about to start its work. While we all
have high expectations for its success, I suspect that amongst
us we have different expectations. Some see PICES as primarily
concerned with fishery questions while others are more interested
in oceanographic research or in studies of climate or pollution.
My own view is that the problems are all interconnected and that
the study of each depends to some degree on, or contributes to,
studies of the others. If we can make progress on the common question
that emerged during the scientific workshop last December, both
marine science and its applications will greatly benefit therefrom.
That question is:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>What is the nature of the subarctic Pacific ecosystem (or ecosystems),
and how is it affected over periods of months to centuries by
changes in the physical environment, by interactions among components
of the ecosystem, and by human activities?</I>
<P>
<I>Many of us have experience with different international organizations
and we tend to equate PICES with those that we know, be it the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission or the International
North Pacific Fisheries Commission. From my own experience, I
see PICES as most similar to ICES, the International Council for
the Exploration of the Sea, in its focus on scientific questions
and in the substantial involvement of scientists in its governance.
I hope that a major part of PICES activities will be the implementation
of scientific projects proposed by scientists through the four
scientific committees we have established and the Science Board
which is their voice to the Governing Council.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Some may feel that unless research is explicitly related to
applied problems - for example, the assessment of fish stocks
- it is of lower priority in these economically troubled times.
As an academic scientist, I would argue that all of the short
term payoffs in science depend on longer term and more fundamental
studies. Obviously some judicious mix of research with short and
with long term payoffs is needed, as much in PICES as in the government
agencies that will support the scientists engaged in its projects.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>One role that PICES will be called on to play is that of mobilizing
scientific opinion to provide advice. That role was foreseen in
the Convention where included among the scientific functions of
the Council is &quot;to consider requests to develop scientific
advice pertaining to the area concerned&quot; (Art. V.d). Already,
Canada has asked the Council to consider the nature of advice
it would be prepared to provide, and the recent FAO Technical
Consultation on High Seas Fishing proposed PICES involvement in
a technical meeting with other international organizations to
develop priorities and procedures for high seas fisheries research.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In a somewhat related matter, the IOC and ICES have proposed
that PICES cooperate with them in a study of toxic algal blooms.
I think we can foresee other such requests and proposals in the
wide variety of subjects in which PICES can become involved. Indeed,
an important justification for creating PICES was that it could
develop objective advice on scientific questions with great practical
implications. But in each case we will have to consider carefully
whether a useful response is possible and to what extent the Organization
has the necessary resources to undertake the work.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>When the PICES convention came into effect in March 1992, time
was short to organize a scientific meeting before the end of the
year. It would be easy for scientists to spend all of their time
at meetings with none to spare for the ship or laboratory. Thus
it seemed desirable to find an occasion where there was already
to be an aggregation of scientists with interests common to those
of PICES. That opportunity was provided by the International Symposium
on Climate Change and Northern Fish Populations whose close association
with PICES was already foreseen by its organizers. I am grateful
to Dr. Beamish for his eagerness to co-operate with PICES as planning
proceeded.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>You will find the two meetings cunningly intertwined, with
no conflicts today and Saturday, but more than enough during the
rest of the week to guarantee frustration. As you will note on
the schedule, this session, meetings of the four scientific committees,
and the session on GLOBEC are open to all symposium participants.
We have also tried to schedule PICES events so that everyone could
attend key sessions of the symposium. For the Second Annual Meeting
next year, we will need to develop a scientific program of sufficient
interest and importance to attract a good representation of marine
scientists interested in problems of the northern North Pacific
- this is one of the important tasks for the scientific committees
this week.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>PICES is not in competition with other international organizations
nor with established international programs. Instead, we should
find ways to complement and support such organizations and programs
to the extent they relate to our objectives. Therefore, I thought
it useful in this opening session to invite spokesmen for some
of those programs to tell us what they are, what work is underway
or planned in our region, and what PICES might do to support the
programs. The scientific committees and the Science Board will
then be able to take this information into account as they consider
further actions that PICES might take.</I>
<P>
<I>PICES now exists, but it remains to be seen how it will develop
and how effective it will be in promoting the scientific study
of the northern North Pacific. I call on all of you to help us
ensure its success. <BR>
</I>
<P>
Brief overviews of the special presentations follow: <BR>
<P>
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) - Professor Lynn Talley,
Scripps Institution of Oceanography <BR>
<P>
Dr. Talley outlined the goals of WOCE in the North Pacific which
include the development of models useful for predicting climate
change and the collection of data necessary to test them. An additional
goal was determination of the representativeness of the specific
WOCE data sets for the long-term behavior of the ocean and finding
methods for determining long-term changes in the ocean circulation.
Dr. Talley described the WOCE hydrographic program and observational
commitments. WOCE includes a global survey of circulation, including
direct current, hydrographic and sea level measurements, an intensive
survey of the North Atlantic and numerical modeling. Organization
structure includes a scientific steering group with three core
projects (Global Description; Southern Ocean; Gyre Dynamics in
the N. Atlantic) as well as a numerical experimentation group.
Possible focal areas in the N. Pacific include intergyre exchange
(N.E. Pacific), circulation and water mass variability, intermediate
water formation, role of the Okhotsk and Bering Seas, Kuroshio
transport and variability, meridional heat transport, and deep
western boundary currents. Dr. Talley pointed out that the North
Pacific Ocean provides a very useful counter example for the North
Atlantic as the Pacific has no local deepwater formation with
its relatively fresh surface layer. A number of illustrations
were presented to describe the program and the location of WOCE
hydrography lines, study areas and time series stations.<BR>
<P>
Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS) - Dr. Ken Denman, Institute
of Ocean Sciences, Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
<BR>
<P>
Dr. Denman described the JGOFS program as being directed at a
better understanding of the ocean carbon cycle and particularly,
of elucidating the role of the ocean in global carbon flux. He
pointed out that man has perturbed the global system through addition
of carbon by activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and
deforestation. The operational goal of JGOFS is to assess more
accurately and understand better the processes controlling regional
to global and seasonal to interannual fluxes of carbon between
the atmosphere, surface ocean and ocean interior, and their sensitivity
to climate changes. JGOFS program components include large scale
surveys, process and regional studies, time series information,
global synthesis and modeling, sedimentary records and continental
margin boundary fluxes. Dr. Denman summarized the provisional
schedule of field activities 1989-1998, pointing out time series
station locations and mooring sites. Maps showing carbon dioxide
survey transects were presented along with a description of the
organizational structure of JGOFS. In terms of possible linkages
between PICES and JGOFS, Dr. Denman thought that PICES could:
<BR>
<P>
- provide infrastructure for North Pacific countries to communicate,
attend meetings, exchange data;<BR>
<P>
- consider geochemical problems related to JGOFS in the Committees
of PICES;<BR>
<P>
- organize and encourage a study of the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering
Sea regions in relation to Intermediate Water Formation and the
removal of carbon dioxide from the surface waters to deep waters;
<BR>
<P>
- ensure that the WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) transects planned
for the North Pacific are completed, with JGOFS carbon dioxide
and surface pigment measurements.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC) - Dr. Dan Ware, Pacific
Biological Station, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada, Department of Fisheries
and Oceans <BR>
<P>
Dr. Ware provided an overview of the GLOBEC initiative. GLOBEC
stands for Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics and results from an
IOC and SCOR-sponsored workshop held in 1991 which concluded that
&quot;concerns for global climate change emphasize the need to
understand how changes in the global environment will affect the
abundance, diversity, and production of animal populations comprising
ocean ecosystems. The goal of GLOBEC is &quot;to understand the
effects of physical processes on predator-prey interactions and
population dynamics of zooplankton and their relation to ocean
ecosystems in the context of the global climate system and anthropogenic
change.&quot; GLOBEC has several working groups including one
on population dynamics and physical variability; population dynamics
and physical variability; numerical modeling; sampling and observation
systems; Southern Ocean; and a cod and climate working group.
More information on GLOBEC will be available at a session at the
present meeting.<BR>
<P>
International North Pacific Ocean Climate Program (INPOC) - Mr.
Robert Wilson, Institute of Ocean Sciences, Canada, Department
of Fisheries and Oceans <BR>
<P>
The INPOC program shares many commonalities with PICES given that
it involves a project in the international waters of the North
Pacific. Canada, Russia and the United States are involved through
an inter-institutional arrangement for five years cooperation
involving the Institute of Ocean Sciences in Sidney, B.C., Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, the University of Alaska and two
institutes in Vladivostok-the Pacific Oceanological Institute
and the Far East Hydrometeorological Institute. Generally, the
North American side provides the technology, instrumentation,
training, etc. and the Russian side provides vessels, crew and
scientists. To date there have been eight Canada-Russia cruises
and the first U.S.A.-Russia cruise is underway.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
INPOC's goals include:<BR>
<P>
- study of the structure and variability of the subarctic frontal
zone;
<P>
- understanding the heat and salt budgets for the region of the
upper ocean north of the subarctic front;
<P>
- examination of the dynamics of boundary currents along the northwest
margin of the Pacific;
<P>
- investigation of spatial and time-varying fluxes of carbon and
associated elements (N, P, Si, O).<BR>
<P>
Field work in INPOC is planned to continue until 1994. PICES might
be able to assist in future by providing a forum for coordination
of INPOC program information and for developing a continuation
of physical oceanography and climate work after 1994. In addition,
PICES could provide the infrastructure during 1993 and 1994 for
meeting, planning and exchanging data.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) - Dr. James Calder, Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO <BR>
<P>
Dr. Calder began by emphasizing how the IOC and PICES share many
issues in common. There has been a long history of cooperation
between ICES and the IOC involving sharing and dissemination of
information, cooperative initiatives, etc. PICES is invited to
participate in the upcoming IOC Assembly in Paris in March 1993.
Some of the activities of the IOC of potential interest to PICES
include GIPME (Global Investigation of Pollution in the Marine
Environment), the International Mussel Watch Program in the Southern
Hemisphere and the Harmful Algal Bloom Program.<BR>
<P>
GOOS stands for the Global Ocean Observing System which is built
on the existing IOC science and monitoring systems which form
its nucleus. GOOS involves a data collection network, data and
information management, data analysis and preparation and dissemination
of products, modeling, training, technical assistance and technology
transfer. The program includes a global network of 300 sea level
stations whereby countries collect and share information according
to standardized procedures.<BR>
<P>
Bering Sea Fisheries Oceanography Coordinated Investigations (FOCI)
- Dr. James Overland, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Seattle.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Overland provided a synopsis of work being conducted in Shelikov
Strait and the Bering Sea that is aimed at determining what biotic
and abiotic factors affect survival and recruitment of fish stocks.
The initiative is linked to the Alaska pollock project conducted
from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Dr. Overland described
the life cycle of pollock and illustrated how oceanographic features
may affect distribution and recruitment success of year classes.
An additional major question is whether there are separate stocks
in the Bering Sea Basin or if a single stock is present. Dr. Overland
described ocean circulation patterns in the North Pacific and
Aleutians area, stressing the importance of obtaining information
on long term variability in ocean features. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC) - Mr.
Shigato Hase, Executive Director, INPFC, Vancouver <BR>
<P>
Mr. Hase thanked PICES for the invitation to speak and wished
the new organization well in its endeavors. INPFC was established
in the early 1950's by a convention between Canada, Japan and
the U.S.A. and has primarily been concerned with regulation of
salmon fishing in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. Since the
United States has served notice to withdraw from the convention,
the organization will cease operation on February 20th, 1993.
As INPFC provides a mechanism for some very important exchange
of information on stocks in the North Pacific, the Parties to
INPFC agreed that it is important to maintain continuity of data
exchange and accomplish a smooth transition to new organizational
arrangements. In that regard, a new convention dealing with anadromous
stocks in the North Pacific has been negotiated by Canada, Japan,
Russia and the United States and is awaiting ratification. INPFC
will hold a Biology and Research Committee meeting during the
week of October 19th in Seattle and a Finance and Administration
meeting and a transition discussion early in November in Vancouver,
B.C. <BR>
<P>
Mr. Hase emphasized that we are now at a historical turning point
in the North Pacific with INPFC coming to an end, abstention from
pollock fishing in the international waters of the Bering Sea,
and a ban on driftnet fishing on the high seas at the end of 1992.
He stressed the need to transfer essential functions to new organizations
and accomplish a smooth transition. Mr. Hase hoped that these
matters would be carefully discussed at the first annual meeting
of PICES.
<P>
<CENTER><B>REPORT OF GOVERNING COUNCIL MEETINGS<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Two sessions of the Governing Council were held under the Chairmanship
of <BR>
Dr. Wooster. Mr. Willie Rapatz served as rapporteur:<BR>
<P>
Monday, 12 October, 1308 - 1500
<P>
Saturday, 17 October, 0900 - 1412<BR>
<P>
All Member Countries were represented at both sessions (see Endnote
1 for participation). The Chairman of the Science Board also participated
in the second session.<BR>
<P>
At the first session, the Chairman welcomed the Delegates and
reviewed the agenda and the order in which he proposed the various
items be taken up. The report which follows summarizes the treatment
of each agenda item regardless of the session when it was discussed.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1.</B> <B>Preliminary Report on Administration
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mr. Rapatz reported on establishment of the Secretariat in April
1992 and on administrative steps that had been taken since then
(Endnote 1 of Finance and Administration Report).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2.</B> <B>Relations with other International Organizations
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Parsons of Canada commented on the importance of relationships
with other international organizations. He noted that some important
issues had to be discussed to elucidate the role of PICES and
referred to the discussion paper which had been circulated earlier
regarding the Convention For the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks
in the North Pacific Ocean (NPASC). He maintained that when the
NPASC is in operation, the activities between it and PICES should
be coordinated. The potential relationship between PICES and NPASC
should be addressed and resolved. This is especially important
during the transition phase from INPFC to NPASC. Canada believes
that PICES should be an organization from which various other
international organizations should seek advice.<BR>
<P>
The Chairman pointed out that a role of PICES with respect to
other organizations would be to supply advice throughthe Science
Board and relevant scientific committees.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Aron of the United States pointed out that the rationale for
PICES was avoidance of duplication of scientific activities, while
INPFC is concerned with what happens to the data it holds. He
said that as NPASC grows and evolves, it should take a critical
look on how to use PICES. He suggested that PICES wait until the
final report of INPFC is received.<BR>
<P>
Dr. John Davis of Canada remarked that scientific issues may also
be determined by Council of PICES, not only through the Science
Board. He noted that PICES should be concerned with how to divide
the business between NPASC and PICES. This is not only a scientific
issue but also a budget item for PICES. For instance, it may affect
the qualifications of the people to be hired for the Secretariat.
<BR>
<P>
The Chairman pointed out that it is quite difficult to determine
the division of roles, since PICES exists now but NPASC does not
yet. He said that he would like to see a specific recommendation
which the Council can then discuss. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Parsons explained that Canada at this time does not have a
specific recommendation, however, in order to make some progress
with this question, he asked that a small Working Group be formed
to discuss the item, perhaps collectively develop a specific recommendation
and then bring it forward to the second session of Council. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Hatanaka of Japan agreed with the proposal of Canada to form
a small Working Group, since INPFC is disappearing and no specific
relationship has been established as yet. He said that there is
an immediate need to know what will happen to INPFC data.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Aron pointed out that there is a problem with reaching an
agreement at this time, especially in the absence of Russia, which
is not yet a member of PICES. He remarked that the data resident
at INPFC are only a small part of the total available data and
would only be a small addition to that which PICES will have to
come to grips with. PICES is willing to respond to a request,
but we should not preempt the response of NPASC. <BR>
<P>
The Chairman agreed that a Working Group should be formed and
that each delegation should name a member of this group. Dr. Parsons
was asked to be the Chairman of that group and report back to
the second session of Council. After much discussion at that session,
a resolution was adopted (Endnote 2).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Consideration of additional Contracting Parties
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Official observers had been named by Korea, Poland and Russia
and had participated in open sessions of the Council and its scientific
committees. Upon return to their countries, these observers will
discuss the desirability of accession. No action can be taken
by PICES until national applications have been received.
<P>
It was suggested that the Chairman write to these countries concerning
procedures to be followed should they wish to accede to the PICES
Convention. The Chairman agreed to draft such a letter and circulate
it to Delegates for their review before it is issued.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Election of Chairman and Vice-Chairman <BR>
</B>
<P>
For this item the Interim Executive Secretary took the chair.
He explained that in accordance with official procedures, there
would be a single nomination from each delegation and then an
election by closed written ballot. All Member States nominated
Dr. Warren S. Wooster. It was moved by Dr. Aron and seconded by
Dr. Parsons that the first ballot be considered the second ballot.
This carried, and Dr. Wooster was elected to a two-year term.
<BR>
<P>
Dr. Hiroshi Hatanaka of Japan and Mr. Yu Kun Xu of China were
nominated for the position of Vice-Chairman. Both withdrew, and
it was decided that the election would be deferred until the Assistant
Secretary had been appointed. It was agreed that the election
would be by mail.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Appointment of Chairman, Finance and Administration
Committee<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Davis of Canada, now serving as Interim Executive Secretary,
was appointed Chairman of the Committee from the time when the
Executive Secretary takes office. In the meantime, and for the
present meeting Mr. Robert Steinbock of Canada was appointed Interim
Chairman.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Report of Finance and Administration Committee
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee met under the chairmanship
of Mr. Steinbock who presented their report to the Council (see
Finance and Administration section for text of report). The report
was accepted and its recommendations were considered in dealing
with agenda items 7 - 10.<BR>
<P>
It was moved by Mr. William Sullivan of the United States and
subsequently carried by Council, that Financial Regulation 8 (i)
in attachment 2 of the Final Report of March 3, 1992 be changed
to read as follows:<BR>
<P>
<I>The Executive Secretary shall designate a bank(s) or financial
institution(s) within the host state, insured by the host state's
Deposit Insurance Corporation, in which the funds of the Organization
shall be kept. The Executive Secretary shall inform the Council
of the name and branch of the bank(s) or financial institution(s).
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Approval of Headquarters</B>
<P>
<B>Agreement<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Agreement, as revised by the Finance and Administration Committee,
was approved (see Finance and Administration section for text
of the Agreement). The Delegate of Canada stated that the document
would be prepared at an early date for signature by the PICES
Chairman and a representative of Canada.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Estimated Accounts for Financial Year 1992<BR>
</B>
<P>
The estimated accounts to September 30, were reviewed by the Finance
and Administration Committee which recognized that some surplus
was on hand since the Organization was only beginning to function.
That surplus was taken into account in consideration of the 1993
budget. On recommendation of the Committee, the estimated accounts
were approved by Council (see section on Finance and Administration).

<B>Agenda Item 9. Budget for Financial Year 1993 <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee recognized the need for
flexibility in budgeting salary levels before the Secretariat
positions were filled. When the Organization is fully operational,
there will be expenses that cannot now be foreseen. Some 1992
funds, such as those allocated to relocation expenses, should
be carried over to 1993. Nonetheless it seemed appropriate to
use a portion of the 1992 surplus as a credit against the contributions
required for the 1993 budget. Taking these views into account,
the Council approved the Budget for 1993 and the level of contributions
called for therein (see section on Finance and Administration).
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Forecast Budget for Financial Year 1994<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee noted that this budget
was predicated on there being five Contracting Parties in 1994
and that the required level of national contributions would be
the same as proposed (prior to credit) for 1993. The Council received
the forecast budget for further consideration and action in 1993
(see section on Finance and Administration). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Appointment of Executive Secretary <BR>
</B>
<P>
An Interview Committee composed of the PICES Chairman and representatives
of each of the Contracting Parties interviewed the five short
listed candidates and recommended appointment of Dr. W.D. McKone,
for an initial period of 5 years. The Council accepted this recommendation,
as did Dr. McKone who participated in the remainder of the session
as the Executive Secretary designate. <BR>
<P>
In recruiting the Assistant Executive Secretary, it was agreed
that preference should be given to candidates with skills and
experience complementary to those of the Executive Secretary.
For example, an appropriate appointee might be a physical scientist
familiar with the language, organization and conduct of marine
scientific research in one of the Asian member countries. An invitation
to apply for this position will be prepared by the Interim Executive
Secretary in consultation with the Chairman and distributed through
the delegates. Council agreed to a deadline of 1 January 1993
for receipt of applications. It was agreed that the period for
which the Assistant Executive Secretary will be appointed is to
be three years.<BR>
<P>
With regard to the position of Administrative Assistant, there
was consensus that the candidate should be recruited from, and
with good knowledge of, the local area. In evaluating relevant
skills and experience for the position, preference would be given
to candidates having Japanese or Mandarin language skills.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Report of Science Board<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Ware was elected Chairman of the Science Board by members
of the Board. Since this left the Chairmanship of the Fishery
Science Committee vacant, the Chairman of PICES, in accordance
with the Rules of Procedure, appointed Dr. Tang of China to serve
as Chairman until the next Annual Meeting when an election could
be held.<BR>
<P>
The design of the Second Annual Meeting was discussed based on
the proposals from the Science Board. It was suggested by Dr.
Aron that the Chairman of the Science Board and of PICES work
together to reduce program overlap as much as possible, since
the emphasis of PICES should be integration of different sciences.
It was important that scientists of different disciplines be able
to attend each others sessions as much as possible. Dr. Davis
proposed that the schedule be developed in such a way that delegates
and members of other committees can attend scientific sessions.
He also strongly recommended PICES have some process of closure,
whereby the results of the meetings are available in an open plenary
session. There was considerable discussion on this suggestion.
The chairman noted that he will try to arrange a closing session.
<BR>
<P>
After a question by Dr. Hatanaka, if there had been discussion
in the Science Board on whether PICES should support international
scientific meetings, Dr. Ware explained that there had been no
such discussion but that, in his opinion, simultaneous meetings
of PICES and other international scientific organizations should
be contemplated.<BR>
<P>
Regarding the Working Groups proposed by the Science Board, the
Chairman noted that Conveners should be selected, that intersessional
meetings of the Working Groups should be arranged, and that the
Groups should report to the Second Annual Meeting. It was suggested
that for some Working Groups, observers with special knowledge,
for example from Russia, should be invited to participate. It
was also noted that in some cases Working Groups may desire participation
of experts from other countries not members of PICES and that
in such cases PICES should consider the possibility of meeting
the costs of participation.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Davis suggested that the Secretariat might support the meetings
of these Working Groups, by attending the meetings and supplying
organizational support, while Member States would provide the
facilities. There would be a need to develop agreed procedures
for such intersessional arrangements.<BR>
<P>
The Report of the Science Board was accepted and the following
recommendations were agreed:<BR>
<P>
1. Working Groups on the following topics will be established:
<BR>
<P>
WG 1. Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region (POC);
<P>
WG 2. Development of common assessment methodology for marine
pollution (MEQ);
<P>
WG 3. Dynamics of small pelagics in coastal ecosystems (FIS);
<P>
WG 4. Data collection and quality control (Science Board);
<P>
WG 5. Bering Sea (Science Board);
<P>
WG 6. Subarctic gyre (Science Board).<BR>
<P>
2. The Working Groups will be organized by the committees indicated
in parentheses above. Terms of reference will be as proposed by
the Science Board (Endnote 3).<BR>
<P>
3. The program of the Second Annual Meeting will include sessions
of invited and contributed scientific papers organized by the
indicated committees on the following topics: <BR>
<P>
1. Ocean circulation and climate variability in the subarctic
Pacific (POC);
<P>
2. High resolution paleoecological studies in the subarctic pacific
(BIO);
<P>
3. Priority chemical and biological contaminants in the North
Pacific ecosystem (MEQ);
<P>
4. Shifts in fish abundance and species dominance in coastal seas
(FIS);
<P>
5. Long-term monitoring from platforms of opportunity (Science
Board).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 13. Second and Third Annual Meeting <BR>
</B>
<P>
It was agreed that the latter part of October would be the appropriate
time to hold Annual Meetings of the Organization. Dr. Aron, on
behalf of the United States, invited the Organization to hold
its Second Annual Meeting at the NOAA facility in Seattle, on
25 - 30 October, 1993. This invitation was accepted.<BR>
<P>
The Chairman noted that the Third Annual Meeting, in October 1994,
might appropriately take place on the western side of the Pacific.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 14. Other Business<BR>
</B>
<P>
It was suggested that at some regularly scheduled times each year
the Executive Secretary should provide a newsletter to inform
the Parties of the activities of working groups, developments
to date and schedule for meetings. Such a newsletter would serve
the function of a central communication system of use to the Parties.
<BR>
<P>
Consideration was given to a proposal by Dr. K.R. Benson, Co-Chairman
of the Fifth International Congress on the History of Oceanography,
that PICES cosponsor the meeting which will be held in La Jolla,
California, on July 7 - 14, 1993. This will be the first time
that the Congress has been held in the Asia-Pacific region, and
the title &quot;Oceanography: The Pacific Perspective&quot; has
been given to the meeting. The Council agreed to sponsor the meeting
without obligation to provide financial support.<BR>
<P>
There being no further business the meeting adjourned at 1412.

<B>RESOLUTION under Agenda Item 2<BR>
</B>
<P>
Under Article V.(1.D.) of the Convention for the North Pacific
Marine Science Organizations (PICES), the Governing Council affirms
that the Organization will consider requests to develop scientific
advice pertaining to the Convention Area. In the context of Article
III of the Convention, the Governing Council recognizes that,
among other things, the purpose of PICES shall be to promote and
coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance scientific
knowledge of the Convention Area and of its living resources and
to promote the collection and exchange of information and data
related to marine scientific research in the Convention Area.
<BR>
<P>
The Governing Council recognizes the need to clarify the respective
roles of PICES and various other international organizations,
existing or new, with a view towards avoiding duplication and
overlap in the activities of these organizations.<BR>
<P>
The Governing Council therefore authorizes the Chairman of PICES
to respond to requests from other organizations, if initiated,
to enter into discussions in order to clarify respective roles,
including maintenance and continuation of INPFC databases and
scientific records, and to report back to the Governing Council
on the results of such discussions. <BR>

<CENTER><B>REPORT OF OPENING SESSION</B></CENTER>
<P>
The meeting on Monday, October 25, was
called to order by the Chairman Dr. Warren S. Wooster, who welcomed
all delegates, observers and researchers to the Second Annual
Meeting. Dr. Wooster introduced Dr. James Baker, Under Secretary
of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, who welcomed participants
on behalf of the United States and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. Dr. Baker recalled the long development of PICES,
going back to an FAO meeting in Vancouver in the early 1970s and
leading to the present meeting and its excellent preparation by
the Secretariat. He observed that in this post World War II, and
post Cold War era, new driving forces of economic development,
environmental protection, and social equity were operating. A
key focus of the present U.S. Administration was sustainable development,
as emphasized by the recent United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development, where worldwide attention was focused on dual
goals of preserving the earth's oceans, atmosphere, land, and
biological species for future generations and promoting economic
growth and development around the world.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Baker noted that sound policy decisions
in these matters required interdisciplinary scientific research
and advanced technologies, with strong links between scientific
researchers, natural resources managers, and policy makers, and
he regarded what was being done in PICES as a key link in this
web of understanding and policy. He welcomed the PICES focus on
long-term research, noting how the importance of research is often
lost when dealing with immediate, short-term concerns.<BR>

<P>
The international cooperation and the
collection of physical and biological data envisioned by PICES
involves all elements of NOAA, and Dr. Baker indicated that NOAA
will continue to play an active role in the development of this
young organization. He noted the parallel <BR>

<P>
evolution of the North Pacific Anadromous
Fish Commission and stressed the importance of establishing a
constructive relationship so that both organizations can fulfill
their respective missions. He closed by noting the value of this
Second Annual Meeting of PICES as a forum for discussion of marine
issues and thanking participants for being a part of such an important
initiative. <BR>

<P>
Mr. James Beckett, on behalf of the
Canadian delegation, expressed the view that this Second Annual
Meeting would prove to be an important step in the development
of PICES towards becoming a focus for scientific activities relevant
to sustainable development of the marine resources of the North
Pacific, as envisioned at the United Nations Conference on the
Environment and Sustainable Development. He noted the importance
in coordinating marine research, particularly when this was responding
to different objectives, in order to avoid duplication and to
improve cost effectiveness. Mr. Beckett described the Canadian
intent to submit papers on stock assessment and multidisciplinary
studies as an initiative to help focus attention on how PICES
will address the biology and status of harvestable resources as
an integral part of its multidisciplinary work. He referred to
the need to establish how PICES would respond to requests from
other organizations for advice on scientific matters, and the
need for PICES to facilitate access to harvest statistics for
all species in the convention area. <BR>

<P>
Mr. Beckett conveyed to the meeting
the regrets of Dr. L.S. Parsons in not being able to attend, and
he noted the interest of ICES in the development of its Pacific
counterpart.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Cong-Meng Liu, on behalf of the
Chinese delegation, thanked the Government of the United States
for hosting the PICES Second Annual Meeting which is providing
an opportunity for old and new friends to meet in the beautiful
city of Seattle. He also thanked the Chairman Dr. Wooster and
the Secretariat staff for their excellent work in preparing for
the meeting.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Liu mentioned that one year has
elapsed since the First Annual meeting held in Victoria, B.C.
Canada. PICES will continue to mature from the efforts of the
Contracting Parties, scientists, and joint activities with other
Organizations, especially from the efforts of Dr. McKone, the
Executive Secretary of PICES, and his staff. Dr. McKone and his
staff have done a lot of work over the past year to make the Secretariat
fully operational.<BR>

<P>
He indicated that the Government of
China has always attached importance to the scientific activities
promoted by PICES. Chinese scientists will cooperate closely with
other scientists from Contracting Parties and Organizations to
secure the smooth implementation of scientific activities. In
the scientific meetings, Chinese scientists will actively be involved
in discussions on the topics of ocean circulation and climate
variability, high resolution paeleoecological studies, priority
chemicals in the subarctic Pacific, and biological contaminants
and shifts in the abundance and species dominance in coastal seas
as well as in the long-term monitoring from platforms of opportunity.
Through discussion Chinese scientists will develop new measures
to protect and regionally explore the North Pacific ocean.<BR>

<P>
He noted that more and more people in
the world pay attention to the conservation and management of
living marine resources on the high seas. Unfortunately, much
remains unknown about fish stocks and their sustainable utilization,
especially, conservation of straddling fish stocks and highly
migratory fish stocks in the North Pacific. Therefore, China looks
to the newly formed PICES to deal with the scientific issues related
to fish species and other aspects in the North Pacific. It is
hoped that, through PICES, a high level of conservation and rational
exploration of the living marine resources can occur.
<P>
Finally, Mr. Liu mentioned that PICES
is a newly formed Organization and it still has a long way to
go. China will do what it can to strengthen PICES. From this point
of view, the Government of China welcomes non Contracting Parties
to consider joining PICES to work together in making a contribution
to conserving the North Pacific region.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Hiroshi Hatanaka speaking on behalf
of the Japanese Government noted his honor to be able to express
the great pleasure in attending the Second Annual Meeting of our
young organization, PICES. He was deeply grateful to the Chairman,
the Secretariat, and the United States delegation for organizing
this meeting in the beautiful city of Seattle.<BR>

<P>
He indicated that the Japanese Government
is fully aware that multilateral cooperation in the field of marine
science is necessary to deepen our understanding of the sea. PICES
will contribute substantially to the enhancement of such international
scientific cooperation in the North Pacific. Moreover the Japanese
Government will continue to give its full support to the Organization.
<BR>

<P>
Dr. Hatanaka mentioned that, since the
First Annual Meeting held in Victoria last year, there have been
important developments in PICES including the establishment of
the Secretariat and the holding of several Working Group Meetings.
He pointed out that, the Second Annual Meeting will also be another
significant step for PICES.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Vera Alexander, on behalf of the
United States, was very pleased to have the opportunity to welcome
friends from overseas and neighbors from Canada as well as colleagues
from within the United States to Seattle for the Second Annual
Meeting. This Second Annual Meeting of PICES is a critical one.
After almost twenty years of incubation the North Pacific Marine
Science Organization Convention has evolved towards reality, PICES
is finally underway. Although less than two years old, the organization
has progressed rapidly. The Secretariat is in place, scientific
committees have been established and are working actively, and
the several Working Groups, which were spawned, are developing
programs and priorities. This PICES Second Annual Meeting will
represent yet another step forward.<BR>

<P>
She further indicated that PICES offers
a means for the development and promotion of North Pacific Ocean
marine research on an international scale. The challenges requiring
knowledge about the North Pacific Ocean are enormous, as day-by-day
we are faced with new potential crises such as marine mammal declines,
organochlorides in the sea water and oil spills. At the same time,
we need to address more encompassing problems such as oceanic
variability and long-term climate change. To address these topics,
we must involve considerations ranging from the climatic to microbial
scales.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Alexander noted how fitting it was
to meet at the NOAA facility on Sand Point. This is truly a United
States hub for oceanographic and fisheries research on the Pacific
Ocean coast, and any PICES research program will pivot around
the expertise which exists here. She and her fellow delegate,
Dr. Bill Aron, offered their assistance to other participants
in making the meeting a success. <BR>

<P>
Dr. Warren S. Wooster, Chairman of PICES
addressed the Opening Session, 25 October 1993:<BR>

<P>
<I>Despite the long gestation period
of PICES, it has only been in existence now for nineteen months
and one day. Since our first annual meeting one year ago, we have
a few accomplishments: A three-person secretariat has been recruited
and has been on the job for most of the year, equipment has been
acquired, office space has been enhanced, and many administrative
and personnel details have been worked out. The six working groups
we established last year have all met, and their recommendations
for action are in our hands, providing the basis for a scientific
plan that the scientific committees and Science Board will be
elaborating at this meeting. A scientific program of distinction
has been put together for this, the first meeting organized on
our own responsibility. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Of course, the road to effective
development and use of the organization is not without its rough
patches and detours. First, although we have been in contact with
colleagues and officials in Russia and Korea, I am unaware of
any real progress toward either country joining PICES. I urge
both the observers from those countries present at this meeting
and the representatives of the PICES Contracting Parties to take
effective steps to achieve the goal of Russian and Korean membership
by the time of our 1994 annual meeting.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Second, we have made no visible progress
toward establishing an effective working relationship with our
sister organization, the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission.
Such discussions as have taken place, for example at last year's
meeting, have centered on the function &quot;to consider requests
to develop scientific advice&quot; set forth in the PICES Convention.
The NPAFC has not yet decided whether to seek such advice, and
PICES in awaiting such requests can only indicate its willingness
to play an advisory role to the extent wished by its Contracting
Parties.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Attention now is also being directed
to the statutory purpose &quot;to promote the collection and exchange
of information and data related to marine scientific research
in the area concerned.&quot; In this case, PICES is not constrained
to react only to external stimuli. Several of the working groups
have proposed a PICES data role, and fishery data will be one
important measure of ecosystem health and change. Here too there
would seem to be a fertile area for cooperation between the two
organizations.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Perhaps more important, two PICES
working groups have proposed scientific activities of considerable
interest to those concerned with the living resources of the region.
I refer here to proposals concerning the effects of climate change
on the productivity and mix of species in the ecosystems of the
subarctic Pacific. These could result in a PICES GLOBEC project
which could lead to an understanding of changes in the potential
yield of the system as well as of its carrying capacity for salmon
and other nekton. To the extent these studies involve anadromous
species, as they must, considering the importance of salmon in
the ecosystems, I hope the Anadromous Fish Commission will accept
an invitation to collaborate in them.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Another unsolved problem is that
of effective working mechanisms for use between annual meetings.
Working groups were an obvious approach, but their success this
year was weakened by non-participation stemming from travel restrictions
and shortages of travel funds at the national level. That governments
approved the establishment of working groups and named their members
was in the event no guarantee that travel would be approved. We
can undoubtedly use electronic communication to greater advantage,
but the likelihood of response and interaction is obviously much
greater when the parties meet together.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The underlying question here is how,
in a time of recession, to implement recommendations that arise
in the PICES Committees and Working Groups or otherwise at this
meeting. It isn't that PICES has a pot of new money that can be
contributed to new ventures. Perhaps PICES will always be more
of a sink than a source for funds. But the hope is that the ideas
for joint action will appeal to the governments represented here
because they address recognized problems of real concern, for
example, the inevitable climate-driven decline of the rich harvest
of the late 1970s and 1980s. I hope that scientists will find
ways to use PICES endorsement of their proposals successfully
as they pursue funding. This has certainly been the experience
in international organizations such as ICES and the IOC.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>So here we are with a powerful new
apparatus available to promote and develop marine science in the
broad sense, both to help solve the scientific mysteries by which
we are surrounded, and to help answer the practical problems faced
by our countries as they use the ocean and its resources. We must
learn how to use the apparatus while making it known and available
to all marine scientists in our region. Let's bend our efforts
to making it work.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster then introduced Dr. J.M.
Wallace, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences and Director of the
Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean at the
University of Washington. Dr. Wallace addressed the subject of
&quot;Climate Variability over the North Pacific&quot;, describing
the nature of the decadal and longer term changes in the atmospheric
and ocean circulation, and their interactions. These variations
may serve as forcing functions for long-term changes in the biological
systems of the region.<BR>

<CENTER><B>REPORT OF GOVERNING COUNCIL
MEETINGS<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Governing Council met on October
25th, 27th, and 30th, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Warren S.
Wooster. The Executive Secretary Dr. W. Doug McKone served as
rapporteur.<BR>

<P>
All member countries were represented
at the three sessions (see Endnote 1 for participation). The Chairman
of the Science Board Dr. Dan Ware also was in attendance during
part or all of each session.<BR>

<P>
At the first session, the Chairman welcomed
the delegates and reviewed the agenda and proposed the order in
which to take up the various items. This report summarizes the
treatment of each agenda item during the course of the three sessions.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Preliminary Report
on Administration<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary summarized the
activities of the Secretariat during the previous year.(Endnote
2). During the reporting of enlargement of facilities in the Secretariat,
the Chairman asked each Contracting Party to give serious consideration
to contribute a work of art to the Secretariat which would be
representative of their culture while keeping in mind the role
of PICES.<BR>

<P>
During the Executive Secretary report,
Dr. Aron indicated that the circulation of research ship schedules
might be very useful to scientists by providing opportunities
for participation and a knowledge of the research activities of
scientists in member states. Dr. Hatanaka indicated that it is
not easy to collect ship schedules and provide them to the Secretariat
sufficiently ahead of time for them to be useful. He indicated
that Japan would need to coordinate the collection between four
agencies. Dr. Wooster indicated that the Secretariat had not systematically
collected ship schedule information to date. After consulting
with the Science Board,<B> Council agreed that the Secretariat
compile and circulate ship schedules from Contracting Parties
(Decision <I>93/A/1</I>, see Endnote 3).</B> The Secretariat will
send a letter to Contracting Parties requesting they designate
a contact to work with the Secretariat in compiling ship schedule
information.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Relations with Other
International Organizations <BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Stewart representing the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission(IOC)and Mr. Hase representing the North
Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission(NPAFC)were invited to speak
to Council relative to the Organizations that they represent.
<BR>

<P>
Dr. Stewart asked how a mutually beneficial
working relationship between PICES and IOC could be developed.
He suggested that one possibility might be through WESTPAC, the
principle IOC program in the PICES area of interest. He also asked
what PICES was doing in relation to other programs, for example
WCRP, JGOFS, LOICS, GLOBEC, and GOOS. He suggested that it might
be beneficial for PICES and the IOC to develop a Memorandum of
Understanding on Cooperation (MOU). <BR>

<P>
Dr. Wooster thought that some WESTPAC
projects were not well known to PICES participants and suggested
that PICES Contracting Parties should inform the Secretariat about
their WESTPAC activities. Then the opportunities for joint action
would become more apparent. He requested that Dr. Stewart provide
a copy of the ICES-IOC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
would be helpful in further consideration of the matter.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hase indicated that the coordination
of activities between PICES and the NPAFC would be an important
topic at the upcoming meeting in the first week of November. He
suggested all fisheries and scientific research in the NPAFC Convention
Area was important to the activities of the Commission. He also
pointed out that the NPAFC Convention states that &quot;The Commission
shall have the authority to: cooperate, as appropriate, with relevant
international organizations, <U>inter alia</U>, to obtain the
best available information, including scientific advice, to further
the attainment of this Convention&quot;. He finally mentioned
that the Commission has not yet considered any specific relationship
between PICES and NPAFC.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wooster asked who would be given
the task of determining the issues that might be discussed with
PICES should the need arise. Mr. Hase indicated that CSRS would
likely play some role but it could not be determined until the
Commission has decided on the PICES-NPAFC relationship. Dr. Wooster
thanked Dr. Stewart and Mr. Hase for their comments.<BR>

<P>
Canada asked that the following two
questions be referred to Science Board for response in relation
to possible PICES- NPAFC interaction; <BR>

<P>
a) How will PICES handle requests for
scientific advice from member countries?<BR>

<P>
b) Who will compile a comprehensive
catch statistics bulletin for species in the convention area?
<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Membership in the
Organization<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Wooster opened discussion on this
item by noting that further efforts were required to encourage
the Republic of Korea and Russia to join PICES. He suggested that
two avenues of approach would be useful. First, a letter from
PICES could indicate that accession of both States would be supported
by the Council. Second, each Member State could send a letter
to both States indicating their support for joining PICES.
<P>
Dr. Aron suggested that the PICES letter
indicate the success of the Second Annual Meeting and state that
all Member States would welcome membership of both States.<BR>

<P>
<B>Council agreed that the Chairman
should draft a letter for circulation to Parties before transmission
to the Republic of Korea and Russian Federation. Delegates agreed
to recommend that their governments send letters to both countries
encouraging them to accede to the PICES convention</B> <I><B>(93/A/2)</B></I>.
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Role of Observers</B><BR>

<P>
Dr. Wooster opened discussion by noting
that, currently, meetings of the General Council, the Finance
and Administration Committee, and the Science Board are open only
to their members. This restriction creates difficulties for observers
who wish to report on decisions of PICES to their sponsors.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Davis pointed out that it was not
necessary to remove constraints on closed meetings. The question
is how to provide the information required by observers. He proposed
that a summary report of the findings of the meeting be prepared
and circulated before the end of the meeting.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Aron supported Dr. Davis and indicated
that in most meetings that he attends it is common practice to
produce such a document. He also suggested that consideration
might be given to developing an agenda which would allow limited
participation of observers. <BR>

<P>
Mr. Yamada also indicated that in most
of the meetings of Organizations that he attends such a summary
report is produced.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Beckett suggested that care should
be taken in opening meetings to others since, while some organizations
may be interested in PICES activities, others may use this access
to advance their own particular agendas. Further, control over
the number of participants attending Council would be difficult
if constraints were removed.
<P>
Council accepted the proposal of the
Finance and Administration Committee that Dr. Davis in consultation
with other representatives of Parties and the Chairman of the
Science Board coordinate preparation of such a draft report for
consideration of Council. Upon adoption of the report, the document
would be circulated to the observers, press and others who express
interest in PICES activities. Council also agreed to invite the
IOC and NPAFC observers to attend their meeting on 27 October
(see agenda item 2). The observers from Russia and Korea were
invited to the meeting on 30 October, but unfortunately they were
unable to attend.<BR>

<P>
The summary of the meeting was completed
and approved by Council for circulation as appropriate.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Election of Vice Chairman</B>
<BR>

<P>
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure,
delegates were provided ballots for nomination of candidates for
Vice Chairman. A single candidate, Mr. Cong-Meng Liu of China,
was nominated and was elected unanimously. Dr. Wooster congratulated
Mr. Liu and welcomed him as Vice Chairman.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Establishment of Scientific
Committees</B><BR>

<P>
At the Organizational Meeting of PICES
in March 1992 it was decided to establish provisionally four scientific
committees and to review their status at the Second Annual Meeting.
With the concurrence of Science Board, Council agreed that these
Committees, as listed below, be confirmed as permanent committees
of PICES <I>(93/A/3)</I>: <BR>

<P>
a) Biological Oceanography Committee
(BIO)
<P>
b) Fishery Science Committee (FIS)
<P>
c) Marine Environmental Quality Committee
(MEQ)
<P>
d) Physical Oceanography and Climate
Committee (POC)<BR>

<P>
Agenda Item 7. Report of Finance and
Administration Committee <BR>

<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee
(F&amp;A) met under the Chairmanship of Dr. Davis who presented
its report to the Council (see Finance and Administration for
text of the report). The report was accepted by Council, including
adoption of recommendations on the amended Staff Rules, reporting
proceedings of meetings, and continuing the amount called for
in Financial Regulation 9(iv)(2) at $6,000. Its recommendations
were also considered in dealing with agenda items 8-11.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Audited Accounts for
Fiscal Year 1992</B><BR>

<P>
With the concurrence of the Finance
and Administration Committee, Council accepted the audited accounts
and agreed to continue with Flader &amp; Greene as auditors for
a second year.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Estimated Accounts for
Fiscal Year 1993</B><BR>

<P>
The estimated accounts to October 15th
were reviewed by the Finance and Administration Committee which
recognized that a surplus over expenditures would occur in 1993.
This surplus along with earnings would be added to the Working
Capital Fund (WCF) established in 1992. The Executive Secretary
proposed that the authorized WCF be increased to $100,000 to allow
for difficulties that may occur in receiving annual contributions.
The Committee recommended that in view of the uncertainty in scope
and responsibilities of PICES during its first years, a maximum
should not be set at this time. Council accepted this recommendation
(see Finance and Administration Committee report). <BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Budget for Fiscal Year
1994</B><BR>

<P>
The detailed components of the budget
were discussed by the Finance and Administration Committees, and
appropriations for travel, contractual services and annual meeting
costs were reduced to give a 1994 budget total of $440,000 CND.
<BR>

<P>
During the Finance and Administration
Committee meeting Dr. Hatanaka (Japan) inquired if there could
be a budgetary provision to pay the cost of bringing scientists
from various countries to PICES meetings. Mr. Wu (China) suggested
that while PICES internal funds should not be used for this purpose,
a special Trust Fund might be established to cover such travel
costs. Mr. Sullivan made it clear that while the United States
also could not support the use of appropriated funds for support
of travel to PICES meetings, a trust fund could provide a solution
to the problem. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Wu were then asked to developed
a proposal for consideration of Council.<BR>

<P>
Council agreed in principle with the
proposal to establish a Trust Fund. It was not clear whether the
Fund would be available for both member state and non member state
scientists or if it could also be used for the exchange of scientists.
The Chairman, together with the Chairman of Science Board and
the Executive Secretary, were asked to develop a simplified draft
for further consideration by Contracting Parties.<BR>

<P>
Salaries of the Secretariat staff were
discussed in the Finance and Administration Committee. It was
noted that the salary provisions of the Canadian Public Service
should serve as a guideline but were not binding on the Organization.
Committee recommendations on merit increases and adjustments were
approved by Council.<BR>

<P>
Council approved the 1994 budget as
revised by the Finance and Administration Committee (see report).
It was agreed that $80,000 CND would be transferred from the Working
Capital Fund to reduce the $110,000 CND contribution from each
Party to $90,000 CND for 1994.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Forecast Budget for
Fiscal Year 1995</B><BR>

<P>
The Forecast Budget for 1995, after
revision by the Finance and Administration Committee, was reviewed
by Council which agreed with the Committee that the budget reflected
the considerable uncertainty in the responsibilities of the Organization
during the next years. The Budget would be further reviewed in
the 1995 budgetary process.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item. 12 Report and Recommendations
of Science Board</B><BR>

<P>
The Chairman of the Science Board, Dr.
Ware summarized the report of the Board's meeting on 29 October
and presented its recommendations. The six Working Groups established
at the last Annual Meeting have met, and their work, summarized
in the report, has been reviewed by the relevant Scientific Committees
and the Board. Decisions on the following matters were proposed:
<BR>

<P>
1. <I>93/S/1 and 1.1</I>: Working Groups
should continue their activities, with a change in WG 2's terms
of reference, and with WG 1 replaced by WG 7 on Modelling of the
Subarctic Pacific Circulation. <BR>

<P>
2. <I>93/S/2 and 2.1</I>: A technical
report series, <I>PICES Scientific Reports</I>, should be established
and the reports of several Working Groups published therein.<BR>

<P>
3. <I>93/S/3</I>: Communication should
be enhanced using the most modern methods.<BR>

<P>
4. <I>93/S/4</I>: The exchange of scientific
information should be encouraged, and constraints thereon reviewed.
<BR>

<P>
5. <I>93/S/5</I>: The Secretariat with
the help of other bodies in PICES should initiate work with data
inventories and identification of non-routine data. <BR>

<P>
6. <I><B>93/S/6</B></I><B>: </B>A Workshop
on <I>Monitoring Subarctic Pacific Ocean Variability</I> should
be organized to review current status and advise on a strategy
for developing a PICES monitoring program.<BR>

<P>
7. <I><B>93/S/7</B></I><B>:</B> A proposal
for a visiting scientist program should be developed.<BR>

<P>
8. <I><B>93/S/8</B></I><B>:</B> A Workshop
on the <I>Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Region</I> should be organized
in Vladivostok.<BR>

<P>
9. <I><B>93/S/9</B></I><B>:</B> A Workshop
on <I>Climate Change and Carrying Capacity</I> should be organized
to develop a PICES/GLOBEC International program.<BR>

<P>
10. <I><B>93/S/10</B></I><B>: </B>Working
Group 3, renamed Coastal Pelagic Fish, should undertake specific
activities.<BR>

<P>
11. <I><B>93/S/11</B></I><B>: </B>Working
Group 4, renamed Data Exchange, should assist in implementing
93/S/5 and should give special attention to the exchange of fishery
and other biological data.<BR>

<P>
12. <I><B>93/S/12</B></I><B>:</B> Working
Group 5, on the Bering Sea, should undertake specific activities.
<BR>

<P>
<B>In connection with 93/S/1.1, Council
suggested that Working Group 7, should consult with Working Group
6 to ensure that the physical model can be used to force a biological
model. It noted that implementation of 93/S/7 is linked to the
proposal to establish a Trust Fund (see Agenda Item 10). With
regard to 93/S/9, if it were not possible to hold the proposed
separate Workshop, the scientific program of the Third Annual
Meeting should as appropriate accommodate the suggested topics.
With these comments, Council approved the Science Board Resolutions
(<I><B>93/A/4);</B></I></B> see
under Decisions of Council in Endnote 3.<BR>

<P>
The Science Board also approved a scientific
program for the Third Annual Meeting (see Agenda Item 13) and
addressed several questions directed to it by Council:<BR>

<P>
1. The Board proposed the following
mechanism for dealing with requests for advice from member countries.
<BR>

<P>
Upon receiving a written request for
advice, the Chairman will refer the question to Science Board
who would form an <U>ad hoc</U> committee to respond to the question.
The advice from this <U>ad hoc</U> committee will be referred
to Science Board for review, and forwarded by the Chairman for
consideration by Governing Council before forwarding to the requesting
party. If there were a need for establishing a permanent mechanism
for providing advice to a certain party, then the <U>ad hoc</U>
committee could be made permanent and it could be empowered by
Council to respond directly to requests. <BR>

<P>
While agreeing with this approach, Council
observed that requests might also come from other organizations
and established the following procedure.<BR>

<P>
<B>Upon receiving a written request
for scientific advice from another organization, the Chairman
will refer the question to Science Board who will propose a process
(e.g. refer to existing committee or to an<U><B> ad hoc</B></U><B>
working group as appropriate) to address the request. The question
and Science Board proposal for addressing it will be then referred
to the Governing Council for approval before action is undertaken.
The advice generated will be handled in the same manner as advice
offered in response to a request from Contracting Parties (reviewed
by Science Board, and considered by Governing Council before being
sent to the requesting organization) <I>(93/A/5)</I>.<BR>
</B></B>
<P>
2. The Board, in noting the value of
catch statistics for studies of the ecosystem as well as for fishery
management, proposed that compilation and dissemination of these
and other data should be discussed with NPAFC and other relevant
organizations.
<P>
3. The question about exchange of ship
schedules is treated in 93/S/5.<BR>

<P>
4. The Board considered how to minimize
cost of Working Group activities while maintaining their quality
and asked the Secretariat to review the cost of alternative approaches
(see Agenda Item 13).<BR>

<P>
5. The Board discussed the influence
on project funding of the adequacy of planning.<BR>

<P>
<B>Agenda Item 13. Future Meetings of
the Organization and Subsidiary Bodies<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Hatanaka, on behalf of Japan, proposed,
that the Third Annual Meeting be held in Nemuro on agreed dates
in October 1994. This proposal was welcomed and unanimously accepted
by Council. The scientific program proposed by the Science Board
(see their report) was also agreed.<BR>

<P>
With regard to dates for the meeting,
the suggestion of Dr. Davis that the meeting be extended by one
day to allow adequate review of the Science Board report before
Council takes action on its recommendations was accepted. Council
proposed, for Japanese consideration, that the meeting be scheduled
for 15-24 October 1994. Dr. Wooster was asked to develop a draft
schedule for review of delegates. <BR>

<P>
Mr. Liu reported that consideration
is being given to invite the Fourth Annual Meeting (1995) to be
held in China. Contracting Parties would be informed as soon as
a decision has been reached. <BR>

<P>
The need for longer range planning for
annual meetings was discussed. However, because of the possibility
of additional members, it seemed premature to agree on a pattern
of rotation for the meetings. Council agreed that the Fourth Annual
Meeting should be scheduled for the week of the 16th October,
1995.<BR>

<P>
The practical problems of scheduling,
location, and expenses of Working Group meetings were discussed
by the Finance and Administration Committee and Science Board.
Experience in 1993 had shown the value of holding these meetings
well in advance of the Annual Meeting. The Board thought meetings
three to six months in advance would be most likely to lead to
substantial and useful reports that could be given adequate consideration
before action by Council. On the other hand, costs might be reduced
if the groups met in connection with the Annual Meetings. Council
asked the Secretariat look into the relative cost of several alternatives
and report to the Third Annual Meeting. Taking this analysis into
account, the Chairman, in consultation the Chairman of the Science
Board and the Executive Secretary, should determine where and
when Working Groups should meet in 1994.<BR>

a. Space for the PICES office has been
increased at IOS to give Dr. Miyata an office and sufficient room
in Dr. McKone's office to meet with 3-4 people. The reception
area has increased to allow sufficient space for Ms. Chiu and
temporary help along with room for filing cabinets etc. Discussions
are continuing to find suitable space for storage and pictures
facilities. <BR>

<P>
b. Notebook computers and a printer
were purchased to use at annual meetings. Filing cabinets, book
cases, and a desk suitable for temporary help were purchased.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Communication<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Publications<BR>

<P>
a. The annual report was published and
circulated in February along with the second announcement and
a poster to advertise the second annual meeting.<BR>

<P>
b. The first Newsletter was circulated
in June along with the final announcement of the second annual
meeting. <BR>

<P>
c. The Secretariat published the Convention,
Rules of Procedure and Financial Rules for use by those interested.
<BR>

<P>
2. Communication<BR>

<P>
a. Improved communications were developed
with the IOS VAX computer to allow better access to Omnet and
Internet. <BR>

<P>
b. The Secretariat developed and published
a &quot;Directory&quot; of those involved in PICES and a special
effort was given to get Omnet and Internet addresses for exchange
of information. In addition an extensive mailing list has been
developed including libraries, organizations and individuals not
directly involved in PICES.<BR>

<P>
c. An Omnet Bulletin Board PICES.OCEAN
was set up for distributing information on PICES activities and
to allow other interested scientists to provide information that
would be of interest to those scientists working in the North
Pacific.<BR>

<P>
d. A list of scientists interested in
PICES activities has been developed and Dr. Miyata forwards relevant
information on PICES activities on Internet. Approximately 130
scientists from 6 countries are currently on the mailing list.
<BR>

<P>
e. The Secretariat is working with W.G.
4 to identify under-utilized physical and biological data sources
in the marine environment in the North Pacific. Contacts have
been made with ICES, WOCE, MEDS, and discussions have been held
with MacLain (NOAA) and McConnaughey (NMFS Alaska). The latter
contact has requested help on PICES.OCEAN to develop an information
base on the fishery resources of the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska
and West Coast.<BR>

<P>
f. The first attempt has been made to
collect ship schedules for member states and make them available
through PICES.OCEAN.<BR>

<P>
<B>Secretariat Matters<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Administrative/Financial<BR>

<P>
a. Action was taken to obtain an Order
in Council with the Canadian Government upon reaching agreement
on the Headquarters Agreement. The Order in Council will cover
such items as the non payment of income tax by foreign nationals
and the Goods and Services Tax by the Organization. To date we
have not received the Order in Council.<BR>

<P>
b. The B.C. Government was approached
to seek an agreement which would allow the non payment of provincial
income tax by foreign nationals and the provincial sales tax by
the Organization. To date we have not received an official response
to this request. They are waiting to see what the Federal Government's
action is relative to the Headquarters Agreement.
<P>
c. Flader and Greene was appointed auditor
in January and the audited report was circulated to Contracting
Parties in February.<BR>

<P>
d. As recommended by F&amp;A Report
(item 2) the establishment of a separate bank account for the
Working Capital Fund was considered but no action was taken. Creating
separate bank accounts would restrict the Executive Secretary
on being able to obtain a good return on funds not in use.<BR>

<P>
e. As recommended by the F&amp;A Report
(item 2) the possibility of depositing PICES funds in several
banks to meet the limits on deposit insurance was explored. No
action was taken as it would limit the Executive Secretary in
being able to manage the fund in the best interest of Contracting
Parties. <BR>

<P>
f. In accordance with item 7 of the
F&amp;A Report, staff rules were developed from comments provided
on a draft sent to Contracting Parties. These were in turn circulated
again for approval and they are now in force.<BR>

<P>
g. Agreements were reached with the
Government concerning Unemployment Insurance and the Canada Pension
Plan. Only Canadian citizens and landed immigrants are covered
by these plans.
<P>
h. Agreement was reached with the Pension
Society to cover Canadian citizens and landed immigrants by the
pension plan. Life insurance and long-term disability insurance
is also being provided to all employees by the Society.<BR>

<P>
i. Agreement was reached with the Pacific
Salmon Commission to cover PICES employees through their Dental
Plan, Extended Health Care Plan and B.C. Medical Plan. Without
this agreement PICES would have a great of difficulty meeting
these obligations at a reasonable rate because the number of permanent
staff is small.<BR>

<P>
j. Agreement was reached with the Workman's
Compensation Board to cover the costs related to accidents while
working on the job for the organizations.<BR>

<P>
k. According to Regulation 9e each staff
member is required to be bonded. I have had some difficulty in
finding a company willing to bond the staff. Negotiations are
still underway. <BR>

<P>
2. Staffing<BR>

<P>
a. The exchange of administration of
the Secretariat to the appointed Executive Secretary occurred
in the first half of January.<BR>

<P>
b. Interviews were held and Christina
Chiu was appointed Administrative Assistant in early February.
<BR>

<P>
c. Information provided by candidates
for the position of Assistant Secretary was reviewed and Dr. Motoyasu
Miyata reported in April.<BR>

organized in Vladivostok to review present knowledge of oceanography
and fisheries and the availability and exchange of data for implementing
collaborative oceanographic research projects in the region for
initial consideration by PICES III. The physical Oceanography
and Climate Committee should take the lead in establishing a Workshop
Steering Committee which should also include representatives of
the Biological Oceanography and Fishery Science Committees, and
Russian laboratories in Vladivostok.<BR>

<P>
<B>93/S/9:</B>
A workshop should be organized just prior to PICES III to develop
a PICES-GLOBEC <I>International Program on Climate Change and
Carrying Capacity</I>. Working Group 6 and Working Group 3 will
take a lead role in establishing a Workshop Steering Committee
that should also include representatives of the host agency, and
relevant PICES Science Committee members. The Steering Committee
and Working Group members should (a) develop a strategy for determining
the carrying capacity of the subarctic Pacific for salmon and
other high-trophic level, pelagic carnivores and its changes in
response to climate variations, (b) develop a plan for a cooperative
study of how changes in oceanic conditions affect the productivity
of key fish species such as salmonids in the subarctic Pacific
and clupeoids and scombrids in the coastal zones of the Pacific
Rim. For example, further study of existing or new salmon scale
samples would be profitable. Cooperation with the NPAFC and other
appropriate bodies should be invited.<BR>

<P>
<B>93/S/10:</B>
Working Group 3, renamed Working Group on Coastal Pelagic Fish,
will (a) compile an inventory of scientists working on key pelagic

from all sources with a view to completing an inventory and summary
of these data by PICES III, (c) plan a pan-Pacific comparison
of life table differences and recruitment based on these data,
and (d) begin planning a comparative trophodynamic model study
of coastal ecosystems around the Pacific rim, to understand how
these important systems support pelagic fish biomass, and how
changes in oceanic conditions may lead to changes in species dominance
and abundance (93/S/5 and 93/S/9).<BR>

<P>
<B>93/S/11:</B>
Working Group 4, renamed Working Group on Data Exchange, will

<P>
<CENTER><B>Modelling of the Subarctic
North Pacific Circulation</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Terms of Reference<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Although the subarctic oceans play an
important role in the earth's climate system as a region where
strong air-sea interactions occur and active ventilation of the
oceans takes place, the present state of modelling of the subarctic
oceans is not satisfactory even with respect to the physics. This
is one of the most important unresolved questions for constructing
an accurate climate forecasting system. In view of the importance
of modelling of the North Pacific Circulation for the global climate
forecast, the Working Group will:<BR>

<P>
-Review the status of present physical
modelling efforts on the subarctic North Pacific circulation and
identify the gaps and problem areas,
<P>
-Identify the kinds of observations
and other information needed to improve circulation models,
<P>
-Identify what kinds of knowledge of
the related physical processes and of local ocean dynamics (such
as in marginal seas) are needed to improve the circulation models,
and
<P>
-Identify how the incompleteness of
the present physical model of the subarctic North Pacific influences
other modelling efforts such as the global climate, ecosystems,
material transport, etc.<BR>

<P>
A focus on physical aspects of modelling
will be maintained.<BR>

<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The meeting of October 18 was called to order by the Chairman,
Dr. Warren S. Wooster, who welcomed all delegates, observers and
researchers to the Third Annual Meeting. Dr. Wooster introduced
Mr. Naotoshi Sugiuchi, Deputy Director General for Arms Control
and Scientific Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan.<BR>
<P>
<I>I would like to thank Dr. Wooster for the kind introduction.
It is a great honor to have the opportunity to welcome all participants,
especially those who have traveled great distances and spared
valuable time from their very busy schedules to attend this meeting.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Recently an earthquake of extraordinary scale struck this region.
In fact it was one of the largest ever experienced and it was
feared the damages caused by the earthquake might compel the postponement
of this meeting. That fortunately did not happen. I would like
to expressed my deep sympathy to the city of Nemuro, the host
city, for any serious damages that has been suffered by the citizens
and to property, and at the same time I sincerely appreciate all
the efforts the city of Nemuro made to meet the meeting schedule
in spite of the difficulties following the earthquake.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Nemuro, located at the eastern end of Japan, is one of the
key centers of Japanese fisheries, and the people have deep-roots
with the sea. Exactly one year ago, Nemuro held the Nemuro Workshop
on Western Subarctic Circulation in conjunction with several PICES
Working Group meetings. Today it is a great pleasure for Japan
to hold the PICES Third Annual Meeting here with the participation
of all those present.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>One duty of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan is to
promote both bilateral and multilateral cooperation in science
and technology. Scientific issues have become important to the
diplomatic agenda, and occupy the largest part of discussions
on international relations. The field of basic research, such
as space and high energy physics draw the world's attention and
the costs related to funding, facilities and time are enormous.
At the same time, there have also occurred global environmental
deterioration, energy shortages, an AIDS epidemic, and other global
issues, which must be urgently tackled as they threaten the foundation
of human existence. Research costs are increasing in terms of
needed facilities, the breadth of research required and the problems
country now face which tend to cross national borders. No country
alone can totally cope with current issues either scientifically
or economically. Global scale problems require international cooperation
on research, exchanges of researchers, information and data.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The sea was formed before the existence of human beings and
it has been deeply related to human life and large amounts of
time, effort, and money have been spent on marine science, and
this will continue to happen. In this sense, marine science, like
the Global Ocean Observing System Program, is one of the oldest
programs in mega science. It is almost a prerequisite in conducting
marine science to cooperate bilaterally and multilaterally. The
oceans cover 70 per cent of the surface of the globe, and it is
the last frontier on earth. In order to research them effectively,
it is essential to have coherent worldwide cooperation.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The North Pacific Region has a great impact on the global environment
and climate change. Marine science is a complex science which
continues to greatly contribute to the understanding of global
climate change. In this context, promoting multilateral cooperation
on marine science is a model case of collectively tacking marine
problems that humans face today.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The first PICES meeting was in Victoria in 1992, and since
then PICES has steadily expanded its activities. It has established
the Secretariat, held many workshops and working group meetings.
Above all, the Russian Federation has decided to accede to the
PICES Convention and delegates from the Russian Federation are
taking part in this meeting as observers. Participation of the
Russian Federation, which have a great amount of experience and
information related to the North Pacific area, will contribute
considerably to future PICES activities. With the addition of
Russian scientists participating at the annual meeting, PICES
will now be able to widen its scope of activities.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I hope that all participants will develop friendly relationships
with each other. The purpose of the PICES meeting is not only
to discuss and to exchange information and knowledge, but to also
network with scientists. I believe this networking will make our
research activities efficient and act as a catalysis to jointly
explore the greatest frontier on the planet. I hope that the meeting
will prove to be fruitful and show a spirit of cooperation.<BR>
</I>
<P>
The Chairman of Council, Dr. Wooster, spoke on behalf of PICES.
<BR>
<P>
<I>First may I comment on the passing of Academician Victor Ivanovich
Il'yichev, Director of the Pacific Oceanological Institute of
the Far-Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and
Chairman of the Far-Eastern Regional PICES Committee. Academician
Il'yichev attended our last meeting, in Seattle, and his support
was important to the development of Russian participation in PICES
scientific committees and working groups. May I ask you to rise
for a moment of silence in his memory.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In this connection, as many of you are aware, Russia has initiated
the process of being a member of PICES. This will come into effect
by the end of the present year. We are also in discussions with
officials of the Republic of Korea, and it is hoped that Korea
will soon accede to the organization. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Because many here have not previously attended a PICES meeting,
it might be helpful for me to say a bit about how the organization
functions. Some of you will have participated in the workshop
on the PICES-GLOBEC Program on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity.
The idea of this workshop came from two PICES working groups that
met last year; it was approved at the Second Annual PICES Meeting,
first by the Science Board and then by the Governing Council.
The Science Board consists of the chairmen of the four Scientific
Committees (Biological Oceanography, Fishery Science, Marine Environmental
Quality, and Physical Oceanography and Climate) and an elected
chairman. The Board is the scientific component of the governance
of the organization. The Governing Council, consisting of two
Delegates from each member country, makes the final decisions
on actions to be taken by PICES.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>So in general, scientific ideas arise in the working groups
and scientific committees, pass to the Science Board for review
and consolidation into a coherent scientific program, and then
go to the governmental representatives for approval. The opportunity
for most of you to contribute to this process at the present meeting
is through the workshops -- at the end of this week, there is
a second workshop, the PICES-STA Workshop on Monitoring the Subarctic
Pacific -- and in the meetings of the Scientific Committees. These
committees are meeting on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. The
meetings are open to all participants, and it is hoped you will
all attend the committee of your choice. That is your best chance
to start influencing the future course of PICES action.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Since the Second Annual Meeting in Seattle last year, several
working groups have met, planning was initiated for the workshops
of the present meeting, and the Secretariat and I have been busy
trying to make everything work. As in all such endeavors, there
is much more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye. I
would like to extend my thanks to all who have contributed to
this work over the year.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, I would like to comment on the speech of Director
General Ishikawa a few days ago at a reception offered by the
Japan Fishery Agency for participants in the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop.
That workshop was sponsored by the Agency whose help has been
most appreciated. Mr. Ishikawa noted the responsibility of PICES
to study marine issues from the scientific viewpoint and, in particular
to promote scientific study and research related to the use of
marine living resources. He sees a large role for PICES in developing
the scientific basis for decisions on resource use and looks forward
to the time that science will provide the recognized criteria
for such judgments. I hope that as PICES grows and develops its
effectiveness and its scientific constituency we will be in a
position to meet this challenge.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon the head of the Canadian delegation, Dr.
William Doubleday, to make a statement on behalf of his government.
<BR>
<P>
<I>I would like to thank Dr. Wooster and express that it is both
an honour and a pleasure for me to represent Canada at the Third
Annual Meeting of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization,
in Nemuro. One month ago, the International Council for the Exploration
of the Sea, ICES, met in St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada. When
I breathe the fresh salt air of Nemuro on my way to PICES sessions,
I am reminded of St. Johns. Both cities have a similar climate
and both cities have strong links to the sea.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I would like to recognize the work of several agencies of the
Japanese Federal Government, the Government of Hokkaido Prefecture
and the City of Nemuro in preparing for this meeting. I wish particularly
to commend the Local Arrangements Committee, whose hard work allowed
this meeting to occur without delay in spite of earthquake damage
to the main hall where PICES was to meet.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>During the past few days I have observed discussions of the
PICES-GLOBEC Workshop. I was impressed by the number of participants
from a wide range of scientific disciplines from countries all
around the North Pacific. The joint planning of this major ecological
research program brings together physical oceanographers, biologists,
climatologists and others to contribute their unique knowledge
and experience to a common goal. PICES-GLOBEC is providing a framework
to organize and coordinate marine research around the rim of the
North Pacific and across the North Pacific. Planning and implementing
PICES-GLOBEC represents a major new phase for PICES as we move
towards coordinating a joint research program.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>A few days ago, in Vladivostok, the North Pacific Anadromous
Fish Commission adopted a resolution about PICES-GLOBEC. The resolution
recognized again the two key issues identified last year by the
Commission - factors affecting productivity trends of the North
Pacific ecosystem together with their effect on salmonid carrying
capacity, and factors affecting trends in production of North
Pacific salmonids; but went further. This year's resolution offered
to share the Commission's records and documents related to salmonids
with PICES-GLOBEC and declared the Commission's desire to play
a leading role in the planning and implementation of parts of
PICES-GLOBEC which relate to salmonids. The Commission has proposed
joint discussions between its scientists and PICES scientists
to develop the PICES-GLOBEC plan.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Canada welcomes the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission
resolution and looks forward to a growing partnership between
the NPAFC and PICES in the coming years.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I have been informed that this year's attendance at PICES is
higher than last year's. Growing participation and a strong and
dynamic scientific program are clear signs that PICES is moving
forward into a new period of international scientific cooperation.
On behalf of all Canadian participants I look forward to a stimulating
and successful annual meeting. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon the acting head of the People's Republic
of China delegation, Prof. Yu-Kun Xu to make a statement on behalf
of his government.<BR>
<P>
<I>I would like to thank Dr. Wooster for the opportunity to speak
on behalf of the People's Republic of China. I would also like
to thank the local Japanese Government and the Japanese delegation
for their support in making it possible to hold the Third Annual
Meeting in beautiful Hokkaido.</I>
<P>
<I>Several strong earthquakes have recently occurred off the Hokkaido
area causing great loss to property of the people of the area.
I would like to express sympathy to all on behalf of the Chinese
delegation.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In addition, the Chinese delegation would like to extend a
warm welcome to our neighbor, the Russian Federation to join PICES,
thus becoming the fifth member of the PICES family.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Three years have passed since PICES came into being and during
this period Dr. Wooster has done a lot of work such as the coordination
of committee work, publication of PICES activities as well as
the promotion of PICES influence. The Secretariat headed by Dr.
McKone has also done a lot of work on behalf of setting up PICES.
The Chinese delegation would like to express our thanks for their
excellent work and will, as we have in the past, continue to support
PICES.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>After the formation of PICES, the focus is now on ocean scientific
research in the PICES region. At present, the issue of population
size, resources and the environment has drawn the world's attention.
Especially after UNCED, various nations and international agencies
are actively working on carrying out the principles and guidelines
of UNCED. The sustainable use of oceans and their resources described
in chapter 17 of agenda 21 becomes the main subject of ocean science.
It is worth mentioning, that this November, the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea will come into force. A new era of cooperation
will develop on oceanographic research and ocean development.
PICES should take advantage of the coming into force of the Law
of the Sea Convention to promote the advancement of ocean sciences
in the North Pacific region. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The North Pacific characterizes important ocean properties,
it has been one of the major research areas of oceanographers
and is one of the most rapidly developing economic areas of the
world. PICES should play an important role for the advancement
of ocean science and the development of the economy of the region.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The Chinese delegation, together with other countries, would
offer support for PICES activities in the future to allow PICES
to play a bigger role in international ocean science research.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon the U.S.A. delegate, Dr. William Aron,
to make a statement on behalf of his government. <BR>
<P>
<I>Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished citizens of Nemuro, it
is a great honor for the United States to participate in this
PICES meeting. It is easy to be last in the order of the opening
speeches and to simply agree with the important points made by
my colleagues both in terms of saying thank you to the organizers
and hosts for these sessions and emphasizing the growing importance
and contributions of PICES. I must, however, repeat the tributes
to the people of Nemuro for their extraordinary contributions
to these sessions in the face of a major natural environmental
assault.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I would like to make a few remarks about the current status
and role of PICES. The recent political perturbations associated
with the role of PICES in relation to other international organizations
to a large degree reflects a growing awareness of PICES as a formidable
intellectual enterprise. A truce, perhaps even genuine peace has
been restored, largely because reason has prevailed and there
is a recognition that PICES can play an important role in providing
the scientific underpinning for decisions regarding the wise use
of natural resources.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In recognizing the role that science may play, both in terms
of prediction and sustainable use of resources it is essential
to remember that our prime responsibility is to tell our leadership
not what they want to know, but what they must know to make effective
decisions.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I remain a wild eyed optimist about the future of PICES. The
presence of many old and distinguished friends in the audience
combined with so many young and very bright scientists makes it
clear that this young organization, while rooted with tradition,
also contains the vigor and enthusiasm that assures a bright and
lengthy future. While many people have made vital contributions
to our current state, I would particularly like to acknowledge
Warren Wooster for his role in establishing a solid foundation
for PICES in what has proven to be a rather unstable environment.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster thanked the Delegates for their remarks and introduced
Prof. Yutaka Nagata of Mie University to give the keynote lecture.
Prof. Nagata addressed the subject of the <I>Subarctic North Pacific
Ocean in Global Climate System</I>, describing the ocean circulation
and the transfer of heat and nutrients in the North Pacific and
Kuril Island region off Northern Japan.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>REPORT OF GOVERNING COUNCIL MEETINGS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Governing Council met on October 18, 20 and 24, under the
Chairmanship of Dr. Wooster. The Executive Secretary, Dr. W. Doug
McKone, served as rapporteur.<BR>
<P>
All Contracting Parties were represented at the three sessions
(Endnote 1). The Chairman of the Science Board, Dr. Dan Ware was
in attendance during part or all of each session.<BR>
<P>
At the first session, the Chairman welcomed the delegates and
noted that there were some new permanent delegates, notably Dr.
T. Sasaki who replaced Dr. H. Hatanaka and Dr. W.G. Doubleday
who replaced Dr. L.S. Parsons. Dr. D.J. Noakes and Mr. H.D. Guo
replaced Dr. J.C. Davis and Mr. C.M. Liu respectively for this
Annual Meeting. The Chairman reviewed the agenda and proposed
the order in which to take up the various items. This report summarizes
the treatment of each agenda item during the course of the three
sessions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Preliminary Report on Administration<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary summarized the activities of the Secretariat
during the previous year (Endnote 2). During the reporting it
was decided that Science Board should review the utility of the
ship schedule document prepared by the Secretariat, consider how
it could be made more useful, and provide recommendations to Council.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Relations with Other International Organizations
and Observers from such Organizations <BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Wooster expressed his pleasure that Prof. V.K. Zilanov, Chairman
of the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, was present at
the meeting and asked consent that he be invited to attend sessions
of Council. This was agreed.
<P>
Prof. Zilanov indicated that the NPAFC strongly supports cooperation
with PICES through the development of programs that meet the goals
of both organizations. Prof. Zilanov reported that the NPAFC is
prepared to work jointly on two critical issues and proposed that
PICES scientists join in a <I>Research Planning and Coordinating
Meeting</I> the week of March 6-10, 1995 (Endnote 3). Dr. Wooster
thanked Prof. Zilanov for his report and indicated that this was
a good opportunity for both organizations to further develop a
spirit of cooperation. <BR>
<P>
Council reviewed the text of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) and
approved its implementation (Decision 94/A/1). Similarly, Council
discussed with Prof. Zilanov the possibility of developing an
MOU with the NPAFC. Prof. Zilanov agreed that the development
of an MOU would form a good basis for cooperation between the
two organizations. Council approved the proposal and the Executive
Secretary was instructed to undertake the development of the MOU
over the next few months jointly with the NPAFC Secretariat and
circulate it to delegates for approval (Decision 94/A/2). <BR>
<P>
Council briefly discussed the formation of a new international
organization with responsibilities for management of fisheries
in the central Bering sea (Donut Hole). It was agreed that PICES
should establish relations with it once the organization becomes
operational.<BR>
<P>
The Executive Secretary provided a list of Organizations that
are currently invited to participate in the Annual Meeting. In
the past, the list was circulated for approval before each meeting.
This process was unnecessarily complicated and he recommended
that the Governing Council approve a standing list that members
of Council could change as required at subsequent Annual Meetings.
The Governing Council approved the adoption of a standing list
of observers ( Decision 94/A/3 and Endnote 4).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Membership and Observers from Other Countries
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Wooster reported that the Russian Federation and the Republic
of Korea had sent observer delegations to this Annual Meeting
and suggested that they be allowed to attend Council Meetings
as observers. Council agreed with the proposal and Dr. Wooster
welcomed Dr. Kotenev and Dr. Shaboneev of the Russian Federation
and Mr. Doo and Dr. Huh from the Republic of Korea.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Kotenev reported that the Russian Federation had filed its
intent to join about 90 days previously and he thought that the
government would soon (perhaps during this meeting) file its instrument
of ratification.<BR>
<P>
Mr. Doo reported that Korea was attempting to obtain funding for
support of its application to join. The funding support will be
decided in the next month or two and the Republic of Korea would
then likely be in a position to file a letter of intent. Mr. Doo
further emphasized that the Republic of Korea was determined to
join PICES as soon as funding was available. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Wooster thanked both delegations for their reports and he
expressed, on behalf of Council, how important it was for PICES
that both countries become members. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Election of Chairman <BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Xu replaced Dr. Wooster as Chairman to call for nominations
for Chairman of Council. In accordance with the Rules of Procedure,
delegates were provided ballots for nomination of candidates for
Chairman. A single candidate, Dr. Wooster was nominated and elected
unanimously. The delegates congratulated Dr. Wooster on his re-election
for a second term. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Report of Finance and Administration Committee
<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the absence of its Chairman, Dr. John C. Davis, the Finance
and Administration Committee met under the Acting Chairmanship
of Mr. William L. Sullivan, Jr., who presented the report to the
Governing Council (see F &amp; A report for text). The report
was accepted by Council.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Audited Accounts for Financial Year 1993<BR>
</B>
<P>
With the recommendation of the Finance and Administration Committee,
the Governing Council accepted the audited accounts and agreed
to continue with Flader and Greene as auditors for another year
(Decision 94/A/4).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Estimated Accounts for Financial Year 1994<BR>
</B>
<P>
The estimated accounts from October 1 to December 31 were reviewed
by the Finance and Administration Committee that recognized a
surplus over expenditures would occur in 1994. This surplus along
with earnings would be added to the Working Capital Fund (WCF).
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Budget for Financial Year 1995<BR>
</B>
<P>
The detailed components of the budget were discussed by the Finance
and Administration Committee, appropriations were reduced in most
categories and funds for a new workshop were provided to give
a 1995 budget total of $440,000 CND, the same as last year (Decision
94/A/5).<BR>
<P>
Salary increases for staff based on merit were accepted by the
Finance and Administration Committee and a new full time continuing
secretarial position was recommended. The Governing Council approved
the merit increases and the new secretary position.
<P>
The Governing Council approved the 1995 budget as revised by the
Finance and Administration Committee. It was also agreed that
$240,000 surplus from the WCF would be shared equally by the Contracting
Parties. Members would inform the Executive Secretary no later
than December 15, 1994 how they wish to disburse their share.
The WCF for 1995 is expected to be approximately $28,000 CND (Decision
94/A/5).<BR>
<P>
Dr. Aron pointed out that the $240,000 surplus in the Working
Capital Fund was generated by contributions to PICES and it should
be used in support of PICES objectives. He urged Contracting Parties
to consider allocating some or all of the surplus to the PICES
Trust Fund which was set up to further the activities of PICES.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Forecast Budget for Financial Year 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
The forecast budget for 1996 was revised by the Finance and Administration
Committee to reflect the changes in the 1995 budget. The Governing
Council agreed with the adjustments as the budget was only for
planning purposes (Decision 94/A/5). Council noted that the membership
was likely to increase in 1995 and further revisions would likely
be required.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Trust Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The expenditures from the account and guidelines for administrating
the account were reviewed in the Finance and Administration Committee.
The provisional guidelines were amended to emphasize that junior
scientists should be considered when accepting applications. Council
approved the revised guidelines as permanent and requested that
the Secretariat develop options for funding the Trust Fund and
report on these at the next Annual Meeting (Decision 94/A/4).
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Report and Recommendations of Science Board
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman of Science Board, Dr. Ware summarized the report
of the Board's meeting on October 22 and 23 and presented its
recommendations. Five working groups met during the year and their
work, summarized in the report, has been reviewed by the relevant
Scientific Committees and Science Board. Two workshops convened
during this Annual Meeting reported their recommendations to Science

<P>
The Science Board also approved a scientific program for the Fourth
Annual Meeting (See Science Board Report) and addressed questions
directed to it by Council:<BR>
<P>
1. The Board noted that the ship schedule document prepared by
the Secretariat was not very useful and proposed that the Chairman
of Council and the Secretariat prepare a scheme indicating what
information is required on what time schedule and how it might
be most effectively disseminated. The scheme should be circulated
to interested parties with a view to having a specific proposal
for consideration at PICES IV.<BR>
<P>
Council approved the Science Board proposal to develop a ship
schedule scheme for consideration at PICES IV. <BR>
<P>

will be established. The first function of this group will be
to examine the possibility of having the existing INPFC annual,
summary catch statistics converted to electronic data files, so
these data can be more easily accessed by scientists working on
PICES programs (like PICES-GLOBEC), and by the global science
community. The task group will report to the Technical Committee
on Data Exchange. <BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/6:</B> The Secretariat will arrange to have TINRO's (Vladivostok)
detailed inventories of scientific surveys undertaken since 1984
translated from Russian into English. The Secretariat together

with TCODE and initiation of retrospective analyses and development
of circulation and regional food web models.<BR>
<P>
5. The invitation of NPAFC to participate in their <I>Research
Planning and Coordinating Meeting</I>, tentatively scheduled for
the week of March 6-10 in Seattle is accepted. Subsequently, NPAFC-PICES
Scientific Liaison Group will be established jointly with the
CSRS of the NPAFC to develop the implementation plan for the part
of the CCCC Program dealing with anadromous species, including
exchange of relevant data as suggested by NPAFC. This group will
be chaired by a person designated by the NPAFC. The liaison group
will report to the PICES-GLOBEC Steering Committee. <BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/8:</B> An interdisciplinary working group <I>Subarctic
Pacific Monitoring</I> (WG 9) will be established (see Appendix
1 B. 4 for terms of reference). The membership of the WG will
consist of two people from each member country, with credentials
in the scientific and technical areas concerned with the monitoring
activities. The Chairman will be named by the PICES Science Board.
<BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/9:</B> Member States are encouraged to support the development
of the new technology required for monitoring identified in the
report of the PICES-STA Workshop on <I>Monitoring in the Subarctic
North Pacific</I>. Particular attention should be paid to the
development of autonomous biological instrumentation, without
which monitoring of ecosystem response to climate forcing will
be particularly difficult.<BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/10: </B>A new MEQ working group (WG 8) <I>Practical Assessment
Methodology</I> will be established (see Appendix 1 B.(3) for
terms of reference). WG 2 <I>Development of Common Assessment
Methodology</I> will disband.<BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/11: </B>WGs on specific regions (<I>Coastal Pelagic Fish</I>,
and <I>Bering Sea</I>) will review current monitoring of the ecosystems
in those regions and will advise on cost-effective ways whereby
it might be strengthened. WG 3 (<I>Coastal Pelagic Fish</I>: FIS)
will spend one more year completing the work it began on: (a)
compiling an inventory of scientists studying pelagic fish, and
(b) comparing life table differences. WG 4 (<I>Data Exchange</I>:
SB) will be replaced by a new technical committee (see Decision
94/S/4). WG 5 (<I>Bering Sea</I>: SB) will continue until mid-1996
(see Decision 94/S/12). WG 6 (<I>Subarctic Gyre</I>: SB) has completed
its terms of reference, and will disband. WG 7 (<I>Modelling of
the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation</I>: POC) will complete
its terms of reference over the next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/12: </B>WG 5 on the <I>Bering Sea</I> will organize a
one-day symposium on the Bering Sea to be held in conjunction
with the PICES IV general meeting. Following the symposium the
WG will convene in early 1996 in order to review the symposium
and to formulate a set of topics that would be the genesis for
a new, focused WG. The current WG will then disband. The WG will
continue preparation of the review volume on the Bering Sea under
the direction of the WG's editorial committee, headed by Dr. T.
Loughlin (U.S.A.) and Prof. K. Ohtani (Japan). Members of the
Editorial Committee will meet as two subgroups, in Asia and in
North America, early in 1995. Subsequent coordination will be
conducted by correspondence. PICES will take responsibility to
arrange publication of the book when completed, preferably through
a commercial publisher. <BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/13:</B> Taking into account the Science Board recommendation
to support the travel of outside scientists who can contribute
significantly to PICES activities, and that of young scientists,
the Executive Secretary, in consultation with the Chairman and
the Chairman of the Science Board, will develop procedures for
selecting scientists for support from the Trust Fund, once funding
sources have been found.<BR>
<P>
<B>94/S/14:</B> Letters received seeking endorsement of meetings/symposia
outside PICES will be forwarded to the appropriate Science Committee
Chairman. His views will be forwarded to the Chairman of Science
Board for action.<BR>
<BR>

data between participants and to external data users, as a mechanism
to control the quality and relevance of the data. <BR>
<P>
d. The WG will report regularly to the PICES Science Board.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>C. Selected Recommendations from WG 4 Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
4.2.1 Recognizing that PICES is a new organization, and noting
that many of the data exchange issues may have already been addressed
by other science organizations, and wanting to make the development
of PICES data exchange mechanisms the most cost-effective and
efficient, <B>WG 4 recommends that PICES visit or contact international
science organizations to review their data inventories, data exchange
functions, etc., and report on the findings.</B>
<P>
4.2.2 Recognizing that many organizations have already produced
inventories of their data holdings in the PICES region, <B>WG
4 recommends that a master inventory (inventory of inventories)
in the PICES region be developed as a long-term goal of PICES.</B>
Initially, the master inventory might be as simple as a bibliography
of available inventories, This might not necessarily involve active
searches for existing inventories but rather PICES should establish
a mechanism whereby member nations can submit lists of existing
inventories to PICES. Data collections from future PICES projects
should be listed in these inventory lists.<BR>
<P>
4.2.3 <B>WG 4 recommends that PICES continue the development of
the Healey et al. (1985) inventory</B> for the eastern Pacific
and expand the inventory to the central and western Pacific if
these inventories do not currently exist. <BR>
<P>
4.2.4 WG 4 noted that more descriptive and more comprehensive
metadata (information about data) inventories will be required
for new PICES science projects in the North Pacific, particularly
for science surveys. The inventory will provide the necessary
detail about what, how, when, and where data were collected. <B>WG
4 recommends that PICES develop a detailed inventory that can
accommodate recent (perhaps beginning with 1991) and future scientific
surveys in the PICES region.</B> In developing this inventory,
it will be important for member nations to submit information
annually about surveys to PICES using existing standard formats
where possible. For some institutions, this will not be a new
reporting requirement as they already submit survey reports to
international organizations. One example that PICES could consider
for use is the ROSCOP format used by the IOC/IODE.<BR>
<P>
4.3.2 <B>WG 4 recommends that PICES facilitate the exchange of
unique data sets (e.g., Ocean Station 'PAPA' time series 1956-1981)
by entering into cooperative ventures with other organizations
(e.g., World Data Centre A, MEDS, etc.) to produce CD-ROMs for
general distribution.<BR>

1. Membership<BR>
<P>
a. As agreed by Council in 1993 a letter was sent encouraging
the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea to seek membership
in PICES. On July 5, 1994 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
notified the depository (Department of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade) of the PICES Convention, in Ottawa, of its desire to accede
to the Convention. Canada informed Member States on July 19, 1994.
If Member States raise no objections, Russia could deposit its
instrument of accession in October, to be effective 60 days later.
<BR>
<P>
b. On August 31, 1994 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the
Republic of Korea indicated that it is trying to secure the necessary
funds to support their membership in PICES. This decision will
likely be made sometime in November. <BR>

of Time Series of Physical, Chemical, Biological and Fisheries
Data from the Eastern North Pacific</I> by Healey et al (1985).
A letter of inquiry was sent to 32 marine science institutions
in North America asking for the information on the time series
data that they might have collected recently to include in the
new version. The Secretariat has received 15 replies to date.
The Secretariat plans to finish updating the inventory and have
it available in machine-readable form by mid-1995. <BR>

<P>
<B>Communication<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Publications<BR>
<P>
a. The Annual Report was published and circulated in early February
to all PICES members, international organizations and libraries.
<BR>
<P>
b. Newsletters were circulated in early February and together
with the Annual Report in early August. <BR>
<P>
c. The First Announcement for the Third Annual Meeting was distributed
in early February.<BR>
<P>
d. The Final Announcement for the Third Annual Meeting was distributed
in early June.<BR>
<P>
e. A poster for the Third Annual Meeting was distributed in early
February. Posters for the PICES-GLOBEC and PICES-STA Monitoring
Workshops were printed in Japan, and sent out by the Secretariat
in early July.<BR>
<P>
f. The Vladivostok Workshop First Announcement was printed and
sent out in late August.<BR>
<P>
g. WG 4 report was distributed to the Chairman, Science Board
Chairman, Scientific Committee members and WG 4 members in mid-August.
WGs 3, 5 and 7 reports were circulated to Scientific Committee
Chairman, Science Board Chairman, Scientific Committee members
and the respective WG members in late August. <BR>
<P>
h. Three Science Plan drafts for the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop were
sent to all PICES active participants plus a special list. Comments
on the plan were forwarded to the Steering Committee members.
<BR>
<P>
i. The PICES Directory was distributed in early March and updated
and sent out again in early August. <BR>
<P>
j. The PICES Handbook was revised and circulated in early April.
<BR>
<P>
k. A volume of abstracts for the Third Annual Meeting was prepared
for circulation at the Annual Meeting. <BR>
<P>
l. PICES Scientific Report No. 1 containing the 1993 reports of
WGs 3 and 6 was circulated to Delegates, Chairman, Science Board
Chairman, Scientific Committee members and members of WGs 3 and
6 in mid-September.<BR>
<P>
2. Communication<BR>
<P>
a. In April 1994, the Secretariat distributed a questionnaire
to PICES members (who are listed in the PICES Directory) and the
users of Internet (who are on the PICES e-mail list) to determine
if the PICES bulletin board on Omnet and sending news via Internet
was useful or could be modified to improved their use.<BR>
<P>
The results indicate that most of the users are satisfied with
the information being provided but a number of improvements were
suggested. Almost all of the users are interested in receiving
relevant information, but some of them find the e-mail messages
too long. A large majority support the use of Internet as the
basis of our service with a few wishing to maintain Omnet.<BR>
<P>
The Secretariat is seeking support to set up our own bulletin
board which would only be accessible via Internet. Once such a
bulletin board is established, the Omnet service would be discontinued.
Those not on Internet will be served by mail.<BR>
<P>
b. The Secretariat developed a communication policy based on cost
factors of fax, mail, and e-mail (appendix). The fax use by the
Secretariat increased over the year, for example, from mid-July
to mid-September 1000 fax messages were sent and received. An
analysis of the average time it takes for mail to reach the Secretariat
from member countries (all sources combined) has also been examined
in relation to costs.<BR>
<P>
c. Appointment of the contact persons for ship schedule by all
four member countries was completed in March 1994. Subsequently,
the Secretariat sent a letter to each of the four persons asking
their opinions on how the ship schedule should be designed and
distributed. U.S.A. and Japan replied. Subsequently, the Secretariat
sent a letter asking for ship schedule information from each country.
US schedule information from one fleet was received, by e-mail,
from various institutions over a period of time. The Secretariat
received the Japanese ship schedules in July. Canada supplied
the necessary information in September. So far no information
has been received from China. The Secretariat compiled the schedules
of the three countries in loose bound form to circulate to those
who would like to receive it by mail.<BR>
<P>
In PICES PRESS Vol. 2. No. 2, an article about the ship schedule
was written informing PICES scientists of the availability of
the ship schedules. To date the Secretariat has not received a
request for the ship schedules.
<P>
<B>Secretariat Matters<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Administration/Financial<BR>
<P>
a. No action was taken by the Secretariat with regard to 93/S/7
concerning the development of a <I>Visiting Scientist Program
</I>during this past year.<BR>
<P>
b. As discussed under Agenda Item 2 of the 1993 Governing Council
Report, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was drafted between
PICES and the IOC. The draft was circulated to delegates for review
and comment on March 10, 1994. The draft was revised based on
the comments and forwarded to the IOC for their approval. Recently,
the Secretariat contacted the IOC regarding the status of the
MOU and we expect to receive it from them in the near future.
<BR>
<P>
c. The PICES Privileges and Immunities Order was passed on December
15, 1993. PICES can now recover the 7% Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on expenditures and need not pay income tax for foreign
nationals working in the Secretariat from that date on. The Finance
Department is processing a Remission Order which would back date
the original order to January 8, 1993 when the Headquarters Agreement
was signed by PICES and the Government of Canada. The Secretariat
is putting together a claim for reimbursement of the GST starting
from 8th January 1993. Additionally, the Revenue Department has
accepted our claim under the Order and has returned income tax
paid on behalf of Dr. Miyata during 1993 to the PICES account.
<BR>
<P>
d. On January 26, 1994, the United States Government extended
to PICES the same privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred
by the International Organizations Immunities Act.<BR>
<P>
e. At our request, the British Columbia Government recently passed
an order granting PICES the privilege to not pay the Provincial
Sales Tax (PST) of 7% from 8th January, 1993. The Secretariat
is currently undertaking the process to recover past expenditures
and we have notified suppliers that PST will not be paid in the
future.<BR>
<P>
f. In accordance with Agenda Item 13 of the Governing Council
regarding future meetings of the Organization and subsidiary bodies,
the Secretariat was asked to compile a relative cost schedule
(including airfare, per diem allowance and hotel accommodation)
of six selected locations. A separate report has been prepared
by the Secretariat for circulation at this meeting.<BR>
<P>
g. As reported by the F&amp;A Committee (Agenda Item 12, 1993),
APEC has now submitted a proposal to the Secretariat to undertake
a USD $5,000 contract to collect information on marine organizations
working in the Pacific, their principal officers, and their objectives
and current and planned activities in relation to the UNCED Agenda
21 follow-up (Ocean Chapter). The objective of the proposal is
to establish a network amongst APEC and other organizations, developing
collaborative programs and planning objectives and avoiding costly
duplication of effort between organizations.<BR>
<P>
The Secretariat has accepted the proposed contract which will
be completed by April 1, 1995.<BR>
<P>
h. Flader and Greene was retained as auditor for another year.
The report for 1993 was circulated March 14, 1994.<BR>
<P>
i. The fax machine was replaced with a new model that reduces
the cost of sending messages and greatly reduces the time required
to send multiple messages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
2. Space, Facilities and Equipment<BR>
<P>
a. Space for PICES has been greatly increased with the addition
of a large room adjacent to current office space. This room can
be used for storage as well as for other uses (pictures, mailouts,
and secondments that need space). <BR>
<P>
b. An additional desk top computer will be purchased this year
as it is contemplated that additional help will be required for
most of next year.<BR>
<P>
3. Staffing<BR>
<P>
A part-time employee was taken on in early July to do secretarial
work this year. There is sufficient work to keep her busy well
into the new fiscal year. It is expected that a full-time position
might be needed in 1996. Workload increases have been experienced
at every level this year, and this is expected to continue, particularly
with the possibility of the addition of two new member states
next year.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Appendix<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Communication Policy for Facsimile, Postal and Courier Services
<BR>
</B>
<P>
a. Where possible the Secretariat should send all information
by Internet as there is no cost of the service to PICES.<BR>
<P>
b. All mail that does not require a response is sent by first-class
mail. This includes mailouts of letters, the Newsletter, the Annual
Report and the PICES Scientific Reports etc.<BR>
<P>
c. All correspondence with Member States, Committees, and WGs
that requires a response is sent by Internet or fax (provided
the document does not have too many pages). Each shall include
a request for confirmation of receipt.<BR>
<P>
d. All draft Working Group Reports that need to be circulated
to members of the Committees and WGs prior to the Annual Meeting
will be sent by first-class mail.<BR>
<P>
e. Larger documents that need a response from Member States are
sent by express mail. Similarly, in an extreme case (because of
cost), this also holds true for large documents that require a
response by Committee Chairmen and Working Group Chairmen but
if they must discuss this document with their members, the members
will not be sent the document by express mail. In the latter case
it is up to the Committee and Working Group Chairmen to schedule
their work in a way that will allow for exchange of large documents
through the mail system.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Excerpt from the NPAFC Committee on Scientific Research
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>and Statistics 1994 Annual Report<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>The Committee on Scientific Research and Statistics reaffirms
the need for NPAFC and PICES to jointly examine two critical issues
identified last year by the Commission: <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(i) The factors affecting current trends in the productivity
of the North Pacific Ocean and their impacts on salmonid carrying
capacity.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(ii) The factors affecting changes in biological characteristics
of Pacific salmon. These characteristics include growth, size
at maturity, age at maturity, oceanic distribution, survival and
abundance.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The CSRS Committee is pleased to note that the proposed PICES-GLOBEC
Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC) program would include
studies on anadromous resources. NPAFC liaison member at the PICES-GLOBEC
Workshop in Nemuro should convey the following points regarding
cooperation on the CCCC program:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(i) The NPAFC has a large body of documents and data of historical
research on the oceanography and the living marine resources in
the North Pacific Ocean that it would share with PICES-GLOBEC
for implementation of the CCCC program.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(ii) The NPAFC wishes to take the lead role in the development
and implementation of that part of the CCCC program dealing with
anadromous species.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(iii) The Committee expects that the liaison member and other
CSRS members who will be attending the Nemuro PICES-GLOBEC Workshop
would contribute their scientific advice at the workshop and other
discussions about the PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan with the view
of promoting the interests of NPAFC to have the two critical issues
identified by the Commission to be incorporated fully into the
PICES-GLOBEC work plan.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(iv) The Committee <U>RECOMMENDS</U> that a &quot;Research
Planning and Coordinating Meeting&quot;, tentatively scheduled

REPORT OF OPENING SESSION<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The meeting of October 16 was called to order by the Chairman,
Dr. Warren S. Wooster, who welcomed all delegates, observers and
researchers to the Fourth Annual Meeting. Dr. Wooster called on
Vice Minister Yanxi Zhang of the Ministry of Agriculture to make
a statement on behalf of the Chinese Government.<BR>
<P>
<I>I would like to thank Dr. Wooster for the kind introduction.
I am exceedingly honored to be able to deliver a speech on behalf
of China the host of the Fourth Annual Meeting of the North Pacific
Marine Science Organization held here in Qingdao. The present
meeting includes two new member nations, Russia and the Republic
of Korea. I wish to express my warm congratulations to them. And,
on behalf of the Chinese government, I am very pleased to extend
my warm welcome to all the delegates, especially those colleagues
who have come from afar to participate in the meetings. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The Chinese government has always supported bilateral and multilateral
exchange and cooperation in science and technology with all the
countries in the world. Today, environment deterioration, energy
shortage and other problems have caused concerns for the world
as they threaten human life. As we all know, the environment was
the major subject of the NGO Forum of the Fourth World Women Conference
recently held in Beijing. To solve these problems, there needs
to be a wide range of international cooperation as well as mutual
exchange of scientific and technical personnel, information and
data.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The ocean and sea occupy more than 70% of the total surface
area of the earth and they have a close relationship with human
existence. Human beings have put a lot of time, energy and financial
resources into marine scientific research. Inputs of these kinds
will increase in the future and many global marine research projects,
such as the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics and Global Ocean Observation
System, are bilateral and multilateral cooperative projects that
require participation by scientists from different countries.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The North Pacific sea waters play an important role in the
global environment and climatic changes. In March 1992, the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization was set up in order to establish
an international science organization that is open to all countries
along the coastal area, commonly promoting and coordinating scientific
research on sea waters and to increase knowledge about the biological
resources of the North Pacific ocean and adjacent sea waters.
This research is aimed at not only the ocean environment, but
also the interaction of sea, land, meteorology and their effect
on the global climate and climatic change, and the effect on the
fauna and flora and ecology and the utilization of resources,
as well as the effect of human activities on the oceans. Though
this Organization has existed for only 3 years, it has accomplished
a lot in a short time .<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>China, as a coastal nation of the North Pacific, is one of
the major world marine fishing counties which has actively participated
in all related activities of this region. Under the circumstances
of limited available land resources, making full use of the oceans
will be an area of future development potential.. Therefore, research
on protection of the oceans by China and other member countries
and international scientific and technological cooperation to
realize the aims of this Organization will play a very important
role in the future. I hope, through the active cooperation of
all member nations, we will carry out more scientific research
in the North Pacific region in order to collect and exchange scientific
research data and effectively and rationally use and protect the
resources of this region and make a contribution to the development
of mankind.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I hope that, through this meeting, all participants can not
only discuss and exchange information on research activities,
but also promote cooperation and further make many friends. Finally,
I wish this Annual Session a complete success.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called on Mr. Wenhe Yang, Vice Director of the State
Oceanic Administration to make a statement on behalf of his agency.
<BR>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,</I> <I>on behalf of the
State Oceanic Administration of the People's Republic of China,
I would like to extend our warm welcome to those hosting the Fourth
PICES Annual Meeting held in this beautiful seaside city, Qingdao.
We would also like to extend a warm welcome to all scientists
from Canada, Japan, Korea, Russia, the United States and China
and delegates from international organizations who have come here
for discussions on North Pacific regional marine science programs
in which we are all interested.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Since PICES' formation in 1992, the Chairman, Dr. W.S. Wooster
actively contributed to the organization and coordination of its
scientific activities and extended its international influence.
We are also very glad to recognize the Secretariat headed by Executive
Secretary Dr. W.D. McKone, and their contribution has been tremendous
and highly effective to the work PICES. The State Oceanic Administration
of the People's Republic of China highly appreciates their work.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Though PICES has not existed long, its scientific activities
and potential role in the North Pacific has gained the appreciation
and general attention of governments and scientists in this region.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>As we all know, the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea came into force on Nov. 16, 1994. Since then, marine awareness
of peoples from all over the world has increased. Protection of
the marine environment and promotion of marine resources utilization
and sustainable development have become universal issues to which
all nations pay great attention. PICES is the only multilateral
comprehensive marine science organization in the area. It undoubtedly
plays an important role in the above mentioned issues on marine
science research and economic development.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The State Oceanic Administration of the People's Republic of
China and its subordinate units and scientists will continue to
support PICES' work ,by helping it play a greater role in the
marine science study in this area.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, I wish the meeting a full success, wish all participants
and delegates a happy time in China.<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon Mr. Shu Sun, Vice President, National
Natural Science Foundation of China to provide a few words from
his agency.<BR>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it
is a great honor for me to say a few words on the occasion of
the opening ceremony of the Fourth PICES Annual Meeting. First
of all, on behalf of the National Science Foundation of China
(NSFC), I would like to express a warm welcome to the representatives
from abroad and in China, and to extend my heartfelt congratulations
on the opening of this Meeting. I am pleased that the Fourth Annual
Meeting is being held in Qingdao, China. One task of the meeting
is to review the scientific work during the past year and to develop
a plan of PICES activities for the coming year. In addition, the
science committees and working groups of PICES will have working
meetings and a scientific symposium. Professor Lin Hai, the deputy
director of the Department of Earth Science, NSFC, will attend
the meeting to hear discussion on some scientific problems. We
are greatly interested in marine resources and the environment,
especially, to changes in the abundance of marine organisms, sources
and circulation of the chemical pollutants, the impact of the
environment on the Pacific, and its marginal seas, and the climate
of both China and the world. Since 1986, NSFC has actively supported
the aforementioned scientific projects in the scope of Earth Science
and Life Science. I believe that mutual cooperation and information
exchange between scientists will promote research activities in
these fields and make greater contributions to the cause of PICES.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The main tasks and responsibility of the NSFC are to direct,
coordinate and finance basic research and part of applied research
in accordance with the guiding principles policies and plans of
the State for the Development of Science and Technology by making
effective use of available science funds; to give advice on major
issues in relation to basic research and part of applied researches
and undertake the evaluation of key state laboratories according
to the entrustment concerned; to discover and train talented personnel
to establish relations with the science foundations and relevant
scientific organizations of other countries and regions and carry
out international scientific cooperation and exchange.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>NSFC consists of 6 academic departments and a division, i.e.
Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Department of
Chemistry, Department of Life Sciences, Department of Earth Sciences,
Department of Material and Engineering Sciences, Department of
Information Science, and the Division of Management Science, and
four bureaus, i.e. Bureau of Planning, Bureau of International
Cooperation, Bureau of Policy, and Bureau of Personnel; as well
as an administrative office.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The funds of NSFC amount to 500 million Chinese yuan in 1995.
On the average each year, NSFC makes grants to about 60,000 scientists
and 20,000 postgraduates, and receives 20,000 proposals from universities
and research institutes. It is also one of the main channels for
international scientific cooperation and exchange in China. Up
to now, NSFC has signed bilateral agreements and memoranda of
understanding of scientific cooperation with 34 science foundations
and other academic institutions in 27 countries and 2 regions.
Therefore, I would take this opportunity to inform you that, in
our field, NSFC will make every effort to encourage Chinese scientists
to participate in scientific research in the PICES area and promote
cooperation with scientists from other member countries of PICES.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, I wish the Meeting a satisfactory success.<BR>
</I>
<P>
The Chairman of Council, Dr. Wooster, spoke on behalf of PICES.
<BR>
<P>
<I>This is an historic occasion for PICES and an honor for me
to welcome two new members to their first meeting in an official
status, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea. We have
been seeking their active participation for the last several years,
so that PICES would have access to their expertise, their scientific
communities, and their information and know-how about the northern
North Pacific and so that we could join with them in a more concerted
effort to unravel the scientific mysteries of our region.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Of course, it is not only mysteries with which we are concerned.
In fulfilling its mission of promoting and coordinating marine
scientific research and the collection and exchange of relevant
information and data, PICES can't ignore the ultimate relation
of its activities to the meeting of societal needs.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>It has been conventional wisdom at least since the end of World
War II that &quot;Basic research ...provides scientific capital.
It creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge
must be drawn&quot; and &quot;scientific progress on a broad front
results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects
of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity&quot;
(Bush, 1945).<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Now it is generally held that science must also meet the related
conditions of accountability to societal goals and sustained political
support. The new paradigm is that &quot;good science is necessary
but not sufficient; association with a societal goal is required.&quot;
It now seems fair to ask &quot;(i) in what ways does science contribute
to the national welfare? and (ii) how can science best be marshaled
to assist in addressing specific societal problems?&quot; &quot;Science
should be driven by internal and external problems, not just curiosity.&quot;
(all from Byerly and Pielke 1995). <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>These tests are undoubtedly being applied in the countries
from which we come and will surely influence the continuation
of our work. This is particularly true in this time of limited
funding for science. We must convince our governments that scientific
research is not an idle luxury, but to the contrary is crucial
if we are to enter the 21st century with a world significantly
less troubled than that of the present.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Some have complained that research sponsored by PICES is of
little practical use because it is not directed at providing the
information needed by industry. The issue arises, for example,
in considering the interactions between PICES and regional fishery
management organizations. PICES explicitly has no management responsibilities
or authority, but the research it promotes will almost certainly
be of importance to the rational exploitation of marine living
resources in the region. While fishery management tends to work
on short time scales, usually a year or less, the solution of
many of the central problems of fisheries production must encompass
much longer time scales, of several years and perhaps decades
or longer.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>These problems are related to our lack of understanding of
the interactions among marine ecosystems and their forcing by
human activities and by variations in their physical environment.
They are contained within the central question stated during a
PICES Scientific Workshop held in December 1991:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>What is the nature of the subarctic Pacific ecosystem (or ecosystems)
and how is it affected over periods of months to centuries by
changes in the physical environment, by interactions among components
of the ecosystem, and by human activities?<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I would argue that PICES should vigorously pursue this fundamental
question in close cooperation with institutions, programs, and
projects with different perspectives. The synergism among these
approaches will serve to benefit all concerned.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Our scientific efforts are both disciplinary - hence the four
Scientific Committees, on Biological Oceanography, Fishery Science,
Marine Environmental Quality, and Physical Oceanography and Climate,
and their working groups - and interdisciplinary, as evidenced
in the program on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity and the
Bering Sea Symposium of the present meeting. I urge you all to
attend the scientific sessions, participate in the work of the
Scientific Committees (which are open to all), attend the open
meeting of the CCCC Implementation Group, and otherwise join fully
in the work of the Organization. Only you can make it best serve
the needs of the North Pacific scientific community.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon the head of the Canadian delegation, Dr.
William Doubleday, to make a statement on behalf of his government.
<BR>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, honored guests, colleagues, on behalf of the
Government of Canada I wish to express the pleasure of all members
of the Canadian delegation to participate in the Fourth Annual
Meeting of PICES in Qingdao. Qingdao is a great city of marine
science located next to a rich and diverse marine ecosystem. I
wish to thank our hosts from the Government of China, the City
of Qingdao, and especially the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute
for their hard work which has provided us an excellent venue and
well organized support for the meeting and the warm hospitality
they have shown to visiting scientists.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The Fourth Annual Meeting is significant as the first time
that colleagues from Russia and Korea will participate fully in
PICES. Canada welcomes Russian and Korean colleagues who are joining
the PICES scientific community.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The scientific program for this meeting is diverse and exciting,
covering a wide range of scientific topics from marine contaminants
to the circulation of the subarctic North Pacific and its impact
on climate to the carrying capacity of the ocean.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>With respect to carrying capacity, I would like to make two
observations. First, I draw your attention to a paper by Bigler,
Welch, and Helle which will soon appear in the Canadian Journal
of Fisheries and Aquatic Science. These authors are finding widespread
trends towards smaller size for Pacific salmon of all species
over the past fifteen or so years. Second, in 1995 the sea survival
of sockeye in the Fraser river in Canada unexpectedly was one
half of the rate of recent years. The reasons for these changes
in productivity of marine resources lie in the open Pacific Ocean,
not in the rivers of the surrounding countries. We believe that
the best way to understand such changes in productivity of marine
resources is through the multidisciplinary cooperative approach
of PICES.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally I wish to invite you to come to Nanaimo, British Columbia
next year for the Fifth Annual Meeting of PICES. This meeting
will be an opportunity to strengthen ties between scientists from
all our member states and to exchange knowledge of the marine
environment and ecosystem of the North Pacific. Thank you.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon Mr. Zuo-Fu Gan speaking on behalf of delegate
Cong-Meng Liu to make a statement on behalf of the Chinese government.
<BR>
<P>
<I>First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation
and in the name of Mr. Cong-Meng Liu, to extend the warmest welcome
to the delegates from various countries and all scientists participating
in the Fourth Annual Meeting, and sincere congratulations to the
opening of the meeting. Chinese Government is greatly interested
in the success of the present meeting. The Chinese delegates include
representatives from many parts of the government such as Ministry
of Agriculture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance,
the State Oceanic Administration, and officials of the National
Natural Science Foundation of China.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>As a major coastal country of the North Pacific and being one
of the largest fishing countries in the world, the Chinese Government
always participates in various activities concerned with this
region, therefore, together with other member countries conduct
marine research and conservation of resources, and are involved
in international scientific cooperation which contributes to the
goals of this organization.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We believe that, at present, the main tasks of PICES are: first,
to give prominence to marine research because the research scope
of PICES is related to several fields and it is necessary to select
a scientific focus that has a practical valued as a target priority.
Secondly, PICES should increase cooperation with other multinational
organizations around the Pacific i.e. to provide scientific support
to these organizations, and to exchange information to reach common
goals. The influence of PICES will increase and its vitality will
be strengthened from cooperation with such organizations. When
these are done, it will avoid duplicating research, saving labor,
material resources and money, and provide a scientific base to
various countries.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>It is well known that China is a developing country, we hope
that PICES would use the limited money, material resources and
labor force to the largest extent to do various activities to
&quot;shoot the arrow at the target&quot; and avoid wasting valuable
resources.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, I sincerely wish this Annual Meeting a success.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked Dr. Takashi Sasaki, the Japanese delegate to
say a few word on behalf of his government. <BR>
<P>
<I>Thank you, Dr. Wooster, for your very kind introduction. Distinguished
delegates, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Japanese participants,
I am honored to have the opportunity to make these remarks.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to
the delegates, of the People's Republic of China, the Yellow Sea
Fisheries Research Institute and the Government of Qingdao for
their arrangement of the Fourth Annual Meeting in this beautiful
city of Qingdao.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The First PICES Annual Meeting was in Victoria in 1992. Since
then, PICES has steadily expanded its activities. With the contributions
of the Contracting Parties, the Chairman and the Secretariat,
PICES has established its structure, held many workshops and run
working groups.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Above all, it is my pleasure that the Russian Federation and
the Republic of Korea have acceded to the PICES Convention. Participation
of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea, which have
a great amount of experience and information related to the North
Pacific area, will provide a considerable contribution to PICES
activities. Together with many scientists from both countries,
PICES has widened its scope of activities. Casting a light on
each activity of the organization, Scientific Committees have
renewed working groups, to keep the organization vigorous. From
the viewpoint of the relation with other international organizations,
PICES has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with IOC, and is
also promoting cooperation with NPAFC.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Concerning individual scientists who are expected to be involved
in activities, PICES has established a Trust Fund last year to
help deserving scientists attend PICES meetings. In this way,
PICES has been formed and widened its activities in various aspects.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Three years have passed since the Convention entered into force.
Today, I think we can celebrate that PICES has made good progress
so far and consolidated its foundation. Now, I would like to say
that PICES must face a new phase of development.. From now on,
it would be very important for us to maintain the momentum we
have gathered and promote the efficiency of the activities of
PICES. On behalf of the Japanese participants, I hope this Fourth
Annual Meeting will become the kick off of this new phase. <BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked Dr. Sangbok D. Hahn to say a few words on behalf
of the Republic of Korea.<BR>
<P>
<I>Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of
the Government of Korea, I am glad to inform you the Republic
of Korea is a full member of PICES since August 1995, just 77
days as a new member. We give many thanks to all of you, particularly,
members of Governing Council, who supported our membership. We
promise that we will do our best to work towards the goals of
PICES as a full member.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We all know that sustainable use of the ocean and the coastal
zone is of key importance in the coming 21st century. We are living
in the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea era since
November 1994. UNCLOS, serves as a focal point for cooperation
on marine scientific research. We are all here now, because of
our interest in the North Pacific Ocean and understanding the
marine ecosystem in the North Pacific requires the cooperation
of all PICES members to be successful.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>This week, I hope we all enjoy and benefit this meeting and
I would like to give many thanks to members of local organizing
committee for their efforts in making this meeting possible, in
Qingdao.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked the Russian Federation Dr. Boris N. Kotenev
to speak on behalf of his government.<BR>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of from Russian
delegation, let me congratulate all PICES meeting representatives.
We express a big appreciation to China National Science Foundation,
scientific and administrative organizations for warm welcome and
their excellent work on organizing the meeting. We express a special
appreciation to the chairman Dr. Wooster for significant help
to our delegation. We hope that we can become rich with new ideas,
new methods of research for the conservation and national exploitation
of marine resources as a result of this meeting. We can consider
more closely the relation with our colleagues from other countries
on such important scientific and practical issues as:<BR>
</I>
<OL>
<LI><I>Evaluation of carrying capacity of ecosystems in diverse
regions of the Pacific Ocean;</I>
<LI><I>More accurate estimation of stock state and definition
of possible catch level;</I>
<LI><I>Definition of long term trends in stock changes.</I> 
</OL>
<P>
<I>Sustainable development of fisheries in our countries and stable
economic progress are closely dependent on finding solutions to
important scientific questions.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We wish the Fourth PICES meeting every success.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon the USA delegate, Dr. William Aron, to
make a statement on behalf of his government.<BR>
<P>
<I>Please forgive me for making remarks that might be deemed by
some as personal. I have been involved for nearly two decades
with the conception, birth and early growth of PICES and because
of my retirement early next year I expect my official role in
PICES will be over.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>My prior visit to Qingdao was almost exactly ten years ago.
I came to a country steeped in tradition, but with a sense of
optimism and enthusiasm that belied its great age and maturity.
Biological experience dictates that mature animals grow very slowly,
if at all, are not apt to change, except to die. Qingdao and China
are clearly not biological entities, if they are, they defy the
rules. The growth and change of the past decade are blatantly
obvious. Only the optimism and enthusiasm remain unchanged and
give hope and certainty to the belief that when PICES meets in
China next time all road maps and guide books will be obsolete.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>PICES is young. It is an organization that includes participation
of the brightest minds of its member nations. The dependence of
all Pacific Rim nations of the North Pacific make it certain that
the normal short-term partner nations in economic health will
be overcome and that the ultimate development of a full synthesis
of knowledge and growth of understanding will occur. PICES was
created at the right time to provide the mechanism required for
such development. I am convinced that if I am allowed to return
to China for the next PICES meeting I will neither recognize China
or PICES. They will have both changed by growing, by being better
and by strengthening their role in the development and improvement
to benefit all human kind..<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster thanked the representatives of China and the delegates
for their remarks and introduced Professor Jilian Su a member
of the Chinese Academy Sinica to give the keynote lecture. Professor
Su addressed the subject of <I>Kuroshio and the East China Sea
Circulation</I> describing the interactions between this strong
western boundary current and the body of water lying to its west.

<CENTER><B>REPORT OF GOVERNING COUNCIL MEETINGS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Governing Council met on October 16, 19 and 22, under the
Chairmanship of Dr. Wooster. The Executive Secretary, Dr. W. Doug
McKone, served as rapporteur.<BR>
<P>
All Contracting Parties were represented at the three sessions
(Endnote 1). The Chairman of the Science Board, Dr. Dan Ware was
in attendance during part or all of each session.<BR>
<P>
At the first session, the Chairman welcomed the delegates and
noted that there were two new Parties to the Convention namely,
the Russian Federation whose permanent representatives are Dr.
A. Rodin and Dr. S.E. Dyagilev and the Republic of Korea whose
permanent representatives are Mr. K-S. Park and Dr. H-T. Huh.
It should be noted that Japan has replaced Council member Mr.
Naotoshi Sugiuchi by Mr. Teruyoshi Inagawa. For this meeting,
Dr. B.N. Kotenev replaced Dr. Rodin, Mr. Nakahara replaced Mr.
Inagawa, Dr. S. Hahn replaced Mr. Park and Mr. Gan replaced Mr.
Liu respectively. The Chairman reviewed the agenda and proposed
the order in which to take up the various items. This report summarizes
the treatment of each agenda item during the course of the three
sessions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Preliminary Report on Administration<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary summarized the activities of the Secretariat
during the previous year (Endnote 2). During the reporting it
was decided that the Finance and Administration Committee should
report to Council on representation of countries at the F&amp;A
meetings, including notification procedures and on funding sources
for the Trust Fund.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Relations with Other International Organizations
and Observers from such Organizations<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary indicated that the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) being developed between PICES and the NPAFC is at a stand
still because the NPAFC was not prepared to move forward until
it is discussed at their up coming meeting starting November 5,
1995. Depending on the out come of these discussions a second
draft of the MOU could be circulated sometime after their meeting.
<BR>
<P>
Letters of invitation to attend PICES IV were sent to the agreed
list of Organizations and the following sent observers:<BR>
<P>
Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) Dr. J. Davis
<P>
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Dr. A. Bakun
<P>
North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) Mr. H. Endo
<P>
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Prof. J. Su
<P>
Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) Prof.
J.Y. Liu<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Membership and Observers from Other Countries
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea joined PICES
this year; no other country were represented at this years meeting.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Election of Vice-Chairman<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called for nominations for Vice-Chairman of Council.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, delegates were provided
ballots for nomination of candidates. Dr. Huh and Dr. Sasaki were
nominated and Dr. Huh was elected. The delegates congratulated
Dr. Huh on his election. Dr. Huh expressed his thanks for the
support given by Council members. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Appointment of new Assistant Executive Secretary
in 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
The job description for the position, which was reviewed by the
Finance and Administration Committee, was approved by Council.
Further, Council's decisions centered on the advertisement of
the position. China suggested that this position should be filled
by someone from the western side of the Pacific to provide a balance
in the staff representation from member countries as the current
Executive Secretary is from Canada. Korea and Russia suggested
that the quality of the candidate should be the governing criteria
for selection of an acceptable person. After much discussion on
the merits of the selection process, Council approved that, for
this staffing action, preference would be given to candidates
from the western side of the Pacific. However, an exceptional
candidate from the eastern side of the Pacific should be given
serious consideration for the position. Council also agreed that
this decision should not be considered as setting a precedent
on how future appointments would be filled<BR>
<P>
Delegates agreed that they would advertise the position in their
respective countries. The Executive Secretary provided each council
member with a copy of the job description and staff rules for
circulation in their countries.<BR>
<P>
The Executive Secretary stressed that applications should be received
by December 31, 1995 and he would interview a short list of candidates
in the new year. He indicated that this timetable is necessary
to allow an overlap between the incumbent and the successful candidate.
The United States suggested that this process seemed short in
order to attract good candidates and the Executive Secretary should
not be pushed into filling the position with a person who may
not be best for the position. It was left to the Executive Secretary
to decide on the suitability of the applications received.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Report of Finance and Administration Committee
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee met under the Chairmanship
of Dr. John C. Davis who presented the report to the Governing
Council (see F &amp; A report for text). The report was approved
by Council.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Audited Accounts for Financial Year 1994<BR>
</B>
<P>
With the recommendation of the Finance and Administration Committee,
the Governing Council accepted the audited accounts and agreed
to continue with Flader and Greene as auditors for another year
(Decision 95/A/1).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Estimated Accounts for Financial Year 1995<BR>
</B>
<P>
The estimated accounts from October 1 to December 31 were reviewed
by the Finance and Administration Committee. The committee recognized
that expenditures would likely exceed allotments resulting in
there being a necessity to direct funds from the Working Capital
Fund to meet some of the obligations for the remainder of this
year. Although the WCF started the year in a negative position
due to an over estimate of the surplus in 1994, it will have a
substantial surplus at the end of the year due to the fees received
from the two new members. The Governing Council approved the 1996
budget as recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Budget for Financial Year 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Finance and Administration Committee, reviewed the appropriations
in all categories and adjusted some to give a 1996 budget total
of $509,000 CND, an increase from last year to reflect the increased
costs associated with the new members (Decision 95/A/2).<BR>
<P>
Merit Salary increases for staff were accepted by the Finance
and Administration Committee. The Governing Council approved the
merit increases. The Chairman agreed to investigate salary practices
in other organizations, including the issue of whether such organizations
employ a salary scale.<BR>
<P>
Council approved a change in the Financial Regulations to allow
the WCF to increase to CND $100,000 to provide for cash flow problems
that can occur when fees are not paid in a timely manner (95/A/2).
Council agreed that the funds in the WCF fund at the end of the
year should be used to increase the level to the agreed amount.
<BR>
<P>
Council approved the Finance and Administration Committee recommendation
to establish a Relocation and Home Leave Fund (RHLF) to a maximum
of CND $110,000 in order to dampen sudden changes in the annual
budget from time to time due to staff changes (95/A/2). Funding
to establish the RHLF would come from surplus from the 1995 WCF
and the 1996 budget.. In subsequent years the fund will be financed
from the levee in lieu of taxes from foreign staff and refunds
from the GST as well as budget adjustments if needed (95/A/2).
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Forecast Budget for Financial Year 1997<BR>
</B>
<P>
The forecast budget for 1997 was revised by the Finance and Administration
Committee to reflect the changes in the 1996 budget. The United
States suggested that the salary levels of staff members at the
top of their scale according to Canadian standards for the position
should be adjusted up as was done in previous years. The Governing
Council agreed with the adjustments as the budget was only for
planning purposes (Decision 95/A/2). Council noted that further
revisions would likely be required as the new member countries
involvement in the activities of PICES takes effect.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Trust Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
Considerable discussion took place in Finance and Administration
committee on the use of the Trust fund. China proposed that the
fund should be used to support the participation of member country
attendees at PICES meetings. The Executive Secretary noted that
by Rule of Procedure (iii), each Contracting Party shall pay the
expenses of its own Delegation to all meetings held pursuant to
the Convention. The Chairman and Executive Secretary have interpreted
the word &quot;Delegation&quot; to mean those participants listed
in Rule 1 (i). Council recommended that the Chairman and the Executive
Secretary develop a paper on the purposes of the Trust fund for
review by Council at PICES V (95/A/1).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Other Funds Held<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported on the state of the other funds
held on behalf of members. Japan indicated to the Executive Secretary
their funds should be used to reduce fees in 1996 and 1997. The
United States informed members that with respect to the CND $50,000
held, it continues to be prepared to donate all or a portion of
the funds to the Trust Fund providing other member countries contribute
an equal amount.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 13. Report and Recommendations of Science Board
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman of Science Board, Dr. Ware summarized the report
of the Board's meeting on October 18 and 21 and presented its
recommendations. Working groups 8 and 9 and the CCCC/IP/EC met
during the year and the Vladivostok Workshop was held in June.
Their work, summarized in the report, has been reviewed by the
relevant Scientific Committees and Science Board. Council approved
recommendations concerning the PICES-Globec International Program
on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (Decision 95/S/1), publications
(Decision 95/S/2), future work of Scientific Committees (Decision
95/S/3), data exchange (Decision 95/S/4), monitoring (Decision
95/S/5), future of existing working groups (Decision 95/S/6),
establishment of three new working groups (Decision 95/S/7), electronic
communications (Decision 95/S/8), and presentation of papers (Decision
95/S/9). Details are given in Appendix 1.<BR>
<P>
The Science Board also approved a scientific program for the Fifth
Annual Meeting (See Science Board Report).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 14. Future Meetings of the Organization and Subsidiary
Bodies, Including Time and Place for the Fifth and Sixth Annual
Meeting<BR>
</B>
<P>
Council accepted the Canadian offer to hold the Fifth Annual Meeting
in Nanaimo B.C. scheduled October 11- 20, 1996. Council also approved,
with pleasure, the Republic of Koreas proposal to explore the
possibility of hosting PICES VI the week of October 10-, 1997
(Decision 95/A/3). The 1998 meeting will be at about the same
time of the year; no host has been identified.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 15. Any Other Business<BR>
</B>
<P>
a.<U> Representation at Finance and Administration Committee Meetings
and Notification Procedures<BR>
</U>
<P>
Council noted that according to Rule of Procedure 1(i) each Contracting
Party shall notify the Executive Secretary in writing the names
of its Delegates, experts, advisers and observers appointed to
attend future annual meetings of PICES. Council approved the Finance
and Administration Committee recommendation that the Executive
Secretary remind Parties of this requirement when distributing
budget information for the next annual meeting (95/A/1).<BR>
<P>
b.<U> Funding Sources for the Trust Fund<BR>
</U>
<P>
Council discussed the need to establish sources that would regularly
contribute to the fund and expressed a desire to know how other
organizations obtain their funding. The Chairman pointed out that
in all international organization with which he was familiar the
sole source of support for Trust Funds was through members to
those organizations and it was highly unlikely that funds could
be found from other sources. Council approved the Finances and
Administration Committee recommendation that the Executive Secretary
obtain information for circulation and review at PICES V on the
operation and funding of the WMO and IOC Trust Funds (95/A/1).

<B>Communication<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Publications<BR>
<P>
a. The Executive Secretary was asked by Council to look into the
cost recovery practices of other similar organizations 94/A/4(2).
Letters were sent to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
(IATTC), North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC), Pacific
Salmon Commission North Atlantic Fishery Organization (NAFO) and
the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
All these Organizations except ICES have a policy of not charging
for their publications. ICES has a cost recovery policy for all
key publications. For gray literature they provide copies to members
of the working group etc., but all others requesting copies must
pay on a cost recovery basis. Libraries of key institutions generally
receive a complete set of all ICES publications, all others must
pay on a cost recovery basis. These libraries act as a repository
for the publication record of ICES for Member Countries.<BR>
<P>
b. The Secretariat arranged to purchase 50 copies of detailed
inventories of scientific surveys (1980-1992) from TINRO to help
pay for some cost of translation and publication as recommended
by Council 94/S/6.<BR>
<P>
c. List of publications produced so far this year:<BR>
<P>
i. The Annual Report was published and circulated in early February
to all PICES members, international organizations and libraries.
<BR>
<P>
ii. A poster for the Fourth Annual Meeting was distributed in
early February.<BR>
<P>
iii. Newsletters were circulated in early February and late July.
<BR>
<P>
iv. The Vladivostok Workshop Final Announcement was printed and
sent out in early February.<BR>
<P>
v. The First Announcement for the Fourth Annual Meeting was distributed
in early February.<BR>
<P>
vi. <I>PICES Papers: Reports of Meetings Leading to the Establishment
of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES)</I> was
printed and distributed to Delegates, Chairman, Science Board
Chairman, Scientific Committee members and international organizations
and libraries in mid-March.<BR>
<P>
vii. PICES published and distributed an inventory of <I>Multilateral
Organizations Concerned with the Implementation of the Oceans
Chapter of UNCED</I> under contract for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) in March.<BR>
<P>
viii. PICES Scientific Report No. 2 on the <I>Ohkotsk Sea and
Oyashio Region</I> containing the 1993 report of WG 1 was circulated
to Delegates, Chairman, Science Board Chairman, Scientific Committee
members and members of WG 1 in late April.<BR>
<P>
ix. The PICES Directory was distributed to all PICES members in
late April.<BR>
<P>
x. The Final Announcement for the Fourth Annual Meeting was distributed
in early June.<BR>
<P>
xi. A volume of abstracts for the Vladivostok Workshop was prepared
for circulation at the Workshop in June.<BR>
<P>
xii. A final draft of the Implementation Plan for PICES-GLOBEC
Program on Carrying Capacity and Climate Change was distributed
to all Scientific Committees, TCODE and Working Groups 3 and 9
in late August.<BR>
<P>
xiii. WGs 3, 5 and 7 reports and the Vladivostok Workshop report
were circulated to Scientific Committee Chairman, Science Board
Chairman, Scientific Committee members and the respective WG members
in late September.<BR>
<P>
xiv. A volume of abstracts for the Fourth Annual Meeting was prepared
for circulation at the Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
2. Communication<BR>
<P>
a. Draft text for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was developed
and circulated to Parties of both organizations. Comments were
received by the Secretariat from Japan, the People's Republic
of China and the United States. It is my understanding that the
MOU will be discussed at the November annual meeting of the NPAFC.
Depending on the outcome of those discussions, a second draft
could be developed for circulation in the next fiscal year.<BR>
<P>
b. The bulletin Board PICES.OCEAN was closed down in December
1994, when Omnet ceased to provide service. The Secretariat has
been regularly sending PICES news via Internet (once a week or
so) to those who request it. The e-mail list has expanded more
than three fold this year, with approximately 800 individuals
and organizations from nearly 30 countries.<BR>
<P>
<B>Secretariat Matters<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Administration/Financial<BR>
<P>
a. Council requested the Executive Secretary to seek funding sources
for the Trust Fund 94/A/4(4). Discussions were held with a number
of sources to seek funding. None of these proved successful. Most
of the organizations contacted receive regular donations to their
Trust Funds from the member governments. Based on these discussions
it would seem that the best way to proceed would be for Parties
to identify funding sources in their respective governments and
aid the Secretariat to obtain commitments to regularly support
the Trust Fund.<BR>
<P>
b. The Administrative Assistant is working, this year, to set
up a recognized accounting program to handle finances starting
in fiscal year 1996. This will be an improvement over the current
system developed from a spreadsheet program.<BR>
<P>
c. The general mailing list is still increasing as more and more
people interested in North Pacific marine science issues ask to
be put on the list. The list in 1993 was 300-400, in 1994 it increased
to 700 and it is now at approximately 1,120. Additionally, there
are 57 libraries and 39 organizations on the list. PICES members
(Council, Committees, Working Groups) add another 176 with the
recent addition of the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation.
It is expected that the list will continue to grow as scientists
from the new members of PICES and other scientists become knowledgeable
of our activities.<BR>
<P>
d. The Secretariat was given a US$5,000 contract by the Marine
Resources and Conservation Working Group of the Asian Pacific
Economic Cooperation, to compile an inventory of multinational
organizations in the Pacific region involved with follow up to
the Oceans Chapter of the United Nations Conference on Environmental
Development. The report &quot;Objectives and Activities of Multilateral
Organizations Concerned with the Implementation of the Oceans
Chapter of UNCED Agenda 21 in the Asia-Pacific Region&quot; was
completed in March 1995, and was distributed to thirty-one participating
organizations as well as to APEC members. PICES Council members
were also included on the mailing list.<BR>
<P>
e. In March the Secretariat received refunds of the Provincial
Government Sales Tax from 8th January, 1993. All purchases are
now exempt from this tax.<BR>
<P>
f. In July and September the Secretariat finally received refunds
of the Federal Government Goods and Services Tax for the period
of 1st January, 1994 to 31st August, 1995. We are still patiently
waiting for the remission order to collect tax payments from 8th
January, 1993 to the 31st December, 1993. I am told that, at the
earliest, it will take a further 5 to 6 months before we can expect
the Order in Council.<BR>
<P>
2. Space, Facilities and Equipment<BR>
<P>
a. A computer was purchased with the addition of the Secretariat
position. Additionally, a scanner was purchased to aid in producing
publications.<BR>
<P>
b. A computer and desk were purchased to set up a World Wide Web
Page (WWWP) to allow PICES to better provide services to the scientific
community (94/S/1). The Secretariat has developed a crude structure
for the WWWP which is being circulated to the different committees
for review and comment. Among other uses we will be able to put
the PICES Directory, PICES Press, a Bulletin Board, ship schedules
(if required) and special data sets on line.<BR>
<P>
c. The Secretariat has had discussions with Dr. Davis concerning
upgrading the room provided for storage last year. We are now
using part of this room for the WWWP computer. The room is not
adequately lighted, heated, nor are there sufficient electrical
plug receptacles and there is a need to split the room into a
storage area and an office for the computer. We have also asked
to have the other office computers put on the Uninterrupted Power
Supply as during last winter we experienced a number of interruptions
due to overloaded circuits, that are partly used by the Secretariat.
It is my understanding that funds are presently short but that
the changes will be given priority when funds become available.
<BR>
<P>
3. Staffing
<P>
As agreed by Council at last year's meeting, the part-time employee
became a full-time employee as of January 1, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Endnote 3 CCCC Program Executive Committee Recommendations
<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. The CCCC Scientific Steering Committee established after PICES
III should be renamed the Implementation Panel.<BR>
<P>
2. A CCCC Workshop on conceptual/theoretical studies and model
development should be held in Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan, in late
June 1996. A Scientific Steering Committee for the workshop should
be established based on the MODEL Task Team, with additional members
from WG 7, WG 9 and the NPAFC Science Sub-Committee. Existing
research programs in member countries that fit the goals of the
CCCC Program should be encouraged to join the CCCC.<BR>
<P>
3. The full membership of the CCCC/IP should meet on the occasion
of the workshop.<BR>
<P>
4. A symposium on the methods and findings of retrospective analyses
should be organized by the Executive Committee and held during
PICES V.<BR>
<P>
5. The following interim task teams, established by the Executive
Committee, should now be established on a continuing basis:
<P>
MODEL - a task team concerned with advancing the development of
conceptual/theoretical and modeling studies needed for both regional
and basin scale components of CCCC.
<P>
BASS - a task team concerned with development of the basin scale
component of CCCC.<BR>
<P>
6. The following task team should also be established on a continuing
basis:
<P>
REX - a task team concerned with developing the intercomparison
of regional scale studies, as proposed in the Implementation Plan.
Scientists working on marine birds and mammals should be encouraged
to join the task team.<BR>
<P>
7. The Co-Chairmen, in consultation with the Science Board Chairman,
should propose assignment of IP members to TTs. Upon approval
by members of these assignments, and with agreement of the Executive
Committee, the Chairmen should designate TT co-chairmen and request
PICES Scientific Committees for help in filling gaps in required
expertise. Chairmen of the Scientific Committees should be added
as ex officio members of the IG.<BR>
<P>
8. Task teams should develop work plans for review and approval
by the Executive Committee.<BR>
<P>
9. In its planning for basin scale studies, BASS and the Executive
Committee should consider research elements that might be developed
under NPAFC sponsorship and in support of this task should meet
with the NPAFC Science Sub-Committee.<BR>
<P>
10. Membership of the Implementation Panel should be kept under
review and revised as appropriate to ensure availability of the
necessary expertise. In principle, three year rotation of members
is considered appropriate.<BR>
<P>
11. The draft implementation plan should be revised to incorporate
information received by the end of 1995 and should be published,
together with the Science Plan, in the first of a series of CCCC
scientific reports. Information for inclusion in tables of national
and international programs should be augmented to include on-going
and planned institutional programs that contribute to CCCC goals
whether or not identified as national GLOBEC projects.<BR>
<P>
12. PICES should recommend financial support of the CCCC and its
program components to its member states.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Endnote 4 Recommendations of the Vladivostok Workshop<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. The workshop recommends that PICES support the volunteer group
of Russian scientists and publish the workshop proceedings.<BR>
<P>
Discussions and conclusions in the SSC meetings and in the plenary
session are summarized in the form of recommendations as follow:
<BR>
<P>
2. Further physical investigations on the Okhotsk Sea Region are
essential not only for the local physics but also for solving
the world climate problem. PICES should maintain its interest
in this region. The workshop recommends that POC takes initiative
on the researches in this region and assists to create relevant
international cooperative studies to solve the urgent problems
mentioned in the O-1 session summary report. As one of such activities,
the workshop recommends that POC hold another workshop on the
Okhotsk Sea Region in the near future, with much more focused
items.<BR>
<P>
3. As discussed in the O-4 session summary report, the Japan Sea
is also a very important region and deserves further discussion
within PICES: in particular, the Japan Sea may be considered as
a suitable domain to test our models of formation and circulation
of the abyssal waters. We recommend that POC organize a working
group on the circulation and ventilation of the Japan Sea as done
for the Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region. The workshop should further
discuss the recommendation items given in the 0-4 session summary.
<BR>
<P>
4. The Okhotsk Sea region is highly productive and has important
fisheries. The workshop created a good atmosphere for discussion
of future biological and fisheries researches. It is recommended
that BIO and/or FIS should focus on the biological and fisheries
aspects of the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas, through the medium
of a report or workshop.<BR>
<P>
5. As necessary future actions, important research items relating
fisheries sciences in the Okhotsk region are summarized, and establishment
of several workshops and/or working groups are proposed in the
summary reports of the F-1, F-2, and F-3 sessions. It is recommended
that FIS discuss these problems and take necessary actions to
coordinate future researches. <BR>
<P>
6. Almost all of the Okhotsk Sea region belongs to the economic
territories of Russia or Japan. Thus, cooperation is essential
for the studies of the Okhotsk Sea (A similar situation exists
for the studies of the Japan Sea and the Bering Sea). The workshop
recommends that PICES member countries bordering the Okhotsk Sea
facilitate access to investigators to cooperate on scientific
research in the region. In addition, PICES should endorse and
support international research programs such as CREAMS in the
Japan Sea and the Soya/La Perouse Project. As a first step the
Sakhalin NIRO and the Hokkaido Fisheries Experimental Station
will start a cooperative study. <BR>
<P>
7. Investigation of the Okhotsk Sea and its adjacent areas is
essential for the CCCC Program. The workshop recommends that CCCC
Implementation Panel coordinate an international cooperative project
on the Okhotsk Sea area as one of its key projects.<BR>
<P>
8. The workshop recognized that data and information exchange
in the regions under consideration is insufficient for the detailed
quantitative analysis of the seas under consideration. An accurate
and dense data set such as CTD data at 1 to 2-decibar interval
is required. TCODE should consider amassing the data necessary
for the special process oriented studies. As studies on the Okhotsk
Sea are done not only by the established institutions like POI,
TINRO, and FERHRI of Russia and JFA and the universities in Japan,
but also by many local organizations of both countries. Complete
data inventories of the relevant institutions and individuals
are required. It is recommended that TCODE takes an initiative
to solve these problems.<BR>
<P>
9. Several different names are often used for a single place due
to historical reasons. A complete nomenclature list of the bays,
straits, currents and so on in all languages is needed. It is
recommended that POC takes an initiative to make such list and
to publish it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Endnote 5 TCODE Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>a . TCODE Report Sections 7.3, 7.4 and Recommendations 8.1-8.5
<BR>
</B>
<H2>7.3 Develop strategic plans to meet these requirements </H2>
<P>
The TCODE strategic plan for PICES data management has the following
elements:
<UL>
<LI>use existing national/international data centers, programs
and techniques wherever possible
<LI>encourage migration of data to these existing data centers
<LI>assist PICES scientists to locate and obtain data of interest
<LI>use the WWW/Internet system to provide information and provide
&quot;pointers&quot; to important agencies or institutions
<LI>provide a &quot;home&quot; and active distribution system
for data sets that are not available elsewhere 
</UL>
<H2>7.4 Identify the data management needs of PICES </H2>
<P>
PICES scientists require access to data in the following subject
areas:
<UL>
<LI>ship schedules and cruise reports
<LI>meteorological data 
<LI>physical and chemical oceanographic data
<LI>biological oceanographic and plankton data
<LI>fish catch and distribution data
<LI>fish &quot;biology&quot; data (length, condition etc.)
<LI>commonly used environmental indices (PNA, El Nino etc.)
<LI>birds and marine mammal distribution and abundance data
<LI>marine environmental quality data
<LI>remote sensing data 
</UL>
<P>
In addition, TCODE should distribute information on software &quot;tools&quot;
for the analysis and processing of these data sets.<BR>
<H2>8.1 Ship schedules </H2>
<P>
TCODE recommends that all PICES members submit cruise plans for
cruises or surveys in the PICES area to the PICES Secretariat
for distribution. The preferred format for such plans is the IOC
National Oceanographic Program (NOP) format, but other formats
will be acceptable. Where possible, the PICES WWW servers will
provide links to other cruise schedule posting areas (e.g. UNOLS
ships schedule page). Members should include all cruises/surveys
that are of broad interest to the PICES members and special purpose
coastal or inshore cruises may be omitted. TCODE members from
each PICES nation will ensure that the schedules are submitted.
<H2>8.2 Cruise Reports </H2>
<P>
TCODE recommends that all PICES members submit cruise summary
reports (CSR) to the PICES Secretariat for distribution. These
cruise reports are an important source of information on recent
sampling activities and data that is not yet available from national
or international data centers. The preferred format for such reports
is the ICES/IOC CSR format (formerly known as ROSCOP). Members
should include all cruises/surveys that are of broad interest
to the PICES members and special purpose coastal or inshore cruises
may be omitted. TCODE members from each PICES nation will ensure
that the reports are submitted.
<H2>8.3 Master Inventory / Directory of data holdings </H2>
<P>
TCODE recommends that PICES begin to assemble a master inventory
or directory that describes (in general terms) the relevant data
holdings of agencies and institutions in the PICES area. TCODE
members will provide this information for distribution on the
PICES WWW server.
<H2>8.4 Inventory of long term time series </H2>
<P>
TCODE recommends that PICES assemble and distribute an inventory
of long term time series of meteorological, oceanographic and
fisheries data that are of broad interest to the PICES members.
TCODE members will assemble such an inventory for distribution
using the PICES WWW server as well as by printed copy (on request).
Where possible, links will be established to the agencies that
hold and distribute these data.
<H2>8.5 Relationships with other committees and Working Groups
</H2>
<P>
TCODE recommends that TCODE be invited to provide a representative
to relevant meetings of other groups, to report on TCODE activities
and to report data requirements and issues to TCODE at the earliest
opportunity. Such a mechanism will help to minimize delays in
reacting to requirements of these committees. TCODE representatives
have agreed to make every attempt to attend such meetings when
they are held in their own country. This will minimize travel
costs.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>b. Proposal for Ship Schedule Information<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the Third Annual Meeting, it was agreed that a ship schedule
scheme should be prepared indicating what information is required
on what time schedule, and how it might be most effectively disseminated.
The following scheme is based on discussions among the Chairman,
Executive Secretary, Science Board Chairman, and TCODE Chairman.
<BR>
<P>
What is it that scientists want to know about ship operations
that are scheduled or being planned in the subarctic Pacific?
For any area in which they are interested, they want to know:
<BR>
<P>
1) who will be operating there,
<P>
2) along what track,
<P>
3) on what dates, and
<P>
4) making what measurements.<BR>
<P>
Further, they would like to know if additional experiments and
scientists could be accommodated, and whom to contact for further
information. Thus for any given operation, the desired information
might be of the form:<BR>
<P>
R/V Marplex. Marine Research Institute, Sidonia. Operating in
Okhotsk Sea, 1-30 September 1995. [show track chart]. Observations
on 50 km centers include surface to bottom CTD casts with full
chemistry, zooplankton tows with Excalibur profiling nets, and
continuous surface observations. Space for 4 visiting scientists,
but no additional experiments that require winch time. For further
information, contact Director, MRI Sidonia [give e-mail and fax
addresses].<BR>
<P>
Research vessels for which such information is desired include
those generally 30 m or greater working offshore (beyond 12 miles),
and operated by government and academic laboratories. Track charts
might be prepared in common format by the PICES Secretariat. The
most effective dissemination would be on a PICES Home Page. While
information would be desirable several months in advance of the
operations, it could be updated as cruise plans evolved. <BR>
<P>
The biggest problem in implementing such a scheme is in obtaining
the information on a regular basis. This problem would have to
be solved at the national level and a national commitment made
to provide the information before implementation is attempted.
The national contact for providing ship schedule information would
need to work closely with the Secretariat for this project to
succeed.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Endnote 6 PICES electronic communication system<BR>
</B>
<P>
Our bulletin board (PICES.OCEAN) on Omnet ceased operation in
December, 1994, when Omnet went out of business. We have been
regularly mailing PICES News via Internet to those who request
it. Our e-mail list has expanded more than three fold since the
Third Annual Meeting last October, to approximately 800 individuals
and organizations from nearly 30 countries. Our aim is to facilitate
the exchange of news and information on marine science in the
North Pacific. In order to provide better service to the marine
science community, we are in the act of setting up our own World
Wide Web (see below) home page.<BR>
<P>
The World Wide Web (often called &quot;WWW&quot; or &quot;The
Web&quot; or &quot;W3&quot;) is a project that was started at
CERN, the European center for particle research. It has since

</B></CENTER>
<P>
The meeting of October 14 was called to order by the Chairman,
Dr. Warren S. Wooster, who welcomed all delegates, observers and
researchers to the Fifth Annual Meeting. Dr. Wooster called on
Mr. Ted McWhinney, Member of Parliament for Vancouver Quadra,
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,
to make a statement on behalf of the Canadian Government. <BR>
<P>
<I>It is a pleasure to convey to the 200 marine scientists here
assembled from the member countries of this Organization - China,
Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States and Canada -
greetings from the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien and
also our Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Admiral Fred Mifflin.
The fact that the inaugural meeting of this Organization, in 1992,
was held in Victoria, B.C., and that Canada, as host country,
is now receiving this follow-up Annual Meeting in Nanaimo, B.C.,
testifies to the Canadian Government's awareness of Canada's new
historical role as a Pacific Rim country, and also to the importance
that Canada assigns to relations with our neighbour countries
who share a Pacific littoral: relations that extend not merely
to trade and commerce but that also include cultural and academic-scientific
exchanges and the acceptance of a common responsibility for the
safeguarding of the natural resources of our common Pacific region,
with the oceans and the abundant fisheries ranking at the top
of these conservation imperatives.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Canada, as a country that shares three oceans,- the Atlantic,
the Pacific, and the Arctic - has always been a leader in the
movement to &quot;internationalize&quot; the duty of protection
of the oceans and ocean fisheries resources, the more so because
our special relation with the Arctic has made us sensitive to
its delicate ecosystem and the need for extra vigilance in its
behalf. In 1970, we enacted, through our national Parliament,
an Arctic Waters Pollution Control Act that was avant-garde in
international law terms. Though it drew upon the Conservation
protocols attached to the proceedings of the Second United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea (1958-1960), it broke new ground
in its assertion of a municipal (national) law power to act affirmatively
on behalf of these new international law imperatives.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>It was in the same spirit that, in 1995, in the course of Canada's
so called &quot;Turbot War&quot; with Spain and Portugal, designed
legally to contain and limit extravagant overfishing by the vessels
of those two countries of an endangered species that threatened
to follow the North Atlantic cod into near extinction, Canada
asserted a municipal (national) law power, in implementation of
the new international law conservation imperatives, to reach the
fishing vessels and crews of other countries, operating just outside
our national territorial waters and contiguous waters and maritime
zones and have consequences harmful for our international law
rights and for those of the World Community at large. Acceptance
by Canada of the right, if not the duty, to act affirmatively
in protection of the new international law norms has meant an
embracing of what an eloquent delegate to the Third United Nations
Conference on the Law of the Sea (1970-1982), Ambassador Pardo
of Malta, called the concept of the Oceans and their resources
as the Common Heritage of Humankind.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Canadian diplomats, and I may cite here especially Ambassador
Allan Beesley, who was born in this province of British Columbia
and who now lives here in professionally active retirement, were
part of a &quot;Ginger&quot; group at the marathon sessions of
the Third United Nations Conference already referred to; and the
Treaty signed at Kingston, Jamaica, in December 1982, reflects
their energy and also their idealism which sometimes (happily,
in retrospect) seemed to go beyond their more cautiously formulated
advance official briefs. But the Canadian foreign service, with
a rich intellectual tradition built by Lester Pearson, and Paul
Martin Sr., and Pierre-Elliot Trudeau, as political leaders, has
never believed that the obligations of the international lawyer
reduced to a mere mechanical restatement of the pre-existing law,
as written. We have accepted, - in the spirit proclaimed by Myres
McDougal of Yale University, the teacher of both President Gerald
Ford and President Bill Clinton - that the role of the international
lawyer - whether lawyer-diplomat, or judge, or parliamentarian
- extends to active participation in changing and up-dating the
law, so as to accord with the emerging juridical conscience of
the World Community. It is a dynamic process of legal change:
international law-in-the-making!<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In this context, our turbot dispute with Spain and Portugal
is now before the International Court of Justice at the instance
of those two countries, and we will ask the international judges
to strike out boldly in support of the new international law imperatives
on safeguarding of endangered or disappearing species that are
part of the Common Heritage. In the same spirit, face with what
we regard as the State of Alaska's gross over-fishing of Pacific
Coast salmon, in violation of the legal norms established by the
Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon Treaty of 1985, we have invited the
U.S. Government - so far unsuccessfully - to submit this particular
problem to legally binding international arbitration, or, failing
that, to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.
We believe our portion is historically right and in full accord
with the enlightened trends in contemporary international law
and its progressive development in accordance with the United
Nations Charter mandate.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Our government's commitment extends, also, to encouraging and
supporting long-range, fundamental scientific research of the
sort that you are already undertaking, in your various ways, in
biological oceanography, fishery science, physical oceanography
and climate, and marine environmental quality. Your work provides
the indispensable empirical base to the development of the new
international law on environmental protection and Conservation
of the Natural Resources of the World Community. In the new Canada
Oceans Act, which we expect to pass in our House of Commons before
the end of October, 1996, and in our planned new Canada Fisheries
Act, we provide new and more comprehensive municipal (national)
legal bases for doing that. In the spirit of co-operation, in
a common international endeavour, that your Organization so well
represents, we invite you to encourage your own national governments
to continue their commitment to science and scientific research
in aid of the oceans and ocean research.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon Dr. John C. Davis to make a statement
on behalf of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, honored guests, colleagues, I am delighted to
welcome you here today to Nanaimo and the Fifth Annual Meeting
of PICES. I am speaking on behalf of Dr. W. Doubleday, Head of
Delegation, who will join us shortly. You have heard words of
welcome as well, from the Hon. T. McWhinney, Parliamentary Secretary,
for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on behalf of Canada.
This message is from the Canadian Delegation responsible for hosting
the meeting here in Nanaimo.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The Local Organizing Committee has worked extremely hard to
make this meeting a success and hopes that everyone will find
their stay in Nanaimo pleasant and scientifically rewarding. I
know how hard this group has worked and feel sure that we will
have an excellent meeting as a result of their labor.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We are particularly happy to be hosting the annual PICES meeting
this year because Canada is initiating its GLOBEC program in 1996.
Our GLOBEC program includes an Atlantic component focused on groundfish
and a Pacific component focused on salmon. The program is multidisciplinary
and involves government and university scientists from across
Canada. We hope that the Pacific component of Canada's GLOBEC
program will complement the GLOBEC programs of our partners in
PICES and realize the potential of the PICES CCCC program framework.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The North Pacific may be entering a period of rapid change
in biological productivity. More information on the climate of
the North Pacific and a better understanding of the forces causing
climatic variation is urgently needed, both for fisheries conservation
and for planning marine and coastal development. We in Canada
hope that PICES can and will unite scientists in all relevant
disciplines in all our member states to advance knowledge in this
vitally important area. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In addition, all our countries around the Pacific Rim face
major challenges and opportunities with respect to marine science.
We are facing population growth, a global food supply crisis and
major changes in our coastal environments in the coming years,
all of which will pose significant challenges to marine science
and coastal resource use planning. The scientists involved in
PICES will play a major role in these issues and it is most important
that we exchange information and engage in cooperative programs
to address common problems and issues.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, it is very fitting that PICES is meeting here in Nanaimo,
as this city has been the site of marine science work for nearly
100 years. The Pacific Biological Station of the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans located here in Nanaimo was opened in 1908
and has a long history of marine science and fisheries science
of which we are very proud.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We look forward to a stimulating and productive meeting, building
on the links established between us at previous meetings and paving
the way to strengthening future cooperation. <BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked Professor Qi-Sheng Tang, speaking on behalf
of Mr. Cong-Meng Liu head delegate, to make a statement on behalf
of the Chinese government.<BR>
<P>
<I>On behalf of the Chinese Government, I wish to express the
pleasure, of all members of the Chinese delegation, to participate
in the Fifth Annual Meeting of PICES in Nanaimo, I wish to thank
our hosts from the Government of Canada, the Department of Fisheries
and Oceans, and especially the Pacific Biological Station and
the Malaspina University-College for their hard work which has
provided us with well organized support for this meeting. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>China is a big and important fisheries country in the world,
and in particular, in the North Pacific Ocean and we always attach
great importance to and participated in various activities in
this region. In association with other member countries, China
has played a positive role in the development of the organization
and contributed a great deal to marine science.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Presently, the issues of environmental deterioration and energy
shortage have caused global concern since they are closely related
and have become a threat to the existence of human beings. The
founding of PICES is designed to promote and coordinate regional
research on marine science. It is very important to enhance scientific
understanding and strengthen scientific collaboration between
member countries on the basis of mutual benefits. For this reason,
PICES should further underline the priority of research programs
like the CCCC program. Therefore, I hope all member countries
will sincerely cooperate with each other, improve their efforts
in marine science research and work together to protect and properly
develop and utilize the resources so as to contribute to the development
of mankind.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally, I wish the meeting every success.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked delegate Dr. Satsuki Matsumura to speak on behalf
of the Japanese Government.<BR>
<P>
<I>Thank you Mr. Chairman for your nice introduction, on behalf
of Japanese participants and Government of Japan, I am honored
to have the opportunity to make these remarks.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Since the First Annual Meeting was held in Victoria, member
countries have shared holding the Annual Meeting and PICES has
steadily expanded year by year. The activities of the many Committees
and Working Groups seem to have progressed over the years. The
basic research in the North Pacific Ocean science has become stronger.
After holding the Annual Meeting among the founding Member Countries,
this Fifth Annual Meeting has returned again to Vancouver Island.
This means PICES has grown.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>During the four years, the technical oceanography has progressed
extremely well. Satellite use for remote sensing for example,
has been used to make many marine observations and collect data
over the whole ocean. Japanese Earth Observation Satellite &quot;ADEOS&quot;
was successfully launched on August 17<SUP>th</SUP>. It has two
oceanographic sensors named OCTS and NSCAT, both of which are
now working very well. It means that, in the very near future,
we can expect to develop basin scale primary productivity maps
each week. Many ocean biologists interested in satellite data
are working to build up primary productivity algorithms using
data from ocean color, temperature and sea surface wind which
are collected by ADEOS. Many international ocean science organizations
and projects are expecting to use the data from the Japanese satellite.
The earth observation program of Japan, which is led by the Science
and Technology Agency (STA) and the National Space Development
Agency (NASDA), will make the data available for all earth environmental
scientists. STA is planning to install many marine observing buoys
over the North Pacific. This buoy system will be deployed by the
new large (8000 ton) research vessel &quot;Mirai&quot;.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>A physical and biochemical circulation study on the North Pacific
must be one of the goals of PICES. I hope the buoy system, satellite
system and other traditional methods using research vessel fleets
will contribute to PICES activities and the new data sets will
be used by all member countries and scientists who are working
at saving the marine environment, especially in the North Pacific.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Finally as a newcomer to PICES meetings, I hope every one enjoys
this meeting and would like to give many thanks to members of
local organizing committee for their efforts.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Thank you for attention.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked Dr. Jang Uk Lee to speak on behalf of the Republic
of Korea Government.<BR>
<P>
<I>First of all, on behalf of my Government, I would like to express
my sincere thanks to the Government of Canada for hosting the
Fifth meeting of PICES and the PICES Secretariat which prepared
all the documents so nicely. Moreover, my special pleasure in
attending in this meeting is doubled because I am not only directly
involved in this meeting but also have the opportunity to be here
in this very attractive coastal city of Nanaimo for the first
time.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I would like to emphasize, Mr. Chairman, that there is not
any doubt that PICES has made great progress in the exchange of
scientific information and knowledge in terms of ocean and fisheries
resources among scientists from contracting parties and others
interested in these fields since the formation of PICES in 1992.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>As we are all well aware, the North Pacific Ocean is one of
the world's most productive waters for living marine resources.
In fact, the leading species in the world's fisheries are from
the Pacific and it is also known that most of the potential living
resources biomass has recently started to follow a declining trend.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>In this sense, Mr. Chairman, ocean scientific research and
related information are vital to better understand the trends
of abundance in living resources in relation to changes in environmental
conditions. Needless to say, this will only occur through participating
in active research and sharing our mutual scientific information.
My government has put great effort into conservation and management
of living marine resources with emphasis on rational utilization
and development by coastal countries in the fisheries sector.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, my government is interested that this Fifth Annual
Meeting of PICES is successful and my delegation is ready to cooperate
with scientists attending to make a successful meeting. I would
like to inform you that, my government established the Ministry
of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in August this year so that
marine and fisheries policies could be carried out more effectively,
in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century, than in the past years. I am very
pleased to announce that my government is now ready to host the
next PICES Annual Meeting and we invite you to come to Korea about
this time next year.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Once again, my delegation would like to give our special thanks
to the members of the organizing committee for their dedicated
effort and also my deep appreciation goes to all present at this
meeting for a most warm welcome you have given the Korean delegation.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Thank you very much for your attention.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster asked Dr. Alexander Rodin of the Russian Federation
to say a few words on behalf of his Government.<BR>
<P>
<I>On behalf of the Government and the State Committee for Fisheries
of the Russian Federation I welcome you to the Fifth PICES Annual
Meeting!<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I extend my gratitude to the Canadian Authorities and the Secretariat
of the Organization for the invitation and preparation for this
meeting.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Russia, with its coasts facing the Pacific Ocean and the peoples
populating it, are very interested in utilizing the ocean resources,
particularly biologic resources. The food problem, in our view,
may to a great degree be solved through proper exploitation of
the biologic resources of the Ocean. With that in mind, one must
not only consider the resources but also the condition under which
they exist must be studied. We can speak about rational exploitation
of riches (resources) of the Ocean only on a serious scientific
basis.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Therefore, I would like to emphasize that we shall support
the goals and objectives of PICES and we shall participate in
its programs. We stand for working towards good cooperation between
all member countries of PICES. Our delegation is ready to work
at the Fifth Annual Meeting.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I wish every success for the fruitful work of all of you at
this meeting.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster called upon Dr. Vera Alexander to provide a few words
on behalf of the US Government.
<P>
<I>.</I>
<P>
<I>Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,
I am very pleased to be here today at the start of the Fifth Annual
Meeting of PICES, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization.
This is the second meeting which has been held in Canada, and
this is significant and appropriate because Canada has played
a major role in the formation and direction of PICES, since the
earliest meetings during which the concept was introduced through
the establishment of the Secretariat in Sidney, British Columbia
and into the present. I thank our Canadian hosts for their welcome.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>There has been a change in the delegation from the United States,
and I wish to introduce to you Dr. James Balsiger, who is the
new delegate from the United States Government, replacing Dr.
William Aron, who has recently retired. I look forward to working
with him.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>PICES has been a success! The two main areas of success that
I receive have been the fostering of enhanced communication among
scientists and the identification of research priorities for the
North Pacific Ocean which require a multi-national approach. It
is significant that the numbers of such research problems are
multiplying as PICES conducts its work through the various Committees
and their Working Groups. This is good and appropriate. However,
now we must turn our attention to the implementation of such research
programs. There must be a commitment to the multi-national efforts
which are developed. The extent to which this will happen will
determine the effectiveness of PICES in advancing our knowledge
of the North Pacific Ocean.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I look forward to an enjoyable and productive meeting. Once
again, thank you to our Canadian hosts.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster thanked the representative of Canada and the delegates
for their remarks and spoke on behalf of PICES. <BR>
<P>
<I>At this Fifth Annual Meeting, when the organization is four
and a half years old, PICES can look back with satisfaction at
what has been accomplished until now, and forward with confidence
at what should be done in the next few years. We are six nations
strong and have engaged the active participation of hundreds of
scientists from across the northern North Pacific. Our meetings
offer a rich array of scientific papers and our publications are
gaining acceptance as valuable contributions. We are tackling
the continuing problems of data exchange and monitoring as well
as considering possible new research efforts in the Bering Sea
and in the Japan/East Sea, along with giving new attention to
the roles of marine mammals, sea birds, and crabs and shrimps
in the marine ecosystem. And we have initiated a research enterprise,
the Four Seas (CCCC) program, that engages a prime scientific
question of our time, the nature of climate variations and their
effects on marine ecosystems. <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Despite this record, not bad for such a young organization,
there are problems we must resolve if this progress is to continue.
I have set out some of these in a perspectives paper you will
all have seen. The biggest deficiency that I perceive is in the
area of participation where significant segments of the marine
science community are not involved, either because they haven't
heard of PICES, or because their agencies or universities have
not been brought in at the national level, or because travel funds
are not available to them. In some ways, the awareness problem
is the easiest to resolve, since it is largely up to our own ingenuity
to design scientific programs and activities of broad interest,
in which scientists will strongly desire to engage. The problem
of interagency cooperation and coordination is one that must be
faced at the national level, and we can only urge that it be recognized
and solved at that level. The funding problem is not disconnected
from the interagency problem if the costs of participation can
be shared among interested agencies. To the extent that members
expect PICES to support participation of individuals, for example
junior scientists and invited experts, the Organization will need
much larger resources than it has been granted so far. Participation
in Annual Meetings is important because of the opportunities for
exchange of information and ideas, the stimulation of collective
thinking, and the potential to set the scientific agenda of the
organization through meetings of the Scientific Committees. Working
Groups and Technical Committees usually meet between sessions
or just before the Annual Meeting, and these bodies are unable
to carry out their assigned tasks if appointed members are unable
to participate. One might assume that Member States who approve
establishment of these bodies and appoint scientists to them would
recognize their responsibility to ensure participation of their
appointees, but this has not always been the case. Perhaps the
advance and spread of technology will help to alleviate this problem
- for example, a &quot;virtual&quot; Technical Committee on Communications
has been proposed that would work primarily by electronic means
- but I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the need for face-to-face
interaction will not disappear. Remember the predictions of &quot;paperless&quot;
offices!<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>You can't blame the Chairman and the Secretariat for getting
bogged down in the operational details of the Organization, but
we must not forget that the ultimate purpose of PICES is to promote
scientific understanding of the northern North Pacific Ocean.
I have seen grand top-down schemes invented by administrators
and imposed on scientists - at first, the International Decade
of Ocean Exploration was such a scheme - but I am a strong believer
in the bottom-up approach which the PICES structure of Scientific
Committees and the Science Board is meant to foster. This is how
the CCCC Program and other activities, such as those in the Bering
Sea. Japan/East Sea, and the Okhotsk Sea have arisen.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>The goal of advancing scientific knowledge of the PICES area
and of its living resources is established in the ICES Convention.
Clearly our founders contemplated not only the increased understanding
of our planet as a cultural advance, but also the gaining of knowledge
that could eventually be applied to problems faced by Governments,
such as the conservation and allocation of resources, protection
of the marine environment, or prediction of the impact of climate
change. The Convention (Art. V.1.d) lists among the scientific
functions &quot;to consider requests to develop scientific advice
pertaining to the area concerned&quot;. However the process of
transferring of scientific findings to user entities has not yet
been well elaborated. It may work successfully within some member
states, but an international organization such as PICES can make
a major contribution to the transfer among its members and organizations
that serve them. We have not yet been successful in establishing
effective links with potential user organizations such as fishery
commissions, but the effort must be continued if PICES is fully
to serve its purpose.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We must keep in mind that PICES is not PISCES! It is not a
fishery science organization, it is a marine science organization.
And the set of scientific problems that face us, centered around
the effects of climate variations and human activities on marine
ecosystems certainly engage all of the marine science disciplines.
Approaches to this set of problems in PICES member laboratories
go well beyond those represented at our meetings and in our Committees
and Working Groups. If we are to see significant progress in your
lifetime, we must find a way to link all of these efforts in a
common approach. There is a challenge that should keep PICES busy
well into the next century!<BR>
</I>
<P>
Dr. Wooster introduced Professor Timothy Parsons to give the keynote
lecture. Professor Parsons addressed the subject of <I>Taking
Stock of Biological Studies in the Ocean</I> describing a holistic
perspective of the last 150 years of studies in ocean biology
that reveals two distinct scientific activities. The first involved
largely descriptive studies and was characterized by many international
expeditions from the &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1870 to the Indian
Ocean Expedition of the late 1960s. These studies ended in what
Carlton Ray (1970) called the &quot;Marine Revolution&quot;. This
was caused by the need for biologists to pay much more attention
to practical problems in fisheries, pollution, undersea mining
and in particular the biology of the 200-mile economic zone which
was established by many nations in the 1970s. The biology of the
oceans moved from largely descriptive ecology into the field of
dynamic processes, holistic models, new methods for collecting
data, industrial aquaculture and networking of different national
and international organizations. Further progress in the biological
sciences is needed in these areas, particularly in determining
the carrying capacity of the sea and the ecological consequences
of removing marine species of fish from the oceans as part of
the annual industrial harvest. These problems are only likely
to be solved through new methodologies and from a consideration
of entire ecosystems, which are often different to that expected
from the sum of the determinate parts. <BR>

Both of these meetings will be at about the same time of year
as previous meetings (i.e. mid to late October). <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Any Other Business<BR>
</B>
<P>
Access for cooperative research<BR>
<P>
In light of Science board support for Recommendation 6 of the
Vladivostok Workshop (see p. 27 of the 1995 Annual Report), the
United States submitted the following statement and recommendations:
<P>
As scientific investigations are developed under the auspices
of PICES, the stage will be reached when research vessels will
be working at sea on these investigations. The cruises will be
elements of agreed scientific programs and are likely to involve
scientists from several of the PICES member states. Dimensions
of the oceanic phenomena being investigated are determined by
natural processes, and these phenomena are likely to extend across
boundaries of national jurisdiction, thus requiring permission
from coastal states for access to carry out research. The United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea makes special mention
(Art. 247) of marine scientific research projects carried out
under the auspices of an international organization, stating that
a coastal State that belongs to such an organization shall be
deemed to have authorized the project to be carried out in conformity
with the agreed specifications if that State approved the detailed
project when the decision was made by the organization for the
undertaking of the project, or is willing to participate in it,
and has not expressed any objection within four months of notification
of the project by the organization to the coastal State. Application
of this provision should be considered by PICES when cooperative
projects have been designed. At the present time cooperative studies
in the Japan Sea/East Sea are being planned by PICES Working Group
10. On-going research in that area has already been impacted by
restrictions on access for marine scientific research, and successful
conduct of the research being planned by WG 10 will depend on
such access being granted. In view of these facts, it is recommended
that:<BR>
<P>
These following recommendations were agreed to by Council(Decision
96/A/8):<BR>
<P>
1. Member States of PICES affirm application of Art. 247 to cooperative
projects being developed under the auspices of PICES.
<P>
2. Working Groups present their research plans to the Science
Board for approval and forwarding to the Governing Council for
endorsement by the Organization.
<P>
3. Working Groups developing specific field phases of cooperative
research programs identify elements of those programs where questions
of research access arise. (96/A/8)<BR>
<P>
At the close of the Governing Council Dr. Doubleday, called on
all members of the Governing Council to join with him in warmly
thanking Dr. Wooster for his outstanding service to PICES over
many years. He praised Dr. Wooster for leading PICES through its
first years and establishing a strong and vital scientific program.
The Governing Council unanimously applauded the contribution of
Dr. Wooster.<BR>

<P>
<B>Secretariat Matters<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>1. Administration/Financial</B>
<P>
The Secretariat has converted the mailing list to a database system
for more efficient handling and processing. It has improved the
access time and allowed for better planning and organizing for
the Fifth Annual Meeting as well as for other uses that will make
our operations more efficient. The current mailing system is being
reviewed and we will experiment with undertaking our own mail
out instead of using the Department of Fisheries system. The objective
is to have better financial control than we currently have.<BR>
<P>
<B>2. Space, Facilities and Equipment</B>
<P>
No changes in space requirements have developed over the last
year. There is still the outstanding commitment made by the Government
of Canada to undertake an upgrade of part of the space they provide
to office standards. Discussions have been held but there has
not been an agreement on when the facilities would be upgraded.
<BR>
<P>
<B>3. Staffing<BR>
</B>
<P>
In April, Dr. Motoyasu Miyata completed his contract as Assistant
Executive Secretary and returned home to Japan to the University
of Tokyo. Dr. Alexander Bychkov, from POI, Vladivostok, was hired
and he started a three-year contract as the new Assistant Executive
Secretary in May.<BR>

<P>
<B>Endnote 3 <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>a. PICES Perspectives<BR>
</B>
<P>
As PICES approaches its Fifth Annual Meeting and the election
of a new Chairman, it seems appropriate to consider what lies
ahead. The Organization has the principal coastal states in the
northern North Pacific as its members, has enlisted the support
and involvement of several hundred marine scientists in those
countries, has organized important scientific meetings, and has
initiated projects of cooperative science in the region. What
will the future bring? Are there new opportunities over the horizon,
and are there problems whose solutions could advance the seizing
of such opportunities?<BR>
<P>
The problems lie in the following three principal areas: participation,
structure, and interactions.<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Participation<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
1. <U>Agency participation</U>: Within the member countries, different
agencies have the principal responsibility for interaction with
PICES. Often, fishery agencies have the lead, but in many countries
weather/climate and environmental matters are handled by other
departments, and important universities fall outside the purview
of the national government. The lead agencies often seem not to
represent the interests of other parties or to coordinate PICES
interactions with them. In fact, few countries have effective
interdepartmental coordination mechanisms.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: An interagency coordi-nation mechanism should
be established in each member country whereby the participation
in PICES activities of all interested parties can be arranged.
<BR>
<P>
2. <U>Appointed scientists</U>: In each PICES country, some 25-30
scientists are formally involved in PICES affairs, as appointed
members of scientific and technical committees and of working
groups and analogous bodies. Although some of the work of these
bodies is conducted by correspondence, their main activities take
place at meetings, especially during the annual meetings. While
it is obviously important for these scientists to attend, unfortunately
national funding for such participation is often not provided,
and the work of the bodies is thereby seriously impaired. This
is particularly a problem when the lead agency is reluctant to
support other than its own people.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: In budgeting for PICES, member countries should
provide for the costs of participation of appointed scientists
in PICES activities. These costs are likely to exceed the annual
national contribution to the PICES budget.<BR>
<P>
3. <U>Other scientists</U>: The scientific program of PICES Annual
Meetings should attract the interest of scientists beyond those
appointed to committees and working groups. In most countries,
only a small fraction of the marine science community is now involved
with PICES. The Organization is unlikely to achieve its objectives
without much broader links with that community. The mistaken perception
that PICES is a fishery organization may discourage some, but
the principal impediment is funding. In principle, each country
should support participation of its own scientists, but funds
are often not available, especially for participation of junior
scientists.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: Member countries should recognize their responsibility
to ensure participation. If the Trust Fund is to be used to support
otherwise unfunded scientists, it should be augmented and regularly
replenished. Procedures for selection of recipients must be agreed.
<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Structure<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
1. <U>Scientific Committees</U>: At its first meeting, PICES established
four standing committees (BIO, FIS, MEQ, and POC) to provide a
disciplinary home for scientists and to give them a voice in the
governance of PICES through representation on the Science Board.
The committees have the responsibility not only to oversee scientific
sessions and develop programs for the next annual meeting, but
also to review progress in their field and to propose actions
that would accelerate advances. While each committee has 18 appointed
members (three from each country), it has always been hoped that
all scientists at an annual meeting would participate in their
work. An active committee should work by correspondence between
annual meetings, so that actions to be taken could, where possible,
have been fully considered in advance. In practice, intersessional
activities and participation in committee meetings have been limited.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: Committee chairmen should take the lead in developing
committee programs through correspondence, and action should be
taken to attract broad interest in committee meetings. [These
actions are being taken for PICES V]<BR>
<P>
2. <U>Technical Committees</U>: In recognition of the continuing
need for a body to deal with PICES data problems, a standing committee,
the Technical Committee on Data Exchange, was established. There
are other areas where standing committees may be needed, e.g.,
monitoring. The Implementation Panel of the CCCC Program will
be required for five years or longer. The relationship of such
bodies to the Science Committees and the Science Board remains
to be defined.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: The Science Board should review the need for
such commit-tees, their terms of reference, and their membership,
as well as their relationship to the Science Committees and the
Science Board. Recommendations on this should be forwarded to
the Governing Council.<BR>
<P>
3. <U>Working Groups</U>: Working Groups have been established
for specific purposes and with finite lives (2 - 3 years). Reports
are expected at the end of their work, and the groups may evolve
into other groups or into standing committees. The constraints
have not been widely understood, with some groups expecting their
work to go on indefinitely. In most cases, participation of appointed
members has been limited.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: The Science Board should prepare specific guidelines
for the function and duration of working groups. [Participation
problems are considered above.]<BR>
<P>
<U><B>Interactions<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
1. <U>Fishery Commissions</U>: While PICES has no responsibility
or authority for fishery management, marine scientific research
in general, and specific programs such as CCCC, can contribute
to the rational use of marine resources and hence to the work
of commissions with management responsibility. Existing and developing
commissions have broad research mandates, and no clear jurisdictional
lines have been drawn. National policies often differ from organization
to organization. The resulting confusion threatens the development
of PICES programs such as CCCC and impedes the transfer of information
to the commissions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: Consistent national policies towards marine science
organizations should be established. Jurisdictional conflicts
should be resolved, and cooperative opportunities should be identified
in memoranda of understanding with PICES.<BR>
<P>
2. <U>Advisory activities</U>: When plans for PICES were being
developed, it was assumed that advisory activities in the fields
of fisheries and environmental quality would be developed, in
analogy with those performed by ICES. While the PICES Convention
(Art.V.1.d) provides for that possibility, political and geographical
realities have prevented it from developing. If the members were
ultimately to decide on an active advisory role for PICES, there
would be important budgetary and structural implications.<BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: Members should include the possibility of a PICES
advisory role in considering cooperative opportunities between
PICES and fishery commissions. The Secretariat should analyze
the budgetary and structural implications for PICES of its assuming
an active role in providing advice to member countries and to
regional international organizations.<BR>
<P>
3. <U>Cooperation with international research programs</U>: Existing
international research programs, bilateral and multilateral, regional
and global, deal with questions that fall within the broad scientific
mandate of PICES. However, within countries, participating agencies
are often different from those that interact with PICES so that
the activity appears to be unrelated. The difficulty is not a
lack of control by PICES, but the loss of opportunities for effective
collaboration. <BR>
<P>
<B>Solution</B>: International research programs related to ongoing
activities and interests of PICES should be identified and listed.
Opportunities for collaboration with these programs should be
sought, first among agencies at the national level and then by
PICES. <BR>
<P>
Opportunities for PICES, in addition to advisory activities mentioned
above, fall in the areas of support services, for example in communication,
exchange of information and data, and monitoring, and in research
itself, as exemplified in the CCCC program. Ideas concerning these
opportunities will be discussed in a subsequent note.<BR>
<P>
W. S. Wooster, Seattle, 17 July (rev. 23 July) 1996 <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>b. Communication Perspectives <BR>
</B>
<P>
Effective communication is important to PICES because the work
places of participants are widely scattered. They work in several
languages but communicate internationally in English. Except at
meetings, where special effort is required to ensure effective
oral presentations, communication is increasingly by electronic
means. Thus it is important that PICES employ the developing technology
in the most effective way to meet its goals and objectives. <BR>
<P>
Communication needs range from low frequency - archival reporting
and data base management; - to mid frequency (MF) - distribution
of news; - to high frequency (HF) - real-time exchanges. Methods
differ among these: <BR>
<P>
LF: now, printed, distributed by post; future, distributed electronically.
In the case of data bases, access is increasingly by electronic
means.<BR>
<P>
MF: now, printed and mailed, increasingly electronic and fax;
future, distributed electronically.<BR>
<P>
HF: now, e-mail and fax; future, e-mail (and fax?) <BR>
<P>
Problems that characterize these frequencies include publication
delays, high costs, and uncertain print orders (LF); stale and
incomplete news (MF); difficulties with equations and graphics
(HF). Many communications problems arise because the response
time of correspondents is often much slower than that of available
technology. With the increasing use of electronic means of communication,
problems also arise because the technology is not universally
available and is not standardized, leading to mismatches in hardware
and software. While the Secretariat has been diligent in trying
to provide the necessary services, there has not yet been a systematic
effort to determine customer requirements and problems.<BR>
<P>
A goal is that every PICES participant be able to communicate
freely and quickly with any other and have ready access to required
information - archival, data base, and news. To facilitate achievement
of this goal, there should be established a Technical Committee
on Communications (TCCOM), to work primarily by electronic means,
with the following terms 
<P>
of reference:<BR>
<P>
1. Consider ways whereby participation in PICES activities might
be enhanced through an expanded communications network.
<P>
2. Determine the communication requirements of PICES participants
and identify the present problems in meeting those requirements.
<P>
3. Review existing electronic communication practices and procedures
within PICES.
<P>
4. Survey the electronic communication capabilities in member
states.
<P>
5. Review technological developments of utility to PICES communications.
<P>
6. Develop a communication plan to meet the requirements of PICES
participants and of the Organization, within the constraints of
present and soon-to-be-available technology, together with estimates
of anticipated costs.

<P>
The Committee met on 13 and 16 October under the chairmanship
of R. Steinbock; W.J. Rapatz served as rapporteur. Participants
were:
<P>
A meeting of the Committee was held on October 13 and again on
October 16, 1992.<BR>
<P>
Canada: C.C. Graham
<P>
China Mr. Ji Xu, Mr. Dachun Li, Mr. Liang Zeng Chen , Mr. Liang

<P>
The PICES Chairman and the Interim Executive Secretary also attended.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Call to Order:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The meeting came to order at 1306. The convener welcomed the delegates.
He noted that both a written and oral report of the Committee's
observations and conclusions would be made to the Governing Council,
hereinafter referred to as Council, on October 17, 1992. He proposed
that the Committee meet again later in the week to approve and
finalize the report. Mr. Rapatz was named as Rapporteur. The Agenda
was adopted.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Report on establishment of Secretariat and implement-ation
of Final Report:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Davis explained the report on the Establishment of the Secretariat
and Implementation of the Final Report (Endnote 1). The Committee
recommends that the Secretariat establish a separate account for
the Working Capital Fund. The Committee also recommends that the
Secretariat investigate the possibility of depositing PICES funds
into several banks to take account of Government of Canada limits
on deposit insurance and that this be done if found to be beneficial.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Current budget status:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Davis explained the status of the current budget. The Committee
suggested that the Interim Executive Secretary or the Executive
Secretary propose an external audit firm early in the new year
to permit approval by Council before the end of March, 1993. The
Committee recommended a specific budget item be established for
financial support to other organizations and that the Council
be consulted if exceptional proposals for assistance were made.
The Committee requested that any credits to a Member State be
identified in the budget documents.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Budget proposals for 1993 and forecast budget
for 1994:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee recognized that as 1992 was a start-up year for
PICES, there was a significant surplus of funds available to the
Organization. The Committee recognized, however, that the major
business of the Organization would be driven by the recommendations
and activities of the scientific committees and the Science Board,
which would be considered by Council, both at the current and
at future meetings. There will be substantive scientific issues
identified in fisheries, biological oceanography, physical oceanography,
climate and marine environmental quality discussions which are
of vital importance to the Member States. Expenditures are expected
in support of scientific initiatives of the Organization which
will likely include but not be limited to, meeting costs, data
analysis and exchange, data archiving, expanded publications,
and travel.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recognized that it is difficult to accurately forecast
these future costs as there is no actual experience with the operation
of the Organization and the scientific program is in a developmental
phase. It is clear, however, that the Organization will concern
itself with a significant array of scientific issues in the North
Pacific and will engage in an active relationship with a number
of international organizations and processes.<BR>
<P>
The Committee noted that there will be additional budgetary items
associated with personnel services after the staff of the Organization
is recruited. These items may include expenses related to home
leave, education grants for the minor children of staff, relocation
and termination benefits, and additional contractual services
or hiring of full or part time staff. Most of these items are
of a non-recurring nature and will appear in the budget only as
required. Occasionally, the need to meet an expense cannot be
predicted and may not have been specifically budgeted for. There
are currently no provisions in the budgetary and contribution
processes to accumulate a fund from which to meet these expenses.
The Committee, therefore, suggested that once staff is recruited,
the Executive Secretary present to the Committee, at the 1993
meeting, information concerning the estimated expenses of funding
these items, and as possible, the likely budget year in which
they will come due.<BR>
<P>
The Committee reviewed the Draft Budget for 1993. The Committee
endorsed the principle that the Organization use the classification
system, pay scales and other conditions in the Public Service
of Canada as a model in classifying the duties of its staff and
establishing its respective pay scales and staff regulations.
The Committee recognized the difficulty in budgeting salary levels
in the absence of respective job descriptions and the uncertainty
of specific requirements for some of the Secretariat staff. The
Committee recommended that Council establish limits for Personnel
Services but not constrain flexibility to hire Secretariat staff.
The Committee therefore recommended the budget provide the maximum
level of salary scales for the Secretariat positions as adopted
in the Final Report of March 3, 1992, but noted that certain positions
may be filled at a lower level on the salary scale. The Committee
recommended that the amount for employee benefits be reduced to
reflect more closely the percentage generally used in the Canadian
Government.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommended that in view of the considerable surplus
currently available, a portion of the surplus be used to hold
1993 contributions at $ 88,000, as in 1992. As the draft budget
totaled $ 376,000, or $ 94,000 per Member State, the Committee
recommends that the difference of $ 24,000 be obtained from the
Working Capital Fund, to provide a credit of $ 6,000 against the
1993 contributions for each current Member State. The Committee
recommends Council's adoption of the attached draft budget for
1993.<BR>
<P>
The Committee reviewed the Forecast Budget for 1994, which is
for the consideration of Council. This budget forecasts total
expenditures in 1994 of $ 470,000. It is assumed that there will
be five Member States in PICES in 1994. If this assumption is
correct, the contribution per Member State would remain at $ 94,000,
the same amount as in 1993 prior to the credit, if the budget
is adopted at that level.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Discussion of Headquarters Agreement: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The convener explained that a draft of this Agreement had been
prepared by the Canadian Government and circulated to member states.
The current draft reflects all the comments received with the
exception of a change recently proposed by China, as follows:
<P>
Article 6, line 2 and 3, delete &quot;including alternative representatives,
experts and advisors to representatives&quot;, Article 6, add
at end: &quot;For the purpose of this Agreement, representatives
shall include alternate representatives, experts and advisors
to representatives.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The Committee approved this change. It was noted that an authorized
Canadian representative would arrange signing of the Agreement
with the Chairman of PICES.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Discussion of the levy and tax status of Secretariat
employees:<BR>
</B>
<P>
This was considered an information item to be dealt with when
the outcome of staffing is known. No further action is required
at this time. A copy of a letter from the Canadian Department
of Finance was tabled which indicated that a Canadian employee
of PICES could pay a levy to PICES and obtain an equivalent income
tax credit. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Consideration of &quot;Staff Rules&quot; document:
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee recommends that the probationary period for the
Executive Secretary be one year. The Committee suggested that
the Interim Executive Secretary request comments on these rules
from Member States and provide them to the Executive Secretary
when he takes office. It is suggested that the Executive Secretary
finalize the staff rules in 1993.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Consideration of other business or additional
items referred by Governing Council:<BR>
</B>
<P>
It was noted that the invitation list for observers in the Final
Report was applicable to this Annual Meeting only. The Committee
suggests that the Executive Secretary propose a list for future
Annual Meetings for modification and approval by Council through
correspondence and through review at Annual Meetings.<BR>
<P>
The Committee noted the announcement by the United States delegation
that it will issue an invitation to Council on October 17, 1992,
to hold the Second Annual Meeting of PICES in Seattle, Washington.
<BR>
<P>
Consistent with Rule of Procedure 15, the Committee recommends
that Council appoint a Chairman of the Finance and Administration
Committee. The Committee further recommends that this Chairman
be appointed for a term of two years and that future Chairmen
serve on a rotational basis among Committee members. The Committee
recommends that Dr. J. C. Davis be appointed as the Chairman of
the Committee, to take office once the permanent Executive Secretary
takes office and in the meantime Mr. R. Steinbock be designated
to serve as Interim <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Preparation, review and approval of report for
Governing Council:<BR>
</B>
<P>
A draft report was distributed to Committee members and approved
at a meeting on Friday, October 16, 1992. The Committee recommends
consideration and approval of this report by Council. <BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
At the Organizational Meeting of March 3, 1992, it was agreed
that Sidney, British Columbia, Canada, be the seat of the Secretariat
and that Dr. J. C. Davis serve as Interim Executive Secretary
until such time as a permanent Executive Secretary shall take
office.<BR>
<P>
In April, 1992, Dr. Davis appointed Mr. W. J. Rapatz to serve
as coordinator to the organization. Mr. Rapatz in turn contracted
Mrs. T. C. Davis to serve as temporary Administrative Assistant.
The duties of the Secretariat for the time period until the First
Annual Meeting were to be the establishment of an office complete
with necessary computing and communication equipment and supplies
as required; assistance to the Chairman of PICES and the Interim
Executive Secretary with the establishment of Scientific Committees,
with the collation and filing of applications for the position
of Executive Secretary; the carrying out of necessary correspondence,
printing and duties as the Chairman and Executive Secretary may
determine; and the arrangements for the First Annual Meeting of
the Organization in October 1992.<BR>
<P>
<B>Funding<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the organizational meeting of March 3, the budget for the partial
year from March 23 to December 31, 1992, was adopted and the Contracting
Parties were asked to deposit funds of $ 88,000 each to the Organization.
On March 23, Japan's contribution of $ 118,000 arrived. It is
to be noted that Japan over-contributed by an amount of $ 30,240.
By Financial Regulation 6.vii. this sum is a credit to Japan which
will be applied to its future contributions. <BR>
<P>
The contribution from the United States was deposited on April
24, from Canada on June 9 and from the People's Republic of China
on September 29, 1992.<BR>
<P>
In order to make good use of the funds as contributed to the Organization,
Guaranteed Investment Certificates were bought from the Bank of
Nova Scotia for varying periods and amounts. The interest rate
in a GIC is superior to the rate received in a Savings Account
in the bank. Up to September 30th, 1992, the Organization realized bank and GIC interest of $3292.12.  [Accounts to 31 December 1992 are reproduced in the following pages.]
<P>
A Working Capital Fund in the amount of $25,000 was established.  The Bank interest mentioned above was for the time being placed into the Working Capital Fund. 
<P>
<B>Establishment of Secretariat Office</B>
<P>
Two rooms were made available for the PICES Secretariat at the Institute of Ocean Sciences in Sidney, Briyish Columbia.  The Institute also made available to the Secretariat the advice and assistance of the Institute Computer Staff and admittance to the IOS communications network such as telephone and computing net. At a reasonable charge we also receive cleaning of the offices, photocopying and office supplies.<BR>
<P>
During the months of April and May telephones and facsimile machines
were purchased and installed at the Secretariat and two IBM compatible
486 - SX computers were purchased from DELL Canada and installed
with the assistance of a computer expert. An additional computer
- workstation is yet to be purchased. An HP laser-printer was
also purchased and installed. In August PICES.SEC was an established
station in OMNET and soon after we received admittance to INTERNET
through the IOS communications.<BR>
<P>
The office furniture was ordered early in May but arrived some
items at a time during the months of July, August and September.
By the end of September the PICES office was fully equipped.

<H1>1993 Report of Finance and Administration Committee</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<HR width=90% align=center size=4>
<P>
The Committee met in the afternoon of the 26th and the morning
of the 27th of October, 1993, under the Chairmanship of J.C. Davis.
Participants at the meeting were: <BR>
<P>
Canada: C.C. Graham<BR>
<P>
China: G. Wu, S.P. Chen, L.Z. Chen<BR>
<P>
Japan: Y. Yamada, H. Hatanaka<BR>
<P>
U.S.A.: W.L. Sullivan, Jr., W. Aron, A. Somma, F.H. Beaudry<BR>
<P>
The Chairman of PICES, Dr. W.S. Wooster, and the Executive Secretary,
Dr. W.D. McKone also participated. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Opening by the Chairman: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman called the meeting to order and welcomed participants.
It was agreed that a second session of the Committee would be
convened in the morning of October 27th if the opening session
failed to complete all the business at hand. (Subsequently, it
was agreed to hold a second session on the 27th to complete Committee
business).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Adoption of Agenda: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The agenda was adopted as proposed with the addition of four items
under &quot;Other Business&quot;. These were &quot;Establishment
of Foreign Currency Account&quot;,&quot;Bonding and Insurance&quot;,
a &quot;Proposal Expected from APEC&quot; and the &quot;Expiry
of Temporary or Transition Rules and Regulations, March 1992&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Implementation of Headquarters Agreement:<BR>
</B>
<P>
This item, which was previously discussed briefly at the Opening
Session of Governing Council was reported upon by Canada. An additional
Order in Council is required to bring the Agreement into force
and allow PICES to become exempt from paying sales tax and income
taxes for foreign nationals working for the Secretariat. Canada
has taken steps to have processing of the Order in Council expedited.
A second Order in Council is required from Revenue Canada to set
the date to make retroactive deductions possible as of January
8th, 1993. It is hoped that the Order will be in place by December
of 1993. Once in place, refunds accruing to the credit of the
organization can be applied for. In response to questions, the
Executive Secretary reported that with the necessary Order in
Council in place, PICES can recover GST, import tax paid on goods
and also the income tax paid by the Assistant Executive Secretary.
In keeping with the practice of other international organizations,
the income tax paid by foreign nationals working for the organization
can be retained as a levy to the credit of the organization.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Staff Rules:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported that Staff Rules were circulated
to Contracting Parties with a request for comments. No written
comments were received. The Committee discussed the Staff Rules
and agreed to make several amendments as follows:<BR>
<P>
<U>Staff Rule 6 (Duties, Obligations and Privileges)</U>:<BR>
<P>
Amend staff rule 6(a) to read:<BR>
<P>
&quot;(a) Staff members of the Secretariat, upon assuming their
responsibilities as employees of the Organization, shall discharge
their duties faithfully and conduct themselves in its best interest.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
Amend last line of staff rule 6(b) to read:<BR>
<P>
&quot;They shall avoid any actions, statements and public activities
which might be detrimental or harmful to the Organization and
its aims, or to the Contracting Parties.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<U>Staff Rule 13 (Recruiting and Appointment)</U>: <BR>
<P>
Amend the first line of staff rule 13 to read:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Staff shall be appointed by the Executive Secretary in accordance
with Article VIII of the Convention, subject to a probationary
period of one year.&quot;<BR>
<P>
The revised Staff Rules were approved as amended.<BR>
<P>
The Committee also discussed the policy for recruiting staff from
nations representing the Parties to the Convention and agreed
that, for the senior positions in the Secretariat, it was desirable
to recruit staff from as wide a representation of the Parties
as possible. Members of the Committee wished to bring this matter
to the attention of the Governing Council for future consideration
should additional staff be recruited. <BR>
<P>
With the above-mentioned changes, the Committee recommends the
amended staff rules for adoption by Governing Council during the
Second Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Reporting Proceedings of Meetings, Reporting
and Approval Procedures:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman introduced this item, explaining the intent was to
review reporting procedures for meetings, including the nature
of reports and the approval procedures for proceedings. There
was consensus that minutes of the Governing Council meetings should
be circulated to the Parties for review and approval as promptly
as possible following the Annual Meeting. The Secretariat would
request comments and approval by the Parties within 30 days of
transmittal of the draft minutes. Once approved, the minutes could
be published in final form as a portion of the Annual Report.
The Committee recommends this procedure to Governing Council for
approval.<BR>
<P>
There was considerable discussion of the need for some sort of
summary report or press release to be prepared for approval and
distribution at the conclusion of each Annual Meeting. This was
deemed important from the standpoint of summarizing highlights
of the meeting and could be used for the information of the public,
observers, press or any groups or individuals interested in PICES.
The difficulties of producing a detailed report or summary of
the final session of Governing Council were recognized but there
was agreement that some sort of brief summary document was both
feasible and desirable. The Committee agreed to try to produce
such a document at the Second Annual Meeting. Dr. Davis, working
with representatives of the Parties, and the Chairmen of the Science
Board and various Committees, agreed to coordinate preparation
of such a draft for Council consideration. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Space, Facilities and Equipment:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported that PICES office space has been
increased at the Institute of Ocean Sciences to give Dr. Miyata
an office and provide sufficient space to allow for small meetings
in Dr. McKone's office. Discussions were underway to find suitable
storage and pictures space. The Executive Secretary thanked Canada
for providing the modifications and said that the Secretariat
was pleased with the alterations. Canada pointed out that the
space now exceeds the area originally agreed to be supplied for
the Organization. Structural modifications were paid for by Canada
with the Organization assuming some of the cost for wiring, telephone
and computer connections. <BR>
<P>
With regard to equipment, the Executive Secretary reported that
some new equipment (computers) and furnishings have been acquired
and that some items are still needed. Additional connections to
the Institute computer and to communications networks have been
acquired to improve communication capabilities.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Auditor's Report, 1992:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Auditor's Report was reviewed by the Committee and recommended
for adoption by Governing Council at the Second Annual Meeting.
Given that this was PICES first year of experience with the company
Flader and Greene of Sidney, B.C., and the fact that the Executive
Secretary was satisfied with the services of this firm, the Committee
agreed to recommend to Governing Council, retention of Flader
and Greene as auditors for a second year. (Endnote 1)<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Working Capital Fund: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The status of funds in the Working Capital Fund was reviewed by
the Executive Secretary and discussed by the Committee. There
was discussion of setting a limit of $100,000.00 as the maximum
for the Working Capital Fund. After considerable discussion it
was agreed that it was best to defer consideration of a maximum
level for the working capital fund, given the uncertainty of the
responsibilities and scope of the PICES Organization and its potential
involvement in costly items such as data archiving and processing.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Administrative and Financial Statements for
1993 (to October 15 and estimated to December 31):<BR>
</B>
<P>
Administrative and financial statements for 1993 were reviewed
by the Committee in preparation for consideration of the budget.
Those statements are attached for information purposes.
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Budget for Fiscal Year 1994:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Budget proposal for the 1994 fiscal year was presented by
the Executive Secretary and discussed by the Committee.<BR>
<P>
Japan inquired as to whether there could be provision in the budget
for paying the costs for bringing scientists from various countries,
such as Russia, to PICES meetings. China proposed consideration
of a special &quot;trust fund&quot; that could be used to fund
travel for scientists to PICES meetings and suggested that PICES
internal funds should not be used for such a purpose. Review of
the Financial Regulations indicated that PICES has the ability
to establish such a fund. Both China and the USA were opposed
to using funds appropriated by the Parties for PICES to support
such travel. A small working group composed of representatives
from China and the United States was struck to investigate the
matter of establishing a trust fund and provide a proposal for
consideration by the Organization.<BR>
<P>
Salaries of staff were discussed by the Committee. Details of
these discussions and recommendations are provided in an Annex
available to Contracting Parties.<BR>
<P>
In response to questions raised regarding components of the proposed
1994 budget circulated prior to the meeting, the Executive Secretary
presented details of specific anticipated expenditures for travel,
the 1994 Annual Meeting and for contractual services. Following
discussion, it was agreed to reduce the proposed budget appropriations
for travel, contractual services and the Annual Meeting to bring
the overall budget down to $440,000 CDN. <BR>
<P>
With regards to appropriations from the Parties, a budget totaling
$440,000 requires $110,000 as a contribution from each of the
Parties. In order to reduce the appropriation to a level more
consistent with that in the previous budget cycle, the Committee
recommends removing $80,000 from the Working Capital Fund. This
will reduce the contribution from each of the Parties to $90,000.00
CDN. - i.e. an increase in contribution of $2000 from each of
the Parties over the 1993 level. (Endnote 2)<BR>
<P>
Committee members stressed that the precise functional responsibilities
of the Organization are not yet firmly established. For example,
the Organization may have to deal with the handling and processing
of large amounts of data, large databases and other complexities
which may necessitate growth of the staff and acquisition of special
equipment, increased travel and meeting costs, and other uncertainties.
Accordingly, some members were concerned that existing budget
levels may not, in the future, allow for such increased responsibilities.
<BR>
<P>
The practical problems of meeting scheduling, location and expenses
associated with the cost of Working Group and Annual Meetings
were discussed. From the Secretariat's standpoint, more precise
budget estimates would be possible if some certainty as to the
location of the Annual Meeting and what costs would be covered
by the host country were available 2-3 years in advance. In addition,
the problems of cost and travel approval difficulties were of
considerable concern to the Parties with regard to activities
of the Working Groups. If Working Groups meet during the year
at times and locations not corresponding to the Annual Meeting
additional costs are incurred. All Parties support attempts to
organize Working Groups and Annual Meetings in as cost effective
a fashion as possible. Many international organizations have scientific
sessions prior to formal Annual Meetings and use this procedure
to keep costs down. The Committee recommends that Governing Council
discuss this matter and seek input from the Science Board on the
topic.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Forecast Budget for Fiscal Year 1995:<BR>
</B>
<P>
A revised forecast budget for fiscal year 1995 was presented by
the Executive Secretary and reviewed by the Committee. It was
agreed to propose a budget totaling $484,000 for consideration
by Council. Such a budget would represent the growing role of
the Organization, but considerable uncertainty still exists as
to the actual functional responsibilities of the Organization.
Members felt that costs could increase significantly in future
years as responsibilities expand.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Other Business: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed the matter of establishing foreign currency
accounts to reduce bank charges and exchange expenses for meetings
held in countries other than the seat of the Organization. The
merits of establishing an account in the Country where the Annual
Meeting is to take place in a given year and having the host country
place part of its appropriation, as a credit to PICES, in an account
in that country was discussed. Costs associated with the local
expenses of the Annual meeting could be provided for in such an
account and credited to the host country as part of its appropriation.
Members agreed to explore this concept and report back to the
Executive Secretary by Correspondence. The Executive Secretary
was asked to explore the merits of setting up foreign exchange
accounts in various currencies in Canada and provide a paper assessing
the possibilities and potential savings to the Organization and
report back to the Contracting Parties through correspondence.
<BR>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported difficulties he is having with
bonding Secretariat employees and with signing arrangements for
cheques. If employees are to be bonded all three Secretariat employees
must be given signing authority and the Executive Secretary is
concerned about liability without direct control. The Committee
asked the Executive Secretary to discuss this matter with the
Auditor and also explore the arrangement and costs associated
with bonding incurred by other international organizations. The
Contracting Parties will consider the matter further upon receipt
of this information.<BR>
<P>
The Committee was informed by the US representative, Mr. Sullivan,
of a proposal from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Working Group on Marine Resource Conservation which may be submitted
to PICES. The Working Group proposes to ask PICES to enter into
a USD$5,000 contract to collect information on organizations active
in the Pacific, their principal officers, and their objectives
and current and planned activities. The Marine Resource Conservation
Working Group is proposing this contract in relation to its UNCED
Agenda 21 follow-up (Ocean Chapter) Proposal which has the objective
of establishing a network amongst APEC and other organizations,
developing collaborative programs and planning objectives and
avoiding costly duplication of effort between organizations. The
committee recommends approval of this contract by Council.<BR>
<P>
With respect to expiry of the temporary transition rules and regulations,
dated March 92, the Committee noted that the amount called for
in Financial Regulation 9(iv)(2), above which the Executive Secretary
shall solicit written proposals for things the Secretariat desires
to purchase, is only provided for in rules which expire on October
30, 1993 at the end of the Second Annual Meeting. The Committee
recommends that the Governing Council agree to continue that amount
at $6000 as stated in the March 3, 1992 document until such time
in the future as the Council determines it should be changed.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Adjournment:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee recommends this report and its contents for approval
by Governing Council. The meeting was adjourned at 1200 hrs, Wednesday,
October 27th, 1993.

We have audited the statement of assets and liabilities of the
North Pacific Marine Science Organization as of December 31, 1992
and the statements of income and expenditures and changes in funds
and changes in cash for the period then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Executive Secretary.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.<BR>
<P>
Our audit was conducted in accordance with general accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an
audit to obtain misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.<BR>
<P>
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the organization
as at December 31, 1992 and the results of its operations and
the changes in its cash position for the period then ended in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles described
in Note 1 to the financial statements.<BR>

<B>1. Accounting Policies<BR>
</B>
<P>
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization Financial Regulations and
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies used in the preparation of these financial statements.
<BR>
<P>
a) Fund Accounting<BR>
<P>
The Working Capital Fund represents the accumulated excess of
funds provided by Contracting Parties over expenditures. The purposes
of the General Fund and Working Capital Fund are established by
Regulation 6 of the Organization's Financial Regulations.<BR>
<P>
b) Capital Assets<BR>
<P>
Capital assets acquired by the Organization are expensed in the
year of acquisition. (note 2)<BR>
<P>
c) Income Tax<BR>
<P>
The Organization is a non-taxable organization under the Privileges
and Immunities (International Organizations) act (Canada).<BR>
<P>
d) Transactions originating in foreign currencies are translated
at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at the balance
sheet date are translated to equivalent Canadian amounts at the
current rate of exchange.<BR>
<P>
<B>2. Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
At December 31, 1992, capital assets on hand and their original
purchase price are as follows:<BR>
<P>
Furniture and fixtures $14,459
<P>
Computer equipment     $17,485
<P>
                       $31,944<BR>
The assets were expensed in the year. <BR>

<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR width=90% align=center size=4>
<P>
The Committee met in the afternoon of October 18, 1994 under the
Chairmanship of Mr. W.L. Sullivan, Jr. (see Endnote 1 for participants).
<BR>
<P>
The Chairman of PICES, Dr. W.S. Wooster, attended, and the Executive
Secretary, Dr. W.D. Mckone, was the rapporteur.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Opening by the Chairman <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman called the meeting to order and welcomed the participants.
It was agreed that the Committee would reconvene in the afternoon
of October 19 if the opening session failed to complete all the
planned business.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Adoption of the Agenda <BR>
</B>
<P>
The agenda was adopted as proposed. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Headquarters Agreement was finally passed on December 15,
1993 through an Order in Council by the Government of Canada.
A Remission Order is now being processed to make the effective
date of the Headquarters Agreement the 8th January, 1993. The
Secretariat has recovered funds paid, on behalf of Dr. Miyata,
to the Government of Canada for 1993 income tax. Additionally,
the Secretariat is currently reviewing the accounts from the 8th
January, 1993 to identify the amount of Goods and Services Tax
subsequently paid and will make application for its return when
the Remission Order comes into effect.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Scheduling Annual Meetings<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee discussed scheduling of the annual meeting with
a view to improving budgeting by developing a three year schedule
as follows:<BR>
<PRE>
   Date                 Year     Country

October 16-22           1995   P.R. China
October 16-22(approx.)  1996   East side of Pacific
October 16-22(approx.)  1997   West side of Pacific
</PRE>
<P>
1. For 1995, the People's Republic of China will provide estimates
of their financial commitments to host the Fourth Annual Meeting
to the Secretariat as early as possible. If the Secretariat does
not receive these estimates by December 15, 1994, the meeting
will be hosted at the Secretariat. <BR>
<P>
2. For 1996, Canada has the opportunity to host the Fifth Annual
Meeting. They must provide the Secretariat with their offer by
December 15, 1994. The offer must include estimates of what costs
that the host country will cover so that the Secretariat can budget
for other costs in the 1995 F&amp;A meeting.<BR>
<P>
3. For 1997 an offer to host the Sixth Annual Meeting must be
received by the Secretariat in time for the opening of the 1995
meeting. The offer must include estimates of what costs that the
host country will cover so that the Secretariat can budget for
other costs in the 1996 F&amp;A meeting.<BR>
<P>
4. In subsequent years the Secretariat must receive offers to
host the Annual Meeting and their financial commitments on December
15 prior to the F&amp;A meeting which would set the budget.<BR>
<P>
5. In the event there was a failure of agreement at any step the
Secretariat would be responsible to host the Annual Meeting at
the Secretariat. <BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends that the Governing Council adopt the
three year scheduling for future meetings.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Space, Facilities and Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported that the space at the Secretariat
has been increased by the addition of a large (18 ft. by 36 ft.)
room. This room is currently being used for storage and a small
pictures. With upgrading the room could be partitioned to accommodate
secondments etc.<BR>
<P>
The fax machine was replaced this year to improve the efficiency
of the Secretariat by allowing batch messaging and decreasing
the sending time if the receiving machine is capable. Another
computer will be purchased this year for the use of temporary
help. Some office furniture was also purchased after the space
was increased.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Communication<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Secretariat proposed that an electronic bulletin board be
established at the Secretariat based on a survey of PICES participants.
The system would also be used for distributing the newsletter,
ship schedules and other requirements of the Organization. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Contracts undertaken by the Secretariat<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported that, as discussed under the
1993 Agenda Item 12, a US$5000 contract was negotiated with APEC
to collect information on marine organizations working in the
North Pacific, their principle officers, and their objectives
and current planned activities in relation to the UNCED Agenda
21 follow-up (Ocean Chapter). The committee discussed whether
the Secretariat should, in future, continue to undertake contracts
and how the funds would be disbursed for this contract. The Executive
Secretary indicated that small contracts of this type did not
detract from the work of the Secretariat. He recommended that
the committee allow the Secretariat to undertake contracts of
this type from time to time and that the funds received be deposited
to the Trust Fund account to help build this account up for future
use. The Committee recommends to the Governing Council that the
Secretariat be allowed to undertake small contracts of this type
at the discretion of the Executive Secretary in consultation with
the Chairman of Council if necessary and that the funds received
be deposited to the Trust Fund account. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Publication cost recovery <BR>
</B>
<P>
Publication costs continue to rise from $3000 in 1992 to an estimated
cost of $19,000 in 1994. As a result of Council decision 93/S/2,
the Secretariat has produced the first issue of <I>Scientific
Reports</I> and another in the series is expected to be published
this year. The Committee recommends to the Governing Council that
no fees be initiated at this time. Further, the Executive Secretary
should look into the policies and cost recovery of publications
by other Organizations and report these findings next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Auditors Report 1993 <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Auditor's Report was reviewed by the Committee and it is recommended
for adoption by the Governing Council (Endnote 2). The Executive
Secretary was asked if Flader and Greene of Sidney B.C. provided
a satisfactory service over the past year. Based on the recommendation
of the Executive Secretary, the Committee agreed to recommend
to the Governing Council that Flader and Greene be retained as
auditors for another year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Working Capital Fund <BR>
</B>
<P>
The status of the Working Capital Fund was reviewed by the Executive
Secretary and discussed by the Committee. The Committee agreed
to reduce the Working Capital Fund to approximately $28,000. The
Committee decided that the $30,240 advance payment of Japan should
be included as a separate item not associated with the Working
Capital Fund. The Committee recommends that Parties equally share
the surplus of $240,000. The Parties should inform the Executive
Secretary of the disbursement of these funds by December 15, 1994.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Administrative and Financial Statements for
1994 (to October 1 and estimated to December 31)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Administrative and financial statements for 1994 were reviewed
by the Committee in preparation for discussion of the budget for
fiscal year 1995.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Budget for Fiscal Year 1995<BR>
</B>
<P>
The budget proposed for 1995 fiscal year was presented by the
Executive Secretary and thoroughly discussed by the Committee.
The budget was adjusted to reflect the experience of the Organization
to date but keeping in mind that it will continue to grow with
the possibility of new Contracting Parties joining PICES in 1995.
The budget includes a new permanent secretarial position, replacing
temporary help, and the support for a workshop to be held independent
of the Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends to the Governing Council that the 1995
budget be adopted at $440,000 (Endnote 3). <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 13. Forecast Budget for Fiscal Year 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
A forecast budget for fiscal year 1996 was presented by the Executive
Secretary and reviewed by the Committee. It was agreed to propose
a total budget of $500,000 for consideration by the Governing
Council. Such a budget would recognize the growing role of the
Organization, and the considerable uncertainties that still exist
as to the actual functions and responsibilities of the Organization.
Members felt that costs could increase significantly over future
years as membership and expected responsibilities expand.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 14. Trust Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Trust Fund account and the provisional guidelines for operating
the account were reviewed. The Executive Secretary should develop
options for funding the Trust Fund and provide these to the Committee
for consideration at the next Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends that the Governing Council adopt the
Provisional Guidelines as the PICES Trust Fund Guidelines (see
Council Report).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Adjournment<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed the final draft of the report of the meeting
and adjourned at 1200 hr., October 20, 1994. The Committee recommends
that this report and its contents be approved by the Governing
Council.<BR>

We have audited the statement of assets and liabilities of the
North Pacific Marine Science Organization as at December 31, 1993,
and the statement of sources of funds and expenditures for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Executive Secretary. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.<BR>
<P>
Our audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.<BR>
<P>
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the organization
as at December 31, 1993, and the results of its operations and
the changes in its cash position for the year then ended in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles described in Note
1 to the financial statements.<BR>

<P>
<B>1. Accounting Policies<BR>
</B>
<P>
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization Financial Regulations and
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies used in the preparation of these financial statements:
<BR>
<P>
a) Fund Accounting<BR>
<P>
The Working Capital Fund represents the accumulated excess of
funds provided by the Contracting Parties over expenditures. The
purposes of the General Fund and Working Capital Fund are established
by Regulation 6 of the Organization's Financial Regulations.<BR>
<P>
b) Capital Assets<BR>
<P>
Capital assets acquired by the Organization are expensed in the
year of acquisition (Note 2).<BR>
<P>
c) Income Tax<BR>
<P>
The Organization is a non-taxable organization under the Privileges
and Immunities (International Organizations) Act (Canada).<BR>
<P>
d) Foreign Exchange<BR>
<P>
Transactions originating in foreign currencies are translated
at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated
to equivalent Canadian amounts at the current rate of exchange
at the balance sheet date.<BR>
<P>
<B>2. Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
At December 31, 1993, capital assets on hand and their original
purchase price are as follows:<BR>
<PRE>
Furniture and fixtures    $20,507
Computer equipment        $35,731
       
Total                     $56,731

</PRE>
<P>
The assets were expensed in the year of acquisition.<BR>
<P>
<B>3. Commitments<BR>
</B>
<P>
Office space and services are provided to the Secretariat to the
Organization by the Government of Canada through the Department
of Fisheries and Oceans. The agreement commenced April 1, 1992
and continues indefinitely with a review every three years. The
fixed cost for office space is $2,000 per year. Services provided
are invoiced quarterly.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>4. Contingent Asset<BR>
</B>
<P>
As of December 15, 1993, the Organization received approval by
an Order in Council of Canada exempting it from the Goods and
Services Tax (GST). A second Order in Council is required to allow
the Organization to apply for a refund for GST paid retroactive
to January 8, 1993. No estimate of this contingent asset is re-elected
in the financial statements.<BR>

<P>
The Committee met on October 17th under the Chairmanship of Dr.
John C. Davis. (See Endnote 1 for list of participants.)<BR>
<P>
The Chairman of PICES, Dr. W.S. Wooster, attended and the Executive

<P>
The Chairman called the meeting to order and welcomed the participants,
particularly those from the Russian Federation and the Republic
of Korea who were participating for the first time as formal members
of the Committee. The Chairman reviewed the objectives of the
Committee, specifying that the goal of the session was to complete
consideration of the agenda in one day in order to prepare a draft
of the meeting report for review and approval by the Committee
members on the following day.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Adoption of Agenda <BR>
</B>
<P>
The agenda was adopted with several items added under &quot;Other

appended as additional agenda items.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Scheduling Annual Meetings<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee discussed scheduling of the Annual Meeting with
the objective of determining, if possible where subsequent meetings
would be held. Following on the discussion in the Committee at
the Third Annual Meeting, it is highly desirable that PICES have
as much notice about the location and financial arrangements as
possible well in advance of meetings to facilitate planning and
budgetary considerations. Thus, at the Third Annual Meeting a
process was adopted as described in the minutes of that meeting
that established dates by which prospective or actual hosts of
Annual Meetings would provide information to the Secretariat regarding
confirmation of arrangements to host the meeting or to cover some
of the costs associated with holding the meeting. <BR>
<P>
At the Third Annual Meeting it was established that the Fourth
Annual meeting would be held in the People's Republic of China
and that the 1996 and 1997 Annual Meetings would be held on the
East side of the Pacific and the West side of the Pacific respectively.
Canada has confirmed that it will host the 1996 Annual Meeting
in Nanaimo, British Columbia. In keeping with that arrangement,
the Republic of Korea agreed to investigate the feasibility of
hosting the 1997 Annual Meeting in Korea, with the proviso that
this would take some time to investigate and would require formal
approval. It was agreed that the Republic of Korea would inform
the Secretariat by December 15, 1995, whether or not the ROK intends
to host the 1997 Annual Meeting. Should the ROK agree to host
the meeting it would be necessary for the ROK to inform the Secretariat
of details of what costs it would cover and provide sufficient
details of arrangements by June 15, 1996 so that the Secretariat
could establish a firm budget for the meeting. No offers to host
the 1998 Annual Meeting were forthcoming. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Appointment of New Assistant Executive Secretary
in 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reviewed the proposed job description
for the new assistant executive secretary's position, explaining
that the current Assistant Executive Secretary, Dr. M. Miyata,
would be returning to Japan in April 1996. The new job description
contains additional responsibilities compared to the former description
of the position occupied by Dr. Miyata. There are additional duties
related to review of papers and documents, editorial responsibilities,
strong computer science and data management responsibilities,
linkages to key Committees such as TCODE, press relations and
other duties that increase the complexity of the position in keeping
with the emerging role of PICES. A Ph.D. or equivalent in terms
of significant experience is needed. While service in a major
international organization would be a desirable quality in a candidate,
it is not mandatory; however, knowledge of international organizations
and experience in working with them is highly desirable.<BR>
<P>
There was considerable discussion of the proposed salary range
for the position which is established at CDN $ 68,371 - $86,920
in the job description. Canada proposed that the salary on appointment
be established at the bottom end of the salary range and that
any subsequent salary increases be withheld in keeping with the
existing salary freeze in the Canadian Public Service. Considerable
debate ensued with several countries pointing out the organization
is an international organization and is not bound to follow the
salary practices of the host country, rather that those salary
practices only serve as guidance for the organization which is
free to adjust salary arrangements as appropriate. Several participants
stressed that the desire was to attract the best possible candidate
for the position and there were concerns that the low end of the
salary range or prospects of a wage freeze would discourage good
candidates. Canada stressed that unless an exceptional candidate
comes forward, the salary should be set at the lower end of the
range and urged that the Executive Secretary consider this approach
when staffing.<BR>
<P>
Following this discussion, the Committee approved the proposed
draft of the job description and recommended it to Council for
adoption with one amendment which referred to staff rules which
apply to the position. The Staff Rules would be distributed with
the job description to prospective candidates. Following approval
of the F &amp; A report by Council, finalized copies of the job
description were to be provided to each member nation for circulation
within their respective countries. Prospective candidates should
apply to the Secretariat by the end of December 1995 to facilitate
staffing early in the new calendar year with a desired objective
of having a short overlap between the new employee and the departing
current Assistant Executive Secretary for familiarization purposes.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Space, Facilities and Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary briefed the Committee on the desirability
of improving existing space at the Institute of Ocean Sciences
to provide additional office accommodation to serve the Secretariat's
new World Wide Web communications function and to improve wiring,
power supply and other support arrangements. The space at the
Institute is provided by the Government of Canada and Canada asked
to be briefed on the rationale for the proposed changes to the
room and to learn the positions of the Committee members with
respect to PICES offering such internet services. All members
support the initiative in keeping with the importance of PICES'
role as an international organization concerned with the North
Pacific Ocean and in terms of the need to communicate with member
nations, cooperators and interested parties on science-related
issues. Dr. McKone will discuss the matter further with the Regional
Director of Science, Dr. Davis, at the Institute, to facilitate
having the modifications made to the room when funds become available.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Proposed Changes to Financial Regulations<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee discussed two draft changes to financial regulations
dealing with the establishment of a relocation and home leave
fund and an increase to the authorized level of the Working Capital
Fund as proposed by the Executive Secretary. It was proposed to
establish a Relocation and Home Leave Fund and increase the Working
Capital Fund to deal with serious problems related to budgeting
and cash flow experienced in the initial years of operating PICES.
Specifically, due to complexities of budgeting and approvals processes
and also to the fact that fiscal years differ significantly between
member countries, annual contributions often reach the organization
late which places operations in jeopardy unless the working capital
fund is sufficiently large to offset a delay in the arrival of
the contributions. It was agreed that a fund sufficient to allow
approximately two months of operation of the secretariat in the
event of late payments (about CDN $100,000.00) was desirable.
The other problem related to periodic fluctuations in the need
to make relatively large payments for home leave and relocation
of employees due to them returning to their home country and a
new incumbent arriving. For example, when Dr. Miyata leaves in
the Spring of 1996 and if a new replacement comes from the western
Pacific, a relocation cost of around $100,000 CDN could be incurred.
Establishment of a Relocation and Home Leave Fund would allow
the organization to finance such periodic expenditures without
large year to year changes in contributions from members. Accordingly,
the Executive Secretary proposed the following which was reviewed
and adopted by the Committee:<BR>
<P>
&quot;The estimated surplus in the Working Capital Fund on December
31st will be approximately $150,000. The Secretariat proposes
that these funds be used as follows: <BR>
<P>
1. Raise the authorized amount of the Working Capital Fund to
CDN $100,000 to allow for cash flow problems that can occur when
fees are not paid in a timely manner. <BR>
<P>
2. The residue of the funds in the Working Capital Fund (approximately
$50,000 CDN) be used to establish the Relocation and Home Leave
Fund proposed in the amendments to the Financial Regulations.
<BR>
<P>
3. Funds collected from the levee in lieu of taxes from foreign
staff and the refunds from the GST be deposited in the Relocation
and Home Leave Fund to bring it up to an agreed level. This fund
is proposed to be set at a maximum of $110,000 initially and would
need to be adjusted from time to time as the costs increase.<BR>
<P>
To effect these proposed changes, the Financial Regulations will
need to be amended as follows:<BR>
<P>
Revise Financial Regulation 6(iii) to read:<BR>
<P>
The amount of the Working Capital Fund shall be reviewed by the
Council at each annual meeting, and may be revised effective on
the first day of the ensuing financial year. The Working Capital
Fund may be increased by miscellaneous income, contributions pursuant
to Regulation 6(vi), and any cash surplus in the General Fund
at the close of the financial year following that annual meeting,
to the extent that any such surplus is not required to meet outstanding
commitments as provided in Regulation 4(ii).<BR>
<P>
Revise Financial Regulation 6(v) to read:<BR>
<P>
The Council may decide to enter amounts from the Working Capital
Fund at the close of the financial year as income in the budget
of the ensuing financial year and use such amounts to offset contributions
of Contracting Parties in the ensuing financial year; provided,
however, if the annual budget for any financial year includes
any appropriation or transfer from the Working Capital Fund based
in whole or in part on estimates of the amount in the Working
Capital Fund at the close of the financial year, and the deduction
of that appropriation or transfer shall cause the Fund established
pursuant to Regulation 6(iii) to fall below the amount set by
Council for the following year, the Executive Secretary shall
reduce the said appropriation or transfer to the extent necessary
to prevent the Fund from falling below the amount established
pursuant to Regulation 6(iii), and shall adjust said contributions
to compensate for the reduced appropriation or transfer, or the
amount of any such appropriation or transfer may be entered as
a credit to contracting party or parties in a special credit fund.
The Executive Secretary shall promptly inform the Council of such
actions.<BR>
<P>
Insert new Financial Regulation 6(vii). <BR>
<P>
... funds available in the Relocation and Home Leave Fund shall
be used, to the extent appropriated by the Council as part of
the budget decision, to pay relocation and home leave expenses
of appropriate new employees and their dependents to the seat
of the Secretariat and for removal after the period of employment
has ended, and for home leave for internationally recruited staff
and their dependents, in accordance with established rules and
practices;<BR>
<P>
Renumber existing Financial Regulation 6(vii) as (viii) and revise
it to read:<BR>
<P>
... and any advance made by a Contracting Party to the Organization,
or any credit made to a Contacting Party as a result of an appropriation
or transfer from the Working Capital Fund pursuant to Regulation
6(v), shall be carried to the credit of the respective Contracting
Party or Parties in a Special Credit Fund until such Contracting
Party or Parties informs the Executive Secretary of any disposition
it desires of any such credit or credits.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Auditor's Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Auditor's Report (Endnote 2) was reviewed and adopted by the
Committee as tabled. The Executive Secretary expressed a desire
to use the same audit firm for an additional year. The Executive
Secretary reported that new accounting software under investigation
may reduce audit costs in future years.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Working Capital Fund <BR>
</B>
<P>
This item was dealt with under Agenda Item 6 as reported above.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Administrative and Financial Statements for
1995 (to October 1 and estimated to December 31)<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reviewed administrative and financial
statements for 1995 as distributed to Committee members and the
statements were discussed by the Committee.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Budget for Fiscal Year 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
The budget proposed for 1996 fiscal year was presented item by
item by the Executive Secretary. China suggested that the total
budget should be held to $440,000, the same level as the previous
year, but other members thought that this would restrict activities
at a time when PICES is still growing to meet the needs of members
and this is particularly important with the increase in membership
in 1995. The key point is that Secretariat operating costs must
increase to provide services to new members. Canada proposed that
salary raises should not occur in 1996 as the Canadian civil service
salaries have been frozen for several years. The U.S.A. pointed
out that PICES was not restricted to explicitly follow the Canadian
Government in setting salary levels. The Committee agreed that
the salary levels should be raised as proposed by the Executive
Secretary (Endnote 3). The Committee recommended that the Chairman
investigate salary increase practices in other international organizations
including the issue of whether such organizations employ a salary
scale. The Chairman, Dr. Wooster, undertook to have that study
done. <BR>
<P>
Canada suggested that where possible, Secretariat participation
in non-PICES meetings be kept down to one person and that where practical, PICES be represented at such meetings by someone from a PICES member country who is already attending.
<P>
Cost recovery on publications was discussed but the committee did not come to any conclusion on changing the current practice of no cost recovery.  Much of the increased cost of printing and communications is due to growing activities of PICES communities and working groups and is internal to PICES.
<P>
On reviewing the draft budget presented by the Executive Secretary, China proposed that the amount shown against relocation and home leave be reduced.
The Committee agreed to Canada's proposal to reduce that item in the budget from $ 100,000 CDN to $ 60,000 CDN and that change was incorporated in the budget document.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends to the Governing Council that the 1996
budget be adopted at CDN $509,000 (Endnote 3).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. Forecast Budget for Fiscal Year 1997<BR>
</B>
<P>
A forecast budget for fiscal year 1997 was presented by the Executive
Secretary and reviewed by the Committee. The salary levels were
adjusted to reflect discussion on the 1996 budget levels. For
purposes of the forecast budget for 1997, Personnel Services were
tentatively set at a level 3% above the 1996 budget level with
the recognition that the entire matter will be reviewed next year,
including consideration of the salary study to be conducted by
the Chairman of PICES. The funding level of the Relocation and
Home Leave Fund reflects the decision to establish such a fund
and the need to replenish the fund after expected expenditures
in 1996. It was agreed to propose a total forecast budget of CDN
$534,000 for consideration by the Governing Council.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Trust Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported on the status of the Trust Fund.
Considerable discussion took place on the use of the Trust Fund
which China proposed be used to support the participation of member
country attendees at PICES meetings. In response to this request,
the Committee considered that guidelines for the use of the Trust
Fund were developed during the Third Annual Meeting which provide
general direction as to its use. At present the Executive Secretary
and the Chairman make decisions on the use of the Trust Fund but
this does not exclude the possible use of the fund to support
participation of scientists from member nations although this
has been discouraged to date to avoid rapidly depleting the fund
due to off loading of costs associated with delegation participation.
Rules of Procedure (Rule 1(iii)) stipulate that each Contracting
Party shall pay the expenses of its own Delegation to all meetings
held pursuant to the Convention. As a general rule, it is desirable
that the Parties pay for their delegates as specified, however,
flexibility exists to support desirable attendees such as young
scientists in future. It is anticipated that the fund could be
used more broadly in future, particularly if a means can be found
to increase the size of the fund.
<P>
(see also below under Other Business). <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 13. Other Funds Held <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported on the disposition of funds held
on behalf of Japan and the United States. The United States informed
the Committee that with respect to the $50,000 of US funding held
by the Secretariat, they continue to be prepared to donate all
or a portion of that amount to the Trust Fund providing other
countries would match the amount donated by equal contributions
to the Trust Fund. No other use of the credit has been decided
to date.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 14. Other Business<BR>
</B>
<P>
Three additional items were discussed:
<P>
<U>Representation at the F &amp; A Meetings and Notification Procedures
<BR>
</U>
<P>
Difficulties were reported by the Executive Secretary related
to knowing in advance who would participate in Finance and Administration
Committee meetings and also with respect to communications between
financial officers, Delegates and the Secretariat. It was resolved
that Rule 1(i) of the Rules of Procedure should be followed such
that each Contracting Party would inform the Executive Secretary
in writing of their delegation to the coming Annual Meeting, including
the names of those who will attend the F &amp; A meeting. This
notification should be made at least three weeks in advance of
the Annual Meeting and any subsequent changes in participation
should be brought to the immediate attention of the Executive
Secretary. In addition, it was requested that all correspondence
between the Secretariat and financial analysts of member countries
be copied to corresponding national Delegates.<BR>
<P>
<U>Increasing the Size of the Trust Fund<BR>
</U>
<P>
In response to a referral from Governing Council and a suggestion
made in Council by the United States, the Committee considered
ways by which the size of the Trust Fund could be increased. It
was generally agreed that it may be difficult to gain support
from funding sources for an intergovernmental organization and
that the most likely source of funding was from the member governments
themselves. It was pointed out that in order to attract additional
funding, specific focussed uses related to scientific issues in
the North Pacific need to be identified. It was also thought desirable
to develop more promotional information, brochures and other documentation
that explains the activities and purpose of the PICES organization
so it becomes better known and supported within member countries.
It was agreed that the Executive Secretary should obtain and circulate
information on the operation and funding of the WMO and IOC Trust
Fund. The Committee felt this matter deserved further consideration
by Council. <BR>
<P>
<U>Quality of Scientific Communications During Presentations at
Meetings<BR>
</U>
<P>
The Committee discussed this matter from the perspective of the
need to maximize the effectiveness of communications and improve
the quality of presentations made at PICES meetings. Specifically,
as the organization is composed of many nationalities and operates
in the English language, it is particularly important that priority
be given to effective presentations of papers at meetings and
in addressing the challenge of improving communications where
linguistic differences occur. Since English is the second language
of most participants, presentations should be particularly clear,
to the point, and make effective use of graphics. The Committee
feels that guidelines for presentation of papers and examples
of good, clear presentational material need to be developed and
distributed to speakers prior to each PICES meeting in an attempt
to improve and standardize the quality of presentations. The Committee
requests that Council task the Science Board to develop these
guidelines in consultation with the Secretariat and that a package
of information be distributed to all speakers prior the next Annual
Meeting. In addition, as the organization matures, Council may
wish to consider moving to a more formal requirement to have papers
written and distributed at or prior to meetings in order to improve
communications. <BR>

We have audited the statements of assets and liabilities of the
North Pacific Marine Science Organization as at December 31, 1994,
and the statement of sources of funds and expenditures for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the organization's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.<BR>
<P>
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.<BR>
<P>
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the organization
as at December 31, 1994, and the results of its operations and
the changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. <BR>

<CENTER><B>December 31, 1994<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Accounting Policies<BR>
</B>
<P>
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization's Financial Regulations and
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies used in the preparation of these financial statements:
<BR>
<P>
a) Fund Accounting<BR>
<P>
The Working Capital Fund represents the accumulated excess of
funds provided by the Contracting Parties over expenditures .
The purposes of the General Fund and Working Capital Fund are
established by Regulation 6 of the Organization Financial Regulation.
<BR>
<P>
b) Capital Assets<BR>
<P>
Capital assets acquired by the Organization are expensed in the
year of acquisition. (Note 2).<BR>
<P>
c) Income Tax<BR>
<P>
The Organization is a non-taxable organization under the Privileges
and Immunities (International Organizations) Act (Canada).<BR>
<P>
d) Foreign Exchange<BR>
<P>
Transactions originating in foreign currencies are translated
at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated
to equivalent Canadian amounts at the current rate of exchange
at the balance sheet date.<BR>
<P>
<B>2. Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
At December 31, 1994, capital assets on hand and their original
purchase price are as follows:<BR>
<PRE>
Furniture and fixtures      $28,890
Computer equipment          $42,693
      
                            $71,582




</PRE>
<P>
The assets were expensed in the year of acquisition.<BR>
<P>
<B>3. Commitments<BR>
</B>
<P>
Office space and services are provided to the Secretariat to the
Organization by the Government of Canada through the Department
of Fisheries and Ocean. This agreement commenced April 1, 1992
and continues indefinitely with a review every three years. The
fixed cost for office space is $2,000 per year. Services provided
are invoiced quarterly.<BR>
<P>
<B>4. Contingent Asset<BR>
</B>
<P>
As of December 15, 1993, the Organization received approval by
the Order in Council of Canada exempting it from the Goods and
Services Tax (GST). A second Order in Council is required to allow
the Organization to apply for a refund for GST paid retroactive
to January 8, 1993. No estimate of this contingent asset is reflected
in the financial statements.<BR>

<H1>1996 Report of Finance and Administration Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR width=90% align=center size=4>
<P>
The Committee met Oct. 14, 15<SUP>th</SUP> and 16<SUP>th</SUP>
under the Chairmanship of Dr. John C. Davis (See Endnote 1 for
list of participants).<BR>
<P>
The Chairman of PICES, Dr. W.S. Wooster, the Executive Secretary,
Dr. W.D. McKone, and the Assistant Executive Secretary, Dr. Alexander
Bychkov, also attended. Drs. McKone and Bychkov, together with
the Chairman, acted as rapporteurs.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 1. Opening by the Chairman <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chairman called the meeting to order and welcomed the participants,
stressing that the job of the Committee was to review financial
and administrative matters in keeping with the rules of the Organization
and to provide a report to Governing Council for consideration
and adoption.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 2. Adoption of Agenda <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Agenda was adopted with an item on &quot;Perspectives&quot;
added under &quot;Other Business&quot;. Documents entitled &quot;PICES
Perspectives&quot;, a synthesis of key ideas in that document,
and additional document entitled &quot;Communication Perspective&quot;
were identified as background material for review prior to discussion
of the &quot;Perspectives&quot; issue.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 3. Scheduling of Annual Meetings<BR>
</B>
<P>
With respect to scheduling of the Sixth Annual Meeting in 1997,
the Republic of Korea reaffirmed its invitation to host the meeting
with the location to be confirmed prior to December 1996. For
the Seventh Annual Meeting in 1998, the U.S.A. is working an invitation
through appropriate channels. The Russian Federation is prepared
to host the Eighth Annual Meeting in 1999 and will provide the
name of a contact person to the PICES Secretariat with whom to
discuss arrangements.<BR>
<P>
The duration and structure of future meetings was discussed with
a view to determining what length of meeting and structure was
best. Originally, the concept of having intersessional meetings
of Committees and/or Working Groups was explored in order for
those bodies to conduct their work prior to the Annual Meeting.
A negative aspect of such an approach is the cost associated with
international travel to such intersessional meetings. At this
Annual Meeting, a structure involving having Committees and Working
Groups precede the Annual Meeting was adopted. However, attendance
at some meetings was poor and not all members were represented.
It was decided to explore the best approach with the scientists
and the PICES Members were encouraged to do this with their respective
delegations. In addition, the matter of meeting duration and structure
were referred to the Science Board which supported continuation
for the next year of the 1996 pattern. The Board supported a duration
of ten days and a structure consisting of three days of working
group meetings, five days for the scientific programs well as
certain meetings of the Governing council and Finance and Administration
Committee, and two days for final actions by the Science Board
and Governing Council. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 4. Appointment of Executive Secretary<BR>
</B>
<P>
A draft procedure for proceeding to advertise the position of
Executive Secretary and a draft position description were reviewed
by the Committee. Some amendments were made to the draft position
description to add clarity. With respect to the salary range given
in the job description, the decision is deferred pending completion
of the Government of Canada's classification review as described
under Agenda Item 10. Revisions to the position description were
drafted by a small task group to clarify the document and the
revised draft is appended for Council's information. This document
will have to be revised by the Finance and Administration Committee
at the Sixth Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
The Executive Secretary requested a one year extension to his
position term in order to address pension considerations and allow
him to complete implementation of training and other tasks in
the Secretariat. The Committee considered this request and was
unanimous in approving it. Accordingly, the Committee recommends
that the appointment of the Executive Secretary, Dr. W.D. McKone,
be extended for one year to December 1998. Advertisement for a
replacement and selection of a suitable candidate should be arranged
in order to provide for some overlap of the incoming and outgoing
individuals and details of the position advertisement, job description,
and selection process will have to be finalized at the next Annual
Meeting (Appendix 1).<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 5. Space, Facilities and Equipment<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary briefed the Committee on the status of
discussions with respect to space allotted to the Secretariat
at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans' Institute of Ocean
Sciences in Sidney, B.C. There have been ongoing discussions with
Fisheries and Oceans with respect to conversion of additional
space for the Secretariat as it grows and there is a need to follow
through on provision of that space for the Secretariat. Dr. Davis
explained that 1996 had been a very difficult year with respect
to budget freezes and cuts and that the Department was prepared
to entertain this request in the coming year. The Executive Secretary
will pursue discussions with the Department. <BR>
<P>
With respect to equipment, there was a question of whether PICES
could face a budget challenge if large amounts of equipment had
to be replaced at short notice. The Executive Secretary explained
that desktop computer equipment was adequate in the short-term
and that there was a need to upgrade some laptop computers essential
to the operation of the Organization, particularly when meetings
are held away from the Secretariat home location. Major budgetary
challenges of this sort are not viewed as a problem, provided
a gradual replacement and upgrade approach to equipment is followed
to keep pace with needs and the capabilities of equipment. It
was also suggested that the Executive Secretary investigate whether
renting laptop computers was a beneficial approach to allow utilization
of the latest technology to meet PICES periodic needs for extra
laptops for Annual Meetings while avoiding having to purchase
some machines for that purpose. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 6. Rules Change to Allow Past Chairman to Serve
as an Ex-officio Participant<BR>
</B>
<P>
The proposal made by the U.S.A. for a rule change which would
allow an outgoing Chairman to serve PICES in an ex-officio advisory
capacity for the term of the incoming Chairman was discussed.
There was general consensus that the idea was a good one and there
was debate about how to accomplish this objective (i.e.- by changing
the rules or by approving the approach under existing rules through
a decision of Council). At issue, was whether PICES should pay
the travel expenses for the Past Chairman appointed in this capacity
or whether they should be borne by the country of origin of the
individual and there was not full consensus on this issue. The
Committee decided to recommend that the outgoing Chairman, Dr.
Wooster, be appointed in an ex-officio advisory capacity to Governing
Council with authorization to attend Annual Meetings with the
associated travel budget to be funded from the interest accrued
in the Working Capital Fund. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 7. Financial Support for PICES scientist to attend
SCOR-WG 105<BR>
</B>
<P>
This item involved a specific issue of approval of a PICES scientist
to attend the SCOR-WG 105 meeting at the expense of the Organization
as well as the more general issue of whether the Chairman and
Executive Secretary would continue to exercise their existing
discretion to approve such expenditures in the future. From time
to time, it may be desirable to have representatives of the PICES
Organization engage in travel at the organization's expense in
order to attend important meetings and act on PICES behalf. After
discussion, it was agreed that it would be undesirable to restrict
the flexibility of the Organization by requiring every specific
travel approval to be reviewed by Governing Council. Accordingly,
the Committee recommends that the Executive Secretary endeavor
to provide the PICES Members with as complete as possible a proposal
for travel approvals at the time the budget is prepared and to
report fully at the end of a budget cycle on travel that was approved.
In addition, it was agreed that Council should ask the Science
Board for a projection of any budgetary implications of its recommendations
at the time the Science Board report is tabled for consideration
by the Governing Council at the Annual Meeting. In this manner,
Governing Council can revisit the budget if necessary, prior to
cessation of the final session of the Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 8. Salary Practices of Other Organizations<BR>
</B>
<P>
In keeping with discussions at the previous Annual Meeting, the
Chairman reported on his commitment to investigate salary increase
practices of other international organizations including whether
pay scales were employed. Responses from four organizations were
received in writing: the Pacific Salmon Commission, the Great
Lakes Fishery Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission,
and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. In general,
these organizations follow the salary practices of the country
in which the Secretariat is located, while in some, there is not
strict adherence to that practice. This item is considered an
information item for guidance of the PICES Organization. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 9. Audited Accounts for Financial Year 1995<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Auditor's Report was reviewed and after some questions of
clarification, adopted by the Committee (Endnote 2). The Executive
Secretary, in response to a query from China, explained that further
details on any item contained in the Auditor's Report can be provided
to any PICES Members requesting such details. The Auditor's Report
is recommended to Governing Council for approval. The recommendation
of the Executive Secretary to retain the auditor Flader and Greene
for another year was approved. <BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 10. Budget<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>a) Estimated Accounts for Fiscal Year 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
This document was reviewed and it was pointed out to the participants
that an error had been made in the tables presented to Committee
members. The table showing the proposed Contribution from each
party and the figures for 1997 should be amended to show a proposed
national contribution of $88,000.00 and a total contribution of
<P>
$ 528,000 respectively.<BR>
<P>
<B>b) Budget for Financial Year 1997 <BR>
</B>
<P>
A detailed review of the draft budget proposal was conducted with
much discussion amongst the participants. Both Canada and China,
particularly, sought explanation of proposed budget expenditures
and sought to reduce the size of the proposed budget, particularly
with respect to Personnel Services and Travel line items in the
budget. China proposed, and it was agreed that travel costs associated
with the Annual Meeting not be shown under the line item &quot;Expenses
for Annual Meeting&quot; but rather under &quot;Travel&quot;.
Furthermore, the Executive Secretary was asked to compile a listing
of proposed travel for the budget year that was as detailed as
possible to allow the PICES Members to examine travel proposals
at the time the budget was reviewed. Each year, this review should
include examination of an itemized report summarizing travel paid
for by the Organization for the past budget year leading up until
the time of the Annual Meeting. There was disagreement amongst
the participants as to the merits of a periodic reporting (every
three or four months) of in-year travel expenses and it was pointed
out that this level of detail was not required in other similar
international bodies to which a number of the PICES Members belong.
The Secretariat reconfirmed its commitment to provide additional
information on any budget item that was of interest to any PICES
Member and will respond to specific inquiries as requested.<BR>
<P>
Canada raised the matter that when the Annual Meeting is on the
Western side of the Pacific it has been a practice to have PICES
contribute a substantive amount of funding to defray the expenses
of the host country while that practice has not been followed
for meetings held on the Eastern side of the Pacific. In those
cases, the U.S.A. or Canada have covered most of the cost of hosting
the Annual Meeting. Canada proposed that for future meetings (after
the Sixth Annual Meeting which is currently being planned in accord
with this past practice), that PICES contribute no money to offset
the costs, or that alternately, some formula be found to keep
the cost down. In discussion, Korea proposed there be no change
to the process and that the U.S.A. and Canada should apply for
assistance to offset Annual Meeting costs in years that they hosted
the Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
With respect to Personnel Services, it was agreed that the job
descriptions for all positions in the Secretariat be reviewed
by a classification specialist from the Government of Canada with
the objective of determining if they are suitably classified in
accordance with the duties of the positions. This will provide
PICES with useful information with which to judge salary matters
and level of remuneration associated with each position. This
review should be conducted as soon as possible with the results
circulated to the PICES Members. If an upward revision of the
salary is justified for any position, the Executive Secretary
will be authorized to implement the increase. Pending the outcome
of the review only staff entitled to a step increase will receive
it. With these adjustments the proposed total budget for personnel
services was set at $274,000.00 for 1997.<BR>
<P>
Regarding the proposed $10,000.00 budgeted for the &quot;Trust
Fund&quot; line item, this entry was removed from the proposed
budget for reasons described below.<BR>
<P>
After considerable discussion of the line items in the budget,
and extensive explanations, largely in response to questions about
budget particulars raised by China, there was consensus amongst
of the Committee Members that a total budget of $509,000.00 was
appropriate (Endnote 3). This figure could be reached by subtracting
savings of $8,000.00 from Personnel Services, reducing the travel
budget to $64,000.00 (including travel associated with the Annual
Meeting) and eliminating the $10,000.00 proposed for the Trust
Fund as indicated above. This revised budget figure is therefore
identical to the 1996 budget and will require a contribution from
each country of $84,800. Detailed budget documentation is included
at the end of this report and the budget is recommended for adoption.
<BR>
<P>
<B>c) Forecast Budget for Financial Year 1998<BR>
</B>
<P>
This item was examined by the Committee and is recommended for
information to Governing Council without need to adopt the forecast
budget at this time. It should be noted that although the forecast
budget contains an item related to the trust fund, the Finance
and Administration Committee has not concluded consideration of
the Trust Fund matter and inclusion of this item does not mean
there is agreement on supplementing the Trust Fund from the PICES
budget.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>d) Working Capital Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported on the status of the Working
Capital Fund for the information of the Committee Members. The
fund contained a total of $105,013.82 including accrued interest
on September 30, 1996.<BR>
<P>
<B>e) Trust Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported that the Trust Fund contained
a total of $64,241.07 as of the 30th of September, 1996. None
of this money has been spent to date to support participation
of additional scientists at PICES functions. In addition, the
U.S.A. indicated that approximately $43,000.00 that was being
held on its behalf could be added to the Trust Fund with the proviso
that this money be used to support the participation of Chinese
and Russian scientists at future PICES functions.<BR>
<P>
There was extensive discussion of how the Trust Fund should be
used, following on from the decision of Governing Council in 1994
when the fund was established. At that time, Council established
the fund &quot;for the purpose of facilitating participation of
a broad spectrum of scientists in activities of the Organization&quot;.
At the current Finance and Administration meeting there was considerable
discussion about the merits of including a scheme to replenish
the trust fund by making it a line item in the budget, whether
contributions to the trust fund should be voluntary and outside
the budget process, and whether the funds should be used to support
scientists from PICES Members, including those serving on Committees
and Working Groups. <BR>
<P>
On the subject of who was eligible for trust fund support, China
felt that the fund should be used to support participation of
PICES Members scientists including those serving on committees
and working groups. Others felt that such individuals should be
supported by the PICES Members sending the individual or the organization
from which the individual came and that these moneys should only
be used to allow individuals who would not normally be able to
attend to take part in PICES functions. Korea was of the opinion
that only scientists from PICES Members should be eligible for
trust fund support. Others felt that support from the trust fund
should be used to allow scientists outside of PICES Members as
well as those from PICES Members to attend. Canada, Japan, Korea,
and the U.S.A. stated that there was no financial mechanism within
their own financial approval process to allow voluntary contributions
to a trust fund if the fund were not specified as an item within
the PICES budget. <BR>
<P>
It was decided that PICES should continue to examine this question,
drawing on the documentation available to date, and including:
<BR>
<P>
- whether there should be replenishment of the Fund from the budget,
<BR>
<P>
- developing a process whereby interested scientists apply for
funding support from the Trust Fund to attend meetings with the
approval to be given no later than 3 months prior to the event;
<BR>
<P>
- a process of review and approval of requests by the Chairman
of the Science Board, in consultation with the Chairman and Executive
Secretary;<BR>
<P>
- whether rule and procedural changes are required to facilitate
the process.<BR>
<P>
At the conclusion of this discussion, it was recommended that
the Secretariat be asked to develop a draft rule change that would
further consider these options and also to develop explanatory
guidelines as to how the money would be used and decisions would
be made on requests for funding assistance. This information would
be circulated to the PICES Members for their consideration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>f) Home Leave Relocation Fund<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary reported on the status of this fund, estimating
that to December 31, 1996, the fund would have a total of $99,642.95.
<BR>
<P>
<B>g) Other Funds Held<BR>
</B>
<P>
A total of $100,000.00 was held on behalf of PICES Members, including
$50,000 from Japan that would be paid towards contributions in
1997. The remaining $50,000.00 was held on behalf of the United
States, approximately $7,000.00 of which had been used to cover
travel of Russian scientists to PICES meetings. The residual,
approx. $43,000.00 was designated for use in the Trust Fund for
support of Chinese and Russian scientists as stated earlier.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 11. F &amp; A Membership and Term of Chairman<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary stressed that the Secretariat has difficulties
determining what individuals will attend F &amp; A meetings as
PICES Members often do not provide F &amp; A Committee membership.
With this lack of information, communication difficulties have
been experienced as information sometimes does not reach the individuals
who attend F &amp; A meetings and key documents may not be available
for analysis by concerned individuals prior to the Annual Meeting.
The Committee recommends the Council stress the importance of
identification of F &amp; A Committee members and encourage the
PICES Members to regularly supply and update this information
in writing as changes occur.<BR>
<P>
The Committee further recommends that rules be amended (Appendix
2) to specify that each PICES Member appoint a member and an alternate
for service on the F &amp; A Committee, and that meetings be closed,
(in keeping with the existing rules) to all but the members and
their alternates, the Committee Chairman and the Vice-Chairman
of PICES.<BR>
<P>
Finally, the Committee proposes that the term of appointment of
the Chairman of the Finance and Administration Committee be for
a term of two years and that the Chairman shall only be eligible
for reappointment only once for a successive term of two years.
In keeping with Rule 15, the Chairman of the Finance and Administration
Committee would be appointed by the Council from among the Committee
members. In that regard, the Chairman, Dr. J.C. Davis, stated
that having done the job for five years, he felt the job should
be taken over by another individual and stated that he was not
prepared to serve as Chairman for an additional term beyond the
Fifth Annual Meeting. A rule change is proposed (Appendix 2).
<BR>
<P>
<B>Agenda Item 12. Other Business<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>a) Perspectives Documentation<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed two documents, one entitled &quot;Perspectives&quot;
prepared by the Chairman and the Executive Secretary and a second
entitled &quot;Communication Perspective&quot;. In addition to
the former document, a synopsis of its key findings was reviewed
by the Committee.<BR>
<P>
The item in the &quot;Perspectives&quot; document that was considered
to be relevant to the business of F &amp; A was the reference
to the trust fund which had been extensively discussed by the
Committee as summarized above. Korea noted a preference to have
Trust Fund moneys used to support the participation of scientists
from PICES members only.<BR>
<P>
On the matter of the &quot;Communication Perspective&quot; document,
the Committee endorsed efforts to improve communications within
the Organization. Some members were concerned about the proliferation
of committees which increase complexity and expense and were of
the opinion that TCODE should be tasked with the initiatives summarized
in the document. While there are some concerns about the workload
of TCODE, it was noted that TCODE itself is proposing addressing
the initiatives in the document through a TCODE Subcommittee.
This seemed an appropriate approach to a number of Committee members.

</B></U>
<P>
Applications are invited for a five-year appointment to the position
of Executive Secretary of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization
(PICES).<BR>
<P>
The purpose of the Organization is to promote and coordinate marine
scientific research in order to advance scientific knowledge of
the area concerned (i.e. the northern North Pacific and adjacent
seas especially northward from 30 degrees North Latitude) and
of its living resources, including but not necessarily limited
to research with respect to the ocean environment and its interactions
with land and atmosphere, its role in and response to global weather
and climate change, its flora, fauna and ecosystems, its uses
and resources, and impact upon it from human activities; and to
promote the collection and exchange of information and data related
to marine scientific research in the area concerned.<BR>
<P>
The Organization's main bodies - the Governing Council and Science
Board - meet annually, and more often if necessary. Member States
currently are Canada, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States
of America. English is the working and official language of the
Organization.<BR>
<P>
The Secretariat is located at the Institute of Ocean Sciences,
British Columbia and provides services to the Organization in
the exercise of its duties and functions.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Description of the Position and Duties <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Executive Secretary is the Organization's chief administrative
officer and must be impartial in promoting and coordinating the
interests of all Contracting Parties. The Executive Secretary
is responsible for the management of the Organization's office,

of the Organization and its constituent bodies and committees;
prepares annual budget estimates and forecasts; annual financial
statements, and other documents as required; invests funds that
are surplus to immediate needs; handles correspondence; prepares
minutes of Governing Council, Science Board, and Finance and Administration
Committee; prepares an annual report of the Organization for distribution
to the Member States; and publishes the annual report and other
scientific publications as required by the Organization. The successful
candidate must be self-motivated and be responsible for administration
and staff of the Organization; work with the Chairman of Council,
Science Board, Scientific Committees, Working Groups, and other
bodies. <BR>
<P>
The Executive Secretary is assisted by an Assistant Executive
Secretary, Administrative Assistant, and a Secretary.<BR>

We have audited the statements of assets and liabilities of the
North Pacific Marine Science Organization as at December 31, 1995,
and the statement of sources of funds and expenditures for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the organization's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.<BR>
<P>
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.<BR>
<P>
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the organization
as at December 31, 1995, and the results of its operations and
the changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. <BR>

<CENTER>Notes to Financial Statements </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>December 31, 1995</CENTER>
<P>
1. Accounting Policies
<P>
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the North
Pacific Marine Science Organization's Financial Regulations and
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies used in the preparation of these financial statements:
<BR>
<P>
a) Fund Accounting<BR>
<P>
The Working Capital Fund represents the accumulated excess of
contributions provided by the Contracting Parties over expenditures
in the general fund. The purposes of the General Fund and Working
Capital Fund are established by Regulation 6 of the Organization
Financial Regulation.<BR>
<P>
b) Capital Assets<BR>
<P>
Capital assets acquired by the Organization are expensed in the
year of acquisition. (Note 2).<BR>
<P>
c) Income Tax<BR>
<P>
The Organization is a non-taxable organization under the Privileges
and Immunities (International Organizations) Act (Canada).<BR>
<P>
d) Foreign Exchange<BR>
<P>
Transactions originating in foreign currencies are translated
at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated
to equivalent Canadian amounts at the current rate of exchange
at the balance sheet date.
<P>
2. Equipment
<P>
At December 31, 1995, capital assets on hand and their original
purchase price are as follows:
<P>
Furniture and fixtures $32,423 Computer equipment 60,432 $92,855
<P>
The assets were expensed in the year of acquisition. 
<P>
3. Commitments
<P>
Office space and services are provided to the Secretariat to the
Organization by the Government of Canada through the Department
of Fisheries and Ocean. This agreement commenced April 1, 1992
and continues indefinitely with a review every three years. The
fixed cost for office space is $2,000 per year. Services provided
are invoiced quarterly.
<P>

<H1>1992 Report of Science Board </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The Board met on October 16, from 1300 to 1730.<BR>
<P>
<B>Participants were:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. D. Ware - Chairman, Science Board
<P>
Dr. W. Wooster - Chairman, PICES
<P>
Dr. Q. Tang - Chairman, Fishery Science Committee
<P>
Professor M.M. Mullin - Chairman, Biological Oceanography Committee
<P>
Professor J. Zhou - Chairman, Marine Environmental Quality Committee
<P>
Dr. Y. Nagata - Chairman, Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
<BR>
<P>
The Chairman, Dr. Ware, called the meeting to order and the task
before the Board was discussed. The Board was to review the findings
of each of the PICES scientific committees as presented by their
chairmen and discuss the business flowing from the reports, particularly
that leading up to the design of the Second Annual Meeting. Reports
from each of the scientific committees are appended and are summarized
as follows:<BR>
<P>
<B>Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) - Professor Michael
Mullin<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee discussed presentations of a prototypical scientific
program by each member. The Committee was not prepared to recommend
any scientific programs at the first meeting, but is clearly interested
in developing a large scale, long term approach emphasizing ecological
concepts or processes that could be tested in several regions.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Fishery Science Committee (FIS) - Dr. Dan Ware and Professor
Qisheng Tang<BR>
</B>
<P>
Discussion in the Committee focused on comparative studies. There
was unanimous agreement among the member countries that we conduct
comparative studies on important groups of species around the
Pacific Rim. It was also agreed that FIS should participate in
planning and promoting interdisciplinary studies in the Bering
Sea and subarctic Pacific. <BR>
<P>
<B>Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) - Professor Jiayi
Zhou<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee prepared summary recommendations for scientific
sessions and inter-committee sessions for the Second Annual Meeting.
In PICES the Committee felt that it should focus on the development
of common assessment methodology for marine pollution in the North
Pacific. There was a need to strengthen the role of inter-committee
activities, by focusing the organizing and planning of the Second
Annual Meeting on this goal. As a subset of activities directed
at assessment techniques and methodologies in marine environmental
quality, two areas were particularly important - algal blooms
and chemical and biological contaminants. The Committee proposed
a specific outline for meeting topics which expanded upon these
two sub-themes.<BR>
<P>
<B>Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC) - Professor
Yutaka Nagata<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed important topics in physical oceanography
and climate in the North Pacific. In addition to identifying important
issues in the area, the Committee reviewed the relationship of
PICES activities in the area relative to other programs such as
WOCE, TOGA, GOOS, JGOFS, GLOBEC and INPOC. It was agreed that
cooperation and communication with other initiatives was very
important and that programs such as INPOC were excellent examples
of the type of international cooperative venture that PICES should
foster. The Committee supported data exchange between cooperating
nations in the Region, and more international cooperation in the
field of physical oceanography and climate. Continued support
from the governments for research vessel operations consistent
with the past level of support is required. Formation of four
working groups was proposed dealing with: <BR>
<P>
- Ocean circulation and climate variability in the subarctic N.
Pacific;
<P>
- The Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region;
<P>
- New technology and observing strategies;
<P>
- Data collection and quality control.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Discussion of Organization of Science Activities for PICES
<BR>
</B>
<P>
There was considerable discussion of how the various working groups
proposed by committees could be incorporated in a scientific program
for PICES. There was consensus that a large number of groups would
be unwieldy and that a relatively few groups which incorporate
priority areas of particular interest to the member nations should
be selected. Accordingly, the Board agreed to propose establishment
of the following working groups:<BR>
<P>
<B>Committee Working Groups:<BR>
</B>
<P>
WG 1. Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region (POC);<BR>
<P>
WG 2. Development of common 
<P>
assessment methodology (MEQ);<BR>
<P>
WG 3. Dynamics of small pelagics in coastal ecosystems (FIS);
<BR>
<P>
<B>Inter-Committee (Science Board) Working Groups: <BR>
</B>
<P>
WG 4. Data collection and quality control;<BR>
<P>
WG 5. Bering Sea;<BR>
<P>
WG 6 Subarctic gyre.<BR>
<P>
Terms of Reference for the Working Groups were developed (see
Report of Governing Council Meetings).<BR>
<P>
It was agreed that conveners should be identified for these working
groups, by POC, MEQ, and FIS respectively for the first three
and by the Science Board for the rest. The Contracting Parties
should be asked to nominate members. Work could be initiated by
correspondence, but intersessional meetings should be anticipated;
expenses of participation should be paid by the nominating Parties.
The Working Groups should report to the Committees and Science
Board at the Second Annual Meeting<BR>
<P>
Working Groups proposed by Committees that have not been incorporated
in the approved list are tabled for further consideration.<BR>
<P>
<B>Proposal for design of Second Annual Meeting: <BR>
</B>
<P>
The Science Board recommends that the program of the Second Annual
Meeting, in addition to providing for an opening session, meetings
of the Science Board and Governing Council, and business meetings
of the scientific committees, include sessions of scientific papers
on the following topics (organizational responsibility of Working
Groups or the Science Board indicated in parenthesis): <BR>
<P>
1. Ocean circulation and climate variability in the subarctic
Pacific (POC);
<P>
2. High resolution paleoecological studies in the subarctic Pacific
(BIO);
<P>
3. Priority chemical and biological contaminants in the North
Pacific ecosystem (MEQ);
<P>
4. Shifts in fish abundance and species dominance in coastal seas
(FIS);
<P>
5. Long-term monitoring from platforms of opportunity (Science
Board).<BR>
<P>
Specific sessions will include invited and contributed papers,
the latter handled in the most part, in poster sessions. Scientific
committees (and the Science Board in the case of topic 5) will
identify conveners and organize the sessions. The Board recommends
this approach for consideration of Governing Council. <BR>

<H1>1993 Report of Science Board</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Board met on October 29, 1993 from 9:30 to 18:00.<BR>
<P>
Participants were:<BR>
<P>
Dr. D. Ware - Chairman, Science Board
<P>
Dr. W. Wooster - Chairman, PICES
<P>
Prof. Y. Nagata - Chairman, Physical Oceanography and Climate
Committee
<P>
Prof. M. Mullin - Chairman, Biological Oceanography Committee
<P>
Prof. Q. Tang - Chairman, Fishery Science Committee
<P>
Prof. J. Zhou - Chairman, Marine Environmental Quality Committee
<P>
Dr. D. McKone - Executive Secretary (rapporteur)<BR>
<P>
The Chairman, Dr. Ware, called the meeting to order and the task
before the Board was discussed. The Board was to review the findings
and recommendations of the Science Committees and Working Groups;
based on these, to develop a PICES Scientific agenda; discuss
a publication plan for PICES; and plan the Third Annual Meeting.
<BR>
<P>
The Board noted that the four Scientific Committees had been provisionally
established and that their continuing status was to be reviewed
at the present meeting. In response to the Governing Council's
request for views on this, the Board strongly recommends that
these bodies now be recognized as permanent Scientific Committees.
<BR>
<P>
Reports from the Science Committees were presented by their chairmen
and are summarized as follows, the full reports are appended:
<BR>
<P>
<B>Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) - Prof. Michael M.
Mullin<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee proposes to sponsor a symposium
at the Third <BR>
<P>
Annual Meeting, and to appoint a convener for this purpose. The
symposium should be:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Structure and ecosystem dynamics of the subarctic and transition
zone North Pacific - is the east like the west?&quot;<BR>
<P>
Structure and east-west comparisons explicitly include physical
properties and processes, and seasonal cycle(s) as well as longer
periods. Ecosystem dynamics explicitly include all trophic levels.
The weakest link, in terms of data, may be mesopelagic fish and
non-commercial squid.<BR>
<P>
In addition to its intrinsic interest, this symposium can initiate
interactions with GLOBEC; we see PICES potentially filling an
important role in linking GLOBEC programs (likely to be coastal)
to the larger oceanic basin.<BR>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee supported the concept of
scientific exchanges among PICES countries, but was divided between
increased availability of funds for Working Group and PICES meetings,
and a program for visiting scientists, fewer people staying for
longer periods to work with specific colleagues and/or institutions.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Fishery Science Committee (FIS) - Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee held a special meeting on October 26, to discuss
how PICES should prepare itself to respond to requests for advice
on issues or problems relative to the marine science of the North
Pacific, and how PICES could best facilitate the exchange of scientific
information.<BR>
<P>
The Committee held its scheduled business meeting on October 28.
Prof. Tang was elected chair of the Fishery Science Committee.
The Coastal Pelagic Fish Working Group (WG3) report was discussed
and a number of recommendations were passed to Science Board.
The Committee endorsed Working Group 3's plan to carry out Pan-Pacific
comparisons of life table differences and recruitment. The Committee
supported the proposal to hold a PICES-GLOBEC Workshop at the
Third Annual Meeting, and recommends that PICES develop an international
PICES-GLOBEC program for the North Pacific Ocean. Last year's
recommendation to reserve a block of time at the Annual Meeting
to facilitate coordination of research surveys by member countries,
was reiterated.<BR>
<P>
<B>Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) - Prof. Jia-Yi
Zhou<BR>
</B>
<P>
Working Group 2's report was reviewed and accepted by the Committee.
It endorsed the report's conclusion that an important objective
is to promote the harmonization of methods used in studying marine
environmental quality within the PICES area in order to: 1) facilitate
data exchange among the participating countries, and 2) the development
of cooperative activities to assess marine environmental quality
across national boundaries, and in the open ocean. To address
this goal, the Committee recommended that a topic session at the
Third Annual Meeting be arranged to explore the range of methodologies
that could be used to assess and predict the impact of pollutants
on marine ecosystem structure and function.<BR>
<P>
Prof. Zhou will represent PICES at a NOWPAP (North-West Pacific
Action Plan) meeting in November. The Committee expressed the
hope that PICES MEQ activities will be complementary and helpful
to NOWPAP in reaching common goals. <BR>
<P>
<B>Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC) - Prof. Yutaka
Nagata<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee received and discussed the Working Group 1 report,
and accepted it. Their recommendations were passed to the Science
Board as parts of the POC recommendations. The Committee thanks
the efforts of the Working Group 1 members, and decided to close
it.<BR>
<P>
The Committee proposes to establish two new POC Working Groups,
on Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation, and on
Monitoring of the North Pacific. The Committee also recommends
two one-day sessions on Physical Processes and Modelling of the
Subarctic North Pacific and its Marginal Sea, and on Monitoring
of the Large Scale Variability of the North Pacific at the Third
Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends that PICES support and help research
in the convention area. For example, the International North Pacific
Ocean Climate (INPOC) Study has been very successful and should
be supported.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The Board endorses the intersessional activities planned by the
Scientific Committees, some of which are reflected in subsequent
specific resolutions.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Working Group Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Board also reviewed the Working Group reports and recommendations.
Working Group summaries follow: <BR>
<P>
<B>WG 1. Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region (POC)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Working Group 1 met in Nemuro, Japan between September 19-23,
1993, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Lynne Talley (USA). The objective
of the group was to review the present level of knowledge of the
oceanic circulation and water mass modification in the Okhotsk
Sea and Oyashio region. The group prepared an extensive review
on this topic, and drafted recommendations for international cooperation
in the region, and to facilitate particular studies that would
address the greatest weaknesses in our knowledge relating to ventilation
of the North Pacific, and the exchange of Okhotsk Sea waters with
the North Pacific. The greatest deficiencies are in quantitative
estimates of all processes: rates, transports, variability and
budgets.<BR>
<P>
The group also proposed that PICES should organize an international
meeting on the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril region in Vladivostok to
discuss physical oceanography, fisheries, and data exchange with
Russian scientists. This meeting would facilitate communication
and planning for projects that require international cooperation
and support. It would also facilitate incorporation of unclassified
Russian hydrographic, sea level, and sea ice data into appropriate
international data bases.<BR>
<P>
<B>WG 2. Development of common assessment methodology (MEQ)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Working Group 2 met on October 21-22 in Seattle. Background papers
had been prepared by each member country before the meeting to
review the kind of information about marine pollution in the PICES
area. &quot;Pollution&quot; had been interpreted widely to cover
not only chemical contamination but also the impact of stressors
such as pathogens, harmful algal blooms, etc. Most countries focused
their pollution assessment and monitoring activities on the coastal
zone, though there were occasional data sets from the open ocean.
Furthermore, most countries focused their analyses on a suit of
chemical contaminants, usually including organochlorines, metals,
petroleum hydrocarbons and radionuclides, though there was a growing
interest in the impact of eutrophication and in harmful algal
blooms.<BR>
<P>
Three main questions emerged from the review of the background
papers; (a) What are the known or potential stressors and their
major sources? (b) What is the potential of these stressors to
be transported to, and have an impact on the North Pacific? (c)
What is the best approach to assessing the &quot;health&quot;
of the subarctic North Pacific system, and, detecting changes
in ecosystem structure for predictive purposes. <BR>
<P>
Several approaches to answering these questions were suggested.
The underlying theme, which was supported unanimously, was that
marine pollution should be thought of and addressed as a <U>biological</U>
as well as a chemical question. <BR>
<P>
The Working Group recommended that PICES organize a symposium
to review approaches to assessing the impact of anthropogenic
stressors at the ecosystem level and suggested that PICES consider
sponsoring a collaborative practical workshop to address some
of the issues identified above.<BR>
<P>
<B>WG 3. Dynamics of pelagics in coastal ecosystems (FIS)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Working Group 3 met in Nemuro, Japan between September 19-23,
1993, under the co-chairmanship of Dr. John Hunter (USA) and Dr.
Tokio Wada (Japan). The objective of the Working Group is to develop
a program for a comparative study of the population dynamics and
productivity of key pelagic fish along the coastal margin of the
North Pacific. The Working Group is initially focusing on the
dynamics of Pacific herring, sardine, anchovy, saury and Pacific
mackerel, and proposes to use comparative methods to determine
how changes in oceanic conditions affect the dynamics of these
stocks, and the coastal ecosystems in which they live.<BR>
<P>
The Working Group plans to begin by assembling an inventory of
population time series for Eastern and Western Pacific pelagic
fish stocks. The resulting time series will be analyzed for patterns
and differences in recruitment and life table rates. A second
comparative study will also be developed to apply trophodynamics
models to understand how changes in ocean climate affect the production
of selected coastal ecosystems around the Pacific rim, and the
impacts on pelagic fish production.
<P>
<B>Inter-Committee (Science Board) Working Group Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>WG 4. Data collection and quality control<BR>
</B>
<P>
The objectives of this Working Group were to identify existing
international standards relevant to data exchange within the PICES
region; identify data sets which are available and suitable for
exchange; advise on data exchange protocols and production of
reference data sets. The Working Group met in Nemuro, Japan between
October 18-23, 1993, under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Skip McKinnell
(Canada) and Dr. De-Quan Yang (China). Data exchange standards
include protocols for the consistent naming of measurements and
standard formats designated to facilitate exchange and acquisition
of data. The Working Group noted that international standards
for data exchange in physical oceanography and meteorology are
well established. In contrast, there are few equivalent standards
for biological and fisheries data. The Working Group proposes
to develop a PICES catalogue of data bases, and to work closely
with PICES scientific programs to develop data standards, where
they do not exist. The Working Group will examine the ICES model
for collection and dissemination of scientific data and information
and its relevance to PICES objectives.<BR>
<P>
<B>WG 5. Bering Sea<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Working Group met in Girdwood, Alaska on August 24 and 25,
1993, under the chairmanship of Prof. Al Tyler (USA). The tasks
set out for the Working Group were to review the present knowledge
of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the Bering Sea;
review present knowledge of the Bering Sea ecosystem and its responses
to environmental variability; identify major gaps in present knowledge;
develop a plan for a symposium on the Bering Sea ecosystem. The
group proposed to reach its review objectives by preparing a book
covering present knowledge of the Bering Sea. The group developed
a series of principal research questions that it considered important
for understanding environmental and ecosystem function in the
Bering Sea. The questions focused on: Do lateral and vertical
input processes cause the deep Bering Sea to be a significant
repository for global deep water? What are the effects of ice
formation on Bering Sea productivity? What is the impact of changing
predator/prey relationships on the dynamics of the Bering Sea
ecosystem? Have the commercial fisheries affected the high trophic
level predators?<BR>
<P>
<B>WG 6. Subarctic Gyre<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Working Group met in Nemuro, Japan between September 18-23,
1993, under the co-chairmanship of Dr. Brent Hargreaves (Canada)
and Prof. Takashige Sugimoto (Japan). The Working Group was asked
to prepare a review of the ocean circulation and climate variability
in the subarctic North Pacific, including information on primary
and secondary production, and what is known about the carrying
capacity for salmon and other nektonic species. The group was
also asked to advise on which PICES and GLOBEC International objectives
could be linked into a joint program for the subarctic North Pacific.
<BR>
<P>
The Working Group prepared detailed reviews of the physical oceanography
and biology of the Subarctic gyre, and drafted recommendations
for collaborative research programs to fill in important gaps
in knowledge. The Working Group reviews and discussions culminated
in three main scientific questions: How do the various scales
of physical variability affect biological processes and productivity
of the subarctic North Pacific ecosystem? What is the structure
of the food web in subarctic waters and what controls its spatial,
seasonal, and interannual variability? What physical and biological
oceanographic processes affect the production and carrying capacity
of salmon and other nekton in the subarctic North Pacific?<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>PICES Publications<BR>
</B>
<P>
The role of PICES in publishing scientific reports was discussed.
The Board noted that many of the Working Group reports and symposium
proceedings contain significant scientific information that merit
publication. The Board concluded that PICES should establish a
series for publication of Working Group, and other reports and
symposia proceedings that have significant scientific information
that would be of general interest to the marine science community
and public. Science Board would function as the Editorial Board
and establish PICES publication standards. (Res. 2).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Third Annual Meeting<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Third Annual Meeting will be held in Nemuro, Japan in 1994.
The program will include sessions of invited and contributed papers
organized by the indicated committees on the following topics:
<BR>
<P>
1. (Science Board) &quot;Structure, Trophic linkages and Ecosystem
Dynamics of the Subarctic Pacific&quot;. Conveners to be determined.
<BR>
<P>
2. (POC) &quot;Physical Processes and Modelling of the Subarctic
North Pacific and its Marginal Seas&quot;. Conveners: Dr. Yutaka
Nagata (Japan) and a co-convener from North America.<BR>
<P>

the subarctic and transition zone North Pacific - is the east
like the west?&quot; Conveners to be determined. <BR>
<P>
4. (FIS) &quot;Recruitment Variability of Clupeoid Fishes and
Mackerels&quot;. Conveners: Dr. Anne B. Hollowed (U.S.A.) and
Dr. Tokio Wada (Japan).<BR>
<P>
5. (MEQ) &quot;Interdisciplinary methodologies to better assess
and predict the impact of pollutants on structure and function
of marine ecosystems.&quot; Conveners to be determined. <BR>
<P>
Science Board recommends that the Third Annual Meeting be scheduled
from October 15th to 24th. October 15th and 17th would be devoted
to a special workshop. October 16th would be devoted to the local
Nemuro Festival. The Third Annual Meeting would start on the 18th
and finish on the 24th. Governing Council would meet for half
a day on the 18th, 20th, and 24th. Science Board would meet on
the 22nd.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Science Board Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
Consideration of Scientific Committee and Working Group reports
led to a set of Resolutions for presentation to Council for approval
(see Endnote 3 to Council Minutes, Decisions of Council).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Other Matters Referred by Governing Council<BR>
</B>
<P>
a) How will PICES handle requests for scientific advice from member
countries? (Canada)<BR>
<P>
Upon receiving a written request for advice, the Chairman will
refer the question to Science Board who would form an <U>ad hoc</U>
committee to respond to the question. The advice from this <U>ad
hoc</U> committee will be referred to Science Board for review,
and forwarded by the Chairman for consideration by Governing Council
before forwarding to the requesting party. If there were a need
for establishing a permanent mechanism for providing advice to
a certain party, then the <U>ad hoc</U> committee could be made
permanent and it could be empowered by Council to respond directly
to requests.<BR>
<P>
b) Who will compile a comprehensive catch statistical bulletin
for species in the convention area? (Canada)<BR>
<P>
The scientific need is for full and free availability of reliable
data to scientists. Catch statistics are useful for scientific
studies of the ecosystem as well as for fishery management purposes.
The practical problem of efficient and cost effective compilation
and dissemination of such data as well as of environmental data
needed for scientific studies, should be the subject of discussion
between PICES and NPAFC as well as other relevant organizations.
<BR>
<P>
c) Do PICES scientists need to know the ship schedules of member
countries to do their work? If they do, how should the schedule
be compiled? (Japan)<BR>
<P>
The Secretariat will attempt to compile a ship schedule for all
member states. Countries are requested to provide a contact point
to the Secretariat who will compile the information, and disseminate
it through the PICES newsletter, e-mail or fax to point of request.
<BR>
<P>
d) How can the Working Groups work effectively at minimal cost?
(U.S.A.)<BR>
<P>
The Science Board notes that the decision on where and when a
Working Group will meet must be agreed by the Chairman of the
Science Board and the Chairman of the Working Group in consultation
with the Executive Secretary with the aim of minimizing costs.
The Science Board recommends that some of the Working Groups meet
in the Spring or the Summer and send their reports to the Secretariat
one month before the annual meeting. The Board believes that this
process will lead to the highest quality scientific work.. In
some cases it will be preferable for some of the Working Groups
to meet in conjunction with the Annual Meeting. For example next
year Working Groups 6 and 7 could best complete their work objectives
at the Annual Meeting. <BR>
<P>
The Secretariat is requested to look into the relative costs of
several options and will report the results to Governing Council
at the Third Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
e) How does PICES propose to implement the science programs after
the planning stage? (U.S.A.)<BR>
<P>
The planning process is intended to progress to the stage where
the need for, and utility of, a project is clear, and the steps
to be taken for implementation are identified. At this point,
the scientists will need governments to provide the necessary
financial support. In cases of sufficient importance, this may
require new funds. But it is implicit in the establishment of
the scientific efforts in which PICES has been engaged that these
are of sufficient importance to the Contracting Parties that when
planning has been completed, means to carry out the programs will
be found.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Scientific Program<BR>

<H1>1994 Report of Science Board </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The Board met on October 22 (08:30-17:30) and October 23 (17:30-18:30).
(See Endnote 1 for participants.) <BR>
<P>
The Chairman, Dr. D.M. Ware called themeeting to order and the
task before the Board was discussed. The Board was to review the
findings and recommendations of the Science Committees and Working
Groups; review the PICES/GLOBEC science plan and recommendations;
review recommendations from the PICES-STA Monitoring Workshop;
make arrangements for future science activities; and plan the
Fourth Annual Meeting.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Science Committee Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
Reports from the four Science Committees were presented by their
chairmen and are summarized below (see reports for full text):
<BR>
<P>
<B>Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) -Prof. Michael M. Mullin
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee met on October 19 and 20
to discuss the PICES-GLOBEC draft report and other business. The
Committee endorsed the PICES-GLOBEC report. At the Fourth Annual
Meeting the Committee proposed to sponsor a theme session on <I>Factors
Affecting the Balance between Alternative Foodweb Structures in
Coastal and Oceanic Ecosystems</I>. The co-convenors will be Drs.
R. Wang (China) and M. Omori (Japan). <BR>
<P>
With respect to other business, the Committee asked Prof. Mullin
to continue as chairman for another year, and reiterated that
it would welcome a third committee member from Japan. The Committee
discussed and made recommendations regarding a <I>Visiting Scientist</I>
<I>Program</I>, dissemination of information on ship schedules
in the PICES area, and PICES symposium publications. Input to
the PICES-STA Monitoring Workshop from the Committee was also
discussed, particularly the merits of establishing a <I>Continuous
Plankton Recorder Program</I> and a sorting and identification
centre (in Russia), and the development of biological instruments
for untended moorings.<BR>
<P>
<B>Fishery Science Committee (FIS) - Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Fishery Science Committee met on October 19 and 20. It discussed
PICES Scientific Report No. 1, and WG reports 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and
7. The PICES-GLOBEC draft Science Plan was also discussed and
accepted. With respect to the Bering Sea report (WG 5), the Committee
agreed with the proposed approach for publication of a review
volume on the Bering Sea, and endorsed the proposed Editorial
Board. For the Fourth Annual Meeting, FIS supported the one-day
symposium on the Bering Sea proposed by WG 5 and selected for
the FIS theme session the topic <I>Density-Dependent Effects on
Fluctuations in Abundance of Marine Organisms</I>. The convenors
for the theme session will be Drs. V. Wespestad (U.S.A.) and Y.
Sakurai (Japan). The Committee also recommended that the Science
Board sponsor a session on marine carrying capacity. <BR>
<P>
FIS discussed PICES publications and recommended that papers given
at PICES symposia be printed as extended abstracts in the PICES
Scientific Report series. The Committee also reiterated its recommendation
for establishing a visiting scientist program.<BR>
<P>
<B>Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) - Prof. Jia-Yi
Zhou<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed and discussed the WG report and recommended
that the Science Board accept (a) the selection of the western
North Pacific as the MEQ's major focus over the long term, and
(b) the sponsorship of a scientific session at PICES IV to <I>Review
and Summarize Appropriate Existing Scientific Information on this
Region, and Especially the East China Sea.</I> Convenors Prof.
J.Y. Zhou and a co-convenor to be determined.<BR>
<P>
The Committee also recommended the following changes in the terms
of reference of WG 2:<BR>
<P>
1. Draft a work plan and an outline for a practical workshop on
the East China Sea and,<BR>
<P>
2. Organize and host a practical workshop to assess methodologies
and explore the feasibility of assessing observable biological
effects, at differing levels, along a selected stressor gradient
in the East China Sea.<BR>
<P>
<B>Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC) - Prof. Yutaka
Nagata<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed and discussed the WG 7 report and based
on the discussions the report will be revised and circulated in
early 1995. The POC Committee accepted the progress report of
the WG and recommended that the WG continue over the next year
to finish its work. It was also recommended the final report of
the WG should be published by PICES.<BR>
<P>
The Committee discussed the issue of making the ship schedules
available and suggested that the Science Board have the ship schedules
placed in the OCEANIC database. The Committee also recommended
that the topic for PICES IV be <I>Circulation in Subarctic North
Pacific North Pacific and its Marginal Seas and its Impact on
Climate.</I> Convenors Dr. M.Y. Zhou and Dr. J.F. Garrett.<BR>
<P>
The Committee reaffirmed support for the Workshop on the <I>Okhotsk
Sea and Adjacent Areas</I> to be held in Vladivostok. The Committee
recommends that PICES provide financial support for this Workshop.
<P>
The Board endorses the intersessional activities planned by the
Scientific Committees, some of which are reflected in subsequent
specific resolutions.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Working Group Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
PICES currently has six WGs, tasked to meet specific objectives.
The Board reviewed the WG reports and recommendations. WG summaries
follow:<BR>
<P>
WG 2. Development of common assessment methodology (MEQ)<BR>
<P>
The 1994 meeting of WG 2 was held on October 13-14, 1994 at the
offices of the Japan Environmental Agency in Tokyo. Four members
were present (Dr. R.F. Addison (Canada), Co-Chairman, Prof. T.
Hirano (Japan), Dr. T. Umezu (Japan) and Dr. M. Watanabe (Japan)).
Dr. E. Shumilin (Russia) attended as an observer, and Mr. Y. Deai
and Mr. T. Yoshida (Japan Environment Agency) attended some of
the sessions.<BR>
<P>
WG 2 discussed three main questions: (i) the appropriateness of
its terms of reference, (ii) a comparison of methods-based, performance-based
and assessment-based methodologies in the evaluation of pollution,
and (iii) plans for a practical co-operative workshop to compare
methods of assessing pollution. Members agreed that there was
no need to revise the WG's terms of reference as these had been
agreed to at last year's meeting. A review of the topic of method-based,
performance-based and assessment-based comparisons was prepared
for the MEQ Committee. <BR>
<P>
The third question, the planning of a practical workshop, generated
considerable discussion. Some members felt that a small number
of WG members (representing only two countries) was not authorized
to make decisions for the entire WG. Some members also felt that
it was premature to plan a practical workshop without a comprehensive
review of existing data describing contamination in the region.
Finally, some members felt that PICES should approach pollution
questions in the area by integrating existing program elements
rather than developing new initiatives. Members agreed to discuss
these issues further at the MEQ business meetings, and in the
course of these, it was agreed that the main cause of changes
to environmental quality in the western North Pacific was likely
to be from control or diversion of freshwater input through projects
like the &quot;Three Gorges&quot; development on the Yangtze River.
<BR>
<P>
WG 3. Coastal pelagic fish (FIS)<BR>
<P>
WG 3 met in La Jolla, U.S.A. on August 3-4, 1994, under the co-chairmanship
of Dr. John Hunter (U.S.A.) and Dr. Tokio Wada (Japan). The objective
of the working group is to develop a program for a comparative
study of the population dynamics and productivity of key pelagic
fish along the coastal margin of the North Pacific. The WG is
initially focusing on the dynamics of Pacific herring, sardine,
and anchovy, and proposes to use comparative methods to determine
how changes in oceanic conditions affect the dynamics of these
stocks, and the coastal ecosystems in which they live. WG members
reached a consensus that trophodynamic modelling is an appropriate
approach for comparing the productivity of pelagic ecosystems
and for assessing how the pelagic fish production system may respond
to climate change. WG members brought life table values for a
number of North Pacific sardine, anchovy and herring stocks to
the meeting. There was a consensus that the life table approach
will provide valuable insights into the effects of broad environmental
change as well as specific short-term effects. Most of the discussion
at the meeting focused on the development of the coastal ecosystem
component of the PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan. The group concluded
that: 1) retrospective studies would be very useful in improving
understanding the effects of climate change on coastal pelagic
fishes (somatic growth was recommended as a key variable); 2)
comparative field process studies should be designed to determine
the linkages between physical forcing and population dynamics
of coastal pelagic fishes; 3) a wide range of models are needed
for the proposed comparative fish stock and ecosystem studies,
including fish growth energetics models, trophodynamic models,
species interaction models, and physical circulation models. To
complete an earlier term of reference, the WG is preparing an
inventory of scientists working on coastal pelagic fishes in the
North Pacific.<BR>

<P>
WG 4. Data Exchange<BR>
<P>
The WG met in Seattle (U.S.A.) on June 20-22, 1994, under the
Chairmanship of Mr. Skip McKinnell (Canada), The co-chairman Dr.
De-Quan Yang (China) was absent. Two observers from Russia presented
reports on the considerable amount of data available in Russian
scientific institutes. Since the last meeting, some progress was
made in the development of data inventories. The Secretariat,
with the assistance of the WG, is updating an inventory of physical,
chemical, biological, and fisheries data for the NE Pacific. Two
catalogues of oceanographic data were made available by China,
and a series of CD-ROM data products available from the U.S. NOAA
was reported to the WG. The WG proposed an expanded role for PICES
in facilitating the exchange of unique data sets on electronic
media. The WG also proposed an organizational restructuring to
give it the ability to create subordinate bodies to undertake
clearly defined tasks requiring common knowledge. The WG recommends
that PICES representatives become more proactive in the collection
of information about data, and data inventories leading to the
development of a master inventory. To obtain more detailed information
about recent (and future) scientific activities, the WG recommended
that PICES member countries routinely submit detailed information
about research cruises and the data collected during these cruises.
To make these data and inventories available to the scientific
community, the WG is recommending that preference be given to
providing this information via the internet. The WG also recommended
a number of data projects that could be undertaken in the following
year. The first is a cooperative project with the NPAFC to have
all of the summary catch statistics from the former INPFC made
machine readable. The second involves collation of all available
historical time series from Ocean Station P into a single collection
for distribution on CD-ROM. The third involves the translation
of selected Russian data inventories into English so that they
can be included in the PICES master inventory.<BR>
<P>
WG 5. Bering Sea<BR>
<P>
The WG met in Seattle, U.S.A. on July 14-15, 1994, under the chairmanship
of Prof. Al Tyler (U.S.A.). The tasks set out for the WG this
year were to: 1) develop research strategies for the principal
scientific questions developed during the first meeting; 2) organize
a symposium on the Bering Sea for presentation at the Fourth Annual
Meeting; and 3) initiate preparation of a book reviewing present
knowledge of the climatology, oceanography, and biology of the
Bering Sea. The group spent some time discussing the research
questions that it considered important for understanding environmental
and ecosystem function in the Bering Sea. They considered, identification
of ecosystem emergent properties; origin, and impact, of decadal-scale
changes in the atmosphere and ocean on living marine organisms;
interaction between deep basin and shelf waters; influence of
ice on Bering Sea productivity; and biology of predator-prey interactions.
The WG also discussed the format and content of the major review
volume it plans to produce on the Bering Sea. The book will cover
all aspects of the physical, chemical and biological components
of the Bering Sea ecosystem, and is expected to take about three
years to complete. The WG began organizing the Bering Sea Symposium
that will be held at the Fourth Annual Meeting. Papers will be
requested to address the principal scientific questions. Approximately
6-8 papers of 45 min. duration are planned. Other submissions
will be incorporated in an extensive poster session, with a brief
oral introduction. Symposium topics are expected to be submitted
early in 1995, so that paper selections can be made by May 1.
The group recommended that following the Symposium, it should
convene a workshop in early 1996 to review the symposium and to
formulate a set of topics that could form the basis for a new,
focused working group.<BR>
<P>
WG 6. Subarctic Gyre<BR>
<P>
This WG is co-chaired by Dr. Brent Hargreaves (Canada) and Prof.
Takashige Sugimoto (Japan). The WG was asked to prepare a review
of the ocean circulation and climate variability in the subarctic
North Pacific, including information on primary and secondary
production, and what is known about the carrying capacity for
salmon and other nektonic species. The review completed by the
group was published in PICES Scientific Report No. 1. The principal
activity of the WG this year has been to participate with WG 3
in the development of a PICES-GLOBEC <I>International Program
on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity</I>, and organization
of the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop (see next section).<BR>
<P>
WG 7. Modelling of the subarctic North Pacific circulation (POC)
<BR>
<P>
This WG was formed after the Second Annual Meeting, and is co-chaired
by Dr. Paul LeBlond (Canada) and Dr. Masahiro Endoh (Japan). The
objectives of the WG are to: 1) review the status of present physical
modelling efforts on the subarctic North Pacific circulation;
2) identify the observations and information needed to improve
circulation models; 3) identify the knowledge of physical processes
and ocean dynamics needed to improve the circulation models; and
4) identify how incompleteness of the present models influences
other modelling efforts on global climate, ecosystems, material
transport, etc. The first meeting of the WG was held in Vancouver
(Canada) on June 22-24, 1994, and the second meeting in Nemuro
on October 18, 1994. The group reviewed the status of existing
models of surface circulation, intermediate layers and deep and
bottom flows. They also discussed the data requirement to improve
the models, the important physical processes and the marginal
seas, and the consequences of the current deficiencies in knowledge.
The WG gave its activity report to the POC-WG7 Joint Meeting held
in Nemuro on October 19, 1994. The Joint Meeting accepted their
interim report and appreciated their efforts. The Joint Meeting
asked the WG to continue their efforts for another year in order
to complete their report and to summarize their results in the
form of recommendations to the POC in time for PICES IV in October,
1995.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>PICES-GLOBEC Workshop Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
The PICES-GLOBEC Workshop was held on October 15 and 17, in conjunction
with the Third Annual Meeting. The objectives of the workshop
were to develop a strategy for determining how the productivity
of phytoplankton, zooplankton and high-trophic level carnivores,
like Pacific salmon changes in response to climatic variations
in the subarctic Pacific; and to develop a plan for a cooperative
study of how changes in oceanic conditions change species dominance
and productivity of key plankton and fish populations in the coastal
ecosystems around the Pacific Rim. The report and recommendations
that emerged from the workshop are found in the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop
Report and Science Plan (see report in a following section).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>PICES-STA Workshop Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
The PICES-STA (Science and Technology Agency of Japan) Workshop
was held on October 22 and 23, 1994, in conjunction with the Third
Annual Meeting. The objectives of the workshop were to review
current programs devoted to monitoring ecosystems, their atmospheric,
oceanic and anthropogenic forcing, and their biological productivity;
and to advise on a strategy for developing a PICES monitoring
program, taking into account existing and planned international
programs such as GOOS. The preliminary report and recommendations
from the workshop are found in the PICES-STA Monitoring Workshop
Report (see report in a following section).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

</B>
<P>
1. Is the PICES member states' ship schedule useful? How could
it be made more effective (e-mail bulletin board etc.)? What information
should be included in the schedule?<BR>
<P>
Science Board agreed that the ship schedule document prepared
by the Secretariat was not very useful and recommended that the
PICES Chairman and Secretariat prepare a scheme indicating what
information is required on what time schedule and how it might
be most effectively disseminated. This scheme should be circulated
to interested parties with a view to having a specific proposal
for consideration at PICES IV.<BR>
<P>
2. Recommend a mechanism for collaboration of the NPAFC and PICES
on the salmon component of the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC Program. (The
NPAFC plans to have a meeting in March 1995, and would like to
involve PICES scientists.)<BR>
<P>
Science Board recommends accepting the invitation of NPAFC to
participate in their &quot;Research Planning and Coordinating
Meeting&quot;, tentatively scheduled for the week of March 6-10
in Seattle and, subsequently, establish a NPAFC-PICES Scientific
Liaison Group jointly with the CSRS of the NPAFC to develop the
implementation plan for the part of the CCCC Program dealing with
anadromous species, including exchange of relevant data as suggested
by NPAFC. This group should be chaired by a person designated
by the NPAFC. The liaison group will report to the PICES-GLOBEC
Steering Committee.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Scientific Program<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Scientific Program at PICES III consisted of two workshops,
and a two and a half day session of scientific papers and posters.
The PICES-GLOBEC Workshop was held on October 15, 16 and 17. Each
of the Scientific Committees held topic sessions, and sessions
of other contributed papers on October 18 to 21. An overview of
these papers was presented at a Closing Scientific Session (on
October 21) by Drs. D. Musgrave, M. Mullin, A. Hollowed and M.
Shimizu. The PICES-STA Workshop was held on October 22 and 23.

The Board met on October 21 (08:30 - 17:00). (See Endnote 1 for
participants.)
<P>
The Chairman, Dr. D.M. Ware, called the meeting to order and set
out the task before the Board. The Board was to review the findings
and recommendations of the Science Committees, TCODE and the Working
Groups; review the PICES/GLOBEC Implementation Panel Report and
recommendations; make arrangements for future Science activities;
and plan the Fifth Annual Meeting. Dr. Ware noted that the Chairmen
of the Science Board, POC, BIO and MEQ will have completed their
terms of office after this meeting, so this was their last chance
to ensure that PICES activities are heading in the right direction
for the new Chairmen. Dr. Ware thanked the out-going Chairmen
for the work they have done, and expressed how much he enjoyed
working with them. Dr. Makoto Kashiwai (Japan) was elected the
new Chairman of the Science Board. (The meeting was adjourned
at 17:00.) 
<P>
The new Science Board, POC, BIO and MEQ Chairmen begin their terms
on Dec. 1, 1995. 
<P>
Reports from the Scientific and Technical Committees 
<P>
Reports from the Science Committees were presented by their Chairmen
and are summarized below (see reports for full text): 
<P>
Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC) - Prof. Yutaka
Nagata 
<P>
The Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee met on October
18 and 19, 1995. An election was held and Prof. Paul H. LeBlond
was unanimously acclaimed the new Chairman of the Committee for
the next three years. The Committee discussed the WG 7 report
on Ocean Circulation Modelling and recommended that this report
be published as a PICES Scientific Report. POC also recommended
that responsible bodies within PICES establish a formal liaison
between POC and TCODE. 
<P>
As a follow up of the Vladivostok Workshop on the Okhotsk Sea
and Adjacent Areas, it was recommended that PICES should maintain
an active interest in the Sea of Okhotsk and be prepared to possibly
hold another workshop after two to three years. The Committee
also recommended that it be responsible for preparing a complete
nomenclature list of the bays, straits, currents, etc., in the
Sea of Okhotsk in the languages of PICES countries. 
<P>
WG 7 has been disbanded and POC proposed a new Working Group 10
on the Circulation and Ventilation in the Japan Sea (East Sea)
and its adjacent areas. The Committee has two concerns that they
asked the Science Board to convey to Governing Council:
<P>
1. that it is important to maintain a balance between routine
monitoring programs and observational programs in support of specific
scientific research activities; and
<P>
2. that university oceanographers in several countries have not
been as active in PICES as would be expected from the proportion
of national oceanographic research carried on in universities.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) - Prof. Michael M.
Mullin<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Patricia A. Wheeler (U.S.A.) was elected by acclamation
to succeed Prof. M.M. Mullin as Chairman of the BIO Committee.
The Committee discussed the CCCC Draft Implementation Plan, and
recommended that BIO be more closely connected to CCCC activities.
In both the proposed data collection and modelling in the CCCC
Program, BIO recommended greater consideration of marine birds
and mammals. Establishment of standards for data collection procedures
and analytical methods (like those employed by JGOFS) is desirable.
BIO recommended that a Working Group 11 be established under its
guidance to develop and tabulate estimates of the food consumption
of marine resources by marine birds and mammals in the PICES region
(by age class and sub-location). Working Group Co-Chairmen will
be determined later. <BR>
<P>
BIO recommended that its topic session at PICES V be &quot;Regional
and Interannual Variants in Life Histories of Key Species&quot;.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Fishery Science Committee (FIS) - Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed WG 3's final report, agreed that the work
was finished, and recommended that WG 3 be disbanded. WG 3 has
produced an inventory of scientists working on pelagic fish which
will be provided to the Secretariat for distribution upon request.
FIS reviewed the CCCC Draft Implementation Plan and supports the
establishment of the CCCC/REX Task Team to coordinate comparative
coastal pelagic species studies among areas. The Committee noted
that it would like to participate in the selection of FIS representatives.
The Committee recommended that it identify the key fish scientific
research issues in relation to the CCCC Program. FIS is concerned
that there is a need to separate fishing effects from environmental
effects in the dynamics of fish populations.<BR>
<P>
The Committee recommends a new Working Group 12 on Crabs and Shrimps.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) - Prof. Jia-Yi
Zhou<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Richard F. Addison (Canada) was elected the new MEQ Chairman,
replacing Prof. Jia-Yi Zhou. The Committee reviewed WG 8's report
and agreed that MEQ and WG 8 will work together to implement the
Practical Workshop. The Practical Workshop will be conducted in
two phases. Phase 1 will be held in May 1997 and will focus on
contamination of Jiaozhou Bay at Qingdao; the Institute of Oceanology
(Academia Sinica) has offered laboratory space and facilities.
It is expected that Phase 2 will be conducted in a subsequent
year. The Committee further replaced Dr. Addison as one of the
Co-Chairmen of WG 8 by Dr. John E. Stein.<BR>
<P>
MEQ Committee discussed the membership of WGs and recommended
that in future the number of members appointed by member countries
be kept as small as practicable.<BR>
<P>
MEQ will organize a topic session for PICES V on &quot;Processes
of contaminant cycling&quot;. This will address such physical,
chemical and geochemical topics as long range transport of contaminants
across the Pacific.<BR>
<P>
<B>Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) - Mr. Robin Brown
<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE was formed as a standing committee to replace WG 4 (PICES
III Decision 94/S/4). It is an interdisciplinary committee consisting
of two scientists from each member country. Members from Canada,
Japan, Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, the
Russian Federation, and the U.S.A. were appointed in 1995. TCODE
members exchanged views on the issues raised last year by WG 4
and the Science Board prior to PICES IV. The Committee held its
first meeting at PICES IV in Qingdao. <BR>
<P>
The Committee discussed a strategy for PICES data management,
and made recommendations regarding ship schedules, cruise reports,
master inventory of long-term time series, and relationships with
other Committees and Working Groups. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Working Group Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
PICES currently has five WGs, tasked to meet specific objectives.
The Board reviewed the WG reports and recommendations. WG report
summaries follow:<BR>
<P>
WG 3. Coastal Pelagic Fish (FIS)
<P>
WG 3 completed its terms of reference by e-mail exchange this
year, under the co-chairmanship of Dr. J.R. Hunter (U.S.A.) and
Dr. T. Wada (Japan). The WG has assembled a complete time series
of catch, abundance and recruitment data for herring stocks from
British Columbia, Alaska, Russia and Hokkaido. These data are
available upon request from Dr. D.E. Hay (Canada) or Dr. V.G.
Wespestad (U.S.A.). Various members of the WG have initiated future
collaborative projects with Russian scientists, such as comparative
retrospective studies of North Pacific herring population dynamics.
WG 3 activities also led to two new bilateral initiatives: 
<P>
1. between the National Research Institute of Fisheries Science
(Yokohama, Japan) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (La
Jolla, U.S.A.), on a comparative retrospective study of Pacific
sardine; and 
<P>
2. a three year joint Japan (Hokkaido University) and U.S.A. (University
of Alaska) program on walleye pollock in the Bering Sea. The WG
has finished preparing a computer based inventory of North Pacific
scientists working on small pelagic fishes. The inventory includes
names, addresses and research specialties. Prof. B.L. Norcross
(U.S.A.) will make the inventory available to the Secretariat.
<BR>
<P>
Science Board thanks WG 3 for completing its work, and is pleased
to see that the activities of the WG have spawned several new
initiatives that the scientists can pursue in the future, to the
mutual benefit of their member countries. <BR>
<P>
WG 7. Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation (POC)
<BR>
<P>
This WG was formed after PICES II, and is co-chaired by Prof.
Paul H. LeBlond (Canada) and Dr. Masahiro Endoh (Japan). The WG
was tasked to: 
<P>
1. review the status of present physical modelling efforts on
the subarctic North Pacific circulation; 
<P>
2. identify the observations and information needed to improve
circulation models; 
<P>
3. identify the knowledge of physical processes and ocean dynamics
needed to improve the circulation models; and 
<P>
4. identify how incompleteness of the present models influences
other modelling efforts on global climate, ecosystems, material
transport, etc. 
<P>
The group had its final meeting at PICES III in Nemuro to assign
reporting tasks. The review focuses on modelling ocean circulation
and its variability in the subarctic North Pacific. The performance
of existing models is assessed in relation to observations in
the upper ocean, intermediate waters, and abyssal waters. The
quality of the model results was found to match that of the observations.
Models of surface circulation, where data are most abundant, reproduce
many observed features, while the reliability of the model results
at greater depths remains more problematic. In general, model
results are found to be too coarse and insufficiently reliable
for many of the applications towards which they have been developed
(fisheries, pollution, climate change, etc.) and significant improvements
are required. The report identifies a number of gaps in physical
understanding and supporting data which need to be filled to improve
model performance. Many of these apply to ocean modelling in general,
but some, particularly with respect to the influence of marginal
seas (Bering, Japan, Okhotsk), are specific to the North Pacific.
The recommendations address ways of filling these gaps and using
international collaboration within PICES to foster development
of better ocean circulation models in the subarctic North Pacific.
<BR>
<P>
Science Board accepts the final report from WG 7, and compliments
the members for producing such a comprehensive and informative
review document. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
WG 8. Practical Assessment Methodology (MEQ)<BR>
<P>
This WG was formed at PICES III, and is co-chaired by Dr. R.F.
Addison (Canada) and Prof. M.J. Zhou (China). The WG met just
prior to PICES IV in Qingdao. The WG is designing a workplan and
outline for a 2-3 week practical workshop to assess contaminant
effects in the western Pacific / East China Seas region. MEQ decided
to conduct this workshop in 2 phases: Phase 1 will be a study
of Qingdao's Jiaozhou Bay. Phase 2 will be conducted in a subsequent
year in the Changjiang Delta, with the primary focus being the
ecosystem effects arising from the Three Gorges Project. The target
date for the Phase 1 workshop is May 1997.<BR>

<P>
WG 5. Bering Sea<BR>
<P>
The Bering Sea WG completed its terms of reference by fax, phone
and e-mail this year under the chairmanship of Dr. A.V. Tyler
(U.S.A.). There was no formal meeting. The WG was tasked with:
<P>
1. planning and convening a one-day Symposium on the Oceanography
and Fisheries of the Bering Sea at PICES IV, and 
<P>
2. developing a review volume on Bering Sea Oceanography and Fisheries.
<P>
The Bering Sea Symposium was organized by Drs. J.E. Overland (U.S.A.),
R.J. Beamish (Canada) and J. Rice (Canada). The purpose of the
Symposium was to showcase ideas, concepts and insights into the
biological, physical and chemical dynamics of the Bering Sea.
Twenty-three papers and posters were presented and discussed at
Qingdao by the Symposium participants. Planning for the review
volume progressed this year. The co-editors are Drs. T.R. Loughlin
(U.S.A.) and Prof. K. Ohtani (Japan). It is anticipated that the
volume will be published as a 400 to 500 page book. The section
editors have selected the authors and have provided guidance on
content and format. Chapter drafts are due by the end of December
1995. Publication is anticipated by the end of 1997. The WG recommends
to Science Board: 
<P>
1. that the Editorial Committee proceed to produce a final draft
of the book by 1996; and 
<P>
2. that the WG meet in 1996 for a final time to draft recommendations
to Science Board on future directions for Bering Sea Science.
<BR>
<P>
WG 9. Subarctic Pacific Monitoring<BR>
<P>
This Working Group was formed at PICES III, and is co-chaired
by Drs. K. Hanawa (Japan) and B.A. Taft (U.S.A.). This interdisciplinary
WG has the following terms of reference: 
<P>
1. it is responsible for planning the monitoring activities in
the PICES area including proposing priorities and schedules, and
including physical, biological and chemical measurements; 
<P>
2. it should cooperate with GOOS and the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC Program
Implementation Panel; 
<P>
3. it will work with TCODE to ensure timely and open exchange
of monitoring data between participants and external data users,
as a mechanism to control the quality and relevance of the data.
<P>
The WG had its first meeting in Seattle on 1-3 August, 1995. The
first WG meeting focused on the design of an observational system
to support the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC Program. The WG report contains
a brief review of present monitoring activities in the PICES area.
The WG identifies seven key observational programs that should
be considered in the subarctic Pacific, and outlines some cost-effective
ways of implementing these programs: 
<P>
1. time series measurements of primary production and zooplankton
stocks; 
<P>
2. heat content and freshwater variability of subarctic Pacific;
<P>
3. time series analysis of salmon scales to provide a measure
of productivity; 
<P>
4. electromagnetic measurements of transport through Kamchatka
Strait; 
<P>
5. aeolian transport of iron into the subarctic Pacific gyre;
<P>
6. voluntary observing ship basin-scale measurements employing
flow-through sensors; 
<P>
7. surface-velocity measurements using satellite-tracked drifters.

<BR>
<P>
<B>PICES-GLOBEC Implementation Panel Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
The PICES-GLOBEC &igrave;Climate Change and Carrying Capacity&icirc;
(CCCC) Program is a regional component of the GLOBEC International
Program which is currently sponsored by SCOR and the IOC. IGBP
will be a third international sponsor if the International GLOBEC
program gains Core Project status. The PICES-GLOBEC Implementation
Panel (formerly known as the CCCC Steering Committee) was struck
at the last Annual Meeting to initiate development of a draft
Implementation Plan for the CCCC Program. It was also tasked with:
<P>
1. determining how the work of the PICES Science Committees and
WGs can most effectively support the CCCC Program, and 
<P>
2. identifying existing or foreseen national and international
programs that the CCCC program could be coordinated with, and
determine how this can be effectively achieved. 
<P>
The Implementation Panel is co-chaired by Drs. M. Kashiwai (Japan)
and W.S. Wooster (U.S.A.). There is an Executive Committee which
consists of the IP Co-Chairmen, the Science Board Chairman, the
National GLOBEC representatives, one of the WG 9 Co-Chairmen,
TCODE Chairman and the NPAFC liaison. The Executive Committee
met in Honolulu on May 24-26 to prepare a draft Implementation
Plan and a schedule for reviewing the draft leading up to PICES
IV. The draft report was circulated to the IP, Science Committees
and selected WG members in August 1995 for feedback. The IP/EC
met at Qingdao on October 17 to plan an evening meeting with the
full IP, Science Committee Chairmen and other interested parties
on the evening of October 19 to finalize the report. The CCCC/IP
report was submitted to the Science Committees and to Science
Board with a number of recommendations.<BR>
<P>
The Science Board recommends that in view of the election of Dr.
Kashiwai as new Science Board Chairman, that Dr. Ware and Prof.
Nagata replace Drs. Kashiwai and Wooster as the CCCC/IP Co-Chairmen,
effective December 1, 1995. To avoid confusion with other National
bodies, the Board recommends that the CCCC Scientific Steering
Committee should be renamed the Implementation Panel (CCCC/IP).
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas Workshop <BR>
</B>
<P>
This Workshop was endorsed by Governing Council at PICES III and
was held in Vladivostok between June 19-24, 1995. It was organized
by POC and was co-chaired by Drs. V. Lobanov (Russia), Y. Nagata
(Japan) and L.D. Talley (U.S.A.). The objective of the Workshop
was to review present knowledge of the oceanography and fisheries
of that region, the availability and exchange of relevant data,
and the development of cooperative investigations. Eight parallel
symposium sessions were held on June 20-23. The Workshop made
a number of recommendations to Science Board, POC, BIO, FIS and
TCODE. The report recommends that Science Board request funding
to publish extended abstracts of the Workshop proceedings in the
PICES Scientific Reports Series, and to translate a Russian monograph
on hydrometeorological conditions in the Okhotsk Sea.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Science Board Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
Consideration of Scientific Committee, Working Group and the CCCC
Draft Implementation Plan reports led to a set of Resolutions
for presentation to Council for approval (see Appendix to Council
minutes, Decisions of Council).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Publications<BR>
</B>
<P>
PICES Scientific Report No. 2 was published this year. It contains
WG 1&iacute;s report &igrave;The Okhotsk sea and Oyashio region&icirc;

<H1>1996 Report of Science Board</H1>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P><HR width=90% align=center size=4>
The Board met on October 15 (17:30-18:30) to review the order of the agenda and 19 (08:30-17:00).  (See Endnote 1 for participants.)</P>
<P>
The Chairman Dr. Makoto Kashiwai called the meeting of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> to order and set out the task before the Board.  The Board reviewed the findings and recommendations of the Scientific Committees, TCODE, Implementation Panel for the CCCC Program and Working Groups 5 and 9;  discussed implementation of decisions from 1995; discussed and recommended relationships with other organizations;  discussed future perspectives for PICES;  made arrangements for future activities;  planned a science program for the Sixth Annual Meeting;  and made recommendations to Council.  Dr. Kashiwai noted that the Chairman of the FIS Committee will have completed his term of office after this meeting when the new Chairman will officially become a member of the Board.</P>

<B>Reports and recommendations of the Scientific and Technical Committees and the Implementation Panel</P></B>
<P>
Reports of the Scientific Committees and the Implementation Panel were presented by their chairmen and are summarized below (see reports for the full text):</P>
<P>
<B>Fishery Science Committee (FIS) - Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang</P></B>
<P>
Dr. Chang-Ik Zhang (Korea) was elected by acclamation to succeed Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang as Chairman of the FIS Committee.  The Committee discussed the CCCC recommendations for 1997, and recommended that FIS be more closely connected to CCCC activities.  FIS recommended that WG 12 hold a inter-sessional meeting of 4-5 day in an Asian country (to be decided).  FIS made recommendations concerning PICES representation in SCOR-WG 105 activities.  In connection with its scientific program, PICES should develop close relationships with regional fisheries committees.</P>
<P>
FIS recommended that a joint topic session on &quot;Models for linking climate and fish&quot; for PICES VI be developed with BIO.</P>

<P><B>Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee (POC) - Prof. Paul H. LeBlond</P></B>
<P>
The Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee met on October 17 and 18, 1996.  Reviewing on-going business, POC first noted the need for an update on the oceanography of the Okhotsk Sea, especially in the light of recent work in the area.  It is recommended that a workshop on the Sea of Okhotsk be held in the summer of 1998.</P>
<P>
POC noted that most of the recommendations of WG 7 were being considered by TCODE and WG 9.  Regarding the need for high resolution bathymetry for accurate modeling, it was recommended that a letter be drafted by the Chairman of POC for release of available data.</P>
<P >
WG 10 Co-Chairmen, Drs. Christopher N.K. Mooers and Sang-Kyung Byun reported on progress, which was held to be very satisfactory.  POC supported their plan for a workshop in Fukuoka in January 1997.  A final report is to be ready for the PICES VI meeting.  The PICES VI POC topic session will focus on &quot;Circulation and ventilation of marginal and semi-enclosed seas&quot; and will be co-convened by Drs. Mooers and Byun;  it will also include a presentation on the progress of NEAR-GOOS.</P>
<P>
POC supported the plans of CCCC task teams REX and BASS and the plan for a model workshop, with the proviso that the latter include the participation of recognized modellers.</P>
<P>
<B>Biological Oceanography Committee (BIO) - Prof. Patricia A. Wheeler</P>
</B>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee met on October 17 and October 18.  New members were introduced; the committee recommends the re-appointment of Dr. Tsutomu Ikeda (Japan) and retention of Dr. Timothy R. Parsons (Canada) as committee members.  The Committee requests the appointment of Dr. George Hunt (WG 11 Co-Chairman) to REX and Dr. Linda Jones to MODEL to maintain close connection of BIO with CCCC Task Teams.  Dr. Hunt provided a summary report of the first WG 11 meeting.  The Committee supports WG 11's request for a 5-day workshop prior to the PICES VI.</P>
<P>
BIO discussed WG 9 recommendations and strongly endorses the recommendations for ecological moorings in the subarctic gyres (with retention of sampling at Station P) and also endorses annual reports on the status of the subarctic Pacific.  BIO recommends the translation of figure legends and table headings for the Russian publication on Biological and Fisheries Aspects of the Okhotsk Sea.</P>
<P>
BIO recommends two co-sponsored special topics for PICES VI:  &quot;Harmful Algal Blooms:  Causes and Consequences&quot; (with MEQ) and &quot;Micronekton and their predators: Distributions, dynamics, and sampling problems&quot; (with FIS).</P>
<P>
<B>Marine Environmental Quality Committee (MEQ) - Dr. Richard F. Addison</P>
</B>
The MEQ Committee discussed and endorsed the report of WG 8.  Following Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou's offer to host a practical workshop at the Institute of Oceanology in Qingdao, WG 8 had developed a scientific workplan during 1996 for the workshop.  Approximately 4 scientists from each of the PICES member countries will spend about two weeks working at Qingdao on assessing pollution in Jiaozhou Bay (Qingdao Harbour).  Details of the workplan are appended as Annex 5 to the WG 8 Report.  The cost of the Workshop will be approximately $70,000;  the MEQ Committee recommended that PICES contribute $30,000 support and the balance would be found elsewhere.</P>
<P>
The MEQ Committee reviewed the scientific presentations at its sessions and noted the large percentage of &quot;no shows&quot; about 30% of speakers who submitted titles and abstracts to the scientific sessions did not attend the Annual meeting.</P>
<P>
The Committee discussed proposals for the scientific sessions at PICES VI.  Three sessions are planned:  one jointly with BIO on &quot;Harmful Algal Blooms:  Causes and Consequences&quot;;  a second on &quot;Environmental Impacts of Aquaculture&quot;, and a third for contributed papers.  Members agreed to nominate convenors within a short time. </P>
<P>
<B>Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) - Mr. Robin Brown</P>
</B>
TCODE met prior to and during the PICES V meeting and reviewed progress on items from PICES IV as well as additional requests that arose during PICES V.  The Committee presented short reports on the Inventory of Long Time Series to the four Scientific Committees and received support for the continued expansion of this database.  In addition, some other areas of interest were birds, sea mammals and contaminant entries for the inventory of long time series, inventories of real-time data sources, climatologies and useful software and analysis tools.</P>
<P>
<B>PICES-GLOBEC Implementation Panel Report for the CCCC program - Dr. Yutaka Nagata and Dr. Warren S. Wooster</P></B>
<P>
The CCCC Workshop on Conceptual/ Theoretical Studies and Model Development was held in Nemuro, Japan on June 23-28 1996.  During that workshop, meetings also took place of the Implementation Panel and its Executive Committee and of the MODEL, REX and BASS Task Teams.  A report of the Workshop has been completed and should be published in the PICES Scientific Report series.  The Task Teams developed work plans, as detailed in their reports, and further discussions held by the IP/EC, and Task Teams during the present meeting led to recommendations concerning future workshops and symposia. </P>
<P>
<B>Working Group Reports</B>
<P>
PICES currently has six Working Groups tasked to meet specific objectives.  The Board reviewed the WG reports and recommendations.  Summaries of WG reports follow:</P>
<P>
WG 8. Practical Assessment Methodology (MEQ)</P>
<P>
The Working Group met immediately prior to PICES V.  The objective of the meeting was to review and refine the draft workplan for convening a Practical Workshop in Jaiozhou Bay, Qingdao, China, in early 1997, aimed at harmonizing approaches among PICES countries when assessing ecological impacts of pollution.  (See Endnote 2 in the Report of the Marine Environmental Quality Committee for the full report.)</P>
<P>
WG 10. Circulation and Ventilation in the Japan Sea/East Sea and its Adjacent Areas (POC)</P>
<P>
The Working Group met immediately before PICES V to set out the task in accordance with the terms of reference.  The Working Group developed a number of tasks to be undertaken and set out a tentative schedule for their accomplishment.  (See Endnote 2 in the Report of the Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee for the full report.)</P>
<P>
WG 11. Consumption of Marine Resources by Marine Birds and Mammals in the PICES Region (BIO)</P>
<P>
The Working Group met immediately prior PICES V to develop strategies to meet the goals set out in the terms of reference.  A set of regions of interest were defined within the PICES area and the Working Groups agreed to construct a tabulation of the populations of marine mammals and birds found in the area, dates of residency, energy demand, food habits and food consumption.  (See Endnote 2 in the Report of the Biological Oceanography Committee for the full report.)</P>
<P>
WG 12. Crabs and Shrimps (FIS)</P>
<P>
The Working Group met immediately prior to PICES V.  The terms of reference were reviewed and proposed changes were developed. The Working Group will develop a list of organizations and key scientific expert along with their field of interest from each Member Country.  Each Working Group member was asked to bring, to the next meeting, previous published material on stock status, recent population abundance trends, and what is known or hypothesized about the causes of these fluctuations.  (See Endnote 1 in the Report of the Fishery Science Committee for the full report.)</P>
<P>
<B>Inter-Committee (Science Board) Working Group Reports</P></B>
<P>
<P>WG 5.Bering Sea</P>
<P>
The Working Group met in July to discuss the final report of the Group and discuss the status of the Bering Sea review volume book that is being prepared for publication.  The Working Group proposed the development of a broad outline for research in the near future, in the Bering Sea, and more specific development of two areas of focus on dominant physical phenomena in the Bering Sea and the biological consequences of these phenomena. (See Endnote 2 for the full report.)</P>
<P>
WG 9. Subarctic Pacific Monitoring</P>
<P>
The Working Group met immediately before PICES V.  Based on the seven possible monitoring initiatives outlined in their first report of the Working Group, three categories of programs were discussed; new initiatives;  continuing programs;  and programs that are not yet ready for commencement of monitoring.  (See Endnote 3 for the full report.)</P>
<P>
<P><B>Implementation from Decisions PICES IV</P></B>
<P>
a. Participation at Scientific Meetings (95/S/3, 4)</P>
<P>
Science Board reviewed the value of circulating draft agendas to participants at registration and recommends  that this practice be continued in future years.  Science Board noted that participation in some Committee meetings can be improved.  In scheduling meetings, business and scientific meetings should be spread out to allow participants to attend meetings of their choice.  </P>
<P>
For participants to have better knowledge of what papers will be presented in scientific sessions, the Secretariat is encouraged to set a deadline two weeks before the Annual Meeting for speakers and poster presenters to confirm whether they will be able to attend.</P>
<P>
b.Implementation Vladivostok Workshop Recommendations (95/S/3, 1)</P>

Science Board strongly supports the United States' proposal, concerning joint investigations in member countries' waters.</P>
<P>
c. Geographic Features of the Okhotsk Sea Region (95/S/3, 1)</P>
<P>
Prof. Yutaka Nagata and Dr. Vyacheslav Lobanov will co-ordinate the development of the list of geographical features of the Okhotsk Sea region, including bays, straits, and currents, in all Member States languages.  Upon completion, the Secretariat will make the list available to all those who wish a copy.</P>

d. WG 3 inventory completion (95/S/6)</P>
<P>
Korea and Russia will provide the Secretariat with a list of their scientists studying pelagic fishes.</P>
<P>
e. Application PICES guidelines (95/S/9)</P>
<P>
Guidelines were reviewed and it was agreed that the Secretariat should continue to send them to successful oral and poster presenters for PICES VI.  Committee Chairmen should encourage convenors to keep presentations within time limits.</P>
<P>
<B><P>Relations with other organizations</P></B>

a. SCOR WG 105  The impact of world fisheries harvests on the stability and diversity of marine ecosystems.</P>
<P>
Science Board agreed that Dr. Chang-Ik Zhang, the Chairman-elect of FIS, will represent PICES in the SCOR WG 105.</P>
<P>
b. Co-sponsorship of ICES Symposium on the Role of Physical and Biological Processes in the Recruitment Dynamics of Marine Populations.</P>
<P>
Dr. Dan Ware will continue to represent PICES on the Scientific Advisory Committee for this ICES Symposium.</P>
<P>
c. Scientific Committees will aid the Secretariat to identify Organizations and Programs whose activities are of interest to PICES in order to form a closer working relationships with them.</P>

<B><P>MODEL Workshop 1998</P></B>
<P>
Science Board recommends that the MODEL Co-Chairmen seek the participation of experienced modellers in the Workshop in addition to users of the results of models.</P>
<B><P>High Resolution Bathymetry</P></B>
<P>
Science Board recommends that the US delegation contact the appropriate U.S. Agencies to obtain access to high resolution bathymetric data in the PICES region, for use in the PICES scientific program.</P>
<P>
<B><P>Future perspective for PICES</P></B>
<P>
Science Board discussed the following recommendations for future perspectives for PICES:</P>
<P>
1. In order to enhance the involvement of the national marine science community in PICES, members should undertake to ensure that all interested agencies and programs, both government and academic, have the opportunity to participate actively in relevant PICES activities.</P>
<P>
2. Members should recognize their responsibility to support participation in PICES activities of their scientists, especially those appointed to scientific and technical committees, working groups, and analogous bodies as well as others who can contribute to PICES scientific programs.</P>
<P>
3. The Science Board should review the need for standing technical committees, their terms of reference, and their membership as well as their relationship to the Science Committees and the Science Board and should forward recommendations to the Governing Council.</P>
<P>
4. The Science Board should prepare specific guidelines for the function and duration of Working Groups.</P>
<P>
5. The Secretariat, with the help of PICES Committees and Working Groups and of contacts in its member states and in international organizations, should identify and list national and international research programs related to ongoing activities and interests of PICES.  Opportunities for collaboration with these programs should be sought, first among agencies at the national level and then by PICES through its Committees and Working Groups.</P>
<P>
Science Board supported the principle that members recognize their responsibility to provide for the cost of participation of appointed scientists in PICES activities (see item 2).  Science Board agreed to undertake items 3 and 4 and agreed to assume responsibility for item 5 with the Secretariat.</P>
<P>
<B><P>Committee Membership</P></B>
<P>
Science Board recommends the following:</P>
<P>
1. Re-appoint Dr. Tsutomu Ikeda (Japan) to BIO and retain Dr. Timothy Parsons (Canada) on BIO.  </P>
<P>
2. Appoint Dr. George Hunt (Co-Chairman of WG 11) to REX and Dr. Linda Jones to MODEL.</P>
<P>
<B>Biological and Fisheries Aspects of the Okhotsk Sea (printed VNIRO, Russia)</P></B>
<P>
The Secretariat will contact Dr. Boris N. Kotenev to obtain the Russian figure legends and table headings from this book so that they can be translated into English.  These will be made available.</P>
<P>
<B><P>Study Group</P></B>
<P>
PICES should create a Study Group with members Dr. Makoto Kashiwai, Dr. Alexander Bychkov and Mr. Robin Brown to review PICES communications needs and practices.  This Study Group will report to Science Board at PICES VI.</P>
<P>

<H1>1992 Report of Fishery Science Committee</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Committee met on October 15 under the Chairmanship of D. Ware;
D. Eggers served as rapporteur. The following members participated:
<BR>
<P>
Canada: R.J. Beamish J. Rice, D. Ware
<P>
China: Q. Tang
<P>
Japan: K. Ohtani T. Sasaki, T. Wada
<P>
United States: D. Eggers J. Hunter G. Stauffer <BR>
<P>
An election supervised by PICES Interim Executive Secretary, John
C. Davis, confirmed convener Dan Ware as the first chair of the
Fishery Science Committee. <BR>
<P>
Discussion in the committee focused on comparative studies. It
was recognized that the value of comparative studies is that the
response of fish stocks to a wide range of oceanic conditions
can be quantified by studying the same species, at the same time,
in the same way, in different places. The results could provide
some useful insights into how commercially important fish stocks
are likely to respond to changing oceanic conditions in the North
Pacific. There was unanimous agreement among the member countries
that we conduct comparative studies around the Pacific Rim on
important groups of species. The committee agreed that it wanted
to promote and coordinate studies on gadoids, on small pelagic
species, and on ecosystem and fish production modeling. <BR>
<P>
With respect to salmon, FIS noted that several lines of evidence
indicate that the productivity in the Subarctic Pacific and the
biomass of salmon and other large nekton species increased by
a factor of two between the 1960s to 1980s. Current ideas about
what controls production in the Subarctic cannot explain why the
zooplankton and pelagic fish biomass doubled. This highlights
the fact that we really don't understand what regulates primary
and secondary production in this region, and therefore what might
cause it to fall in the future, with obvious consequences for
wild and enhanced salmon stocks.<BR>
<P>
There was also unanimous agreement that FIS should promote and
coordinate studies in the Bering Sea ecosystem, and recommend
what research should be done. The chairman of FIS should contact
the chairmen of the other scientific committees to see if inter-committee
programs could be formed to meet some common objectives. <BR>
<P>
To begin the business of developing scientific programs FIS agreed
to establish a number of working groups.<BR>
<P>
<B>Working Group Terms of Reference<BR>
</B>
<P>
FIS Working groups should be struck to address specific problems.
With respect to these problems they should determine the present
state of knowledge, identify and define the problem and hypotheses,
who is currently working on the problem, identify relevant methodology,
determine what data are available for retrospective analyses,
determine what objectives each member country can contribute to,
decide if the activities of the working group should be linked
to other international programs in the Pacific like GLOBEC and
INPOC. <BR>
<P>
The working group is requested to develop a research plan according
to these terms of reference and report back to FIS at the 1993
PICES annual meeting. We noted that every nation does not necessarily
have to have a member on every working group. Membership should
be voluntary and the countries should have the opportunity to
appoint members to the working group as they see fit. An effective
size for a working group might include 2-3 members from each country.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. FIS recommends that comparative studies of selected gadoid
and small pelagic species, be conducted at various locations around
the Pacific Rim. Comparative fish production modeling activities
should also be conducted. We recommend that three working groups
be struck to address these problems: <BR>
<P>
a. a gadoid working group focusing on pollock, Pacific cod and
hake.<BR>
<P>
b. a small pelagics working group focusing on herring, sardine,
anchovy and mackerel.<BR>
<P>
c. a modeling working group focusing broadly on the impact of
oceanic conditions on fish production, and ecosystem structure.
<BR>
<P>
2. FIS recommends that a subarctic working group be struck to
promote and coordinate fisheries research in the North Pacific.
The committee requests that the working group develop a program
which addresses the carrying capacity for salmon and other large
nekton in the Subarctic Pacific and the Aleutian Basin of the
Bering Sea, which is also an important salmon rearing area. The
Chairman of the working group should contact the other PICES Scientific
Committees to see if there is interest in developing a multidisciplinary
ecosystem approach.<BR>
<P>
3. FIS recommends that a Bering Sea working group be established
to promote and coordinate research in this region, and to develop
contacts with the other PICES Scientific Committees to see if
there is support for developing an ecosystem approach in some
areas of common interest.<BR>
<P>
4. FIS recommends that for the 1993 PICES meeting we accept the
offer by the NMFS in Seattle to host a workshop on the importance
of juvenile pollock in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. We also
recommend that the FIS working groups attract a few key contributed
papers that address the main scientific questions the group is
working on. We would also like to have a contributed papers session.
<BR>
<P>
5. FIS is concerned about maintaining international cooperation
and exchange of information on non-anadromous species and recommends
that the INPFC transition team address this problem in the transition
from INPFC to the new commission (NPAFC).<BR>
<P>
6. FIS recommends that PICES coordinate physical, biological and
fisheries research surveys planned by different member countries
in the PICES area of interest, and that a block of time be reserved
at the Annual meetings to facilitate this. <BR>

<H1>1993 Report of Fishery Science Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Fisheries Science Committee met on October 26 with the Canadian
Delegate, Mr. James Beckett, to discuss how PICES should prepare
itself to respond to requests for information on issues or problems
relative to the marine science of the north Pacific Ocean, and
how PICES might better serve the scientific community by disseminating
scientific reports to PICES members. The Committee did not reach
a position on what types of data bases and information should
be maintained and disseminated by PICES. The Committee concluded
that any such requests for advice or information coming to PICES
from others outside PICES should be handled directly by the PICES
Governing Council or such advisory body that it might set up.
Responses by any of the committees and Working Groups would be
inappropriate unless specifically empowered by the Governing Council.
With respect to the second issue the Canadians proposed that each
country submit copies of important scientific reports or papers
which are not yet readily available in the scientific literature
to PICES on a regular schedule to be disseminated to the PICES
membership. The Committee agreed that this proposal should be
considered as a possible service to be provided by PICES. This
service could include a dissemination of a list of submitted documents
with brief descriptions of their contents and the addresses of
where copies of the documents could be obtained. The Committee
met again on October 28 under the Chairmanship of Q. Tang; D.
Eggers served as rapporteur. The following members participated:
Canada: R.J. Beamish, J. Rice China: Q. Tang Japan: K. Ohtani,
T. Sasaki, T. Wada U.S.A.: D. Eggers, J. Hunter, G. Stauffer An
election supervised by PICES Executive Director, D. McKone, confirmed
interim Chairman Q. Tang as the chair of the Fishery Science Committee.
Discussions in the Committee focused on review of the report of
Working Group 3, and relevant portions of the reports from Working
Groups 5 and 6. The FIS committee also discussed the Working Group
reports with respect to major scientific direction and priority.
With respect to the report of Working Group 3, Coastal Pelagic
Fishes, The FIS Committee recommends the following: 1. The name
of PICES Working Group 3 be changed to Pelagic Fishes Working
Group, and that Pacific Hake and Walleye Pollock be included as
species of interest to the workgroup. 2. PICES establish a visiting
scientist program and that the Science Board develop funding and
details of the program. The Committee suggests that a minimum
of two scientists be funded for a month or more. The process for
selecting visiting scientists should be competitive with a group
from PICES making the selections. Applicants should submit a letter
of intent with Curriculum Vitae for consideration by the group.
3. PICES establish a workgroup report series produced in a useful
format that is identifiable and citable. The reports should be
anonymous so as not to jeopardize publication of information in
the reports in the open scientific literature. 4. The FIS Committee
attaches highest priority to recommendation 1 of Working Group
3, that the workgroup assemble information on western and eastern
Pacific pelagic fish stocks and produce a document with these
data for key species for the 1994 workgroup meeting. With respect
to the relevant portions of the reports of Working Groups 5 and
6, the Committee makes no specific recommendations. The Committee
supports any activity that improves the quality data and provides
for communication of data among the PICES parties. The FIS Committee
reviewed proposed activities of the workgroup, and endorsed its
scheduled meeting in August 1994 to review the assembled data
and establish plans to carry out Pan-Pacific comparisons of life
table differences and recruitment. The FIS Committee recommends
that the symposium &quot;Recruitment Variability of Clupeoid Fishes
and Mackerels&quot; be the FIS sponsored symposium for the Third
Annual Meeting of PICES. The FIS Committee further recommends
that the Science Board consider the proposals for symposia and
workshops recommended by Working Groups 5 and 6. The FIS Committee
recommends that of these other proposals, the workshop on &quot;PICES-GLOBEC
Program for the North Pacific Ocean&quot; be given highest priority.
This is because of the limited time available to develop a joint
PICES-GLOBEC program relative to the timing of the individual
nation GLOBEC initiatives. The Japanese delegation offered to
sponsor a symposium related to the above symposium proposals,
with the specific topic to be decided after the Science Board
develops its recommendation for the program for the 1994 PICES
Annual Meeting, which would be independent of PICES but held so
that participants could attend the PICES meeting. The FIS Committee
recommends that PICES form a new Working Group or planning committee
to develop an international PICES-GLOBEC program for the North
Pacific Ocean. The FIS Committee reiterates its recommendation
made at the first annual meeting, that PICES coordinate physical,
biological and fisheries research surveys planned by different
member countries in the PICES area of interest, and that a block
of time be reserved at the Annual Meetings to facilitate this.

<H1>1994 Report of Fishery Science Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR>
<P>
The Fishery Science Committee met at 14:30 on October 19, 1994,
and 13:30 on October 20, 1994. Following introductions, the Chairman
presented a draft agenda which was discussed and adopted. The
Committee agreed that a draft version of the Committee Report
would be distributed to Committee members for review before the
close of the meeting.</P> 
<P>
The Committee accepted PICES Scientific Report No.1, 1993, as
tabled. There was some discussion about the policy of PICES with
regard to publication of WG reports. The Committee understood
that the PICES Committee which sponsors a WG is the body which
recommends publication of WG reports in the Scientific Report
series. The recommendation would be based on the scientific content
of a particular WG report, and not all WG reports would be published.</P>
<P>
The Committee considered reports from WGs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Discussion centered on reports from WGs 5 (Bering Sea WG) and
PICES-GLOBEC Workshop Steering Committee, which contained recommendations
of direct relevance to FIS.</P> 
<P>
Discussion of the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop Steering Committee report
led to acceptance of the report as tabled. The WG agreed that
the document was a very comprehensive general science plan which
opens many avenues for good and important scientific initiatives
to be undertaken. FIS noted that the Implementation Plan for PICES-GLOBEC,
yet to be developed, will be crucial in actually laying out what
work will be done under PICES-GLOBEC. The meeting between PICES-GLOBEC
and NPAFC representatives, tentatively scheduled for March 1995,
will also be important in clarifying the exact work which will
be done on key scientific questions 5 and 6 in the PICES-GLOBEC
Science Plan.</P> 
<P>
With regard to the Implementation Plan for PICES-GLOBEC, the WG
approved the four recommendations proposed by the Chairman of
the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop Steering Committee:</P> 
<P>
1. Develop a draft Implementation Plan addressing the key scientific
questions, and meet in the first half of 1995 to discuss the plan.</P>
<P>
2. The Implementation Plan would identify the common interests
of the national research programs that could form a core PICES-GLOBEC
Program, and the resources that each country might contribute
to the program.</P> 
<P>
3. Identify cooperative research programs that could be developed
using existing resources, and ones requiring new funds.</P> 
<P>
4. Identify how the PICES-GLOBEC Program will be coordinated with
other PICES WGs and activities (e.g., WG 7 and PICES-STA Workshop),
and other international organizations and programs in the North
Pacific, in particular NPAFC and GLOBEC.INTernational.</P> 
<P>
To ensure full participation by all members of the group developing
the Implementation Plan, FIS also recommends:</P> 
<P>
The PICES-GLOBEC Implementation Plan group take new steps to facilitate
participation by those speaking English as a second language;
possible approaches include real-time recording and display of
minutes and discussion using pc-based large screen video display,
or use of boards for all discussion, with frequent printing and
duplicating of summaries.</P> 
<P>
FIS also noted that the approach to developing an implementation
plan described in the four recommendations from the PICES-GLOBEC
Steering Committee is likely to result in an Implementation Plan
which largely consists of coordinating programs of interest to
member states. This may be the most feasible way to implement
the PICES-GLOBEC program. However, some FIS members expressed
the hope that the PICES-GLOBEC Implementation Plan would also
clearly identify what the most fundamental questions and scientific
needs were for the coastal and open North Pacific marine ecosystems,
to help to focus PICES-GLOBEC activities. FIS requests that the
group charged with developing the PICES-GLOBEC Implementation
Plan take note of that point.</P> 
<P>
With regard to the report from the Bering Sea WG, on the basis
of scientific merit FIS agreed with the proposed approach to publication
of a review volume on the Bering Sea, and endorsed the proposed
editorial board. FIS does note that the proposal does not address
the matter of the cost of publishing the proposed book, and calls
the attention of Science Board and the PICES administrators to
that important consideration. FIS deferred discussion of the WG
5 recommendation for a symposium on the Bering Sea, until its
discussion of all proposals for symposia and theme sessions at
future meetings.</P> 
<P>
FIS received proposals for a total of four symposia and theme
sessions. After discussion the Committee agreed to recommend:</P>
<P>
A symposium on the Bering Sea, as described by the report from
WG 5, be held for one day, immediately preceding the 1995 PICES
Annual Meeting. Drs. J. Overland (USA) and J. Rice (Canada) would
be co-convenors.</P> 
<P>
A FIS theme session on <I>Density dependent effects on fluctuations
in abundance of marine organisms</I> would be held as part of
the 1995 Annual Meeting. The session would focus on key scientific
questions of the PICES-GLOBEC Science Plan. Drs. V. Wespestad
(U.S.A.) and Y. Sakurai (Japan) would be co-convenors.</P> 
<P>
A session on <I>Marine carrying capacity, including analytical/theoretical
frameworks</I>, with papers and, if possible to arrange, a hands-on
workshop component, should be held at the 1995 Annual Meeting.
It is recommended that the Science Board sponsor this session.
Co-convenors will be Drs. A.D. MacCall (U.S.A.) and M. Kashiwai
(Japan).</P> 
<P>
A one-day topic session on <I>The significance of truncated age-structures
in fish populations</I> should be held at the 1996 Annual Meeting.
Drs. R.J. Beamish (Canada) and A.B. Hollowed (U.S.A.) would be
co-convenors.</P> 
<P>
FIS also discussed the future of three WGs of which FIS is sponsor
or co-sponsor. It concluded that the PICES-GLOBEC Workshop Steering
Committee should evolve into the group which develops the PICES-GLOBEC
Implementation Plan. The Bering Sea WG should be continued until
after the proposed symposium in 1995 is held. The Coastal Pelagics
WG should work by correspondence for one more year.</P> 
<P>
FIS agreed that it was desirable to have a publication record
of PICES symposia. After discussing alternative modes for publication,
FIS recommends symposia be recorded as 1,000-2,000 word abstracts
with 2-3 figures, and included in the PICES Scientific Report
series. This is a minimum requirement, and symposium convenors
may arrange for more formal publication of symposium proceedings.
Such volumes of proceedings generally would not be part of the
PICES Scientific Report series.</P> 
<P>
FIS again recommends establishment of a visiting scientist program,
as described in the 1993 PICES Annual Report.</P> <B>Scientific
Program </B>
<P>
The following scientific papers were presented from the FIS Committee
sponsored part of the program.</P>

<H1>1995 Report of Fishery Science Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The Fishery Science Committee meet on October 18 and 19. The Chairman,
Prof. Qi-Sheng Tang announced that he had just been informed that
he had to attend a meeting in Beijing and asked Dr. R. Beamish
to be the acting Chairman. The proposed agenda was then discussed
and approved.</P> 
<P>
There was a discussion about Working Groups and Working Group
3. Working Groups are created to focus attention of experts on
specific issues for short time periods. It was agreed that WG
3 had completed its business and should be terminated. However,
there were some issues resulting from the activities of the working
group that the Committee considered could be continued in a new
working group.</P> 
<P>
The Committee discussed the formation of MODEL, BASS and REX.
REX was a proposed group that FIS considered could help coordinate
the comparative coastal pelagic species studies. FIS recommends
that it participate in the selection of its representatives on
REX.</P> 
<P>
There was a report on the progress of the PICES-GLOBEC CCCC Program
which lead the Committee to discuss the need to identify specific
activities related to fish. After a lengthy discussion, there
was consensus that FIS identify that key scientific issues relating
to fish in each of the 12 PICES areas, once the CCCC Program is
approved. The Committee also noted that it was important to identify
fishing effects and environmental effects when studying the dynamics
of the key commercial species as part of the CCCC Program.</P>
<P>
A document on stock identification, prepared by ICES, was submitted
to the Committee for comment. As this was a specialized area of
research and the appropriate experts from each country were not
present, it was decided to ask that the document be reviewed at
a later date by each country and that comments be sent directly
to the Secretariat.</P> 
<P>
There were two proposals for Working Groups, a Working Group on
crabs and a group to continue the studies of small coastal pelagics.
The WG on crabs would have the following objectives:</P> 
<P>
1. identify the persons performing scientific work on the distribution,
recruitment, larval transport, migration, population dynamics,
and influences of environmental conditions for crabs and shrimp
in the PICES region,</P> 
<P>
2. identify data that are available that would assist in the analyses
of factors affecting abundance trends, and</P> 
<P>
3. review current knowledge of factors affecting abundance and
survival of crabs and shrimp and identify the key scientific questions
relating to the understanding of the reasons for abundance fluctuations.</P>
<P>
The working group to continue the studies of coastal pelagics
would:</P> 
<P>
1. seek consensus and describe the temporal and geographic properties
of small pelagic fish stocks, favouring the concept of &quot;unit
stocks&quot; to the extent possible. Maps of stock distributions
would be one of the products, 
<P>
2. describe the patterns of mixing or overlap if &quot;unit stocks&quot;
cannot be defined; 3. describe the alternative views of the differing
parties if consensus cannot be reached, and</P> 
<P>
4. describe appropriate research that would solve problems identified;
(v) describe known or suspected patterns of oceanographic variability
that influence stock distribution.</P> 
<P>
Last year FIS agreed to its topic for the 1996 annual meeting.
This decision was reviewed and supported. The topic, &quot;Truncated
age and size distributions and effects of fishing on the ecology
of fish populations&quot;, relates to the need to understand how
fishing has affected the ability of a fish population to survive
future extremes in the environment. Fish populations are more
than just numbers. The structure of the population has evolved
to adapt to the particular habitat. In many species this has resulted
in fish obtaining older ages and larger sizes. Fishing has become
a force of selection and may be altering the structure in a manner
that reduces the population's ability to adapt to extremes in
the environment. In particular, many populations have greatly
truncated age structure and reductions in average size at age.
FIS also suggested that PICES have a symposium topic on retrospective
analysis.</P> 
<P>

complements the Working Group for an excellent job.<BR>
<P>
3.2. Review and comment on three recommendations in WG 9 Report:
<P>
3.2.1. Recommendation #1: PICES recommends member nations to establish
ecological monitoring moorings in the Alaska Gyre and Western
Subarctic.
<P>
Recommendation #2: PICES/FIS recommends member nations to investigate
the possibility of installing a conduction cable across Kamchatka
Strait as specified by the Working Group.
<P>
Recommendation #3: PICES/FIS supports the idea of a &quot;State
of the subarctic pacific&quot; session at the next PICES Annual
Meeting, and sees this activity as part of the REX and BASS activities
already planned for the meeting.<BR>
<P>
3.3. Russian and Korean member of FIS should provide names of
scientists working on pelagic species in order to complete WG
3 inventory:
<P>
3.3.1. Russian and Korean members agreed to provide these data
one month after the meeting.<BR>
<P>
3.4. Discussion of how to increase participation in Scientific
Committees:
<P>

<P>
4.2. Response to SCOR-WG 105:
<P>
4.2.1. The FIS Committee wish to point out to SCOR that the North
Pacific is poorly represented in WG 105. The Committee recommends
to the Secretariat to contact SCOR indicating the lack of representation,
and provide names of some potential participants. The Committee
recommended Drs. Tang and Wakabayashi as PICES representatives
to SCOR-WG 105.<BR>
<P>
4.3. Review of PICES WG 12 on Crabs and Shrimps:
<P>
4.3.1. Fish Committee approved the minutes of WG 12th the October
16, 1996 addendum which indicate that an inter-sessional meeting
would be held for about 4-5 days sometime between PICES V and
PICES VI meetings.<BR>
<P>
4.4. Co-sponsorship of ICES Symposium on recruitment dynamics:
<P>
4.4.1. FIS Committee noted that the symposium was already sponsored
by PICES so no action by Committee was required.<BR>
<P>
4.5. Discussion of holding a joint PICES/NPAFC Symposium:
<P>
4.5.1. FIS Committee deferred any recommendations on item 4.5
until PICES and NPAFC have their joint meeting to discuss cooperation
and integration of science Plans in early 1997.<BR>
<P>
5. Proposal for session topics for PICES VI and PICES VII Annual
Meetings:
<P>
5.1. FIS Committee approved the FIS topic for PICES VI to be &quot;Models
for linking climate and fish&quot;. Dr. Pat Livingston has agreed
to co-convene the meeting.<BR>
<P>
6. Best Presentation Award for the FIS Session at PICES V:
<P>
6.1. Several papers were nominated, a vote held, and the paper
by Dr. Richard D. Brodeur et al. &quot;The distribution of juvenile
pollock relative to frontal structure near the Pribilof Islands,
Bering Sea&quot; was selected.<BR>
<P>
7. Review of PICES Perspectives:
<P>
7.1. FIS Committee reviewed the document and agreed with the views
expressed.
<P>
7.2. FIS made recommendations concerning PICES representation
in SCOR WG-105 (see 4.2 above). In connection with the scientific
program, PICES should further develop close relationships with
PICES regional fisheries committees, e.g., tuna and pollock.<BR>
<P>
8. New Business:
<P>
8.1. Schedule of PICES VI: the FIS Committee strongly recommends
that all scientific presentations be given in one block of time
uninterrupted by Working Group and Committee meetings. The Committee
felt that the interspersion of such meetings with the scientific
transactions was a disservice to those attending the meetings
for their scientific content (which we wish to encourage) and
discourages attendance.
<P>
8.2. Albacore and Bluefin: It was suggested to the Committee that
including the ecology and movements of temperate tunas (albacore
and bluefin) would broaden the PICES perspective by providing
another group that is keenly interested in fish ecology and ocean
dynamics and provide a service to tuna-oceanographers because
of the strong representation of physical oceanography in PICES.
A suggestion was made tht a FIS topic for 1998 might be something
like basin scale changes on ocean dynamics and fish migration,
which would appeal to those interested in temperate tunas as well
as salmon.<BR>

<H1>1992 Report of Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Committee met on October 15 under the Chairmanship of Y. Nagata;
S. Riser served as rapporteur. The following members participated:
<BR>
<P>
Canada: J. Garrett, P. LeBlond, C.S. Wong
<P>
China: M. Zhou
<P>
Japan: Y. Nagata, Y. Sugimori, T. Uji
<P>
United States: D. Musgrave, J. Overland, S. Riser <BR>
<P>
The meeting began with the unanimous election of Professor Yutaka
Nagata of Japan as Chairman. Each member of the committee then
briefly discussed the topics that he/she felt were of special
importance and that should be addressed by PICES. These topics
included the circulation of the subpolar gyre of the North Pacific,
including its marginal seas; the interdisciplinary nature of the
scientific problems in these regions; the need to focus on the
variability of the circulation as well as on the long-term mean;
the freshwater budget of the North Pacific circulation; development
of models of the North Pacific circulation; and the use of satellite
altimetry. The committee then proceeded to examine the goals of
PICES in relation to other programs concerning the North Pacific
such as WOCE, TOGA, GOOS, JGOFS, GLOBEC and INPOC. <BR>
<P>
It was agreed that one important role that PICES could play would
be to facilitate cooperation and communication that is necessary
to carry out such large international programs, especially in
light of the fact that several of the programs named will conclude
in the next two years and will ultimately be replaced by something
else. As an example, the committee felt that the ongoing INPOC
program is a good example of the type of international cooperative
venture that PICES should foster. Moreover, the INPOC agreement
expires in 1994 and discussions about its renewal or replacement
must begin soon. PICES member countries should be urged to support
INPOC and future similar activities. In a similar vein, there
is a great deal of planning for GOOS underway at present, and
we as an international community hope to have input into these
plans.<BR>
<P>
The discussion turned to questions of data management and exchange.
It was suggested that data exchange in the PICES region is relatively
difficult compared to other parts of the world, due partially
to political reasons. More national cooperation is needed from
PICES members. As a corollary, it was suggested that the governments
of the nations involved in PICES should be encouraged to continue
to support research vessels at a level consistent with past support,
so that new data can be collected. <BR>
<P>
It was agreed that the scientific issues the group felt initially
most important could be addressed through the formation of four
working groups:<BR>
<P>
1. Ocean circulation and climate variability in subarctic North
Pacific region
<P>
2. The Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region
<P>
3. New technology and observing strategies
<P>
4. Data collection and quality control<BR>
<P>
Terms of reference for these working groups were prepared for
consideration by the Science Board. It was agreed that one result
of the working group discussions would be to plan a series of
symposia on these topics that would take place at the next international
PICES meeting.<BR>

<H1>1993 Report of Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The PICES Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee held two
meetings during the PICES Second Annual Meeting. Both were chaired
by Dr. Yutaka Nagata, the POC Committee Chairman. Dr. John Garrett
served as rapporteur.
<P>
<B>1. Joint Meeting of PICES Physical Oceanography and Climate
Committee and Working Group-1: The Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio Region,
October 26 </B>The Working Group presented its report, which contains
three main sections: -a series of recommendations for international
cooperation in the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril region, -a review of
previous work in the sea ice and physical oceanography of the
Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio region, -a lengthy bibliography (more
than 500 citations) on the physics of the Oyashio region and the
Okhotsk Sea. The Working Group identified lack of input from Russian
scientists as a major deficiency in the report and bibliography.
The Joint Meeting reviewed and discussed the principal recommendations
of the report. The first Working Group recommendation is that
PICES should encourage the organization of a meeting on the Sea
of Okhotsk and Kuril region in Vladivostok sometime in the near
future, with discussions of physical oceanography, fisheries and
data exchange. One major purpose of this meeting would be to facilitate
the incorporation of Russian information in the review of past
work and in the bibliography. The Joint Meeting was told that
the Russian laboratories in Vladivostok were prepared to organize
such a meeting in September 1994. The ensuing discussion suggested
that: -care should be taken to ensure that the main Russian institutes
were represented, -3 to 5 days should be allowed for the meeting,
-foreign participants would be prepared to pay a reasonable registration
fee to defray some of the local costs, -about 20 foreign physical
oceanographers might be expected to attend, -there was interest
in broadening the meeting to include some aspects of the Sea of
Japan, which might provide increased access to Russian funding.
In view of the importance of Russian contributions to the understanding
of the region, the Physical Oceanography Committee recommends
that PICES endorse the workshop. It also recommends that PICES
consider taking a more active role in the workshop depending on
the status of Russian membership in PICES and providing suitable
administrative arrangements can be found. The Joint Meeting next
considered a group of Working Group recommendations related to
data exchange: -Full efforts should be made to facilitate incorporation
of unclassified Russian hydrographic, sea level and sea ice measurements
into the appropriate international databases, and to identify
datasets which are not archived in WDCB which should be part of
the international archive, -Efforts should be made to ensure that
all special (non-routine) Japanese hydrographic and current (ADCP
and current meter) data sets in the Okhotsk Sea are archived in
the appropriate international databases, -CTD data collected in
the Okhotsk Sea, Kuril region and along major routine network
lines in the Mixed Water Region should be archived in high density
form (1-2 decibars or meters) as well as at standard depths. A
number of points were raised during the discussion: -there are
large amounts of Russian data, so that archiving it is not a small
task, -a monograph on Russian data from the Okhotsk Sea is in
preparation, -some efforts are already being made to acquire Russian
data for incorporation in WDCA, which could benefit from an indication
of PICES support, -INPOC data should also be archived in the international
archives: it is assumed that Canada will do this, -CTD profiles
using only standard depths do not provide adequate vertical resolution
to describe the complex interactions between water masses in this
area, -national oceanographic data centres may not be prepared
to accept high density CTD profiles, -a core group of scientists
is needed to identify the important CTD data. The Physical Oceanography
Committee agreed to draft a letter indicating the great importance
it attaches to ensuring that Russian hydrographic data from the
area are archived in World Data Center A. The Physical Oceanography
Committee also recommends establishment of a focussed task group
of interested scientists to assemble a data set of high density
CTD profiles in the area of interest. The third group of Working
Group recommendations related to high priority topics for international
cooperation: International cooperation should be sought for observations
relating to ventilation of the North Pacific and the exchange
of Okhotsk Sea waters with the North Pacific. The greatest deficiencies
are in quantitative estimates of all processes: rates, transports,
variability and budgets. Recommended projects and studies for
the Okhotsk Sea are: -linkage of Japanese and Russian geodetic
networks (tide gauge levelling), -sea ice formation, dense shelf
water formation in the northwestern Okhotsk Sea, and the polynya
over Kashevarov Bank, -Kuril straits exchange and mixing, -Soya
Current volume, fresh water and heat transports; how the Soya
current leaves the shelf, -influence of mesoscale eddies in the
southern Okhotsk Sea on water structure and dynamics, including
mixing of saline Soya Current water. Recommended projects and
studies for the Oyashio region are: -Oyashio transport monitoring,
-transformation of waters in the Oyashio/East Kamchatka Current
region, including the role of large anticyclonic eddies, -NPIW
formation in the Mixed Water Region. International cooperation
should be sought for exchange of SST and sea ice observations
and for technical improvements to Russian sea ice analysis and
forecasting capabilities. Discussion of these recommendations
included the following important points: -international scientific
cooperation is inhibited by some current national policies restricting
port calls by scientific vessels and foreign scientific observations
within EEZs. In some cases the rules applied to scientific vessels
appear to be inconsistent with those applied to commercial, fishing
or military ships, -the list in the recommendations only covers
topics within the mandate of Working Group 1. The Physical Oceanography
Committee decided to recommend that PICES recognize as scientific
priorities the topics listed and that PICES encourage member countries
to develop projects responding to these priorities. The Physical
Oceanography Committee congratulated the Working Group on its
success in producing such a comprehensive and thorough report
and for developing well thought out recommendations. The POC enthusiastically
accepted the report, recognizing that additional material reviewing
Russian information would be forthcoming within the next year.
The Working Group will revise the report to reflect editorial
comments received since the completion of the draft. PICES is
requested to arrange for the publication of the Working Group
report and the eventual Russian addendum. The objective should
be to ensure wide and permanent availability of the material,
especially the bibliography. Three options were identified: -PICES
provide secretarial assistance and page costs to publish a substantially
complete version of the report and bibliography in a series such
as <U>Progress in Oceanography, </U>-PICES publish the report
under PICES covers and assist preparation of a shortened version
for publication in the primary literature, -PICES assist in the
preparation of a manuscript for publication as a book by a commercial
publisher. It was felt that the first option would best achieve
the objectives of wide distribution and permanent availability.
<P>
<B>2. Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee, October 28
</B>A list of those participating in this meeting is attached
as Endnote 1. 
<P>
<B>2.1 Working Groups </B>The nature and role of working groups
was discussed. The points raised included the following: -working
groups are an extremely important tool to achieve the objectives
of PICES, -the cost of travel may limit participation in working
groups, so that working groups should be well justified, -working
groups should be well focussed, -if possible, working group reports
should be circulated before the PICES annual meeting so that committee
members would have time to consider national responses. This includes
the reports of multi-committee Working Groups, which should be
circulated to the members of all of the committees concerned,
-Working Groups may wish to meet during PICES annual general meetings
but they should not be constrained to do this as there may be
more effective ways to complete their tasks, such as correspondence
and meetings in conjunction with other activities which bring
the members together. Three proposals for new working groups were
considered: -Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation
-Subarctic Pacific Sediment Trap Study -Monitoring of the North
Pacific The Committee agreed to recommend the formation of a Working
Group on Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation.
The proposed terms of reference are included in Endnote 2. The
following points were raised during consideration of the proposal:
-the availability of the WOCE data set makes this timely, -there
is a need to improve the representation in global models of the
subarctic North Pacific, -there is both a need for better models
of the subarctic region and the potential for significant advances,
-special attention needs to be paid to the representation of air-sea
interactions and marginal seas, -the reliability of models of
the biological system, chemical components and material transport
depends on the availability of reliable physical models. After
considerable discussion it was agreed that the Sediment Trap Study
would be covered by the broader Monitoring proposal. This does
not preclude the formation of a group of interested scientists
for joint planning and coordination of sediment trap work. The
Physical Oceanography Committee would encourage such coordination,
and would also like to bring this activity to the attention of
the biological community as the data collected are fundamentally
multidisciplinary. The Committee also agreed to recommend the
formation of a Working Group on Monitoring of the North Pacific.
The proposed terms of reference are attached as Endnote 3. Some
of the points raised during the discussion included: -the timeliness
of this proposal, which should provide a means to ensure that
PICES concerns are well expressed during the planning of the Global
Ocean Observing System, -several PICES member countries are planning
contributions to GOOS, -PICES may wish to expand the terms of
reference to include biological and chemical monitoring. Careful
thought should be given to maintaining the focus of the group.
The Committee was divided on the relative priority of the two
proposed Working Groups. Both are important and timely. The Modelling
Working Group has the potential to have significant impact on
the progress of research, has a reasonable prospect of completing
its task within a year, and is not duplicated elsewhere. The Monitoring
working group has the potential to have an impact on the development
of long term observing systems and data collection and can help
ensure that the needs of PICES are adequately represented in national
and international planning during the period of transition from
WOCE and TOGA to longer term observing systems. It may not be
able to complete its task within a year. The Committee suggested
that Dr. Paul LeBlond of Canada might be asked to chair the Working
Group on Modelling, and that either Dr. Klaus Wyrtki of the USA
or Dr. R.W. Stewart of Canada be asked to chair the Working Group
on Monitoring. 
<P>
<B>2.2 Ongoing Programs </B>The International North Pacific Ocean
Climate (INPOC) Study has been very successful in focusing the
efforts of Canadian, Russian and US scientists on the study of
the subarctic North Pacific. The Physical Oceanography Committee
requested PICES to provide a letter to the Russian Ministry of
Science asking that INPOC be granted official status in the Russian
government program, Complex Investigations of Oceans, Seas, Arctic
and Antarctic. If possible this letter should be provided to Dr.
Yurasov before November 7.
<P>
<B>2.3 Theme of POC Session in the PICES Third Annual Meeting
Symposium </B>The Committee recommended that a one-day session
be held on the topic of &quot;Physical Processes and Modelling
of the Subarctic North Pacific and its Marginal Seas&quot;. Dr.
Y. Nagata agreed to act as convener provided someone from North
America could be found to serve as co-convener. The Committee
also recommended a second one-day session on the topic of Monitoring
of the Large Scale Variability of the North Pacific. Dr. Y. Sugimori
agreed to act as convener for this session, but requested the
assistance of at least one co-convener from North America. <B>Scientific
Papers </B>The following is a list of scientific papers from the
POC Committee supported part of the program. <U>Ocean circulation

<CENTER><B>Working Group on Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific
Circulation Terms of Reference </B></CENTER>
<P>
Although the subarctic oceans play an important role in the Earth's
climate system as a region where strong air-sea interactions occur
and active ventilation of the oceans takes place, the present
state of modelling of the subarctic oceans is not satisfactory
even with respect to the physics. This is one of the most important
unresolved questions for constructing an accurate climate forecasting
system. In view of the importance of modelling of the North Pacific
Circulation for the global climate forecast, the Working Group
will: -Review the status of present physical modelling efforts
on the subarctic North Pacific circulation and identify the gaps
and problem areas, -Identify the kinds of observations and other
information needed to improve circulation models, -Identify what
kinds of knowledge of the related physical processes and of local
ocean dynamics (such as in marginal seas) are needed to improve
the circulation models, -Identify how the incompleteness of the
present physical model of the subarctic North Pacific influences
other modelling efforts such as the global climate, ecosystems,
material transport, etc. A focus on physical aspects of modelling
will be maintained. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Working Group on Monitoring North Pacific Ocean Variability
Terms of Reference </B></CENTER>
<P>
There is ample evidence that large scale variability in ocean
conditions affects fish stocks on interannual and decadal time
scales, even in coastal waters. There is also concern regarding
the detection of trends in response to human activities, e.g.
emission of greenhouse gasses. International recognition that
systematic long term oceanic observations are essential has resulted
in the initiation of planning for a Global Ocean Observing System.
Sustained monitoring over the necessary long periods will be impossible
unless there is an acceptable balance between cost and benefit
from the observations. Careful consideration must be given to
the type, number and location of observations and to the development
of simple, robust and automated techniques. The Working Group
is to: -identify the key physical and chemical parameters for
the North Pacific, on the basis of their value as indicators of
large scale ocean conditions and circulation, on the basis of
the best present understanding of their role in biological processes,
and on the basis of their potential for improving the quality
of model forecasts, -review the measurement accuracy and time
and space resolution required to obtain useful observations of
changes in these key parameters, -review current and planned national
and international monitoring programs, -review current technology
for measuring the key parameters with respect to its ability to
meet the needs for accuracy and time and space resolution, -estimate
the costs of meeting these needs using current technology, -advise
on priorities for development of techniques, -advise on priorities
and strategy for implementation of a monitoring program in the
North Pacific.

<H1>1994 Report of Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
Dr. Nagata presented an agenda, which was adopted after one addition.
<BR>
<P>
Dr. Sugimori presented the agenda and purpose of the upcoming
PICES-STA Workshop on Monitoring the Subarctic Pacific Ocean to
be held October 22-23, 1994, in conjunction with PICES III. Everyone
was encouraged to attend.<BR>
<P>
A report by WG 7 on Modeling was presented by Dr. LeBlond. WG
7 was formed at the PICES Second Annual Meeting in October, 1993.
Members to the WG were appointed in early 1994. Drs. LeBlond and
Endoh served as co-chairmen. Communications among the committee
members were initiated through email and fax. A three day meeting
was held in Vancouver in June, 1994. In September a draft report
was circulated to all members of the WG and the POC Committee.
<BR>
<P>
At the Third Annual Meeting, a meeting of the WG was convened
and the revised draft was discussed by members of the WG and others.
Based on discussions at that meeting, the draft report will be
revised and circulated to all working group and POC Committee
members. A final draft is expected to be forwarded in early 1995.
<BR>
<P>
The POC Committee accepts the progress report by the WG.<BR>
<P>
By consensus, the POC Committee recommended that the activities
of the WG continue over the next year until the final report is
finished.<BR>
<P>
By consensus, the POC Committee recommended that the final report
be published by PICES.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Navrotsky presented his written proposal for an International
Working Committee on Methods of Complex Monitoring of the North
Pacific. The discussion that followed encouraged Dr. Navrotsky
to present his proposal at the PICES-STA Monitoring Workshop.
<BR>
<P>
The Committee considered the issue of making the ship schedules
available. Dr. Royer suggested that OCEANIC, a database that includes
many international ship schedules, could accommodate the PICES
members ship schedules. The POC Committee advises the Science
Board to place the ship schedule in OCEANIC. <BR>
<P>
The PICES Fourth Annual Meeting, to be held in China, was discussed
and Dr. Zhou suggested that the topic for the POC be <I>Circulation
in Subarctic North Pacific and its Marginal Seas and its Impact
on Climate</I>. This topic was accepted by the POC Committee.
Convenors: Drs. M.Y. Zhou (China) and J.F. Garrett (Canada).<BR>
<P>
Dr. Lobanov gave a presentation on the logistic preparations for
the PICES Workshop on the <I>Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas</I>,
to be held in Vladivostok June 19-24, 1995. The announcements
have been sent out. The Workshop will consist of 3 to 4 days of
two parallel sessions, one on physical oceanography and the other
biology and fisheries. There will be a one day boat excursion
to the Islands.<BR>
<P>
The local organization committee will consist of officials from
the local and provincial governments and officials from other
scientific institutes in Vladivostok. <BR>
<P>
The POC Committee recommends that PICES provide financial support
for this workshop.<BR>
<P>
POC also recommends that PICES requests, in a letter, partial
financial support from the Russian Foundation for Fundamental
Investigations for the Okhotsk Workshop.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Lobanov presented a proposal for financial support for the
publication of two books from a Russian series <I>Seas of the
USSR: Hydrometeorology and Hydrochemistry</I>. Some of the books
in the series have been published, but two of the books on the
Okhotsk and Bering Seas remain unpublished due to lack of funds.
The two books are <I>Hydrometeorological Conditions of the Okhotsk
Sea </I>and <I>Hydrometeorological Conditions of the Bering Sea.
</I>These books could eventually be translated and published in
English but first they must be published in Russian due to Russian
regulations. Five hundred copies could be printed within one year
if the publisher received funds for their publication. <BR>
<P>
The POC Committee recommends<B> </B>that PICES provide financial
support to the Gidrometeoizdat Publishing Company for the publication
of the above two volumes and that PICES provide financial support,
in the future, for the publication of the same two volumes in
English.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Talley reported on the progress of the report by the WG 1
on the Okhotsk and Oyashio Region. It is now under its final revisions
and should be finalized soon. The POC Committee recommends that
PICES widely distributes the report.<BR>
<P>
POC Committee discussed publication of working group reports,
symposium papers, etc. POC Committee felt it was not necessary
to publish symposium proceedings since the abstracts are already
available. However, working group reports should be published.
Disclaimers by PICES in working group reports are acceptable.
<BR>
<P>
The POC Committee recommends that PICES provide visiting scientist
travel funds.<BR>

<H1>1995 Report of Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The meeting was opened by the Chairman, Prof. Y. Nagata (Japan),
at 1500. The members present briefly introduced themselves.<BR>
<P>
Dr. J.F. Garrett (Canada) agreed to serve as Rapporteur for this
meeting.<BR>
<P>
<B>Report of WG 7: Modelling of the Subarctic North Pacific Circulation
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. P.H. LeBlond presented the report of WG 7, Ocean Circulation
Modelling. The terms of reference and history of the group were
reviewed. The report is in a final draft stage, and will be circulated
to POC committee members. Comments are welcome, provided they
are received before November 15. In view of the large amount of
effort invested nationally and internationally on improving ocean
circulation models, the WG focussed its recommendations on how
PICES could make work easier for modellers and facilitate progress
in modelling. Many of the recommendations therefore have to do
with data. The WG proposes to dissolve itself when the report
is finished as it will have completed its tasks.<BR>
<P>
POC thanked the WG for its excellent work and comprehensive and
insightful report. <BR>
<P>
POC agreed to recommend to the Science Board that this report
be published as a PICES Scientific Report. <BR>
<P>
<B>Report of Vladivostok Workshop and PICES Scientific Report
No. 2<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Nagata presented the report of the PICES Vladivostok workshop
on the Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent Areas. He reminded POC that the
workshop was planned to complete the work of PICES WG 2 on the
Okhotsk Sea and Oyashio area, which was previously unable to achieve
a thorough representation of Russian work in the area. The proceedings
will be published by the PICES secretariat to complement the earlier
working group report. The workshop produced a number of recommendations.
One is that the WG should be disbanded, but that PICES should
maintain an active interest in the Sea of Okhotsk, and perhaps
prepare another workshop after two or three years. Another is
that PICES should establish a new WG on the circulation and ventilation
in the Japan Sea (East Sea) and adjacent areas. Finally, the workshop
recommended that PICES prepare a complete nomenclature list of
the bays, straits, currents, etc., in the Sea of Okhotsk in all
PICES member languages.<BR>
<P>
POC thanked the organizers of the workshop for their effective
work. It also expressed its appreciation to the editors of the
proceedings and the authors of the meeting report. <BR>
<P>
<B>Proposal for new Working Group<BR>
</B>
<P>
Only one proposal for a new working group was received in response
to the Chairman's request made earlier in the year. This was the
recommendation from the Vladivostok Workshop for a Working Group
on the Circulation and Ventilation in the Japan Sea (East Sea)
and its adjacent areas. The proposed terms of reference are:
<P>
- Review the present level of knowledge of the oceanic circulation
and ventilation in this area, and identify gaps in this knowledge.
<P>
- Review the ongoing and planned scientific programs in this area,
and identify gaps.
<P>
- Review studies relating chemical, biologic and geophysical regimes,
and encourage interactive understanding and planning of multidisciplinary
experiments.
<P>
- Identify the scientific and logistical difficulties of ocean
studies in the area.
<P>
- Encourage the planning of experiments and discussion relating
to physical processes in the area.
<P>
Potential co-chairs for this group would be Dr. S.K. Byun from
KORDI, Korea, and Dr. C.N.K. Mooers from the University of Miami,
U.S.A.<BR>
<P>
A lively discussion followed, focussed on the relationship between
the proposed group and the existing informal and formal mechanisms
for coordination in the region: <BR>
<P>
PAMS/ JECSS (Pacific Marginal Seas Studies/Japan and East China
Sea Studies) have been holding informal meetings every other year
since 1981<BR>
<P>
IOC WESPAC provides an intergovern-mental umbrella<BR>
<P>
The CREAMS (Circulation Research for Eastern Asian Marginal Seas)
program has been developed through JECSS and under the IOS WESPAC
umbrella.<BR>
<P>
The leaders of IOC WESTPAC (Prof. J.L. Su) and JESCC (Prof. Kim),
who were both present, did not think the proposed group would
detract from the activities within their communities, although
they also thought that the WG should coordinate closely with the
existing groups to avoid duplication of effort. Some members felt
that the WG would provide an overview which would be useful to
the planning of specific research projects in the area, and also
that it might provide a framework for projects not yet included
in the existing projects.<BR>
<P>
The meeting concluded that the WG would be worthwhile, but that
its progress should be reviewed on a year by year basis because
the previous work of JECSS and WESPAC might permit the WG to be
complete its tasks quite quickly. 
<P>
<B>Actions in response to the recommendations of WG 7 and the
Vladivostok Workshop<BR>
</B>
<P>
The meeting generally endorsed the recommendations from both sources.
It also noted that several of the recommendations from WG 7 related
to data exchange and management. <BR>
<P>
In consequence and in recognition of the central importance of
data exchange to both regional and large scale problems, POC agreed
to request that responsible bodies within PICES establish a formal
liaison between POC and TCODE. This might take the form of designating
a member of one group to participate in the activities of the
other. <BR>
<P>
<B>Proposal for the POC Symposium in the Fifth and Sixth PICES
Annual Meetings<BR>
</B>
<P>
Several possible topics were suggested. After a lively discussion
and an informal poll to assess potential interest in the scientific
community, it was agreed that the preferred topic for the POC
Symposium at the 1996 PICES Annual Meeting would be &quot;<I>Exchanges
of water, organisms, and sediment between continental shelf waters
and the nearby ocean</I>&quot;. Dr. K.L. Denman (Canada) and Prof.
K. Kim (Korea) were proposed as co-convenors, subject to their
acceptance.<BR>
<P>
No decision was made regarding a topic for the 1997 Annual Meeting.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Election of the Chairman of POC<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Nagata reviewed the PICES rules for choice of Chairman of
the Scientific Committees. The formal election was conducted by
Dr. McKone, Executive Secretary of PICES. Only one candidate was
proposed. Dr. Paul H. LeBlond (Canada) was elected by acclamation.
<BR>
<P>
The POC Committee members present warmly thanked Prof. Nagata
for his effective leadership over the critical formative period
of the POC Committee. His sensitivity to the interests of the
member countries has been particularly appreciated. <BR>
<P>
<B>Preparation of Report for Science Board and PICES Closing<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Rapporteur will prepare a brief summary report for the PICES
Closing Ceremony. The Chairman will use the present document in
reporting to Science Board.<BR>
<P>
<B>Progress Report from WG 9: Monitoring</B>
<P>
Dr. B.A. Taft (U.S.A.) presented a brief overview of the progress
of WG 9. He explained that the ideas in the preliminary report
(circulated at this meeting) arose from the meeting of a small
group and that the WG would benefit from input from the larger
community. The objective is to find the best ways to measure climate
change in the North Pacific in both physical and biological systems.
He asked that POC members, and experts in their home countries,
provide ideas and information to the Working Group within the
next few months.<BR>
<P>
The relationship between the PICES WG and the Global Ocean Observing
System (GOOS) was discussed. PICES recommendations which are not
compatible with the national GOOS programs may find it difficult
to obtain funding. With respect to the large scale North Pacific
PICES appears to be somewhat ahead of GOOS. It should therefore
be able to influence the development of GOOS, provided that effective
means can be found to communicate PICES requirements to national
and international GOOS planning groups.<BR>
<P>
Some members expressed concern with the impact of monitoring programs
on research agencies. Maintenance of monitoring programs can easily
use up such a large proportion of available resources that little
funding is left for research. As a consequence the agencies lose
credibility as research organizations. Concern was also expressed
over possible overlaps and funding competition with environmental
monitoring agencies.
<P>
POC agreed to asked the Science Board to use appropriate means
to remind the member states that it was important to maintain
a balance between routine monitoring programs and observational
programs in support of specific scientific research activities.
<BR>
<P>
<B>PICES Activities in Member Countries as related to POC interests
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Nagata presented a brief informal overview of the agencies
involved in physical oceanography and climate work in the member
countries and the factors affecting participation in PICES and
POC. In several countries university oceanographers have not been
as active in PICES as would be expected from the proportion of
national oceanographic research carried on in universities. In
some cases important government agencies are not well represented.
<BR>
<P>
The POC Committee recommends that the Science Board bring this
concern to the attention of the Governing Council, with the objective
of encouraging broadly based and representative participation
from all member countries. <BR>
<P>
<B>Future Working Groups<BR>
</B>
<P>
The meeting decided that it would leave open the question of future
POC Working Groups, other than that proposed under Agenda 5 above.
<BR>
<P>
The meeting agreed to recommend to the Science Board that a general
PICES Working Group be established to review information on the
'regime shift' in the late 1970s. Possible terms of reference
for this group might include:
<P>
- compile available time series observations of physical and biological
parameters for the North Pacific for the period from about 1960
until after 1990,
<P>
- assemble a bibliography of relevant scientific publications,
<P>
- review the available information and prepare and overview of
the nature of the changes observed and their expression in various
physical, chemical and biological systems.<BR>
<P>
<B>Other Items<BR>
</B>
<P>
The group agreed that it was important to maintain communications
between the annual meetings, although the Chair noted that he
had often had little response to his requests for material. As
Internet e-mail becomes more widely available in all countries
this could be used for to hold 'virtual meetings' on various topics.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Closing<BR>
</B>
<P>
Prof. Nagata closed the meeting at 15:00 on October 19. The members
reiterated their expressions of appreciation for his work as the
first POC Chairman. The Russian delegation particularly thanked
him for his continual efforts to ensure that they were involved
in POC activities during the period when Russia had not finally
confirmed its participation in PICES.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Scientific Program<BR>
</B>
<P>
The following scientific papers were presented from the POC Committee
sponsored part of the program. <BR>

<H1>1996 Report of Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee
</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The meeting was opened at 14:00 on Oct. 16 by the Chairman, Prof.
Paul H. LeBlond (Canada), and was held in two sessions on that
day and on the next afternoon.<BR>
<P>
New members, Drs. Masahiro Endoh (Japan) and Howard J. Freeland
(Canada), were welcomed. It was noted also that Dr. Vyacheslav
B. Lobanov, who could not attend, had replaced Dr. Alexander Bychkov
on the Committee.<BR>
<P>
Dr. H.J. Freeland (Canada) accepted to act as rapporteur.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recommendations of WG7<BR>
</B>
<P>
The report of WG 7, submitted last year, has been published. Its
recommendations (WG 7 Report, p. 30) were reviewed and action
proposed as follows.<BR>
<P>
Rec. 1.1. To make higher resolution bathymetric information available
for modelers. Dr. Yurasov also mentioned forthcoming 1-km resolution
of the Japan/East Sea prepared by Y.I. Melnichenko. Dr. Mooers
mentioned that there had been talk of de-classifying US Navy data
under the &quot;dual-use&quot; policy and suggested PICES write
to the US Oceanographer of the Navy. <BR>
<P>
Action: POC Chair to draft a letter to be sent under the signature
of the Chairman of PICES.<BR>
<P>
Rec. 1.2. Extension of ocean property atlases. POC members felt
that others were already pursuing this goal. The need for data
archival into world data centres was however strongly emphasized:
too much data are unavailable. <BR>
<P>
Action: POC members to remind institutions in their respective
countries of the need for formal archiving of data, including
old data. Letter to be drafted by POC Chair for circulation by
Secretariat.<BR>
<P>
Rec. 1.3. Availability and quality of meteorological fields. Require
identification of national efforts. Consult with MODEL task team
on how best to guide future modeling efforts. <BR>
<P>
Action: Informal discussion between POC Chair and MODEL Chair.
<BR>
<P>
Rec. 1.4. Strong support for satellite ocean-observing missions.
POC members did not suggest specific action but rejoiced at the
news that TOPEX altimetry data are likely to be available for
many years thanks to the proposed continuation of the TOPEX-POSEIDON
mission.<BR>
<P>
Rec. 2. PICES to express support for development of Ocean Observing
System. B. Taft, Chair of WG-9, reported that his WG is addressing
that point. C. Mooers suggested that a representative of NE Asian
Regional GOOS be invited to make a presentation at PICES-VI.<BR>
<P>
Action: Conveners of PICES VI POC Symposium to be requested to
include that item in their program.<BR>
<P>
Rec. 3. Encourage data exchange. This is being pursued by TCODE.
<BR>
<P>
Rec. 4. PICES to encourage workshops on modeling. This is now
underway within the CCCC task teams. <BR>
<P>
Rec. 5. Encouraging visualization of model results. POC members
suggested that the best way to do this was to circulate appropriate
software. R. Brown (TCODE Chair) also said that this point was
being addressed by TCODE.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recommendations of Vladivostok Workshop <BR>
</B>
<P>
There continues to be considerable interest and much recent work
on the oceanography of the Sea of Okhotsk. POC recommends that
a workshop be held in the summer of 1998 to review recent advances.
Prof. Nagata outlined plans to hold such a meeting in Nemuro.
<BR>
<P>
Action: To be confirmed at PICES VI. <BR>
<P>
The preparation of a multilingual (English, Japanese, Russian)
nomenclature of place and oceanographic feature names in the Sea
of Okhotsk is progressing. Prof. Nagata presented a preliminary
draft, and will continue, with the assistance of Dr. V. Lobanov.
POC thanked him for his effort and expects a final report by PICES
VI. <BR>
<P>
Action: Nagata and Lobanov.<BR>
<P>
<B>TCODE Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mr. Robin Brown, Chairman of TCODE, briefed POC members on recent
progress by TCODE, especially in accessing data sources and other
information on the PICES Website. <BR>
<P>
<B>WG 9 Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Bruce A. Taft, Co-Chairman of WG 9, reported on major recommendations.
POC expressed support for the ecological moorings, one in the
western, one in the eastern gyre. There was some discussion on
the exact location of the eastern mooring and it was felt that
some overlap with measurements at Station P would be required.
POC also supported the idea of monitoring the E. Kamchatka Current
using a submarine cable.<BR>
<P>
<B>WG 10 Report<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Co-Chairmen of WG 10, Drs. Sang-Kyung Byun and Christopher
N.K. Mooers, reported on progress of their working group on &quot;Ventilation
and circulation of the Japan/East Sea&quot;. POC expressed satisfaction
with progress to date and supported their plans for a meeting
in Fukuoka in January 1997. Anticipated completion during the
summer of 1997 with report to be presented to POC at PICES VI.
<BR>
<P>
Other interim recommendations put forward by WG 10 included:
<P>
i. A request that PICES should facilitate access of research vessels
to the EEZ of other member countries. Supported by POC.
<P>
ii. General support for the work of the CREAMS program:
<P>
recognized by POC as an example of good collaboration between
member countries.
<P>
iii. A request for translation of a book from Russian to English
was held off for re-consideration upon completion of the report.
<P>
iv. Financial assistance for making Web access possible to all
WG members was requested.
<P>
v. Establishment of a dynamic, periodically refreshed bibliography
on the Japan/East Sea on the PICES Web site. T-Code Chair. R.
Brown suggested this could easily be achieved.
<P>
vi. That a special WG-10 topic session be held at PICES VI.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of CCCC Recommendations for 1997<BR>
</B>
<P>
POC supported the recommendation by the MODEL Task Group that
a workshop be held to develop vertical profile models for nitrate
in the North Pacific and to discuss methods of adapting vertical
profile models into three-dimensional models. POC emphasized that
recognized modelers should be encouraged to attend.<BR>
<P>
POC declined to comment on the proposals of the REX Task Group
other than to express an offer of general support for regional
model development as required.<BR>
<P>
POC expressed strong support for the one-day symposium recommended
by BASS for the 1997 annual meeting on the topic: &quot;Temporal
Variability and Decadal Comparison of the Eastern and Western
Gyres&quot;.<BR>
<P>
<B>WOCE Pacific Workshop<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. H.J. Freeland and Prof. Y. Nagata reported on the WOCE Pacific
Workshop held in August at Newport Beach, California. Dr. Freeland
suggested that PICES might be interested in assisting with publication
of a WOCE Pacific Atlas. He and Dr. K. Kim will investigate costs
and report. <BR>
<P>
Action: Freeland and Kim.<BR>
<P>
<B>State of the Ocean<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. G.I. Yurasov spoke to a suggestion that PICES produce an annual
&quot;State of the Pacific&quot; report, mentioning that Dr. Khen
was producing a report for the region of Russian interest. Prof.
Nagata outlined plans for the SAGE (Sub-arctic Gyre Experiment)
which will monitor the state of the sub-arctic gyre. It was also
thought that plans for forthcoming research were also of interest.
It was resolved that, on a trial basis, contributions would be
requested from national members for submission at the next annual
meeting. ACTION: Chair of POC to request contributions before
PICES-VI.<BR>
<P>
<B>1997 Symposium<BR>
</B>
<P>
Following the request of WG-10 leaders, POC proposes for the 1997
PICES Annual Meeting a Symposium on &quot;Ventilation and Circulation
in Marginal and Semi-Enclosed Seas&quot;, to be co-convened by
Drs Mooers and Byun. The symposium will include an invited presentation
on progress and plans of NEAR-GOOS.<BR>
<P>
<B>Scientific Program<BR>

<H1>1992 Report of Biological Oceanography Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<P>
The Committee met on October 14 under the Chairmanship of M.M.
Mullin; D. Mackas served as rapporteur. The following members
participated:<BR>
<P>
Canada: K. Denman, D. Mackas, T. Parsons
<P>
China: R. Wang
<P>
Japan: T. Ikeda
<P>
United States: L. Jones, M.M. Mullin<BR>
<P>
An election supervised by PICES Interim Executive Secretary, John
C. Davis, confirmed convener M. M. Mullin as the first chair of
the Biological Oceanography Committee. <BR>
<P>
Professor Mullin opened with an explanation of the role and duties
of the PICES Scientific Committees. He then noted that Biological
Oceanography plays a key intermediary role with respect to the
other three PICES scientific Committees. For example, lower trophic
levels may be the most directly affected by the processes considered
by the Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee. Biological
Oceanography will also play a central role in defining the &quot;normal&quot;
conditions (or range of conditions) against which changes of interest
to Marine Environmental Quality can be measured. Finally, Biological
Oceanography will interact with the Fishery Science Committee
to provide scientific advice on interactions of harvested species
with both lower trophic levels (their forage base) and with other
non-harvested &quot;top predators&quot; such as marine mammals
and birds.<BR>
<P>
Committee members of signatory nations introduced themselves.
Professor Mullin then asked official observers from non-signatory
nations to identify and introduce themselves. Two did so: V.V.
Kuznetsov of Russia and C.I. Zhang of Korea.<BR>
<P>
In his role as convener, Professor Mullin had by letter invited
Committee members to prepare position papers identifying favored
areas for PICES scientific activity. These were not intended to
be formal proposals to be subsequently approved or disapproved
by the Committee, but rather to give a quick overview of the range
of scientific priorities shared or spanned by the Committee membership.
The texts of these position papers, which were distributed, are
appended to this report. The chair and rapporteur of the Committee
noted in their subsequent discussions that these papers indicate
a common interest in the large scale structure and time variability
of the Subarctic Transition Zone, the West Wind Drift/North Pacific
Current and the two adjoining oceanic Subarctic Pacific gyres.
There was a strong sense that variability within this large system
strongly conditions the behavior of adjoining marginal seas and
continental boundary currents.<BR>
<P>
However, despite this underlying interest in the large scale role
of the oceanic Subarctic Pacific, and an awareness that proposals
for regionally-focussed studies were being presented to the Fishery
Science Committee, the Biological Oceanography Committee did not
wish at this time to endorse studies limited to a particular region.
The Committee felt that its most important contribution to any
regional studies will be to emphasize the interconnectedness of
the various oceanic regions, and to identify key oceanographic
and ecological processes rather than study sites. <BR>
<P>
The Committee noted that the cost and availability of major research
vessels is a major constraint for all participants interested
in large-scale, long-term, and distant water research. The Committee
recommended that the Secretariat explore and summarize for the
Science Board opportunities for multinational access to available
research vessel time. Specifically, can we facilitate opportunistic
participation by scientists of one nation in the already planned
research cruises of another nation? This could include, for example,
a mechanism for rapid allocation of minor funding by one nation
of the additional costs of research by (or conducted for) its
scientists on cruises organized and principally funded by another
nation.<BR>
<P>
On this topic, the Committee specifically recommended that the
Secretariat collect and collate the schedules for cruises in the
Subarctic Pacific by major research vessels of the member nations,
and disseminate (e.g. via a PICES.SHIPS electronic bulletin board)
these to marine science institutions in member and North Pacific
Rim non-member nations. The Korean observer, Zhang, stated that
his nation would like to participate in such an exchange. The
bulletin board should include dates, area of operation, general
objective, and points-of-contact for each ship or cruise. Potential
users could then request directly from the point-of-contact additional
detail regarding capabilities and cost for add-on projects.<BR>
<P>
Professor Wang noted that formal ties between PICES research programs
and other international scientific bodies and programs such as
IGBP, IOC, JGOFS and GLOBEC should be clearly stated in order
to promote national involvement. <BR>
<P>
Professor Mullin asked for specific comments on the apparently
strongly shared objectives of PICES and the various national and
international GLOBEC programs now being developed. Mackas noted
that a GLOBEC strategy is to identify study areas in which process
and time series work can be combined. <BR>
<P>
The Committee considered briefly an external proposal concerning
toxic algal blooms. Several mechanisms already exist to mobilize
scientific expertise on this class of phenomena, and the Biological
Oceanography Committee decided to pass the proposal to the Marine
Environmental Quality Committee because of the coastal nature
of the impact and its hypothesized linkage in many areas to coastal
eutrophication.<BR>
<P>
The Committee next considered candidate topics for the next general
scientific meeting, and recommended that the following issues
be addressed through symposia and/or workshops: <BR>
<P>
1. Long term time series monitoring of the ecology of the Subarctic
North Pacific (SNP), including scientific objectives, technical
capabilities, and statistical issues.<BR>
<P>
2. Paleoclimatology and paleoecology of the SNP, including potential
new sampling sites for existing methods and possible new evidence
from non-traditional (to an oceanographer) sources such as animal
remains preserved in middens.<BR>
<P>
3. Evidence for top-down control of ecosystem structure by high
order predators (including, but not limited to, fishing activity).
<BR>
<P>
4. Theory of multiple stable states and evidence for &quot;regime
shifts&quot; (particularly evidence from other than climate and
harvested stocks). The Committee noted areas of common interest
with the preceding topic.<BR>
<P>
5. Summary of existing large-scale ecosystem modeling in the SNP,
particularly those models structured to suggest further research
on particular processes or areas. Ikeda noted that existing data
and models are spatially biased toward the eastern half of the
oceanic SNP.<BR>
<P>
The Committee discussed ways in which PICES could facilitate identification
, recovery and dissemination of underutilized data and archived
samples. Professor Mullin voiced concern that financial and other
disruptions could result in permanent loss of some information.
Comments from various observers indicated that while data base
extraction may be laborious, it is generally possible. Kuznetsov
(Russian observer) did not support concern about permanent loss
of archives. Stillwaugh (U.S., NODC) noted that national data
banks and procedures for access are available. Nagata (Japan,
chair of PICES Physical Oceanography and Climate Committee) noted
that the diversity of data types and quality presents a problem
that needs to be addressed in an interdisciplinary setting rather
than within any single PICES scientific Committee. For this reason,
the Committee decided to initiate no independent recommendations
at this time.<BR>
<P>
The Committee discussed sponsorship of training courses, methodological
handbooks and inter calibration exercises. The Committee recognized
the value of these efforts to marine science. However, because
many other international organizations have been or are presently
active in these areas, none was viewed to be an immediate responsibility
of this PICES Committee.<BR>
<P>
With regard to its membership, the Committee would welcome expansion
of the Japanese membership to three people. Additional expertise
in the ecology of marine mammals and/or birds would also be desirable.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Questions for possible consideration by BIO; contributions
of committee members.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Ken Denman, Canada. Does the subarctic Pacific gyre pelagic
ecosystem have a carrying capacity and is that carrying capacity
a function of climate scale change?</B>
<P>
Because the nitrates in the subarctic Pacific gyre seldom approach
zero, it has been assumed that any carrying capacity for the ecosystem
was seldom approached. Recent work suggests that possibly iron
limitation rather than nitrate limitation controls the annual
primary production. Therefore it is possible that the subarctic
pelagic ecosystem does approach a carrying capacity. Near surface
temperatures in the subarctic Pacific entered into a new regime
in about 1976, in conjunction with a deepening of the Aleutian
atmospheric low pressure system. There are strong indications
that in the northeast subarctic Pacific many fish stocks underwent
various types of changes in 1976 - 77 (Beamish, in press). Were
these changes associated with a change in carrying capacity in
response to different physical conditions?<BR>
<P>
PICES could put together physical and biological data bases from
the subarctic Pacific to document ecosystem and fisheries changes
that might have occurred as a result of the 1976 - 77 transition
in large scale atmosphere and ocean conditions. Retrospective
analysis and modeling might identify crucial causal factors that
could be used to predict future change. Also, such an exercise
would identify data gaps and deficiencies that would need to be
addressed if future changes in the pelagic ecosystem, in response
to climate variation, are to be documented adequately. This might
include design of some mid ocean time series stations that different
PICES nations might sample at different times and then pool their
data to for a more complete time series. More specific process
studies could be carried out in conjunction with the time series
data collection.<BR>

<U>Background<BR>
</U>
<P>
The subarctic Pacific has been known as a highly productive region.
Most of the biological oceanography data that support this idea
are from the Bering Sea and the eastern subarctic region, and
there are few data from the western subarctic. Both eastern and
western subarctic have nearly common sets of planktonic species,
but community structure and function in the two regions are expected
to be significantly different. This is because oceanographic conditions
prevailing in the two regions are not identical, reflecting dissimilar
water circulation patterns and water temperature conditions (see
figure) and meteorology. What is needed to fill this gap of knowledge
and to facilitate our better understanding of these diverse subarctic
ecosystems is a multidisciplinary research approach with close
international coordination of effort. This effort should eventually
extend through the entire PICES region (the North Pacific north
of 30o N including the East China, Japan, Okhotsk, and Bering
Seas) and should accumulate data in the region over a long time
period.<BR>
<P>
There are two central hypotheses to be tested:<BR>
<P>
1. Match/mismatch hypothesis: When the seasonal production cycles
of phytoplankton and of the grazing activity of zooplankton are
well synchronized, the standing stock of phytoplankton is maintained
at a constant level throughout the year. In contrast to this &quot;matched&quot;
situation, a &quot;mismatched&quot; production-consump-tion process
results in a conspicuous accumulation of phytoplankton, a so-called
&quot;bloom&quot;.<BR>
<P>
2. Top-down/bottom-up control hypo-thesis: Production processes
at various trophic levels are largely controlled by top predators
(top-down control) or by organisms at lower trophic levels (bottom-up
control).<BR>
<P>
The proposed program involved the following categories of investigation,
most of which require complete seasonal coverage: <BR>
<P>
1. Meteorology, physical and chemical oceanography <BR>
<P>
2. Phytoplankton: size structure and species composition; timing,
magnitude, and duration of blooming, if any; production and sinking
loss. Techniques include bottle sampling, in situ fluorometer
and sediment trap installed in buoy and moored systems, and remote
sensing<BR>
<P>
3. Micro/macrozooplankton: abundance, size structure, life history,
behavior, growth, and mortality. Techniques include net sampling,
multi-frequency acoustics, and automated samplers <BR>
<P>
4. Micronekton: abundance, life cycle, diel migration, growth,
and mortality, by net sampling and acoustics<BR>
<P>
5. Nekton (both migratory and endemic species), mammals and birds

Zone.<BR>
</B>
<P>
One area in which the Biological Oceanography Committee could
encourage research is in the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ).
There are several reasons why further research effort in this
region of the North Pacific is important and timely.<BR>
<P>
First, the North Pacific Transition Zone is a productive area
that supports extensive fishing activities. It is a biologically
interesting area due to the mix of subtropical and subarctic species.
There is also a history of cooperative international research
in this region in conjunction with high seas driftnet fisheries.
Scientists of Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, Republic of China
and United States conducted research in this region through a
scientific observer program on commercial vessels an on research
cruises. Data were collected over several years on catch and bycatch
in various driftnet fisheries; oceanography; life history, distribution
and ecology of fish, mammals, turtles and birds; and distribution
of plankton and other prey resources. Analyses have focussed on
estimating abundance, mortality and biological parameters, and
assessing effects of the commercial fishing. This year, the United
States Driftnet Program initiated a study on species interactions
and community structure of the North Pacific Transition Zone.
Studies are planned which will integrate biological and physical
environmental data to develop preliminary ecosystem models of
the NPTZ. Studies are also continuing by scientists in other countries.
<BR>
<P>
With the cessation of driftnet fishing on the high seas and the
termination of the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission
there is a need for a forum to discuss and develop cooperative
research and to coordinate with other large-scale international
research programs that are also collecting data from the NPTZ.
<BR>
<P>
Data collected under the joint research programs will provide
a basic understanding of the NPTZ ecosystems, however further
cooperative studies are needed to develop adequate ecosystem models
and understanding of the structure and functioning of the NPTZ.
Particularly, more thorough sampling of lower trophic levels,
including mesopelagic fish and squid, and the physical oceanography
are needed.<BR>
<P>
<B>D.L. Mackas, Canada. What physical and biological interactions
trigger major changes in community structure within large marine
ecosystems?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Widely-spaced but often rather abrupt changes in species dominance
patterns occur in the ocean. These changes are ecologically, economically
and sociologically disruptive. I would argue that the disruption
is usually far out of proportion to accompanying changes in total
ecosystem productivity or long term harvested yield, and is linked
to their &quot;surprise factor&quot;. The surprise comes because
scientists and environmental managers do not now have an adequate
understanding of the stability (instability?) properties of marine
ecosystems. To make a valuable contribution, we do not need (and
will probably be unable) to <B>prevent</B> ecosystem change. Probabilistic
risk assessment and early recognition of change-in-progress would
be a huge accomplishment.<BR>
<P>
We know that any given ecosystem always contains low to moderate
levels of species capable of becoming alternate system dominants,
and that ocean currents provide broad dispersal of seed stock
for most marine species. Existing theories of community change
(developed mostly for terrestrial and freshwater systems) do not
deal with this situation. For example, spatial invasion by uncontrolled
&quot;weed&quot; species is probably not common in the ocean.
More generally, various &quot;disruption-succession&quot; theories
seem applicable only to hard-substrate benthic communities. For
other (animal?) groups, dispersal rates are too high and degree
of local habitat conditioning too low. Alternate hypotheses therefore
need to be developed for pelagic systems.
<P>
At least to a plankton biologist, fishery stock collapse sequences
seem strikingly similar and recurrent worldwide. What does the
trajectory of one collapse tell us about another? Are the sequence
and rates similar or drastically different in heavily vs. weakly
vs. unexploited systems?<BR>
<P>
There are significant examples (e.g. Russell cycle, paleosedimentary
record of California Current, CalCOFI and Hardy recorder time
series) for which major dominance changes are not confined to
a small number of harvested species. In these, there are often
many and strong species-species and species-&quot;physical environment&quot;
correlations. This suggests some form of climate coupling, and
a need for effective collaboration between physical scientists
and biologists (in all their diversity).<BR>
<P>
Because the interval between major community changes appears to
be of order interannual to decadal, observation programs must
include long time series. These are wildly popular immediately
after a major &quot;event&quot; but in each subsequent year become
progressively harder to sustain because they are expensive and,
for much of their total life span, relatively unglamorous. (Paul
E. Smith has a wonderful line to the effect that &quot;the greatest
value of the CalCOFI data series is its duration; its worst problem
is its age&quot;) PICES should be a persistent lobbyist for &quot;long
term&quot; science, reminding both institutions and individual
researchers that the natural world does not necessarily tick to
the 3 - 5 year clock of grant renewals and election campaigns.
<BR>
<P>
PICES can also do a number of things to make these expensive regional
time series observations more efficient.<BR>
<P>
One is to endorse and coordinate international collaborations,
both within transboundary systems and on geographically-separated
&quot;parallel&quot; systems, so that results from each participant
nation can be inter compared and &quot;ensemble-averaged&quot;.
<BR>
<P>
Another is to recognize and promote key shorter-term process studies
that can be imbedded in long term &quot;monitoring&quot; effort.
(This is essentially a direct quote from the strategic objectives
of GLOBEC programs). While I think the design of elegant process
studies should be by individuals, not committees, PICES could
provide a meeting ground for these individuals and some high level
balm for the irritations associated with &quot;shared cruise&quot;
logistics.<BR>
<P>
Finally, I think some important advances (or at least different
approaches) could be sponsored in marine ecosystem theory and
modeling. Most existing models, at least of plankton, seem to
me to imbed very simplified taxonomy in very detailed physics
and/or physiology. In range of possible response, they are essentially
locked into the community status quo. A greater range of possibilities
needs to be considered.<BR>
<P>
<B>M.M. Mullin, USA. Variability in fish stocks and in large scale
flow of the West Wind Drift.<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is overwhelming evidence of interannual-to-interdecadal
variation in both anadromous and demersal fish populations of
commercial importance in the eastern North Pacific. There is also
evidence of variability on similar scales in the latitudinal position
of the West Wind Drift, or Transition Zone Current, and in the
relative amounts of water it contributes to the two arms of its
eastern bifurcation - California Current and the Alaska Gyre.
It has been suggested that these two kinds of variability may
be connected causally.<BR>
<P>
Even if the connection is statistically valid, the mechanism underlying
the connection - i.e. how (or even, does) variation in the current
system affect the balance of reproduction, growth and mortality
of the fish populations? - remains as a fundamentally important
question. Therefore, I propose that PICES coordinate and supervise
the design of a program consisting of new research, re-analysis
of previous research (and data sets), and cooperation with other
research programs in the region to accomplish two goals: <BR>
<P>
1. Through examination of existing data and ongoing physical monitoring
and commercial catch records, to test the hypotheses that variations
in the large-scale flow of the West Wind Drift and in these fish
stocks are indeed correlated<BR>
<P>
2 Through examining other data to distinguish between plausible
causal mechanisms for a correlation<BR>
<P>
Goal 1 seems to me to be reasonably straightforward in a conceptual
sense (though expensive). Monitoring of large-scale surface flow
from satellites plus hydrographic surveys transecting the West
Wind Drift, the northern California Current, and the southeastern
Alaska Gyre is one component; a time series of biomasses of commercial
stocks (derived largely from catch data), segregated as to age,
is another. This simplified description minimizes many real problems
in converting data on catches to real estimates of biomasses of
populations.<BR>
<P>
Goal 2 is more complex because the problem is less well formulated,
but it lies at the core of fisheries oceanography as I see it.
The types of research and/or data analysis I envision can be categorized
as follows:<BR>
<P>
a) Direct measures of large-scale abundances of food and of predators
such that years in which the nature of the West Wind Drift differences
can be compared. This presumes that we know how to measure food
and predators for particular species. <BR>
<P>
b) Over a similar period of years, measures of food as perceived
by the fish, through analysis of e.g. otolith widths, RNA/DNA
ratios or other measures of physiological condition, or through
at-sea estimates of mortality.<BR>
<P>
c) Measures of food, or of predators, as perceived by other species.
Other species in the environment which have ecologies similar
to the commercial species ought to respond similarly to environmental
change if, in fact, the mechanism we seek is one where their ecologies
overlap (unless there is unknown niche separation). The responses
of such species could either be positive or negative with respect
to the commercial species (i.e. either a common depression or
competitive replacement). The point of this approach is to use
the responses of several species which are similar in some ecological
requirements and differ in others to support or eliminate hypothesized
causal mechanisms.<BR>
<P>
One can easily imagine supporting controlled experiments, etc.
One can also imagine structuring the measurements such that meso-scale
as well as large scale physical processes and biological responses
can be compared. Conceptually, none of this is new. However, relatively
few (perhaps no) studies have succeeded in doing all of these
kinds of measurements for long enough to create the necessary
data sets. It is this organizational/funding problem to which
, I believe, PICES could contribute significantly.<BR>
<P>
<B>T.R. Parsons, Canada. A proposal for a trans-Pacific Continuous
Plankton Recorder (CPR) program.<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the North Sea a CPR program was started in 1931 and expanded
into the North Atlantic from 1960 onwards. Currently there are
various proposals for programs in other parts of the world oceans
as shown in the Figure at the top of page 30. There is no proposal
for a trans-Pacific program, although a similar program was started
for a five year period in the 1960s under the general title of
&quot;Ships of Opportunity&quot;; it used American Mail Line vessels
traveling between Seattle and Yokohama. <BR>
<P>
The value of CPR data can only be assessed after a significant
time series has been established. However, the data are expected
to have multiple uses including detailed understanding of plankton
species fluctuations, effects of global warning on the plankton
community, the availability of specific food items for the large
salmon stocks in the North Pacific, analysis of long term periodic
fluctuations in plankton due to some yet undiagnosed physical
processes and so on. By analogy with data from the Atlantic Ocean
(e.g. See page 30.), trends in the abundance of planktonic organisms
can only be observed with a sufficient data set (i.e. &gt;10 years).
These data sets enable us to understand that there are changes
in the biology of the oceans which are independent of anthropogenic
effects, such as pollution and industrial fisheries. Only with
such understanding can we hope to proceed towards a better management
system for human effects on ocean ecology. The fact that zooplankton
biomass does vary over long time periods in the North Pacific
is summarized in publication by Brodeur and Ware (See page 30).
<BR>
<P>
In a recent letter from Dr. John Gamble (14.8.92, copy available
on request), the Director of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation
for Ocean Science has pointed out that the foundation is dedicated
to the expansion of the CPR program and will take on training
responsibility and also act as a quality control agency and custodian
of a world-wide data base. Obviously it would be to the advantage
of PICES to communicate further with the Director of this foundation,
if it is agreed that a trans-Pacific CPR program should be one
of the aims of the PICES Biological Oceanography Committee.<BR>
<P>
With regard to the costs of such a program, The Sir Alister Hardy
Foundation for Ocean Science, which is entirely dedicated to CPR
programs, operates on a budget of about $700,000. Providing some
co-operation can be obtained from shipping companies and that
the salaries of research scientists involved in this program do
not have to be covered by its operation, the annual technical
costs of a trans-Pacific CPR program might be covered by a budget
of $150,000. This would not include , however, initial capital
costs. The basic instrument with 6 internal replacement mechanisms
costs about $84,000. At least three of these would be needed.

<H1>1993 Report of Biological Oceanography Committee</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee met on October 28, 1993.
Present were members M. Mullin (U.S.A.), L. Jones (U.S.A.), K.
Denman (Canada), D. Mackas (Canada), T. Ikeda (Japan), T. Sugimoto
(Japan) and Y.Q. Chen (China); and non-members A. Tyler and P.
Gould, V. Alexander, W. Wooster and D. Ware were present for some
of the discussions.<BR>
<P>
1. Chair Mullin opened the meeting and greeted new members Y.Q.
Chen (not present last year) and T. Sugimoto. <BR>
<P>
2. A. Tyler representing the Bering Sea Working Group, distributed
and discussed research recommendations and a statement of principle
scientific questions from that WG. He requested that the Committee
support a symposium, to be sponsored by the WG, on a subject of
mutual interest yet to be defined. The Committee made no decision,
and felt it would be better to postpone such a symposium until
Russia joins PICES.<BR>
<P>
3. T. Ikeda discussed the merits of a symposium or session at
next year's meeting covering comparisons of ecology of the east
and west regions of the subarctic Pacific, in order that paradigms
developed in one area not be inappropriately applied to other
areas. The &quot;small pelagics&quot; WG might also be interested.
Possible conveners include Parsons, Miller, Frost, Brodeur, Terazaki,
Pearcy, or Tagouchi.<BR>
<P>
4. The Committee discussed a letter from C.S. Wong seeking support
for an expanded program of sediment traps in the North Pacific.
His justification was primarily for a study of the carbon cycle.
With respect to records of fish scales in such traps, it was pointed
out the salmon are not deciduous. However, greater sharing of
the ships' schedules (recommended by this committee last year)
might facilitate development or recovery of traps. The Committee
decided that Wong's proposal was too specific for a WG, but might
be incorporated into a more general WG on moorings or other intended
systems. The Committee recommended last year that such a program
be developed.<BR>
<P>
5. The following proposal was presented to the Committee and discussed.
The Biological Oceanography Committee recommends that PICES form
a new Working Group or Planning Committee to develop an international
PICES-GLOBEC program for the North Pacific. The terms of reference
should include:<BR>
<P>
1. Develop and solicit &quot;strawman&quot; proposals for the
PICES-GLOBEC program, based on shared themes of climate variability
and physical-biological interactions, prior to the PICES Third
Annual Meeting. These should include as much opportunity as possible
for direct input and participation from all other PICES Working
Groups. Input from key people outside PICES (from Russian, Korea,
GLOBEC, ICES etc.) should also be encouraged and supported. The
recommendations developed by PICES Working Groups in 1993 should
form the foundation of the PICES-GLOBEC proposal.<BR>
<P>
2. Organize a PICES-GLOBEC Workshop at the PICES Third Annual
Meeting to review these proposals and develop and finalize the
scientific plan for the PICES-GLOBEC proposal.<BR>
<P>
3. Organize a symposium on a subject of mutual interest to PICES
and GLOBEC for the Third or Fourth Annual Meeting.<BR>
<P>
4. One focus of the PICES-GLOBEC program should be decadal time
scale and basin-wide spatial scale, variations in the subarctic
Pacific ecosystem, mediated by climate and physical oceanographic
variations. Subarctic Pacific trophodynamics, including recruitment
of pelagic fish populations, should be modeled. Comparative sty those models structured to suggest further research
on particular processes or areas. Ikeda noted that existing data
and models are spatially biased toward the eastern half of the
oceanic SNP.<BR>
<P>
The Committee discussed ways in which PICES could facilitate identification
, recovery and dissemination of underutilized data and archived
samples. Professor Mullin voiced concern that financial and other
disruptions could result in permanent loss of some information.
Comments from various observerput processes operating at
gyre-to-basin spatial and decadal time scales. Although evidence
for association is strong, understanding of coupling mechanisms
is inadequate for diagnosis and prediction. PICES shares many
objectives and approaches with the GLOBEC program and several
existing PICES Working Groups and Committees share expertise and
mandates. PICES might provide the infrastructure to further shared
GLOBEC and PICES goals. These points were incorporated into the
Committee's recommendations.<BR>
<P>
6. The Committee discussed selected recommendations of the PICES
Working Groups.<BR>
<P>
7. The Physical Oceanography Committee may want to set up a WG
in numerical modelling. The Committee agreed on supporting this
WG providing that ecosystem modelling or linkages were included.
<BR>
<P>
8. Visiting Scientist Programs which would provide support for
scientists to work with specific colleagues in a different PICES
country for a few days to several months were discussed. Some
members felt that travel support to WG or PICES meetings is more
important than visiting scientist programs. There was general
agreement that non-member scientists should be included in a program,
although member governments might not want to support non-member
visits.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recommendations<BR>
</B>
<P>
The following recommendations were presented to the Science Board
by Chairman Mullin.<BR>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee proposes to sponsor a symposium
at the Third Annual Meeting and to appoint a convener for this
purpose. The symposium should be: Structure and ecosystem dynamics
of the subarctic and transition zone North Pacific - is the east
like the west?<BR>
<P>
Structure and east-west comparison explicitly include physical
properties and processes, and season cycle(s) as well as longer
periods. Ecosystem dynamics explicitly include all trophic levels.
The weakest link, in terms of data, may be mesopelagic fish and
non-commercial squid. In addition to its intrinsic interest, this
symposium can initiate interactions with GLOBEC; we see PICES
potentially filling an important role in linking GLOBEC programs
(likely to be coastal) to the larger oceanic basin.<BR>
<P>
The Biological Oceanography Committee supported the concept of
scientific exchanges among PICES countries, but was divided between
two models:<BR>
<P>
1. Increased availability of travel money to attend Working Group
and PICES meetings. This option should probably include scientists
from non-PICES countries (if permitted by PICES governments).
<BR>
<P>
2. Visiting scientists - involving fewer people staying for longer
periods (weeks to months) in a different PICES country to work
with specific colleagues and/or institutions. This option probably
is for exchanges among PICES countries.<B>Scientific Papers<BR>

<P>
After introductions, Chairman Mullin thanked the convenors of
the Committee's symposium, Drs. R. Brodeur and A. Taniguchi, for
their efforts.</P> 
<P>
The PICES-GLOBEC draft report was discussed. Concerns expressed
were:</P> 
<P>
1. Whether adequate long-term, routine monitoring of lower trophic
levels could be conducted without leadership from the equivalent
of a &quot;Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation&quot;.</P> 
<P>
2. Whether phrases in the report such as &quot;whole ecosystem&quot;
and &quot;all trophic levels&quot; were appropriate without explicit
commitment to measure nutrients and phytoplankton. After discussion,
the Committee unanimously endorsed the draft report, requesting
Mullin convey the above-mentioned concerns to the Science Board.</P>After
discussion, the Committee chose not to recommend establishment
of a new WG. However, it was reported that the U.S.A. may request
PICES to establish a WG on top predators (particularly marine
mammals and birds). Such a WG would probably report to our Committee.</P>
<P>
Possible session topics for the Fourth Annual Meeting were discussed.
The Committee proposes to sponsor a topic session entitled <I>Factors
affecting the balance between alternative foodweb structures in
coastal and oceanic ecosystems</I>. Co-convenors will be Drs.
R. Wang (China) and M. Omori (Japan). The goal of the symposium
is to transcend the traditional &quot; diatoms-crustaceans-fish&quot;
food chain to consider, e.g., the microbial loop, gelatinous zooplankton,
heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and how natural or anthropogenic
forces can cause changes in the structure of food webs.</P> 
<P>
The present chairing of the Committee, and the Committee's relative
reactive mode of operation to date were discussed. No changes
were agreed upon; Mullin will continue as chairman fo ranother
year. It was also noted that the Committee would welcome a third
Japanese member.</P> 
<P>
A <I>Visiting Scientist Program</I> funded by PICES was discussed;
as last year, the majority of the Committee felt that assuring
funds for travel of invited speakers and symposium convenors to
annual meetings and workshops should receive higher priority.
If a <I>Visiting Scientist Program</I> is funded, it should be
directly related to specific research needs identified by some
Science Committee.</P> 
<P>
In discussion of disseminating schedules of research ships, R.
Wang noted that e-mail was not yet widespread in China. T. Sugimoto
summarized the schedules of major Japanese distant-water cruises.
It was noted that PICES might be helpful by scanning a WOCE e-mail
bulletin board (Oceanic, U. Delaware) and disseminating a printed
version.</P> 
<P>
The majority felt PICES should not issue its own publications
of symposia. It would be preferable to subsidize the publication
of special or supplementary issues of existing, recognized journals
containing PICES papers. This might cost $20K per issue. Alternatively,
the Secretariat could merely assign PICES contribution numbers
to papers published in refereed journals chosen by the authors,
and collect reprints into a PICES pictures.</P> 
<P>
Sugimoto requested, and received, comments to be relayed to the
PICES-STA Workshop. A Continuous Plankton Recorder Program and
sorting/identification center (e.g., Vladivostok) and biological
instruments suitable for untended moorings were specifically discussed.</P>
<P>

<H1>1995 Report of Biological Oceanography Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<P>
The Committee thanked Profs. M. Omori and R. Wang for convening
a stimulating topic session, &quot;Factors affecting the balance
between alternative food web structures in coastal and oceanic
ecosystems&quot;.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Patricia A. Wheeler (U.S.A.) was elected by acclamation to
succeed Prof. Michael M. Mullin as Chairman of this Committee,
beginning Dec. 1, 1995.<BR>
<P>
The Committee had no comments on the WG 5 (Bering Sea) report,
as summarized by A. Tyler.<BR>
<P>
Concerning the WG 9 (Subarctic Monitoring) report, summarized
by B. Taft, the Committee made the following comments/suggestions:
<BR>
<P>
1. Unfortunately, a ship-of-opportunity program monitoring surface
conditions (particularly chlorophyll) between Japan and Korea
has been terminated. However, a China-Korea Continuous Plankton
Recorder (CPR) program will be started next year.<BR>
<P>
2. Dr. T. Sugimoto described a Japanese ship-of-opportunity program
with 8 crossings of the Subarctic per year, and including preservation
of small samples of zooplankton from the ship's seawater system.
It is hoped to expand this to a CPR program.<BR>
<P>
3. It would be desirable to add a bird/mammal observer program
to the ship-of-opportunity program described by A. Taft.<BR>
<P>
4. For the Atlas moorings, multi-frequency acoustic sampling of
zooplankton (i.e. some resolution of organism's size) should be
considered. Also, a micro-wet chemistry method for NO<SUB>3</SUB>,
developed at MBARI, shows considerable promise as a way to monitor
this important nutrient.<BR>
<P>
5. ALYCE floats should be considered as a useful addition to the
sampling described by A. Taft.<BR>
<P>
Concerning the CCCC report and recommendations, distributed to
members, the committee had the following comments: <BR>
<P>
1. In the proposed MODEL task team, attention should be given
to models of community structure (species, etc.) as well as more
common (in oceanography) physics/biomass models. Also, &quot;top-down&quot;
or &quot;keystone predator&quot; models (i.e., in which a dominant
&quot;force&quot; is selective predation) should be included in
the discussion.<BR>
<P>
2. Concerning the proposed CCCC workshop in Nemuro (June, 1996),
this Committee was concerned that its member on the Implementation
Group (R. Wang) had not been informed. BIO believes that a &quot;biological
oceanographic&quot; perspective is important to CCCC, and (without
intending to question the stature of the IP members) believes
that BIO should be more strongly represented in CCCC.<BR>
<P>
3. The symposium proposed by CCCC/IP for PICES V should emphasize
suitable standard and/or innovative <U>methods</U> of statistical
analysis of retrospective data. BIO believes that powerful methods
of analysis need to be distributed just as much as data. In this
connection, attention was called to SCOR WG 98 which is considering
these issues.<BR>
<P>
4. Regarding membership of task teams, BIO recommends that a bird/mammal
expert be included in (e.g.) REX.
<P>
5. BIO also discussed the need to establish standards for collection
procedures and analytical methods, following the JGOFS model.
A task team under CCCC would be appropriate. <BR>
<P>
6. Regarding the recommendation that PICES recommend financial
support of the CCCC, it was stated that several national GLOBEC
programs are already being considered for funding, and it is unclear
how PICES can help at this stage (except possibly in China).<BR>
<P>
The proposed PICES WWW site is good for information. However,
it may be less satisfactory for data exchange if a user cannot
be identified and informed of corrections to data. Data users
should &quot;leave an ID card&quot; when they extract data.<BR>
<P>
Exchange / posting of research ship schedules is useful. However,
since individual scientists may need many months to obtain funds
to participate in a cruise, even vague cruise plans known two
years in advance could be helpful. Also, potential seekers for
a ship should be able to advertise their desires. The problem
is that the biological community is much more diffuse than is
the physical oceanographic one, and less uniformly connected to
large, information-sharing programs. <BR>
<P>
Four possible topic sessions for PICES V were proposed and discussed.
By vote, BIO recommends that its topic session at PICES V be,
&quot;Regional and Interannual Variants in Life Histories of Key
Species&quot;. Co-convenor will be Dr. D.L. Mackas, for BIO; it
would be desirable for the other co-convenor to be from a western
Pacific nation. This topic is intended to call attention to the
importance of, and variability in, the life histories of species
of regional ecological importance. In addition, BIO agreed to
co-operate with MEQ in organizing a symposium on &quot;Harmful
Algal Blooms - Causes and Consequences&quot;, if MEQ recommends
such a topic session, but BIO places top priority on the &quot;life
histories&quot; topic. Additional topics recorded for possible
future use are: &quot;Controls on lower trophic level productivity
in the subarctic North Pacific&quot;, &quot;Trophic ecology and
impact of marine birds and mammals&quot;, and &quot;Physical and
biological causes of extreme (very large or small) recruitment
events in the North Pacific&quot;.<BR>
<P>
BIO has not previously recommended the establishment of a Working
Group to Science Board. Now, however, BIO recommends that a Working
Group be established under its guidance to develop and tabulate
estimates of the consumption by marine birds and mammals in the
PICES region of marine resource species (by age class and sub-location).
Dr. L. Jones will be the point of contact for BIO. BIO believes
that this activity will contribute to the ecosystem studies contemplated
in CCCC.<BR>
<P>
Specifically, BIO recommends that PICES establish a WG 11, called
&quot;WG on consumption of marine resources by marine birds and
mammals in the PICES region&quot;. This WG should:<BR>
<P>
- Obtain and tabulate available data on population sizes and prey
consumption by marine birds and mammals.
<P>
- Calculate seasonal and annual consumption, expressed as numbers
and biomass, of particular marine resource species by particular
bird and mammal populations.
<P>
- Where possible, stratify the calculation as to age classes of
prey and locality (local stock impacted).
<P>
- Prepare a report for PICES describing data sources and methods
of calculation, and the results, and identifying major lacunae
in knowledge.<BR>
<P>
It is the intent of BIO that this WG encourage communication with
CCCC/IP, with overlapping membership where possible. BIO anticipates
that two meetings of the WG should be sufficient.<BR>
<P>
Prof. Wang noted that China is likely to recommend that Dr. Wu
(who is in ill health) be replaced as delegate to BIO by Dr. Ming-Yuan
Zhu of the First Institute of Oceanology.<BR>
<P>

<H1>1996 Report of Biological Oceanography Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The committee thanked Drs. D. Mackas and T. Ikeda for convening
a stimulating topic session on &quot; Regional and interannual
variants in life histories of key species&quot;. 
<P>
After committee members were introduced the proposed agenda was
presented and several new items added.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Tsutoma Ikeda (Japan) commented on his replacement on the
BIO committee by Dr. Tsuda after Dr. Ikeda's move to an academic
position. We are pleased to have Dr. Tsuda on the committee, but
since we only have two Japanese members at present we encourage
Dr. Ikeda to investigate being reappointed to our committee and
urge PICES to support this recommendation. Dr. Tim Parsons is
considering withdrawing from the Committee due to difficulty in
obtaining travel funds to attend PICES meetings. Dr. Parsons has
been an active and important academic contributor to BIO activities
and we urge that he be retained on the committee.<BR>
<P>
The committee and our guests discussed the new procedures for
requesting extended abstracts for PICES presentations. All participants
were enthusiastically in favor of continuing this procedure. Suggestions
for changes include: marking extended abstracts with &quot;not
for citation without authors permission&quot;, including an e-mail
address or FAX number for first author, requesting the Secretariat
to make copies of extended abstracts IF abstracts were submitted
well in advance of the meeting, and having the Secretariart maintain
a permanent file of the extended abstracts with identification
(reference numbers).<BR>
<P>
Special topics for PICES VI and VII were discussed. Two topics
were discussed for PICES VI: the role of micronekton and harmful
algal blooms. The committee voted in favor of &quot;Harmful Algal
Blooms: Causes and Consequences&quot; with a Korean and eastern
Pacific co-conveners. This will be co-sponsored with MEQ and the
two commitees will work together to choose conveners. Possible
conveners include Wekell, Trainer, or Paul Harrison. The committee
would also like to sponsor a special session topic on &quot;Micronekton
and their predators: Distributions, dynamics, and sampling problems&quot;
.for PICES VI with possible co-sponsoring by FIS. Possible conveners
are Brodeur or McKinnell, and Kawaguchi, Sakurai, or Fukuyo. We
proposed to consolidate the committee meeting to one afternoon
session and to use the other afternoon for a paper session. Other
topics discussed for future meetings include controlling factors
for lower trophic levels, higher trophic level models, marine
birds and mammals, environmental effects of fishing, the role
of under-appreciated (missing link) fauna, effects of timing of
production, the role of micronekton, the hunger state of zooplankton,
factors controlling phytoplankton stocks, and comparison of various
modeling approaches applied to a common data set.<BR>
<P>
Dr. George Hunt gave a report on the first meeting on WG 11 &quot;The
consumption of marine resources by marine birds and mammals&quot;.
The group meet 11-12 October an assessed the quantity and quality
of data available for estimating the size of populations, food
habits and consumption. The data available differ greatly in quality
and quantity for marine birds and mammals and for various PICES
areas. The group agreed to construct for each area, a tabulation
of populations, dates of residency, energy demand, food habits
and consumption. Not all cells in the table will be filled. Time
periods for aggregating data will vary with species and data availability.
The group defined a set of regions within the PICES area and requests
feedback from the PICES community as to the useful of the boundaries
chosen. A number of individuals with expertise in the western
Pacific were not able to attend, and efforts should be made to
insure their future participation.<BR>
<P>
Working Group 11 will be requesting a 5 day workshop to assemble
this table, discuss and revise the tabulation and to prepare their
report. The committee endorses this request as the most efficient
way for WG11 to complete their work over the following year.<BR>
<P>
Mr. Robin Brown presented an overview of the times series inventory
being developed for the PICES web pages.<BR>
<P>
BIO representation of the CCCC-IP and task teams was discussed.
The committee recommends that Dr. George Hunt be appointed to
REX to represent WG11 and that Dr. Linda Jones be appointed to
MODEL.<BR>
<P>
Regarding the recommendations of WG9 (Subarctic Pacific Monitoring)
the committee endorses the implementation of ecological moorings
in the Alaskan and western gyres but is concerned that Station
P be maintained as a site in order to have continued comparisons
with the historical records. Any funding from Canada will be unlikely
if the site is changed. The committee strongly endorses the WG9
suggestion of SB sponsoring an annual session of &quot;Assessing
the state of the subarctic Pacific&quot;.<BR>
<P>
Regarding SCOR-WG105, the committee recommends that Dr. Tang be
appointed as the PICES representative and serve as rapporteur
to BIO and FIS regarding SCOR-WG105 activities.<BR>
<P>
The committee received and discussed 13 nominations (7 nominees)
for best BIO presentation. Two semi-finalists were selected and
the committee voted to give the award to Dr. Nakata (National
Research Institute of Fisheries Science, Yokohama, Japan) for
her presentation on &quot;Long-term fluctuations in the food availability
for Japanese sardine larvae on the coastal side of the Kuroshio&quot;.
<BR>
<P>
The committee discussed two recommendations made in the Vladivostok
Report. First, we strongly urge PICES to actively pursue facilitating
access to EEZ zones for scientific investigations. The second
recommendation was for preparation of a report on biological and
fisheries aspects for the Okhotsk Sea and adjacent areas. According
to our Russian committee members preparation of this report is
already in progress and should be published in 1997 in Russian
with abstracts also in English. For maximum utility of the Russian
publication, the Committee asks PICES to support translation of
the figure legends and table headings.<BR>
<P>
PICES Perspectives were discussed. The main comment was that we
should have more scientific presentations (and fewer committee
meetings) at PICES meetings.<BR>
<P>
A new working group on micronekton was suggested by Napp and Brodeur.
A brief written description will be distributed to committee members.
The committee is in favor of such a working group if it addresses
the distribution and abundance of micronekton in addition to the
initial suggestion which focussed on sampling protocols which
permit assessment of both predators and prey. Discussion will
continue by e-mail to refine the goals of the working group and
develop terms of reference.<BR>
<P>
Written comments on the CCCC-IP report and recommendations will
be passed on to chairs of the appropriate Task Team.<BR>

<H1>Marine Environmental Quality Committee Report</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The Committee met on October 15 under the Chairmanship of J. Zhou;
C.M. Watson served as rapporteur. The following members participated:
<BR>
<P>
Canada: W.J. Cretney (Alternate), M. D. Nassichuk, R.C.H. Wilson
<P>
China: H. Wang
<P>
Japan: M. Watanabe
<P>
United States: W.S. Reeburgh, U. Varanasi, C.M. Watson. <BR>
<P>
Observers included C.I. Zhang, Korea; J.C. Davis, Canada; J.M.
Coe and S.D. Stillwaugh. U.S.A.<BR>
<P>
<B>Introductions:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The meeting began with Professor Zhou extending a welcome, and
asking all members and other interested parties to briefly introduce
themselves and their backgrounds and interests. The general agenda
for the Committee was then briefly set forth. <BR>
<P>
<B>Committee Tasks and Goals:<BR>
</B>
<P>
A preliminary discussion then ensued about the general sequence
of tasks for the Committee, and what was to be accomplished. Central
to this was the realization by all, that the question of marine
environmental quality is quite different in the open ocean than
it is in the (more polluted/degraded) coastal regions of the member
countries. Mr. Wilson expressed the hope that the goals of the
meeting would especially lead to a mechanism enabling the MEQ
effort to help foster and strengthen international cooperation.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Election of MEQ Science Committee Chair:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The first item of business was election of the Chairperson of
the MEQ Science Committee for PICES. The election and balloting
process was explained to all members by Dr. John C. Davis (Canada),
who is also Interim Executive Secretary of PICES. After brief
consultations among each country's membership, ballots were submitted,
and Professor Zhou was elected Chairperson by unanimous vote of
all four member countries.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of 1991 PICES Scientific Workshop, Seattle: <BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Varanasi then provided the committee with a brief review of
the December 13, 1991 Report of the Environmental Quality Working
Group (Chaired by Dr. John C. Davis, Canada), which met as part
of last year's PICES Scientific Workshop held in Seattle. The
1991 Working Group had identified five research issues as being
of primary importance to PICES. The five areas included: <BR>
<P>
<U>(High Priority):</U>
<P>
(A) Nutrient loading and eutrophication;
<P>
(B) Chronic and persistent chemical pollu-tants;
<P>
<U>(Secondary Priority):</U>
<P>
(C) The role of the North Pacific in waste disposal;
<P>
(D) Large-scale environmental impacts;
<P>
(E) Biological community impacts due to exploitation. <BR>
<P>
Although coastal problems as a separate issue were not addressed
by the 1991 report, at least four of the five issues identified
do incorporate a very strong coastal focus in terms of MEQ. Also,
each of the five major issues is strongly dependent on the central
focus of Methodology.<BR>
<P>
<B>Identifying Common Scientific Problems:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Chair then focused the discussion on reviewing Question #3
of his August 17, 1992 letter to all MEQ Scientific Committee
members. This general question was &quot;<U>What are the common
scientific problems needed to be solved or understood both in
coastal areas and in the open ocean?</U>&quot; Mr. Wilson suggested
that PICES could play a major role in sharing technology among
member countries. For example, identifying and providing the latest
methodologies in intercalibration, the sharing of techniques,
etc.
<P>
As a preliminary framework to stimulate discussion along these
lines of thought, the committee also briefly outlined the two
important topics of <B>Data and Information exchange</B>, and
<B>Research Projects and Programs</B>.<BR>
<P>
<U>Data and Information</U> which could be exchanged among PICES
nations could include:<BR>
<P>
- Marine pollution monitoring
<P>
- Fluxes of land-based pollutants into coastal marine environments
(including sewage and wastes)
<P>
- Ocean waste disposal, oil pollution
<P>
- Other<BR>
<P>
<U>Research Projects and Programs</U> which require urgent development
should be identified and supported with highest priority. Possible
research topics in MEQ/PICES could included such areas as:<BR>
<P>
- Methodology
<P>
- Monitoring
<P>
- Biological/ecological effects
<P>
- Transport/fate/bioconcentration/
<P>
Bioaccumulation
<P>
- Development of MEQ criteria and standards
<P>
- Other<BR>
<P>
<U>Linkages and Consequences</U> were also discussed. e.g., are
the effects due to the pollutant(s) in question? What does finding
a particular pollutant actually signify, in terms of MEQ?<BR>
<P>
<B>MEQ in Coastal Areas versus the Open Ocean:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Professor Zhou then led a renewed discussion of how, in general,
deterioration of the marine environment is much more serious in
coastal zones. Moreover, if the committee is to focus on a common
area (e.g., Shanghai Harbor), it should not be an area of interest
to just one country. Rather, we should somehow select an area
of common interest to all.<BR>
<P>
Mr. Wilson emphasized the point that the relative absence of MEQ
studies in the open ocean makes MEQ a very &quot;different&quot;
area for the PICES network to absorb. The MEQ efforts of most
countries are focused in individual embayments. He went on to
point out that monitoring in the open ocean is important, because:
(1) when effects are detected in the open ocean it is usually
too late, and (2) there is continual and increasing transport
of pollutants to the open ocean, both from the continental shelf
and from atmospheric pollution.<BR>
<P>
Focusing on a common need such as MEQ methodology for the open
ocean was also heavily discussed. It was suggested that perhaps
MEQ/PICES could focus on open ocean biomarkers, or foster better
quality assurance (QA/QC) among all participants. Dr. Reeburgh
suggested that it would be best to worry about calibration and
standards, and trying to anticipate problems in the open ocean
before they actually do occur.<BR>
<P>
The committee summed up its discussion of the open ocean problem
by strongly suggesting that PICES be encouraged to begin discussions
to:<BR>
<P>
(1) <U>Select suitable bio-indicator organism(s) for the North
Pacific Ocean</U>. Suggested candidates included tuna, squid,
or similar pelagic species of multi-national importance. Also,
PICES should be encouraged to:<BR>
<P>
(2) <U>Develop a suite of chemicals and other environmental pollution-related
phenomena of concern for the open ocean</U>. Hopefully, significant
portions of this task could tie in with the effort on bioindicator
organisms.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Bering Sea and MEQ:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Portions of the meeting were also devoted to the issue of whether
or not to consider the Bering Sea as a potential site for a baseline
study. A MEQ focus using the Bering Sea would be of general benefit
to PICES nations. However, the Bering Sea has only a relative
few known examples of possible &quot;pollution&quot; or related
undesirable environmental phenomena of interest to MEQ (e.g.,
very high levels of cadmium in walrus kidney and liver in certain
areas). Is such an event a &quot;natural&quot; part of the ecosystem,
or is it due to increased bioavailability of cadmium because of
man's intervention, etc.? A baseline Bering Sea study at this
time would thus seem to be useful only in establishing general
parameters for what is reasonably believed to be a &quot;clean&quot;
sea. It would also be time consuming and resource intensive, and
would probably not be able to address questions in the near term
about serious MEQ problems elsewhere in the North Pacific. <BR>
<P>
<B>Recommended Scientific Sessions for the Second Annual Meeting
(SAM) in Seattle, 1993:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The remainder of the meeting focused on the development of scientific
sessions and intersessional activities for the Second Annual Meeting
(SAM). The Committee agreed that its focus for the SAM should
be on the goal of <U>The Development of Common Assessment Methodology
for Marine Pollution in the North Pacific</U>. The focus outlined
above should remain a general one, and not encumbered by too small
a focus. The solicitation and acceptance of contributed papers
should adhere rigorously to a state-of-the-art theme, and eschew
the presentation of &quot;data for data's sake&quot;. <BR>
<P>
Perhaps the most fundamental components underlying the central
issue of Assessment Methodology are the concepts of &quot;linkages&quot;
and &quot;consequences&quot; of contamination. Is the contaminant,
or other offending substance, present at levels which are above
what could be anticipated as reasonable background? Is it causing
an adverse effect? Will it cause an effect later on? <B>Is the
effect likely to be of consequence?</B> How? To what, and in what
fashion? &quot;Linkages&quot; also follow strongly in the wake
of our efforts at fostering greater intersessional activities
in MEQ. Such linkages could, for example, include the development
of uniform QA/AC techniques, tissue banks for comparability studies
and status and trends information, open-ocean MEQ strategies for
the future, and so forth.<BR>
<P>
With these factors in mind, the MEQ Scientific Committee recommends
that the SAM focus on the general topic, <B>&quot;Assessment Techniques
and Methodologies in Marine Environmental Quality&quot;</B>. This
topic would 
<P>
be subdivided into two subsets:<BR>
<P>
A: <B>Algal blooms</B>
<P>
B: <B>Chemical and biological contaminants<BR>
</B>
<P>
Initially, the Committee had identified the first subset topic
as 'Harmful Algal Blooms&quot;. However, Dr. Watanabe and others
pointed out that such a topic would be too limiting, especially
in light of the intersessional nature of MEQ activities. Hence,
the topic was broadened to include algal blooms in general. <BR>
<P>
To design the scientific content and scope of the SAM, the MEQ
also recommended <B>the establishment of an Intersessional Working
Group</B> with the responsibility, which would include the selection
of sessions and issuance of a call for appropriate research papers
for the 1993 SAM in Seattle.<BR>
<P>
<B>Specific Outline for the Proposed SAM Meeting Topic:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Although every possible effort should be made to focus these two
sub-topics along an intersessional approach, a suggested detailed
outline of possible problem areas and research issues to be addressed
was put forth by the Committee as follows: <BR>
<P>
<B>A: Algal blooms:</B> Some suggested subsets of this topic at
the SAM should include:<BR>
<P>
- National overviews from each participating country
<P>
- Future vision/new approaches to the topic
<P>
- Indicator organisms/trends
<P>
- Nutrient flux
<P>
- Monitoring techniques and method-ology
<P>
- Development of new techniques to identify and understand biotoxins
<P>
- Mechanism of action/toxicology
<P>
- Epidemiology/clinical reports
<P>
- fish, humans, etc.
<P>
- case history studies
<P>
- Causal factors
<P>
- Ecodynamics
<P>
- Other
<P>
<B>B: Chemical and Biological Contaminants:</B> Introductory papers
on this topic at the SAM should also include National Overviews
from each participating country, as well as a focus upon Future
Vision/New Approaches to the topic. This topic can be further
divided into two subsets:<BR>
<P>
1. <U>Sources, and Contaminants of Concern<BR>
</U>
<P>
- Sewage discharge pathogens, organics, metals, nutrients
<P>
- Waste dumping industrial, dredge spoils, marine debris
<P>
- Fish/shellfish processing wastes coastal versus vessels at sea
pathogens, nutrients, sediment chemistry
<P>
- Agriculture/mariculture pathogens, nutrients, sediment chemistry
<P>
- Ballast water as contaminant source
<P>
- Anthropogenic chemicals/events organics, organometalloids, metals
etc. oil spills/oil seepages<BR>
<P>
2. <U>Impact of These Contaminants on Natural Biogeochemical Processes
and Cycling<BR>
</U>
<P>
- Transport/transfer coast, shelf, open-ocean
<P>
- Transportation/metabolism
<P>
- Biodergradation/other
<P>
- deterministic and stochastic modeling

<H1>1993 Report of Marine Environmental Quality Committee</H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<HR><P>
The MEQ Scientific Committee met from 1300 to 1700 hrs. on Thursday,
October 28, 1993, at the NOAA Sand Point facility in Seattle,
Washington, USA. To maximize opportunities for the interdisciplinary
exchanges of ideas and problem solving techniques, the meeting
was held jointly with available members of PICES Working Group
2 (WG2: Development of Common Assessment Methodology for Marine
Pollution). <BR>
<P>
Committee and Working Group members, observers and countries represented
included: (* members of both MEQ and WG2 Scientific Committees)
<BR>
<P>
Chair: Prof. J. Y. Zhou (China)<BR>
<P>
MEQ Scientific Committee Members:
<P>
Japan: Dr. M. Watanabe, Mr. M. Kinoshita, Dr. T. Hirano
<P>
China: Prof. M. J. Zhou (replaced Prof. H. T. Wang)
<P>
Canada: Mr. R. C. H. Wilson
<P>
U.S.A.: Prof. W. S. Reeburgh, Dr. J. E. Stein (participated on
behalf of Dr. U. Varanasi), Dr. C. M. Watson (Rapporteur)<BR>
<P>

<P>
U.S.A.: Dr. J. E. Stein<BR>
<P>
Observers: Ms. N. Lerner, Dr. F. B. Taub<BR>
<P>
<B>Introductions:</B>
<P>
The meeting began with Prof. J. Zhou extending a welcome, and
asking all present in the meeting room to briefly introduce themselves
and their backgrounds and interests. The Chair then stressed that
two very important tasks of this meeting would be: (1) to review
the WG2 Report, and (2) to continue discussions of future MEQ
agenda and focus. The Chair then briefly set forth a general outline
of the various MEQ Business Meeting Agenda, and the meeting was
called to order.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of 1992 MEQ Scientific Committee Meeting, Victoria,
B.C., Canada:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Watson then provided a brief overview of the previous year's
(and first annual) PICES MEQ meeting, held in Victoria on October
15, 1992. The meeting largely focused on the two tasks of: <BR>
<P>
(a) Identifying common scientific problems, and 
<P>
(b) Recommending scientific sessions for the (current) Second
Annual Meeting in Seattle. <BR>
<P>
The former task centered largely around discussions about the
relationships between MEQ in the (more polluted and more researched)
coastal regions of PICES countries, versus MEQ issues in the open
ocean. It was suggested that PICES be encouraged to begin discussions
to select suitable bio-indicator organisms for the North Pacific
Ocean, and to develop a suite of chemicals and other phenomena
of concern for the open ocean. For its second task, the Committee
recommended that the Second Annual Meeting focus on the goal of
&quot;The Development of Common Assessment Methodology for Marine
Pollution in the North Pacific&quot;. Further, this topic would
be divided into two subsets: (1) Algal blooms, and (2) Chemical
and Biological Contaminants. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Watson emphasized that the issue of the coastal regions versus
the open ocean remains the most challenging one before our Committee,
and will necessarily play a major part in determining the focus
of future discussions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of the MEQ Scientific Papers Presented at the Second
Annual Meeting:</B> (see also Endnote 1)<BR>
<P>
Dr. Stein summarized the October 26, 1993 Seattle MEQ scientific
sessions, which had been arranged and convened by Dr. Varanasi,
and co-chaired by Drs. J. Davis (Canada), T. Hirano (Japan), M.J.
Zhou (China) and C. M. Watson (U.S.A.). The technical session
was extremely successful, and the invited papers were very appropriate
to MEQ's scientific charge and goals. Presentations were made
by scientists from all PICES countries, and covered a broad spectrum
of highly pertinent issues; ranging from disposal of fish processing
waste at sea and the introduction of exotic species, to storage
and metabolism of chemical contaminants in marine fish and marine
mammals and the atmospheric transport of chemical contaminants
to Arctic environments. Transportation of contaminants was identified
as an issue of major concern to the MEQ Scientific Committee.
The presentations also identified a number of contaminants of
concern to PICES countries, including: chemical contaminants,
nutrients, radionuclides, marine debris, harmful algal blooms,
and the introduction of exotic species via ballast waters.<BR>
<P>
The scientific sessions served to underscore the key theme that
despite their obvious differences, all of the PICES countries
share many common similarities in terms of MEQ problems and the
need for an integrated scientific approach. Mr. Wilson commented
that we should not lose sight of the importance of atmospheric
transport of contaminants as a common problem for all, as pointed
out in the MEQ session's paper by Muir, et al regarding organochlorines
in cetaceans from Canadian waters. <BR>
<P>
The MEQ Scientific Committee unanimously agreed that the scope
and quality of the papers from the Second Annual Meeting fulfilled
the goals set forth last year in Victoria as outlined above, and
that they set the stage very appropriately for what should go
forward in our future MEQ efforts.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of the Report of Working Group 2 (WG2):<BR>
</B>
<P>
(a) Background and Scope of WG2 Report: <BR>
<P>
Dr. Addison then provided a detailed overview of the WG2 Report.
In preparing the report, the WG2 first invited background papers
from each of the four PICES countries, which would then provide
a series of broad introductory overviews of what are considered
to be major MEQ issues and problems in each country, and summarizing
their various approaches used in assessing MEQ. Following the
two major terms of reference identified at the First Annual Meeting,
these background papers were then used by the WG2 to develop general
conclusions for future MEQ activities.<BR>
<P>
General conclusions from the four reports were that: <BR>
<P>
(1) All four countries focus their marine pollution studies on
coastal zones and continental shelves, rather than the &quot;open
ocean&quot;. This is because not only do coastal zones serve as
receiving waters, but also because they are the main areas of
exploitation and productivity. Furthermore, <BR>
<P>
(2) All four countries emphasize the distribution of &quot;contaminants&quot;;
these are usually chemicals, but more recently the focus also
include pathogens, harmful algal blooms, etc.<BR>
<P>
Questions arising from the four background papers included:<BR>
<P>
(1) What are the contaminants? 
<P>
(2) What are their sources, pathways, and sinks? and 
<P>
(3) What are their impacts? <BR>
<P>
Mr. Wilson provided discussion as to how in actuality, the order
of these three questions could easily be reversed, because society
tends to care the most about &quot;impacts&quot; before it addresses
the sources and causes of these impacts. PICES countries appear
to be relatively comfortable with the first question, but the
other two remain largely unanswered. Therefore, MEQ should focus
more on the second and third questions. WG2 also recognized that
chemical analysis is currently the area in which there has been
the most research. Additional areas for suggested study include:
(a) environmental quality objectives, and (b) the use of biomarkers
to measure environmental effects of contaminants. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Addison went on with his summary to point out that China and
Japan tend to be more concerned with chemicals which cause eutrophication,
because of the relatively more shallow continental shelves along
their Pacific borders. In North America, on the other hand, higher
priorities are given to chemicals we receive by &quot;being downstream&quot;
from so many sources, atmospheric and otherwise.<BR>
<P>
(b) Conclusions of WG2 Report:<BR>
<P>
Using this background information and guidance from the First
Annual Meeting as a starting point, WG2 concluded that an important
objective was to promote the harmonization of methods used in
studying MEQ within the PICES area, including evaluation and comparison
of methods. In turn, this would serve to facilitate the exchange
of data among the participating countries and the development
of comparative and cooperative activities to assess MEQ conditions
across national boundaries and in the open ocean. Such harmonization
can be conducted at three different levels: at the first level,
(1) methods-based comparisons evaluate methods to determine whether
the same techniques, procedures and equipment are being used.
At the second level, (2) performance-based comparisons are made
by analyzing identical environmental samples to assess how well
results agree and within what levels of accuracy and precision
it is valid to combine and compare results. At the third level,
(3) assessment-based comparisons are made of the conclusions which
result when the environmental conditions of an area are assessed
using different methods. It was also concluded that in order to
begin to achieve the goal of harmonization, data should begin
to be exchanged among scientists from member countries.<BR>
<P>
(c) WG2 Suggested Action Plan:<BR>
<P>
With these needs and objectives in mind, WG2 then sought to develop
a practical plan of action. This consisted of two key suggestions,
which are the essential core of their recommendations: First,
(1) MEQ should organize a symposium at the Third Annual Meeting
(to be held at Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan), dealing with how we can
assess the question of the impact of contaminant stressors on
marine ecosystem structure and function (MESAF). Such a symposium
should explore the range of methodologies that could be used to
assess and predict these ecosystem impacts. Secondly, (2) MEQ
and WG2 should organize a collaborative, interdisciplinary workshop
within the next two to three years, which would address problems
of sources and transport of contaminants to the sub-Arctic North
Pacific. Such a workshop should also encourage effects on biological
systems, rather than just focusing on chemicals, biomarkers, and
so forth. The workshop should be designed around a practical,
&quot;hands-on&quot; approach in the use of methodologies for
assessing sources, transport, and impacts of contaminants on MEQ.
<BR>
<P>
The reasoning for the suggestion to conduct both a symposium and
a workshop was based on the fact that it is both easier and necessary
to set up a symposium for the more general question, which could
be set up within the year and serve to generate ways to measure
stressors. The workshop would require more time to organize. One
of the underlying recurrent themes of the WG2 meeting was that
we need to be able to look at pollutants not solely in terms of
chemistry, but also in terms of their biological response and
impact. The symposium is seen as a necessary step in clarifying
and defining the work of the practical workshop.<BR>
<P>
(d) Discussion of Proposed WG2 Action Plan:<BR>
<P>
Elements and scientific focus of the proposed symposium and workshop
were discussed heavily. Dr. Addison presented a visual paradigm,
which compared studies at the population level to those of whole
organisms and subcellular processes, in terms of their ecological
relevance, sensitivity, specificity and timeliness. This served
to highlight the parameters which are used to measure impacts
at the ecosystem level, and to set the stage for discussion as
to how to address basic MEQ questions by using biochemical indices,
organismal and population levels, and community structure. In
measuring impacts, one must first identify the question before
choosing the level of study. For example, one could investigate
subcellular biochemical impacts if the goal were to look for an
&quot;early warning system&quot;. On the other hand, studies of
community structure would be more useful in understanding impacts
of contaminant stressors &quot;after the fact&quot;. Problems
with this approach include accurately determining the structure
of the community prior to the advent of the stressors involved.
Also, examination of an ecosystem, species by species, will not
necessarily allow one to understand a community structure and
make predictions.<BR>
<P>
Mr. Wilson pointed out the need to sort out changes in ecosystems
which are due to pollution, versus those changes which are not.
A suggestion was made that Dalian Bay in China would be an ideal
situation for convening the proposed workshop, because it provides
a wide gradient of ecosystem pollution, ranging from severely
impacted to near-&quot;background&quot; areas. Dr. Watanabe emphasized
the importance of eutrophication. Although we all know that reducing
the input of nutrients into the ocean is very desirable, we remain
unable to predict the effects of this at the ecosystem level.
Dr. Hirano felt that such a workshop would be a good first step
toward the development of cooperative studies among PICES nations.
The Chair summarized the benefits from convening such a proposed
MEQ Workshop, which include: (1) Getting appropriate scientists
together to solve common problems, and (2) developing the best
possible scientific solutions to these common problems.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recommendations to the PICES Science Board:<BR>
</B>
<P>
The MEQ Committee reiterated its support for the WG2 report, and
moved to submit it to the PICES Science Board for their consideration
and implementation.<BR>
<P>
In addition the MEQ Committee strongly suggested that the Science
Board select a Scientific Convener as soon as possible for the
MEQ Sessions to be held in Nemuro, Japan in 1994.<BR>
<P>
Furthermore, due to the international nature and geographic vastness
of the PICES area, there are obvious practical difficulties in
assembling all members of MEQ and its various working group(s)
in a convenient and reasonable meeting location. As a possible
solution, and intersessional meeting in a mid-Pacific area such
as Hawaii, was proposed as both geographically and financially
practical.<BR>
<P>
<B>Review of the North-West Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) and discussion
on relationship and cooperation between PICES and NOWPAP:</B>
<P>
The Chair briefly described NOWPAP, which is an Asian Pacific
international effort sponsored by the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). NOWPAP focuses on the North West Pacific Region;
specifically, the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan. Relevant countries
in NOWPAP consist of: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea,
and the Russian Federation. PICES has designated MEQ Scientific
Committee Chair, Prof. J. Y. Zhou, to officially represent PICES
at the upcoming NOWPAP meeting to be held in Bangkok on 10-12
November, 1993.<BR>
<P>
The Chair then entertained discussion and comment about the desired
extent and nature of this proposed relationship with NOWPAP. Mr.
Kinoshita pointed out the importance of PICES being aware of Japan's
formal position with regard to NOWPAP, which is that the issue
of Marine Resource Preservation be excluded from NOWPAP at this
time. Dr. Reeburgh suggested that MEQ and PICES should seek to
establish communication with and complement NOWPAP, providing
whatever assistance we can. Following discussion around the table,
the MEQ Committee unanimously welcomed the communication and participation
of Prof. Zhou with NOWPAP, and is hopeful that our MEQ efforts
will prove complementary and helpful to theirs in carrying out
our many mutual interests. <BR>
<P>
<B>Other Business:<BR>
</B>
<P>
Members of both committees briefly addressed the problem of not
being able to prepare, receive and review the final WG2 Report
until well into the Second Annual Meeting. In order to give both
MEQ and WG2 more time to generate and to review such reports,
it would be ideal to phase the two committees in a bimodal fashion.
However, financing such an arrangement would clearly be more costly.
For the time being, Dr. Addison suggested that we continue to
hold the meetings in the same back-to-back arrangement.<BR>

<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Dr. Bradley Stevens of the National Marine Fisheries Service,
Kodiak, Alaska (USA), presented results of an initial study of
the impact of disposal of fish processing waste in waters near
Kodiak, Alaska. The conclusions of the study were that there were
no major effects on megafaunal abundance or on water quality due
to the dumping of nearshore fish processing wastes. Rapid decomposition
of wastes prevented the buildup of waste, and the only significant
difference between the dump site and the control site was a significantly
higher microbial count in dump areas, which probably contributed
to the residual decay of the waste. <BR>
<P>
Dr. Stevens concluded that there was no apparent effect on the
benthos, but stipulated that his results could not be extrapolated
to disposal in the open ocean. Waste at sea is not processed for
disposal in the same manner as nearshore waste, and therefore
it is not known whether disposal at sea poses any concern.<BR>
<P>
Dr. John Landahl, National Marine Fisheries Service, Seattle (USA),
described efforts to determine treads over time in the levels
of chemical contaminants in sediment and fish from sites along
the U.S. West Coast. One conclusion of the Benthic Surveillance
Program was that at least 4-5 years of data are needed for trends
analysis. Several questions regarding time lags in the system
for persistent compounds, the role of offshore transport processes,
and the land as a source of contaminants were raised, as well
as difficulties in sorting out natural variations in the system.
This presentation generated a good discussion, bringing out the
need for long-term data sets to effectively determine trends.
At the same time, the presentation generated discussion on the
need to revise goals and incorporate new techniques as developed
and validated that will improve our ability to address our ultimate
goal: the effects of contaminants on biological systems.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Edward Goldberg, Marine Research Division of Scripps Institution
of Oceanography in California (U.S.A.), provided a position paper
on what he currently views as the most important issues related
to marine environmental quality, and some insights on recent activities
of an international mussel watch project. Dr. Goldberg described
how we have historically only identified harmful contaminants
through catastrophic events that resulted from the introduction
of a contaminant into the environment, such as the effects of
TBT and DDT on nontarget organisms, or the methyl mercury poisoning
of Minamata Bay. Dr. Goldberg pointed out three contaminants of
considerable future concern: namely nutrients, plastics, and radionuclides.
These contaminants are also priority issues identified by other
international organizations. All three contaminants were highlighted
by speakers in other presentations in the session.<BR>
<P>
Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
Qingdao, and Prof. Jia-Yi Zhou of the Institute of Marine Environmental
Protection in Dalian (China) emphasized that two key issues for
China are nutrients, and their relationship to harmful algal blooms.
Recently, human consumption of shellfish containing biotoxins
and pathogens in China has led to serious human health consequences.
Prof. M.J. Zhou also effectively presented the knowledge gaps
in methodologies for effectively monitoring harmful algal blooms
and in generating information that would allow us to predict such
events, including: criteria with which to judge eutrophication
and the relationship between eutrophication and red tides; the
taxonomy, mechanisms, and control of harmful algal blooms; monitoring
of organic and pathogenic marine pollution; the bioavailability
of heavy metals and organic compounds in the marine environment;
sediment criteria (type, particle size, organic matter, biological
assessment); and the relationship between coastal waters and the
open sea in environmental quality issues.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Masataka Watanabe, National Institute for Environmental Studies
(Japan), presented the results of mesocosm-studies designed to
determine the processes and factors important in creating the
proper environmental conditions for the formation of harmful algal
blooms, which will lead to increased ability to predict their
occurrences. Dr. Watanabe's studies employed a mesocosm (18 m.
deep and 5 m. in diameter) that allowed for systematic vertical
circulation in the surface layer. Nutrients were then added at
different depths and a range of physical and biological parameters
were measured. Dr. Watanabe's results clearly showed that controlled
studies are very useful in identifying key parameters in order
to effectively model abiotic and biotic changes resulting from
nutrient enrichment.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Takeshi Umezu of the Environment Conservation Division of
the National Research Institute of Fisheries Science (Japan),
presented results of a study evaluating the squid as a biological
monitor for the dispersion of radionuclides in the North Pacific.
Dr. Umezu's studies highlighted two important topics concerning
marine environmental quality in the PICES region: transboundary
transport of contaminants, and radionuclides as contaminants of
concern.<BR>
<P>
Mr. Masaaki Kinoshita of the Office of Marine Pollution Control
and Waste Management, Japan Environment Agency (Japan) presented
a paper on the results of the monitoring in the Sea of Japan conducted
by his Agency in 1992. These studies involved monitoring of chemical
contaminants and marine debris, such as plastics, and assessed
both spatial and temporal trends in the parameters measured. The
results showed that some parameters (e.g. total organic carbon
in seawater) were apparently declining in relation to decreased
disposal of wastes at sea; however, Mr. Kinoshita's results also
showed that on transects from disposal sites towards the open
sea, plastics are being observed, at times at levels comparable
to the levels near the disposal sites. These findings augmented
those of other presenters suggesting that transboundary transport
of both chemical and biological substances is an area of concern.
<BR>
<P>
Dr. Derek Muir from the Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans at the Freshwater
Institute in Winnipeg (Canada) presented work on chemical contaminants
in the Arctic. Briefly, his data confirm other studies showing
atmospheric transport of certain chemical contaminants to the
Arctic, where they are then transferred through the food web to
marine mammals. One unexpected finding was the presence of higher
concentrations of an organochlorine contaminant in Arctic waters
than in water from the lower latitudes. Dr. Muir's study also
found that seals from the Arctic had higher concentrations of
dioxin in their tissues than did seals nearer urban centers, where
contamination of the environment is much higher. Dr. Muir's presentation
clearly pointed to the importance of the issue of atmospheric
transport in the PICES region, and demonstrates that identifying
sources of the contaminants is an important facet in gaining a
better understanding of the scope of the issue of transboundary
transport of chemical contaminants. He also identified several
gaps in data, including the lack of temporal trend data in most
species, the limited information on the biological effects of
contaminants, the need to test additional biomarkers and test
for immunocompetence, and the need for comparisons of biopsy and
whole tissue samples for use in organochlorines and biomarker
monitoring.<BR>
<P>
Dr. James Carlton from the Maritime Studies Program at Williams
College (USA) addressed the issue of transboundary transport of
biological contaminants. Dr. Carlton provided an excellent overview
of the potential for introduction of exotic species to coastal
areas through the exchange of ballast water and sediments. He
noted that at any one moment there are 30,000 vessels and nearly
2,000 species in motion globally. The issue did not receive much
attention recently until a catastrophe, the invasion of the zebra
mussel into the Great lakes, which has brought about significant
biological and economic damage. Dr. Carlton noted the need for
further studies on the relationship between harmful algal blooms
and ballast water and on the costs of prevention vs. removal and
control of harmful species introductions, as well as the true
cost of decades of invasions. He also emphasized that although
transport of species has been going on for a long time, and although
steps are being taken now to address the issue, we can still expect
invasions to occur for the foreseeable future because it will
take time to develop scientific data and accrue effective international
policies, as well as to implement them. <BR>
<P>
The MEQ sessions presented a broad array of issues relating to
marine environmental quality, demonstrating the challenge of finding
a suite of endpoints and processes that can be studied by collaborators
from widely diverse fields, and that PICES can serve as a mechanism
to address these problems. One of the first steps needs to be
exploring possible routes of biological and physical transport
of contaminants to and throughout the North Pacific. Investigations
of the distribution and transport of contaminants between marine
ecosystems, from nearshore to offshore, and from one country's
coastline to another country's coastline, will help us to address
our ultimate goal: increasing our understanding of the processes
so that the magnitude of the impact of contaminants on biological
systems in the marine environment can be determined. <BR>
<P>
The convener of the MEQ session, Dr. Usha Varanasi, felt it was
also important to note that a key issue in marine environmental
quality is marine debris (such as plastics). Presentations for
this important topic were not sought for this meeting, because
there will be an International Meeting on Marine Debris in Miami,
Florida, in May, 1994.<BR>

<H1>1994 Report of Marine Environmental Quality Committee </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The MEQ Scientific Committee met in Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan, in
two sessions, held jointly with members of WG 2. Sessions were
held on Wednesday, October 19 and Thursday, October 20, 1994.
There were two new MEQ members from Japan (Prof. M. Shimizu and
Dr. T. Yoshida) and one from Canada (Dr. L. Harding). In addition,
MEQ welcomed our Russian colleagues as first-time participants,
with Drs. A. Tkalin and E. Shumilin attending as observers.</P>
<P>
Prof. J.Y. Zhou extended a welcome, and asked all present to briefly
introduce themselves and their backgrounds and interests. The
Chairman then set forth an outline of the agenda, and the meeting
was called to order.</P> 
<P>
Dr. M. Watson presented a brief synopsis of the history and evolving
scope of the MEQ Scientific Committee. This included summaries
of the two previous scientific meetings held in Victoria, B.C.,
Canada (1992), and Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. (1993). Discussions
included an overview of the key issues facing MEQ, especially
the continuing need to reach a consensus on the major environmental
effects issue upon which the MEQ should focus. Namely, the need
to select a given research site of common interest to all PICES
nations, and which will suitably address the issue of pollutant
transfer and impact; from the obvious pollutant sources of coastal
areas and marginal seas to the open North Pacific Ocean itself.</P>
<P>
Dr. R. Addison led a detailed discussion outlining the past and
present activities of WG 2.</P> <B>1993 WG 2 Report </B>
<P>
Prior to the Seattle 1993 MEQ meeting, WG 2 had been tasked with
identifying the major and unifying problems with marine environmental
quality in participating countries, and identifying knowledge
gaps. All four participating countries submitted comprehensive
scientific overview papers to WG 2, which clearly indicated that
their primary concerns were with pollution as a coastal problem,
rather than one involving the open ocean. WG 2 recommended that
MEQ organize a symposium on approaches being used to assess marine
pollution (at Nemuro in 1994), and also organize a practical workshop
at some future date, which would allow scientists to come together
and work on a common problem at a site (most likely in the Asian
North Pacific region) or concern to all PICES nations.</P> <B>1994
WG 2 Report </B>
<P>
WG 2 met in Tokyo on October 13-14, 1994, at the offices of the
Japan Environmental Agency. Its tasks were to (a) review the WG
2 terms of reference to ensure that they were still relevant,
(b) review and discuss a comparison of methods-based, performance-based
and assessment-based methodologies in the evaluation of pollution,
and (c) outline plans for the proposed technical workshop. Because
the WG 2 Tokyo meetings did not include members from all PICES
nations, there was reluctance among attending WG 2 members to
make decisions affecting the future workshop and symposium for
PICES IV. The 1994 WG 2 Report was presented and discussed as
a &quot;draft&quot;, rather than as a final document.</P> <B>Terms
of reference and future focus for WG 2 </B>
<P>
After extensive discussions, MEQ and WG 2 members agreed that
the future scientific membership of WG 2 should remain essentially
the same. However, the focus and terms of reference for WG 2 should
be narrowed toward a specific area in the western North Pacific
region which can satisfy various interests shared by all PICES
nations. Criteria for such a specific focal area would include:
a) the presence of a major and quantifiable long-term environmental
stressor(s), b) linkages between stressor-induced phenomena in
coastal regions with those in adjacent marginal seas and ultimately,
the open North Pacific Ocean itself, and c) the presence of suitable
baseline data relative to source, transport, and characterization
of pollutants and their associated biological effects.</P> 
<P>
Possible assessment methodologies and analytical tools:</P> 
<P>
Dr. Addison then gave an overview of three types of Quality Assurance
approaches for measurements made in assessing pollutant-stressed
ecosystems. It is, of course, essential that all approaches be
of high accuracy and thus comparable. These three approaches were:</P>
<P>
1. Methods-based, in which the same methods (e.g., GC/MS, HPLC
Fluorescence, etc.) are rigorously used by all laboratories to
improve comparability of the results generated in assessing perturbed
ecosystems.</P> 
<P>
2. Performance-based, in which the individual participating laboratories
use common standard reference materials to assess the accuracy
of the method used to generate the data (e.g., measurements of
chemicals in sediment), and as such the use of the same method
by each laboratory is not mandatory. These two approaches are
the major QA/QC paradigms that are commonly used by analytical
laboratories worldwide, and often both common methods and standard
reference materials are used to increase data quality and thus
intercomparability between laboratories.</P> 
<P>
3. Assessment-based comparisons, in which the interpretations
of the different data types from the various investigators are
compared. For example, one laboratory might measure mixed function
oxidase activities in livers from benthic fish inhabiting a pollution
gradient. Another laboratory might measure co-planar PCBs and
related chemicals in the fish tissue and/or in surrounding sediment,
while other investigators might examine liver slices of the fish
in question for histopathology, or perform tissue assays for excess
production of detoxifying proteins like ethoxyresorufin-oxy-deethylase
(EROD). Concurrently, other investigators might measure &quot;scope
for growth&quot; (SFG) in benthic invertebrates (e.g., mussels),
while others examine species diversity, or historical data on
extirpation of species. In this approach, a variety of different
analytical techniques and perspectives are used to assess a stressed
ecosystem, the criterion used to evaluate the accuracy of the
approach is whether the approach is effective at identifying a
gradient for the stressor perturbing the system. This approach
is gaining greater attention where the monitoring used primarily
biological rather than chemical endpoints.</P> 
<P>
Such approaches would bring to bear many of the current arsenal
of tools being utilized in &quot;analytic biology&quot;, in which
different disciplines attempt to assess how chemical contaminants
bring about biological change. Such tools allow us to look in
greater detail at the whole chain of events between the presence
of a stressor and its biological impact.</P> 
<P>
Various practical examples, where such assessment-based comparison
techniques were used, was discussed by Dr. Addison (industrial
contamination of Norwegian fjords) and Dr. Harding (relationships
between pollutants and the background of natural change driven
events which affect assimilative capacity). Dr. Stein briefly
discussed how valuable PICES can be to the study of transboundary
effects of marine pollution.</P> 
<P>
<B>MEQ symposium at the PICES Fourth Annual Meeting, Qingdao</P>
</B>
<P>
Selection of a common site for future study:</P> 
<P>
The comparative weaknesses and advantages of preferentially focusing
on various potential &quot;candidate areas&quot; in the North
Paicfic were discussed in detail. Potential areas included: Seto
Inland Sea, Puget Sound/Georgia Strait region, Tokyo Bay, Sea
of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Dalian Bay, and the East China and Yellow
Sea regions. The possibility of selecting more than one site,
e.g., one on either side of the North Pacific - was also discussed.</P>
<P>
The Yangtze Estuary and East China Sea:</P> 
<P>
Dr. P.K. Park recounted in detail the high degree of PICES commonality
exhibited by the East China Sea. A tremendous hydroelectric dam
- the &quot;Three Gorges Project&quot; - is to be built several
hundred kilometers inland on the Yangtze River, and it will be
the largest construction project in Asia since the Great Wall.
This dam will be the most important single environmental impact
on the East China Sea and its northern circulation pathways, including
the Sea of Japan. Construction will take from five to ten years,
and filling the huge impoundment will take approximately twenty
years. Dr. J.S. Gray stressed that the lessons we have learned
from the Aswan Dam clearly indicate that the two most critical
changes that will occur from the Three Gorges Project will be
altered sediment and nutrient fluxes. Potential transboundary
effects on the marine ecosystem will continue for centuries.</P>
<P>
Prof. Hirano presented an overview of the physical oceanography
and current flow in the East China and Yellow Sea region. Very
rich fishing grounds are located at the area where the Yangtze
empties into the East China Sea. He has modelled the estimated
riverine discharge from the Chinese mainland into the adjoining
seas at about 100,000 tons per second; with about 40,000 to 50,000
tons per second coming from the Yangtze. During the summer months,
the Kuroshio Current transports a significant portion of the massive
Yangtze freshwater contribution to the northeast, where it travels
upward off eastern Japan. Likewise in summer, other major portions
flow northward toward the Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea, and ultimately
into the Sea of Japan. In winter, the Kuroshio takes much of the
Yangtze influences toward the south - toward the southern Ryukyus
and Taiwan.</P> 
<P>
Prof. Hirano estimates the residence time for water in the east
China - Yellow Sea area at 100-200 days. Although the subsequent
residence time for the Sea of Japan is quite long - on the order
of 100 to 200 years - this water ultimately mixes with the North
Pacific and the Sea of Ohkotsk as it reaches northern Hokkaido
and the Kuril Islands. The East China Sea pathway thus provides
a good example for assessing linkages between impacts in coastal
areas and their transfer to marginal seas, and ultimately the
North Pacific.</P> 
<P>
<B>Focus of 1995 symposium and subsequent workshop</P> </B>
<P>
The most important theme upon which MEQ / WG 2 will focus for
the long term will be assembling information on how changes in
the Yangtze freshwater flow will affect such factors as: upwelling,
sediment flux, behavior of nutrients and contaminants, benthic
conditions, and biological perturbations in the East China Sea
and its various major pathways to the North Pacific. The 1995
PICES IV MEQ symposium should therefore be an overview of what
is known about the Yangtze area, including physical and chemical
oceanography, sedimentology, chemical pollutants, and biological
perturbations. In addition to invited papers, an extensive literature
review of the Yangtze-East China Sea will be required.</P> 
<P>
Dr. Gray enlarged upon the Three Gorges theme further by stressing
the benefit of studying such a colossal impact both before and
after its actual inception. This will give MEQ a baseline from
which to compare perturbations from the area, as the ongoing effects
of the dam are eventually and perhaps irrevocably manifested.
The East China Sea is also of great interest and value to all
PICES nations, and such a site would serve to bring relevant scientists
together for a common and mutually supportable goal. Through the
cooperative efforts of both China and Japan, the Yangtze and East
China Sea systems are fairly well characterized in terms of physical
and chemical parameters of waters and sediment at this time. However,
data on biota for the general area are lacking. This should be
an important component of MEQ's long term focus on the actual
impact of the chemical and physical stressors from the changing
Yangtze system.</P> 
<P>
Dr. Shumilin put forth the suggestion that we conduct the future
workshop from a research vessel, rather than from a land-based
site. Such an approach would facilitate access to, and sampling
of a suitable pollution gradient. In addition, every effort should
be made to coordinate our efforts with the builders and timetable
of the Three Gorges Project. Dr. Shumilin reinforced Dr. Gray's
prior comments that the Three Gorges Project will likely parallel
the type of environmental influences brought about in the Mediterranean
Sea as a consequence of building the Aswan Dam (which unlike our
planned effort in the Yangtze, unfortunately had no pre-construction
baseline data collected relative to marine environmental quality).</P>
<P>
MEQ recommended that the proposed future workshop on such a system
include predictive models, as well as incorporating remote sensing
and geographic information system (GIS) capabilities to follow
pollutant trends and fluxes entering the marine ecosystem as a
consequence of the massive Yangtze dam site. Along these lines,
Dr. Watanabe indicated that several major Asian countries are
currently amplifying their GIS capabilities, and Japan is planning
a major land use conference in the near future, to be coupled
with remote sensing themes. A remote sensing satellite is slated
to soon be established near Okinawa.</P> 
<P>
<B>Recommendations to the PICES Science Board</P> </B>
<P>
MEQ recommendations were twofold:</P> 
<P>
1. The MEQ Scientific Committee fully supported the WG 2 &quot;draft&quot;
report, and its subsequent review and refocusing by MEQ and WG
2 joint discussions during the business meetings. MEQ recommended
that the Science Board consider and implement the suggestions
presented previously in this report, relative to a) selection
of the western North Pacific as MEQ's major future focus over
the long term, and b) sponsorship of a scientific session at PICES
IV in Qingdao, to review and summarize appropriate existing scientific
information on this region, and especially the East China Sea
as MEQ's major focal point.</P> 
<P>
2. MEQ thoroughly considered the desirability of changing the
terms of reference of WG 2. After considerable discussion, MEQ
recommended that membership in WG 2 continue in its present form
until the conclusion of the practical workshop (now being planned,
and slated to occur in Asia within the next two to three years).
However, the focus and terms of reference of WG 2 should be redefined
to reflect our PICES III decisions to focus much more specifically
on the western North Pacific over the long term. The new terms
of reference should therefore be redefined as follow:</P> 
<P>
a. draft a work plan and an outline for a practical workshop on
the East China Sea, as recommended in the WG 2 &quot;draft&quot;
report of October 1994, and</P> 
<P>
b. organize and host a practical workshop, as described above,
by October 1997. The workshop will be designed to assess methodologies
and explore the feasibility of assessing observable biological
effects, at differing levels, along a selected stressor gradient
in the East China Sea.</P>

The MEQ Scientific Committee met in two sessions during PICES
IV in Qingdao, People's Republic of China. The first session was
held from 1500 to 1750 hours on Wednesday, October 18, 1995. Through
the courtesy of Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou and our Chinese hosts, members
and observers of MEQ were taken on a shipboard field trip the
next morning, to familiarize us with pollution sources and marine
resource utilization in Qingdao's Jiaozhou Bay. Following the
field trip, a concluding session was convened from 1330 to 1750
hours on Thursday, October 19, 1995.</P>

The MEQ SCientific Committee met in two sessions during PICES
IV in Qingdao, People's Republic of China. The first session was
held from 1500 to 1750 hours on Wednesday October 18, 1995. Through
the courtesy of Prof. Ming-Jaing Zhou and our Chinese hoss, members
and observers of the MEQ were taken on a shipboard field trip
the next morning, to familiarize us with polluton sources and
marine resource utilization in Qingdao's Jiaozhou Bay. Following
the field trip, a concluding session was convened from 1330 to
1750 hours on Thursday, October 19, 1995.</P> 
<P>
<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
The meeting began with Chairman Prof. J.Y. Zhou extending a welcome
to all. All present in the meeting room were asked to briefly
introduce themselves and their various backgrounds and interests,
and encouraged to actively participate and contribute as much
as possible in our various discussions and issues. The Chairman
then briefly set forth a general outline of the various agenda
at hand, and the meeting was called to order.</P> 
<P>
<B>Election of New MEQ Chairman<BR>
</B>
<P>
Because PICES by-laws limit the tenure of each scientific Committee
Chairman to a maximum of four years, it was necessary for MEQ
to elect a new Chairman at this time. The MEQ Committee unanimously
expressed its gratitude to Chairman J.Y. Zhou, for his past leadership
and his great pioneering efforts in marine pollution issues in
Asia and throughout the world. Further, MEQ unanimously urged
that he consent to remaining an active MEQ Scientific Member,
to assure our retention of his insight and knowledge.</P> 
<P>
As per the by-laws, the formal election process was witnessed
by PICES Executive Secretary Dr. W. Doug McKone, who had attended
this portion of the MEQ Session to provide administrative and
procedural assistance. Nominees for new Chairman included Drs.
Watanabe, Varanasi, and Addison. After thorough discussion and
deliberations, individual written ballots presented to Dr. McKone
revealed the selection of Dr. Richard F. Addison as the new MEQ
Chairman-Elect.</P> 
<P>
<B>Brief Review of the History and Prior Recommendations of the
MEQ Committee<BR>
</B>
<P>
For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the history of our marine
pollution efforts within PICES, rapporteur Dr. M. Watson presented
a brief synopsis of the history and evolving scope of the MEQ
Scientific Committee. Our first two meetings, held respectively
at Victoria, Canada (1992) and Seattle, U.S.A. (1993) were largely
focused on identifying common problems of marine pollution in
the North Pacific. From this, it soon became obvious that MEQ
must surmount the more &quot;oceanographically correct&quot; issue
of pollution of the &quot;open North Pacific Ocean&quot;, and
instead focus PICES resources toward the vastly more impacted
nearshore regions of coastal areas and marginal seas. These efforts
led to our MEQ symposium in Nemuro, Japan (at PICES III, 1994)
on &quot;Interdisciplinary Methodology to Better Assess and Predict
the Impacts of Pollutants on Structure and Function of Marine
Ecosystems&quot;. At Nemuro, the MEQ decided to narrow and refine
its focus, and to select a single perturbed marine ecosystem of
interest to all PICES member nations. The area chosen by MEQ was
the East China Sea, and especially the area impacted by its largest
river, the Changjiang (Yangtze).</P> 
<P>
With this in mind, MEQ also specifically identified pollution-mediated
phenomena in the East China Sea and Changjiang outflow system
as the theme for our MEQ symposium and Topic Session at the PICES
IV in Qingdao.</P>
<P>
Also at Nemuro, MEQ and Working Group 2 (WG 2; disbanded at PICES
III and refocused as WG 8) agreed to sponsor and conduct a two-to-three
week Practical Workshop, along a gradient outward from the Changjiang
into the East China Sea. Slated for 1997 or 1998, the workshop
would involve working scientists from all PICES member nations.
This would be a cooperative sampling and analysis effort along
a pollutant gradient extending out from the Changjiang estuary,
and designed to assess and predict degradative changes in the
marine ecosystem as a result of the construction of the massive
Three Gorges Dam approximately 500 kilometers upriver.
<P>
MEQ Chairman J.Y. Zhou then formally turned the meeting over to
Chairman-Elect Addison, who subsequently assumed responsibilities
for the remainder of our business meeting.
<P>
<B>Selection of a New Working Group 8 (WG 8) Co-Chairman, Overview
of the 1995 (WG 8) Meetings, and Recommendations for Implementing
MEQ's Proposed Practical Workshop(s)</B>
<P>
New WG 8 Co-Chairman; Dr. John E. Stein: Due to Dr. Addison's
assumption of his new leadership dutieswith MEQ, it was thus necessary
to select a replacement to continue his former responsibilities
as WG 8 Co-Chairman. The MEQ agreed to appoint Dr. John E. Stein
(Director, Environmental Conservation, NMFS /NOAA, Seattle, U.S.A.)
to fill this vacancy. Dr. Stein will serve as WG 8 Co-Chairman
along with Professor Mingjiang Zhou.
<P>
WG 8 Meetings at PICES IV: Dr. Addison then led a discussion about
the recent activities of the MEQ Scientific Working Group, WG
8. Just prior to PICES IV, the WG 8 convened in Qingdao on October
12-13, 1995, at the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. 
<P>
WG 8 Members in attendance were: 
<P>
Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou (China), Co-Chairman
<P>
Dr. Richard. F. Addison (Canada), Co-Chairman
<P>
Prof. You-Xian Yuan (China)
<P>
Dr. Colin D. Levings (Canada)
<P>
Dr. Brenda Sanders (U.S.A.)
<P>
Dr. Masataka Watanabe (Japan)
<P>
Prof. Makoto Shimizu (Japan)
<P>
Dr. Hisashi Yamada (Japan) 
<P>
The Proposed Practical Workshop(s): Building on PICES III's revised
Terms of Reference in chartering WG 8, Dr. Addison went on to
highlight WG 8's extensive discussions of the proposed MEQ plans
for holding a future Practical Workshop in a critical Chinese
Marine ecosystem. As outlined in Annex 4 of the 1995 WG 8 Report,
it was recommended that instead of first seeking to examine a
single, relatively massive area like the Changjiang estuary and
adjoining East China Sea, MEQ should consider a more stepwise
approach. This would involve two successive phases for the Practical
Workshop, rather than one. 
<P>
1. The first stage, targeted for 1997, could most logically be
an assessment of (for example) contaminant fluxes, productivity
levels, and/or biological perturbations in Qingdao's Jiaozhou
Bay (Yellow Sea). This effort would focus on preliminary logistics;
e.g., defining analytical and comparative methods, assembling
needed equipment and instrumentation, quality assurance, shipboard
needs, etc. Most importantly, this initial international study
of Jiaozhou Bay would be able to focus on the extensive data on
local marine ecosystems already available in the literature, as
well as utilize the locally existing network of marine scientific
research facilities and personnel.
<P>
2. A second, and much more comprehensive stage of the Practical
Workshop would be a preliminary assessment of the Changjiang estuary
itself, conducted along a preselected gradient in the East China
Sea as a contribution to baseline data for the Three Gorges Project.
<P>
Recommendation to create an &quot;Implementation Group&quot; within
WG 8, to plan and implement the Practical Workshop(s): As outlined
in Annex 4 of the WG 8 Report, Dr. Addison also explained that
WG 8 recommended that MEQ/WG 8 organize a small &quot;Implementation
Group&quot;; in effect, a subset of WG 8, which would be exclusively
responsible for planning and carrying out the Practical Workshop(s)
in China.
<P>
This session of the MEQ business meeting was then concluded, to
resume the following afternoon following our field assessment
trip to Jiaozhou Bay. 
<P>
<B>Introduction of Background Information on Jiaozhou Bay, via
MEQ Scientific Field Trip: Boat Tour to Assess Jiaozhou Bay</B>
<P>
From 0800 to 1200 hours on Thursday, October 19, 1995, the MEQ
Scientific Committee, attending members of WG 8, and observers
were taken on a special guided shipboard tour of Jiaozhou Bay.
MEQ greatly appreciates the efforts of Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou,
his colleagues at the Academia Sinica, the scientists at the Yellow
Sea Fishery Research Institute, the Chinese Government, and City
of Qingdao for making this tour possible.
<P>
After being bussed along Zhongshan Blvd. through the center of
downtown Qingdao to the Qingdao Harbour and Passenger Terminal
area, we boarded a special research vessel. We were then treated
to a three hour scientific tour of the bay, specifically focusing
upon the various mariculture and fishery uses, and how the Bay
is being directly impacted by pollution sources. The Bay is also
utilized as a major shipping facility.
<P>
Especially impressive were the extensive culturing operations
for bay scallop and macroalgae; some extending literally as far
as the eye could see across the Bay. We also were able to observe
many types and sizes of fishing and shipping vessels; some working
at close quarters to our route.
<P>
Numerous point sources of pollutant loading were observed first
hand. Some of these-all in very close proximity to each other
along the shoreline -- included a pulp mill, a large military
base, a military aircraft base, a metal smelting facility, a textile
mill, an organophosphate pesticide plant, extensive agricultural
runoff from a major river, and various other industrial sites.
Charts of the bay were provided for us on deck, and our many questions
about the ecosystem and its basic oceanography and biology were
answered by our thoughtful hosts as thoroughly as time and circumstances
would allow.
<P>
We are greatly indebted to Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou and our Chinese
hosts for making such a tour possible; such on-site experience
was indispensable for all attending scientists, allowing us to
familiarize ourselves with the area first-hand, thus ensuring
the best possible research and logistic design for our proposed
Phase One of the MEQ Practical Workshop. 
<P>
<B>Discussion of 1995 WG 8 Report</P></B> In general discussions
of the WG 8 Report, it was strongly suggested that each PICES
country be limited to a maximum of three scientists per Working
Group. Also, it was agreed that the idea of having two WG 8 Co-Chairmen
should be continued.
<P>
Annex 3 (Revised Terms of Reference for WG 8): Dr. Addison then
led a discussion of key points in the WG 8 Report, with initial
discussion focusing on Annex 3, in which minor changes were suggested
which would allow greater flexibility, especially in light of
our new proposal to focus our preliminary workshop on Jiaozhou
Bay (Yellow Sea). Specifically, this involved (a) removing the
language limiting the workshop solely to the &quot;East China
Sea&quot;, and (b) changing the proposed workshop research target
of &quot;..... along a selected pollutant gradient in the East
China Sea&quot; to read: &quot;.....along a potential gradient
of impact of anthropogenic activities&quot;.
<P>
Annex 4 (Proposed Terms of Reference for Implementation Group
for MEQ Practical Workshop): The Committee then discussed Annex
4 of the WG 8 Report. It was agreed that rather than establishing
another formal &quot;subcommittee&quot; to design and carry out
the Practical Workshop, a more workable approach would be to simply
create an informal &quot;Implementation Group&quot;, made up of
working scientists appointed by WG 8 /MEQ. This Implementation
Group would be responsible for &quot;scoping&quot; the framework
of the Workshop(s), including:
<P>
1. assembling existing data and literature on the chosen site(s),
<P>
2. describing techniques to be used,
<P>
3. the general design and schedule of the study plan(s),
<P>
4. identifying potential participants, 
<P>
5. logistic considerations, and 
<P>
6. ensuring the reporting of results. 
<P>
Workshop Implementation Group Membership: It was agreed that membership
in this informal Implementation Group shall consist of at least
one working scientist from each country, and that the group have
two Co-Chairmen. MEQ and WG 8 agreed to establishing such an Implementation
Group, with the following scientists as participating members:
<P>
Canada: Dr. Colin D. Levings
<P>
People's Republic of China:<BR>
Prof. Ming-Jiang Zhou (Co-Chairman)<BR>
Prof. You-Xian Yuan
<P>
Japan:<BR>
Dr. Shigeki Harada
<P>
Republic of Korea:<BR>
(although none has been formally named at this time, Dr. Addison
will ask Dr. Yang to nominate a candidate Korean scientist)<BR>
<P>
Russia Federation:<BR>
Dr. Alexander V. Tkalin
<P>
U.S.A.: Dr. John E. Stein (Co-Chairman)<BR>
Dr. Brenda Sanders<BR>
<P>
Funding for Workshop(s): It was agreed that sources of funding
is a very critical issue, and that this should be formally be
brought to the attention of the PICES Science Board. Dr. Addison
will also contact all MEQ members later in the year, asking for
specific suggestions as to how we might generate adequate funding
for our proposed workshop(s). 
<P>
<B>Review of MEQ Topic Sessions and Paper Sessions Presented at
the Fourth Annual Meeting</B>
<P>
The Qingdao PICES IV MEQ sessions were arranged and convened by
Prof. Jia-Yi Zhou, Dr. John Stein, and Dr. Richard Addison. This
year's symposium, which was recommended by MEQ at the PICES III
meetings in Nemuro, was entitled &quot;Sources, Transport, and
Impact of Chemical Contaminants&quot;. Six papers were presented
in the MEQ Topic Session (PICES Topic 5) held on Tuesday, October
17, and nine were presented at the MEQ Papers Session held on
Wednesday, October 18. Unfortunately, a few papers scheduled for
the sessions were not presented due to travel difficulties for
some of the invited authors.<BR>
<P>
MEQ is especially thankful to Prof. Rui-Yu Liu (President Emeritus,
Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology; and Senior Scientist,
Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for keynoting
our Topic Session with his presentation of a specially invited
paper, &quot;Impact of the Three Gorges Project on the estuarine
environment and living resources of the Changjiang River&quot;,
co-authored by Prof. J.Y. Liu. <BR>
<P>
All papers were relevant to the purposes of the symposium, and
could be divided into two basic groupings. One subset of papers,
mostly presented in the Topic Session, focused primarily on contaminant-related
phenomena in and around the East China and Yellow Sea regions.
The second subset, mostly presented in the Papers Session, focused
on problems and processes related to contaminants in other areas
of the North Pacific. A few papers also addressed scientific techniques
in identifying and assessing biomarkers in marine organisms exposed
to environmental stressors. All papers stimulated very useful
and fruitful discussion, and served us especially well in establishing
a more complete scientific understanding of basic contaminant-related
problems in the Yellow and East China Sea regions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Discussion of Future Work of MEQ Scientific Committee, and
the 1996 PICES /MEQ Sessions to be held at Nanaimo, B.C., Canada</B>
<P>
Considerable discussion was devoted to the proposed format and
scope of the 1996 MEQ activities at PICES V. The following key
points were agreed upon:
<P>
1. The MEQ Symposium topic for PICES V will be &quot;&quot;Processes
of Contaminant Cycling&quot;.
<P>
2. In addition to our traditional MEQ emphasis on harmful chemicals,
MEQ will co-sponsor, and consider, a joint session with the Biological
Oceanography Scientific Committee (BIO), to focus specifically
on &quot;Harmful Algal Blooms&quot; (HAB).
<P>
3. MEQ is also considering the possibility of a joint session
with Physical Oceanography (POC), which would focus on the question
of how regulation of freshwater discharges (e.g., via impoundments,
dams) affects the marine environment.
<P>
4. MEQ resolves that more attention should be given to the problem
of very long range transport of contaminants; especially long
range atmospheric transport across the Pacific (see MEQ Topic
5 paper by Gao, et al. 1995; p. 19 of Abstracts from PICES IV,
Qingdao) 
<P>
5. More emphasis should be devoted on benthic ecosystems, especially
benthic-pelagic coupling.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<TT>The meeting was opened by MEQ Chairman Dr. Richard Addison,
who welcomed all participants, and asked that each introduce themselves
and their affiliations/ research interests. The Chair then set
forth a general outline of the various agenda at hand. The proposed
agenda were unanimously accepted, and the meeting was called to
order.<BR>

<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>Presentation of WG8 Report:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>WG8 Co-Chair Dr. Stein reported on the progress of his Working
Group, which is tasked with planning and convening an MEQ Practical
Workshop in Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, People's Republic of China.
This workshop is aimed at harmonizing approaches among PICES countries
in assessing ecological impacts of pollution, by working together
on a single issue. The specific goal of the workshop is to assess
bioaccumulation and effects of contaminants in Jiaozhou Bay (&quot;contaminated&quot;
site), as compared to Laoshan Bay (&quot;reference&quot; site).
Although markedly different in their extent and types of pollutant
sources, both bays are heavily focused on mariculture and are
reasonably comparable in terms of oceanographic, sedimentation,
and biological characteristics. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The workshop also represents the first step leading to a much
larger scale project (Phase II) off the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary,
which will be conducted along a preselected gradient in the East
China Sea as a contribution to baseline data for the Three Gorges
Dam Project. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The PICES V WG8 meetings were convened October 11-12, at Pacific
Biological Station, Nanaimo, to review current progress and draft
a more specific work plan. Some of the more fundamental concepts
in the research design had been previously set forth out at a
preliminary ad hoc meeting of North American members of MEQ and
WG8, held in Seattle June 20. The Qingdao Practical Workshop will
take place in May - June of 1997, and will consist of three phases.
</TT>
<P>
<TT>First, a compilation of existing data and literature specific
to the Qingdao marine ecosystem will be performed. This effort
is currently in progress, directed by Dr. Levings with assistance
from a Chinese graduate student from Qingdao, currently studying
at the University of British Columbia. Concurrent with the literature
review, the variables to be measured will be finalized within
the research design.</TT>
<P>
<TT>The second phase, to begin in May, 1997, will be a field reconnaissance
survey in Qingdao, to assess the feasibility of sampling, and
to validate the sampling design. The reconnaissance will also
serve to confirm that all necessary equipment is available and
working, to field-test the sampling gear, and to set up the laboratory.
This preliminary work will continue for 1-2 weeks. Three or four
MEQ /PICES scientists of varying but complementary backgrounds
will work with the Chinese in this effort. It is suggested that
daily e-mail reports of the reconnaissance survey be sent out
daily to all workshop participants. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The third phase, scheduled for June, 1997, will be the actual
implementation of the Practical Workshop in Qingdao. Within a
week following the reconnaissance survey, the sampling design
will be refined as appropriate and sampling will begin. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The tentative design of the research will include the following
major points:</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Jiaozhou
Bay and the nearby Laoshan Bay (reference site) will be sampled
cooperatively by the MEQ international team of participating scientists,
with headquarters and facilities under the guidance and kind cooperation
of Professor Ming-Jiang Zhou, Academia Sinica. This cooperative
sampling and analysis phase will be carried out by up to 24 participants,
approximately four from each PICES member country.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Sediment
and benthic invertebrates will be the primary focus. Fish and
other vertebrates will serve as a secondary focus.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Jiaozhou
Bay benthos will be sampled at 5 - 7 sites, with the center of
the bay serving as an integrating site for comparative purposes.
Included in the peripheral sites--at a minimum-- will be specific
benthic grabs from gradients off an industrial site, an agricultural
runoff site, and an aquaculture site. </TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> At
the same time, studies of primary productivity will take place
in both bays, via an ongoing agreement between Japan and China.
Dr. Watanabe (MEQ Scientific Member and WG8 Member) is coordinating
this phase of the study with Dr. Harada, and Professor Ming-Jiang
Zhou.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> For
performing laboratory analyses of the various samples, four possibilities
were set forth:</TT>
<P>
<TT>(1) As many of the analyses as possible would be performed
cooperatively at the Institute of Oceanology in Qingdao. </TT>
<P>
<TT>(2) On a case-by case basis, certain types of analyses might
necessarily be performed at other PICES-participating laboratories
elsewhere in the Northwest Pacific. </TT>
<P>
<TT>(3) It may also be necessary to perform some highly specific
analyses at other locations outside PICES laboratories, with involvement
of participants as feasible, and </TT>
<P>
<TT>(4) certain specific analyses (e.g. otolith aging) which do
not require inter-laboratory cooperation could be done at any
convenient time and location later on.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Immediately
following the workshop, wrap-up meetings would also be held in
Qingdao. </TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Data
exchange and interpretation, and the formulation of preliminary
results would continue through summer 1997.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> At
PICES VI (October 1997), MEQ /WG8 will issue a preliminary report
to PICES.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> A more
complete series of review and discussion of our findings will
take place at PICES VII in October, 1998.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> Final
publication of the results in the scientific literature will be
rigorously pursued, as appropriate.<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT>Expected products of the Workshop will be: </TT>
<P>
<TT>(1) At the minimum, an improved understanding of the impacts
of pollution in Jiaozhou Bay.</TT>
<P>
<TT>(2) In addition, a &quot;synergistic&quot; output resulting
from a range of techniques and approaches applied to a single
issue of mutual research interest, and </TT>
<P>
<TT>(3) Probably most importantly, an improved appreciation of
the motivations, aproaches, needs and expertise of our MEQ /PICES
colleagues.<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>Discussion of WG8 Report
and Recommendations:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Stein's presentation stimulated considerable discussion
about the proposed Qingdao practical workshop.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Varanasi reminded the group that one of the original MEQ
goals for this exercise--the comparison of methodologies-- does
not appear to be adequately stressed by the proposal. Inter-calibration
and inter-comparisons among the various participating scientists
and laboratories will be of great benefit in sharing techniques
with all participating scientists, and will also generate data
which are more quality assured. MEQ agreed that it will be important
to do as much of the laboratory work as possible on location in
Qingdao, while we all able to benefit from working closely with
one another at a common facility.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Addison suggested that some of the tests, such as total
fluorescence for total hydrocarbons, would be relatively quick
and easy to do. For a few critical procedures, such as low level
GC /MS analyses for certain pollutant suites, &quot;Comet&quot;
assays, etc;, it may be necessary to ship samples or sample extracts
to other laboratories outside China. There was uniform agreement
that wherever possible, scientific and analytical work should
be done together as a group in Qingdao. Since the goal of the
Technical Workshop is the harmonization of techniques and methodologies
among PICES member scientists, it is critical that as many as
possible of the highly specialized and novel assessment techniques
be conducted as a team, and on site.</TT>
<P>
<TT>It was suggested that we view the possible sampling of marine
birds on an &quot;opportunistic&quot; basis. MEQ hopes that a
limited number of specimens of appropriate bird species birds
can be sampled. This will be dictated largely by the results of
the proposed reconnaissance survey, and local conditions during
the study period. Dr. McCain asked about the status of our proposed
sampling platform(s) in Qingdao. It was generally agreed that
Professor Ming-Jiang Zhou's facility at Academia Sinica would
easily be able to provide us with all necessary watercraft and
equipment with which to conduct reconnaissance and sampling.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Drs. Tkalin, Watson and others asked about obtaining proper
clearance and permission from the Chinese government prior to
the Workshop. As a point of clarification, Dr. Yang explained
the joint agreement which KORDI has with China, relative to conducting
research in Qingdao. He pointed out that as one of China's major
oceanographic and marine sciences research centers, Qingdao boasts
four different groups of marine scientists doing work with four
separate agencies. These are: (1) First Institute of Oceanography:
State Oceanographic Administration, (2) Academic Sinica (Dr. Ming-Jiang
Zhou, Director), (3) Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Center, and
(4) Ocean University of Qingdao. Each of these is a separate and
distinct agency /facility, and Dr. Yang's formal agreement for
joint research is with (1). </TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Yang, through his working knowledge of the various Qingdao
laboratories, commented very favorably on the high quality of
work and the level of instrumentation and capabilities at the
Academic Sinica (#2 above) in Qingdao. This laboratory routinely
performs ICP mass spectral analysis, and boasts many CTVs and
gas chromatographs. In his opinion, this laboratory is very complete.
Dr. Yang also favored the idea of bringing together 2-4 scientists
from each PICES country. He suggested that in order to best foster
the concept of inter-comparison among countries and laboratories,
we should do our best to bring everyone together to share techniques
on site, with as many techniques being performed together at Qingdao
as possible. He is also concerned about QA /QC, as is MEQ as a
whole.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Since PICES /MEQ is planning to conduct its workshop via the
facilities and courtesy extended to us by Professor Ming-Jiang
Zhou at the Academia Sinica, it is very important that MEQ PICES
make sure that the proper diplomatic channels have been contacted
within the Chinese government, and that our working agreements
are firmly and clearly established at all levels prior to commencing
the workshop. This issue is made more urgent in light of the current
lack of Chinese representation on the PICES Science Board. Consequently,
MEQ /PICES strongly urged that PICES Science Board and Governing
Council formally pursue this issue as soon as possible. MEQ also
recommended that the PICES Science Board and Governing Council
establish an agreement with the Chinese Government relative to
obtaining samples, and shipping some of these samples out of China.
MEQ also recommended that PICES establish a formal agreement with
the Chinese government regarding the release of scientific data
to interested global scientific and media parties, publication
in the world literature, etc.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Tkalin reminded all participants that these issues have
already been basically agreed upon, at least on an informal basis
by all participating MEQ /WG8 scientists involved. What remains
is to be certain that MEQ remind PICES of the critical importance
of continued high-level dialogue with our Chinese colleagues via
appropriate diplomatic channels, and that the Science Board and
Governing Council make sure that any possible diplomatic, regulatory
or export barriers are identified and cleared with the Chinese
government prior to our actual research.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Yang stressed the importance of meeting later to discuss
results; i.e., at PICES VI and VII. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Professor Hirano highlighted the need to obtain and study
existing data about the Jiaozhou and Laoshan Bay areas, and especially
data regarding current and historic human impacts on these two
marine ecosystems.<BR>
<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>Presentation and Discussion
of WG8 funding request for Jiaozhou Bay Workshop:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Addison reviewed the projected funding requirements set
forth by WG8, as necessary to carry out the practical workshop.
The original total estimated costs set forth by WG8 were $62000
($Can.). For the estimated 24 participating scientists from the
six PICES nations, this was designed to cover Travel ($20000),
Accommodation and Meals for 15 days ($36000), Supplies and Shipping
($5000), and literature review of the Jiaozhou Bay area ($1000).
</TT>
<P>
<TT>MEQ suggested that because of the need for a reconnaissance
survey prior to the sampling, the budget should be increased by
$4200 to support three scientists for an additional two weeks
in Qingdao prior to the Workshop. Also, although WG8 had factored
in no costs for laboratory facilities, MEQ suggested that $5000
be allocated for reimbursing Professor Ming-Jiang Zhou and Academia
Sinica for their laboratory supplies and other expenditures, in
appreciation of their role and services as MEQ's laboratory and
scientific coordination facility in Qingdao. These additions resulted
in a total estimated Workshop cost of $71200 ($Can.)</TT>
<P>
<TT>Chairman Addison went on to explain that of this total, PICES
Governing Council and Science Board will be formally asked by
MEQ to provide support at the level of $30000. This leaves $41200
to be generated by funding sources outside PICES per se, if the
practical workshop is to take place in may 1997 as planned. Dr.
Addison suggested that some of the more important vending sources
for us to contact would include: </TT>
<P>
<TT>(1) IOC, </TT>
<P>
<TT>(2) WESTPAC (which counts among its members Professor Jiayi
Zhou, former Chairman of MEQ /PICES), </TT>
<P>
<TT>(3) CETA, and </TT>
<P>
<TT>(4) the World Bank. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Tkalin indicated that the current Chair of WESTPAC is
Dr. Taira, at the University of Tokyo. Also, it is his understanding
that PICES has already allocated general funds for travel of Russian
and Chinese scientists to PICES research venues, and perhaps this
can be used in part to support our MEQ Practical Workshop.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Varanasi suggested that each MEQ member formally approach
their respective sponsoring Agencies, and ask that travel funds
be set aside for PICES- related research such as Jiaozhou Bay.
Perhaps the $30000 PICES funding can be used for leverage with
these various other PICES-nation agencies.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Professor Hirano suggested that we keep the workshop open
to the possibility of inviting a small number of non-PICES scientists,
in case such a need arises. For example, if WESTPAC were to help
fund the Practical Workshop, and wished to send a small number
of participating scientists, MEQ /PICES should be prepared to
accommodate them in our plan. <BR>
<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>Recommendations of MEQ
Committee to PICES Science Board:<BR>
</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>After much discussion, the MEQ formulated two recommendations
to the Science Board. These were:</TT>
<P>
<TT>1. The MEQ Committee accepts the report of WG8 and recommends
that PICES allocate $30k as its contribution to support the proposed
MEQ Practical Workshop in Jiaozhou Bay scheduled for May /June
1997, at the invitation of the Institute of Oceanology, Academic
Sinica, Qingdao, People's Republic of China. Total cost of the
Workshop is estimated at $71.2k.</TT>
<P>
<TT>2. The MEQ Committee recommends that PICES contact the proper
Chinese authorities to arrange all necessary approvals and permits
for conducting a cooperative scientific study (a &quot;Practical
Workshop&quot;) in May /June 1997.<BR>
<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>9. Other Business:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT><U>Pre-Workshop Timelines</U>:</TT>
<P>
<TT>Considerable discussion was generated about the need for the
WG8 Ad Hoc Implementation group to set up a timeline, and milestones,
for the process of gathering technical information and completing
other necessary preparatory steps toward carrying out the actual
Workshop. </TT>
<P>
<TT>It was agreed upon that a reasonable timeline for obtaining
essential preliminary background information about Jiaozhou and
Laoshan Bays would be December 1, 1996. This information would
consist of two parts: <U>Part
A</U> would include the completion of a review of published
scientific information in the bay (responsibility; Dr. Levings,
with the assistance of a graduate student familiar with Qingdao).
<U>Part B</U> would include
a summary of pollution sources which impact the bay(s), including
mapped information, point sources and quantities discharged, and
other locally relevant information about pollution sources (responsibility;
Professor Ming-Jiang Zhou). <BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><U>MEQ topics proposed for
PICES VI, Pusan, KOREA</U>:</TT>
<P>
<TT>Drs. Addison and Stein brought up the possibility of MEQ sponsoring
a joint symposium with BIO at PICES VI. A suggested topic would
be Harmful /Noxious Algal Blooms. It was agreed that MEQ will
participate with BIO in this proposed joint symposium, and that
the topic will be Harmful Algal Blooms.</TT>
<P>
<TT>Suggestions for PICES VI MEQ-sponsored paper and platform
topics included trans-boundary exchange of pollutants (air-sea
and land-sea exchange), the impact of human influence on nearshore
ecosystems, and impacts of aquaculture. </TT>
<P>
<TT>It was also stressed that in Korea, aquaculture, red tides,
and wetlands are extremely critical issues. This is especially
the case in highly industrialized areas like Chinhae Bay, which
adjoins the Korea Strait near Pusan. Korea suggested two titles:
Jiaozhou Bay, and General Topics. Under the General Topics, Korea
also suggested a session topic adressing the ecological functions
of coastal wetlands as filters for chemicals, and a session focusing
on the habitat value of wetland ecosystems. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Mindful that the charge of MEQ symposium at PICES V was &quot;Processes
of Contaminant Cycling&quot;, Mr. Harding suggested that MEQ could
continue to adhere to this general theme, while focusing on specific
sub-areas like boundary exchange, aquaculture, wetland ecosystems,
etc. </TT>
<P>
<TT>After much discussion, Dr. Addison then synthesized and summarized
MEQ's proposed topics for PICES VI as follow:</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> MEQ
will sponsor a joint symposium with BIO. Topic will be harmful
Algal Blooms.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> In
addition, MEQ will sponsor a session addressing interactions between
aquaculture and the marine environment.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> MEQ
will also continue to sponsor a session focusing on &quot;Processes
of Contaminant Cycling&quot;.</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>&lt;&gt;</B> At
PICES VI, MEQ will also generate and present a draft report of
preliminary results from the Jiaozhou Bay Practical Workshop,
as mentioned previously. <BR>
<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>10. Presentation by TCODE
Chair:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>MEQ was then given a brief presentation by Dr. Robin Brown,
Chairman of the PICES Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE).</TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Brown explained that the preliminary TCODE Inventory of
Long Term Time Series data, which is now available on the World
Wide Web Server via the PICES Home Page, represents a significant
area of progress for TCODE. Dr. Brown explained the various functions
of TCODE, and its specific physical and chemical oceanographic
data sets. </TT>
<P>
<TT>The main utility of TCODE is to provide a forum, especially
via the Worldwide Web, where scientists who are interested in
the various PICES-generated data can be in contact with those
who actually hold the data. </TT>
<P>
<TT>It was the general consensus of MEQ that at this time, it
is too soon to attempt to integrate MEQ data into TCODE. However,
the upcoming research proposed by MEQ in the Northwest pacific
(e.g., Jiaozhou Bay Practical Workshop, and the subsequent MEQ
research proposed for the mouth of the Changjiang, East China
Sea) would no doubt generate much valuable and interesting data
regarding marine pollution and biological effects. After peer
review and publication, these data should be very useful and relevant
to TCODE, and the PICES Web Site. </TT>
<P>
<TT>Dr. Stein suggested that MEQ explore this issue further via
a questionnaire, which will be sent out to MEQ membership by Dr.
Addison later in the year. We will then advise TCODE as appropriate,
and hopefully be able to eventually share various of our environmental
data from the North Pacific, after our MEQ Workshop and subsequent
activities have generated their results.<BR>
<BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT><B>11. Adjournment:</B></TT>
<P>
<TT>The MEQ Scientific Committee concluded its business meetings
for PICES V, and was adjourned by Dr. Addison at 1730 hours on
Thursday, October 17, 1996.<BR>

<B>3. Summary of Activities Prior To Annual Meeting</B> 
<P>
The Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) was formed as
a standing committee to replace WG 4 (Decision 94/S/4). PICES
requested that each nation provide two scientists, with specialties
in physical/ chemical oceanographic data and biological oceanographic
and fisheries data. The committee was formed and a chairman (Mr.
Robin Brown, Canada) appointed in the spring of 1995. Members
from Russia were appointed in August 1995, and members for Korea
were appointed in September 1995. 
<P>
The first meeting of TCODE was held in conjunction with the 4th
Annual Meeting in Qingdao. Prior to this meeting, the chairman
circulated a review of issues raised from WG 4 and the Science
Board. Comments were received from TCODE members and a summary
of the responses was distributed in August, 1995. A draft committee
report was prepared and circulated to all members in September,
prior to the Annual Meeting. 
<P>
<B>4. Summary of Meeting<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE meetings were held on the mornings of October 18 and 19,
1995. See Endnote 1 for attendance.<BR>
<P>
Observers included:
<P>
Mr. Skip McKinnell (Canada) <BR>
Prof. Y. Nagata (Japan)<BR>
Dr. V. Luchin (Russia)<BR>
Dr. V. Lobanov (Russia)<BR>
Dr. S. Varlamov (Russia)<BR>
The following members were unable to attend the meeting:
<P>
Dr. L. Bocharov (Russia) (attended PICES meeting, but was absent
due to illness)<BR>
Dr. Kee Soo Nam (Korea)<BR>
Mr. William Shaw (Canada)<BR>
Dr. Jim Swift (U.S.A.) (represented by Dr. T. Royer)<BR>
Dr. Tadao Tatsuno (Japan)<BR>
<P>
<B>5. Operation of TCODE<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Committee reviewed progress to date and discussed the possibility
of additional committee meetings between PICES annual meetings.
The Committee recognized that travels costs were a substantial
barrier for all members and agreed that members would meet only
once each year, during the PICES annual meeting, with the bulk
of the Committee's work to be carried out by correspondence. The
committee noted that most representatives have access to electronic
mail and this service would be available to all members in the
near future. <BR>
<P>
The Committee agreed that while most of the business can be conducted
by correspondence, attendance by representatives at the Annual
Meeting was very important. If TCODE members are unable to meet
and discuss issues arising from the Science Committees, TCODE
will be unable to react to these important issues in a timely
manner and undesirable lags in activities may result.<BR>
<P>
The working relationships with various Science Committees and
Working Groups was discussed. TCODE recommends that a TCODE member
should attend WG and Science Committee meetings when appropriate
to report on TCODE activities and to report back to TCODE on the
relevant issues raised. TCODE members agreed to share the responsibility
for this activity to minimize costs. 
<P>
<B>6. Issues Discussed </B>
<P>
<B>6.1 WG 4 Recommendations:</B>
<P>
4.2.1 -Visit international agencies to review data holdings <BR>
4.2.2 - Create master inventory for the PICES region<BR>
4.2.3 - Continue development of the Healey et al (1985) report
<BR>
<P>
TCODE members considered these recommendations together. TCODE
supports these goals, but recognizes some serious difficulties
in attacking these recommendations directly. In addition, the
PICES Secretariat has experienced some difficulty in updating
the information in the Healey et al report. The strategy suggested
is as follows:<BR>
<P>
1. establish links with the key agencies who are responsible for
the data holdings of interest in the area. This entails creating
descriptions of the data holdings, distribution procedures and
key contacts for each agency and distributing this information
among PICES scientists as a short term solution for data exchange.
<P>
2. enlist the support of these agencies in the exchange and inventorying
of relevant datasets and information. These agencies frequently
have the staff and experts available to support data exchange
functions.<BR>
<P>
3. PICES should create &quot;links&quot; among these organizations
so that PICES scientists can retrieve the data that they require.
We recommend setting up a PICES data directory or set of &quot;pointers&quot;
to these agencies using the World Wide Web (WWW) on the Internet.
The concept here is to provide access to the primary data holder,
rather than duplicating the holdings within PICES, where possible
and practical. This many prevent some of the serious problems
of maintenance and synchronization that result when portions of
data holdings are duplicated. The issue of maintenance and updating
is important. PICES should carefully consider how it will maintain
any datasets that it takes direct responsibility for the distribution
and maintenance of. The resulting links will form a &quot;virtual&quot;
inventory, rather than a physical, &quot;standalone&quot; inventory.
<BR>
<P>
TCODE strongly supports the recommendation that PICES representatives
visit or contact national and international science organizations
to review data inventories and data exchange functions. TCODE
members noted the importance of establishing lists of organizations,
holdings, contacts and procedures as a necessary early step in
data exchange. The members were concerned about the potential
for large travel costs and have requested that these visits be
carefully planned and coordinated with other travel, wherever
possible. Each visit should result in a trip report which summarizes
the findings and is broadly distributed. Dr. Miyata (PICES Secretariat)
will undertake the first of these visits to Korea following the
Qingdao meeting. TCODE members will assist in providing names
of organizations and contacts and coordinating visits within their
own country. 
<P>
<B>6.2 WG 4 Recommendation 4.2.4 Detailed Survey of Research Cruises</B>
<P>
The creation of an inventory of recent and proposed cruises in
the PICES region is strongly supported by TCODE. TCODE notes that
there are already existing formats and conventions for such reports
and recommends that these be adopted. Adopting existing standards
and formats will reduce the burden on the information providers
and will allow users to create Cruise Summary Reports (CSR) using
software provided by ICES/IOC. <BR>
<P>
The creation of a ship schedule &quot;notice board&quot; is also
supported. This would allow PICES scientists to explore the possibilities
of joint projects or sampling using planned cruises from other
nations. It will be a challenge to gather this information well
in advance of the scheduled cruise date. The IOC has an existing
system for exchanging this information (the National Oceanographic
Program - NOP) which contains much of the required information.
We also note that the University National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) in the United States has an electronic ship schedule
available on the Internet. 
<P>
<B>6.3 WG 4 Recommendation 4.3.2 - PICES enter into joint ventures
with other Data Centers to produce CD-ROMs of important dataset
(e.g. OWS PAPA).<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE supports this activity, so long as it does not duplicate
any related activity at one of the existing data centers. We feel
it is more important to ensure that data from PICES nations is
migrated quickly and efficiently to the existing national centers
and to ensure that the links amongst the national and world data
centers are operating well. TCODE feels the strategy for publication
of important datasets should be (in order of priority):<BR>
<P>
a. migrate data to world or regional centers so that the data
are included in the existing products (for example, we feel it
is important to migrate CTD and water property data to WDC-A in
Washington to be included in the World Ocean Atlas product which
is being produced by WDC-A; we also note that JODC has recently
published a similar volume to temperature profiles of the Pacific
on CD-ROM).<BR>
<P>
b. where there is no existing or planned data product offered
by national, regional or world data centers, PICES should encourage
an existing data center to undertake this task.<BR>
<P>
c. PICES should undertake publishing, distribution and maintenance
of datasets when options a) or b) are unavailable or will take
too long to complete. PICES might well serve as a temporary distribution
center for datasets which will eventually be included in other
products/databases or for datasets which cannot find a suitable
&quot;home&quot; elsewhere. PICES (through the efforts of the
Secretariat and TCODE) should take an active role in &quot;advertising&quot;
and distributing information on datasets that are useful to the
PICES members. Mr. Skip McKinnell (Pacific Biological Station,
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada) has created such a
dataset for distribution by PICES. This dataset (and accompanying
Technical Report) contains zooplankton data from Ocean Weather
Station PAPA from the 1950's to the 1980's. 
<P>
<B>6.4 Science Board Recommendation 94/S/5 - Joint PICES/NPAFC
task group on fisheries data<BR>
</B>
<P>
The goal of the proposed task group was to assemble the historical
INPFC catch summary statistics in a convenient, electronic form
for distribution to the scientific community. The arrangements
for this are still in the hands of the Secretariat and it is not
yet clear what the role of TCODE might be. <BR>
<P>
<B>6.5 Science Board Recommendation 94/S/6 - Translation of TINRO
inventories of scientific surveys <BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE was to review these publications and comment on the utility
and importance of translation of such inventories. Members found
such inventories to be useful, but represent an interim step towards
on-line inventories of oceanographic and fisheries data. Such
on-line inventories can reduce the costs of distributing this
kind of information and can allow users to form specific requests.
<P>
<B>6.6 Science Board Recommendation 94/S/7 - PICES-GLOBEC Climate
Change and Carrying Capacity Program<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE members recognize the importance of coordination of data
management and exchange for this program. The TCODE Chairman is
a member of the Implementation Panel. TCODE should take an active
role in providing access to basin-scale datasets for model input
and retrospective analysis. In response to a request for information
on long term time series, TCODE proposes to assemble and electronic
inventory of such data for the PICES area. 
<P>
<B>6.7 Science Board Recommendation 94/S/1 - Electronic networks
and bulletin boards <BR>
</B>
<P>
The PICES Secretariat has recently purchased a computer to serve
as a World Wide Web (WWW) server for PICES. TCODE strongly supports
this strategy. The exploitation of the WWW strategy, which involves
creating &quot;links&quot; to other locations/datasets/information
resources is consistent with the TCODE recommendations with respect
to data exchange - we should be exploiting the facilities, holdings
and expertise of existing data centers whenever possible. In this
view, much of the PICES data distribution function could be provided
by building clear, concise web documents that describe the various
available data sources and how to get data from these locations.
In many cases, there will be an actual hypertext link that will
take the user from a PICES web page to other existing web pages
(e.g. NODC/WDC-A, MEDS, JODC etc.). This will prevent duplication
of information (the user is automatically &quot;moved&quot; to
the real data source) and reduce the requirement for maintenance
and updating of datasets and information on the PICES system.
Automated distribution (via ftp) of data files can also be accomplished
using this system. Access to WWW is not universal in the PICES
region, so it will be necessary for the PICES secretariat to maintain
a separate &quot;digest&quot; or summary of the contents and a
method of &quot;ordering&quot; documents and/or data files by
mail. The summary of the current contents of the PICES web pages
should be include in any future mailings to the PICES information
distribution list. In time, this requirement may<B> </B>be become
unnecessary. 
<P>
<B>7. Summary of Progress Made on Terms of Reference</B> 
<P>
<B>7.1 Recommend formation of ad hoc task groups to deal with
specific functions of TCODE<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE does not recommend the formation of Task Groups at this
time. The activities planned by TCODE will be carried out by the
committee of the whole. 
<P>
<B>7.2 Review progress of task groups and provide Annual Reports
<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE held its first meeting at the PICES 4th Annual Meeting in
Qingdao. The report describes the activities of the committee
since formation (Spring, 1995). 
<P>
<B>7.3 Develop strategic plans to meet these requirements<BR>
</B>
<P>
The TCODE strategic plan for PICES data management has the following
elements:
<UL>
<LI>use existing national/international data centers, programs
and techniques wherever possible 
<LI>encourage migration of data to these existing data centers
<LI>assist PICES scientists to locate and obtain data of interest
<LI>use the WWW/Internet system to provide information and provide
&quot;pointers&quot; to important agencies or institutions
<LI>provide a &quot;home&quot; and active distribution system
for datasets that are not available elsewhere 
</UL>
<P>
<B>7.4 Identify the data management needs of PICES<BR>
</B>
<P>
PICES scientists require access to data in the following subject
areas:
<UL>
<LI>ship schedules and cruise reports
<LI>meteorological data 
<LI>physical and chemical oceanographic data
<LI>biological oceanographic and plankton data
<LI>fish catch and distribution data
<LI>fish &quot;biology&quot; data (length, condition etc.)
<LI>commonly used environmental indices (PNA, El Nino etc.)
<LI>birds and marine mammal distribution and abundance data
<LI>marine environmental quality data 
<LI>remote sensing data 
</UL>
<P>
In addition, TCODE should distribute information on software &quot;tools&quot;
for the analysis and processing of these datasets. 
<P>
<B>7.5 Advise PICES Secretariat on its data management activities
<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE has been active in advising the PICES Secretariat in data
management activities including:
<UL>
<LI>advising on the installation and configuration of the PICES
WWW server
<LI>advising on information-gathering visits to other agencies.
The first of these visits will be to Korea immediately following
the PICES 4th Annual Meeting)
<LI>in the coming year, TCODE members will be expected to contribute
information material for the PICES WWW server. 
</UL>
<P>
<B>8. Recommendations</B> 
<P>
<B>8.1 Ship schedules<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE recommends that all PICES members submit cruise plans for
cruises or surveys in the PICES area to the PICES Secretariat
for distribution. The preferred format for such plans is the IOC
National Oceanographic Program (NOP) format, but other formats
will be acceptable. Where possible, the PICES WWW servers will
provide links to other cruise schedule posting areas (e.g. UNOLS
ships schedule page). Members should include all cruises/surveys
that are of broad interest to the PICES members and special purpose
coastal or inshore cruises may be omitted. TCODE members from
each PICES nation will ensure that the schedules are submitted.
<P>
<B>8.2 Cruise Reports<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE recommends that all PICES members submit cruise summary
reports (CSR) to the PICES Secretariat for distribution. These
cruise reports are an important source of information on recent
sampling activities and data that is not yet available from national
or international data centers. The preferred format for such reports
is the ICES/IOC CSR format (formerly known as ROSCOP). Members
should include all cruises/surveys that are of broad interest
to the PICES members and special purpose coastal or inshore cruises
may be omitted. TCODE members from each PICES nation will ensure
that the reports are submitted. 
<P>
<B>8.3 Master Inventory / Directory of data holdings<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE recommends that PICES begin to assemble a master inventory
or directory that describes (in general terms) the relevant data
holdings of agencies and institutions in the PICES area. TCODE
members will provide this information for distribution on the
PICES WWW server. 
<P>
<B>8.4 Inventory of long term time series<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE recommends that PICES assemble and distribute an inventory
of long term time series of meteorological, oceanographic and
fisheries data that are of broad interest to the PICES members.
TCODE members will assemble such an inventory for distribution
using the PICES WWW server as well as by printed copy (on request).
Where possible, links will be established to the agencies that
hold and distribute these data. 
<P>
<B>8.5 Relationships with other committees and Working Groups</B>
<P>
TCODE recommends that TCODE be invited to provide a representative
to relevant meetings of other groups, to report on TCODE activities
and to report data requirements and issues to TCODE at the earliest
opportunity. Such a mechanism will help to minimize delays in
reacting to requirements of these committees. TCODE representatives
have agreed to make every attempt to attend such meetings when
they are held in their own country. This will minimize travel
costs.<BR>

<H1>1996 Report of Technical Committee on Data Exchange </H1>
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<HR><BR><P>
The Technical Committee on Data Exchange met on October 11, 12
and 17, 1996 under the Chairmanship of Mr. Robin Brown. A provisional
agenda and supporting documents had been circulated prior to the
meeting. Dr. William Karp and Mr. William Shaw agreed to act as
rapporteurs (see endnote 1 for participants). <BR>
<P>
Mr. Brown opened the meeting and welcomed the participants. The
agenda was reviewed and additional items (11, 12, 13 and 14) were
added to the agenda.<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>Review of TCODE Work Plans and Science Board recommendations
<BR>
</B>The committee reviewed the Science Board recommendations and
noted acceptance of the TCODE strategic plan for data management.
The committee noted that the preliminary TCODE Inventory of Long
Term Time Series data, which is now available on the PICES Web
Server represents a significant area of progress for TCODE. <BR>

The Chairman gave a short summary of these meetings. Detailed
reports on these meetings were circulated earlier with the supporting
documents for the meeting.<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>The role of the PICES Secretariat in supporting TCODE activities</B>
</OL>
<P>
The committee discussed and outlined TCODE expectations in support
of TCODE activities. The committee listed the following expectations
of the Secretariat: 
<UL>
<LI>maintenance of the WWW server and introductory &quot;pages&quot;,
including corrections and updates to documents as requested by
TCODE.
<LI>the Secretariat shall be responsible for distributing paper
copies of WWW documents and database reports from the Inventory
of Long Time Series. The responsibility for development and population
of this database remains with TCODE for the present.
<LI>The Secretariat will distribute a summary of the long term
time series with &quot;broadcast&quot; messages (paper and email).
</UL>
<OL>
<LI><B>&quot;PICES Perspectives&quot; and Communication Strategy
<BR>
</B>There was an active discussion of some of the issues raised
in Dr. Wooster's &quot;PICES Perspectives&quot; and the Communication
Strategy paper produced by the Secretariat. 
<UL>
<LI>TCODE members supported the observation that committee members
who are appointed by their governments to PICES committees find
it difficult to represent all the relevant institutions within
their country and often are limited to representing the views
of their own home institution. This problem is more severe in
some countries than in others, depending on the number and structure
of agencies/institutions involved. Some members reported that
they felt they did not have the real mandate to represent other
institutions (i.e. commit them to action items) while other members
found it difficult to find the time to consult and gain consensus
within their country. TCODE members did not provide any additional
suggestions to overcome this problem. 
<LI>TCODE members supported the observation that committee members
find it difficult to fully participate in their PICES committee
activities. The Chairman noted that this TCODE meeting had no
representatives from Korea or China. Travel costs were certainly
a problem for delegates from China and Russia this year. It is
not clear what is limiting participation from Korea, although
internal reorganization of government agencies and other (higher)
priorities may be a problem. Governments need to reaffirm their
commitment to fully participate in PICES activities and provide
the necessary support to enable this.
<LI>TCODE has not found that communications technology is the
major impediment to progress in achieving its goals. Taking a
leading-edge approach in this area will be expensive to implement
and maintain and could create additional communications problems
(and stratification) within the PICES community. TCODE suggests
that it is premature to form such a communications committee..
<LI>TCODE strongly support Secretariat's initiative on the questionnaire
on internet access and TCODE members would like to review and
comment on the results when completed. It will be important to
gather responses from PICES participants who are unable to attend
this annual meeting to complete the survey. We feel that it may
be more appropriate to set up some Communications Task Team following
the review of the results of the questionnaire.<BR>
</UL>
<LI><B>TCODE operations - suggestions for improvements, areas
of focus etc.</B>
<UL>
<LI>As noted in the &quot;PICES Perspectives&quot; discussion
above, full participation by all TCODE members continues to be
a problem. Most of the work of TCODE is done between meetings
by email and fax correspondence, but members felt that the annual
meetings were very important in improving communications and building
commitment to work on these tasks. 
<LI>As noted above, TCODE members found it difficult to represent
all agencies/institutions in their country on TCODE issues. Some
members feel they do not truly have the required mandate or support
while others find it difficult to find the time required to consult
with and integrate the views of all the parties. Each nation needs
to develop a strategy for dealing with these problems. 
<LI>We reviewed meeting strategy with a view to increasing participation.
After considerable discussion, it was agreed that one meeting
per year, immediately before the annual meeting was best option
(even though it makes for a long meeting). This was considered
to be the most cost-effective and efficient option and was most
likely to result in maximum participation. Unless the PICES nations
reinforce their support for delegates, we anticipate continued
problems with participation, especially where trans-Pacific travel
is required. 
<LI>Communication problems were considered to be a minor irritant,
although these are continuing problems with reliable email and
fax connections to some member countries.. It is our understanding
that the barriers to improvements in this area are primarily financial,
not technical. We also understand that major improvements in email
access to Qingdao and Vladivostok are planned for the coming year.
</UL>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>TCODE needs to work more closely with other committees and
Working Groups to develop appropriate tasks with achievable goals.
There are serious practical limitations to the type, size and
complexity of tasks which TCODE can take on. On the other hand,
TCODE can develop strategies to support and promote activities
that are taking place in various PICES which are focused on the
data exchange/management problems recognized by PICES. The Bering
Sea fisheries/oceanography meta-database proposal (see agenda
item 6) is an example of how this can be achieved.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<OL>
<LI><B>Bering Sea Fisheries Oceanography database on WWW</B>
</OL>
<P>
Dr. B. Megrey (NMFS, U.S.A.) described his proposal for a Bering
Sea Fisheries Oceanography Meta-database for the World Wide Web.
This is a proposal that has been submitted for funding from the
ESDIM (Earth Sciences Data and Information Management) program.
During the development of this proposal, Dr. Megrey consulted
with TCODE members (and other PICES participants). As a result
of these consultations, the scope of the original project (eastern
Bering Sea only) was expanded to encompass the entire Bering Sea.
Linkage to PICES activities/projects (like the inventory of long
term time series and the Bering Sea Working Group) was used in
the justification for the utility and importance of the proposed
database.<BR>
<P>
TCODE members strongly supported this initiative. If funded, it
will bring significant resources to data inventory problems and
challenges previously addressed by TCODE. The committee agreed
to assist Dr. Megrey in soliciting international support for the
project and in identifying data sources and key contact persons
within their countries.<BR>
<P>
Dr. Megrey expects that an announcement from the ESDIM program
on funding for this project will be made before the end of 1996.
<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>TCODE inventory of long term time series</B>
</OL>
<P>
Members reviewed the progress to data on the Inventory (now available
on the PICES WWW server) and found the format and contents useful.
The Chairman agreed to prepare a short article for the next PICES
Press newsletter that will describe the Inventory and the methods
for gaining access (WWW and printed copies on request from the
PICES Secretariat). Dr. Bychkov (PICES Secretariat) confirmed
that the Secretariat was prepared to distribute printed copies
on request.<BR>
<P>
There was considerable discussion on apparent &quot;gaps&quot;
in the contents. Dr. Kobayashi reported that he has circulated
information on how to access the Inventory on the WWW, samples
of the existing entries and a request for contributions to various
fisheries scientists in Japan and was expecting contributions
soon. Dr. Nam (Korea) has written to the Chairman promising contributions
from Korea in the coming year. Dr. Royer (U.S.A.) offered to assemble
additional entries for the Meteorology section. Mr. Shaw (Canada)
offered to create entries that describe the historical archive
of fisheries data in the INPFC/NPAFC documents. In addition, Mr.
Shaw offered to review the contents of the Healey report and create
additional entries (as required) from this report. All members
agreed to take steps to &quot;promote&quot; the use of the on-line
database within their own country. The committee strongly supported
the strategy that TCODE members prepare a short description of
the PICES web server and the on-line database (with examples)
in the working language of the country for distribution. <BR>
<P>
Following presentations on the Inventory of Long Time Series,
the Chairman agreed to forward copies of the &quot;worksheet&quot;
and instructions to the Chairman of WG 11 (Sea Birds and Marine
Mammals) and the Marine Environmental Quality committee for collection
of addition entries in the categories of sea birds, marine mammals
and contaminants.<BR>
<P>
TCODE agreed to maintain responsibility for additional entries
and corrections for the next year. The Chairman will provide PICES
with updated versions of the underlying database and web documents
periodically. PICES Secretariat should forward all comments, additions
and requests for corrections to the TCODE Chairman. During discussions
over maintenance of the database, Dr. Megrey suggested an additional
field for the email address of the custodian, so that an automated
process could be set up to prompt custodian for comment on updating
or correction of the entries. The Chairman agreed to undertake
this minor modification. <BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>IOC Ocean Pilot Service</B>
</OL>
<P>
A short discussion was held on the IOC (International Oceanographic
Commission) Ocean Pilot Program, based on supporting documents
circulated before the meeting. This is an attempt to create a
master index of important web sites/resources for oceanography
throughout the world. The Chairman agreed to contact IOC and obtain
further information on how PICES could be linked to this program
or make a contribution. Additional information on this will be
circulated to the committee following correspondence with IOC.
<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>Report on the PICES Vladivostok meeting - Workshop on the
Okhotsk Sea and Adjacent areas.</B>
</OL>
<P>
Discussion was held over various recommendations from this Workshop
which directly or indirectly make requests of TCODE. The following
items were discussed:
<UL>
<LI>TCODE assistance requested in obtaining high resolution (1-2
decibar) CTD data in the Oyashio and Mixed Water regions
</UL>
<P>
Chairman to notify WG Chair to ensure they are familiar with existing
data sources (JODC archives, TINRO archives/inventory) and seek
clarification on the problem. Dr. Kobayashi reported that high
resolution CTD data from Japan Fisheries Agency cruises may not
be submitted to JODC -(perhaps data at standard depths only are
transferred). Dr. Tatsuno (JODC) to comment of possibility of
adding high resolution data to JODC archive, if required.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>high resolution (0.25 deg) seasonal ocean climatology - will
require an international effort to aggregate and manage physical
and chemical oceanographic data. 
</UL>
<P>
This is indeed a daunting task! It is not clear that there are
sufficient data for a climatology at this scale. The Chairman
agreed to forward this request to Dr. Syd Levitus for comments
and suggestions.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>working group to collate all information on catch, size and
age for pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk
</UL>
<P>
The TINRO catalog of recent data from this area (and others) is
available from the PICES Secretariat or TINRO. . All data on fish
catch, size etc. Will be in the hand of agencies in Russia (no
other PICES nations will have any significant data holdings in
this area).
<UL>
<LI>TCODE to consider amassing the data necessary for the special
process-oriented studies. Complete data inventories from relevant
institutions and individuals needs to be identified. It is recommended
that TCODE takes an initiative to solve these problems.
</UL>
<P>
Dr. Zuenko reports that much recent existing data is available
in electronic form from TINRO, HydroMet Institute and Academy
of Sciences. An inventory of recent data from TINRO is available
from TINRO or the PICES Secretariat. Additional historical data
are available in paper form in Russia and could be convert to
electronic form if funding were available. The Chairman noted
that the current contributions from Russia to the inventory of
long time series were restricted to TINRO. TCODE representative
from Russia need complete entries for other major labs and institutions.
TCODE feels that is its a reasonable request to improve descriptions
of data holdings at the key institutions, but actually assembling
the data into a standard format or database is beyond our current
abilities. These activities could be coordinated with the work
of Dr. Syd Levitus at WDC-A.<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>TCODE participation at the Science Board</B>
</OL>
<P>
TCODE members felt that it would be advantageous to have the TCODE
Chairman available to discuss recommendations and relate issues.
TCODE members also agreed to attempt to attend meetings of other
WG on behalf of TCODE when it is practical to do so and where
travel costs will not be a barrier.<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>Ship Schedules</B>
</OL>
<P>
At the 1995 meeting, TCODE agreed to undertake publication and
distribution (via WWW) of ship schedule information. The Science
Board requested that we review our proposal for a minimal ship
schedule database and merge it with a more extensive model suggested
by the Secretariat. 
<P>
There was extensive discussion about utility and practical problems
associated with establishing this service. The Chairman also reported
on correspondence with the University of Delaware personnel who
operate the a similar system for proving ship schedule information
worldwide. The University of Delaware people offered to assist
in any way (up to and including doing on PICES behalf). They pointed
out that the task was not trivial (which TCODE members had discovered
when attempting to assemble this information themselves) and that
timeliness was critical if the system was to be useful in identifying
opportunities for sharing ship time. This suggests there is no
place for a &quot;tiered&quot; system for assembling ship schedule
information (collated in member countries, forwarded to PICES,
collated at PICES, forwarded to Univ. of Delaware). <BR>
<P>
The University of Delaware people suggest they would deal directly
with the fleet operators, if PICES/TCODE would help in identification
of the contact points for the fleet operators. TCODE members also
suggested that it would be important to be aware of the planning
cycles in the various countries, so that updates could be requested
at the appropriate interval for each country. Members also noted
that information on charter vessels was also important and was
frequently missing from such databases.<BR>
<P>
TCODE recommend that PICES take advantage of the offer from the
University of Delaware and TCODE assist by identifying the important
vessel/fleet operators in each country. Responsibility for reminding/harassing
the fleet operators for updated ship schedules is to be clarified
with the University of Delaware personnel. <BR>
<P>
<B>12: Cruise Reports.<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the previous meeting, TCODE agreed to attempt to assemble cruise
reports for recent cruise by PICES members, and post these on
the PICES web site. Some minimal progress was made, but the results
were unsatisfactory. There was no indication that this was useful
to PICES participants (although no data on &quot;hits&quot; to
this page were collected).<BR>
<P>
JODC archives and distributes cruise reports (via a WWW site)
for the IOC-WESTPAC area, which provides an important source of
information. TCODE members felt a more rewarding strategy might
be to establish links on the PICES WWW site to existing data centers
and agencies who are managing data from large programs (such as
WOCE, JGOFS, GLOBEC etc.). These project sites often have cruise
reports available and submission of reports is often a condition
of funding. PICES participants who do not have access to WWW could
request that the PICES Secretariat or a TCODE member undertake
a search on their behalf. There are additional benefits to such
links, as these same sites often provide inventories of and access
to recent data that has not yet migrated to National or International
data centers.<BR>
<P>
<B>13 : Structure and Content of PICES WWW site<BR>
</B>
<P>
TCODE members from Canada, Japan and the U.S. reported that they
had personally used the PICES WWW server. Generally, the committee
is with very pleased with the Secretariat's efforts in establishing
the site. TCODE members felt a PICES should work to establish
itself as the primary &quot;theme page(s)&quot; for North Pacific
Marine Science issues, as well as providing a mechanism for internal
information exchange.. This is a big job, but the competition
to fill this niche will be limited. This does provide an inexpensive
way of broadening the impact of and participation in PICES affairs.
<BR>
<P>
Some specific issues were discussed:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Should the full text of PICES reports be available on WWW
site?
</UL>
<P>
TCODE members suggest that this is unnecessary at the present
time. There should be a document summary and Table of Contents
available on line for each publication, as well as information
on how to obtain a copy. The PICES Secretariat should pursue fully
electronic version of new reports to allow a &quot;print on request&quot;
service for documents which are no longer available. This service
should be advertised to those who do not have WWW access currently.
<BR>
<P>
If PICES establishes an anonymous ftp (file transfer protocol)
facility, complete reports in electronic format (postscript) could
be placed in this area. Such files will be large and will not
be suitable for downloading on systems with limited bandwidth.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Additional &quot;lists&quot; of people 
</UL>
<P>
TCODE recommends that additional lists of people and email addresses
be made available on the web sit. For example, all attendees at
PICES meetings could be added. Such lists need not be maintained
- they can be kept on line for a reasonable period, then deleted
after 2 or 3 years. Searches for a specific name might return
multiple &quot;hits&quot;, as people are found on more than one
list, but this is preferable to not finding the name/address at
all. <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Automated WWW-based registration for annual meeting
</UL>
<P>
TCODE supports such a scheme, if it is simple and robust, but
we do not consider it a high priority unless it will provide a
significant reduction in the workload for the Secretariat. Acceptance
of credit card payment by PICES would also be helpful.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>PICES useful links section
</UL>
<P>
TCODE strongly supports the Secretariat's initiatives in this
area. We suggest the following sections in this area:<BR>
<P>
- International Programs (existing)
<P>
- International organizations (existing)
<P>
- &quot;PICES World&quot; (new) This section would contain links
to all home pages of institutes/agencies of PICE participants,
organized by nation
<P>
- Data Centers (existing)<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Additional subject areas for TCODE (Data and Inventories page)
</UL>
<P>
- Real Time data for the North Pacific
<P>
- Methodologies, Manuals and Standards for Marine Science
<P>
- Climatologies 
<P>
- selected software/tools for Marine Science<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Usage monitoring and reporting
</UL>
<P>
TCODE recommends that the PICES Secretariat activate usage monitoring
for the WWW site. There are standard packages that provide summary
reports on which pages are accessed and from where. TCODE members
expressed interest in reviewing these summaries with the goal
of improving the utility and use of the WWW site. The PICES WWW
site should become the primary site for marine science information
for the North Pacific.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>14: Data Preservation<BR>
</B>
<P>
Dr. Royer pointed out that many government agencies are downsizing
and are at significant risk of losing access to data and samples
that are inadequately archived. TCODE recommends that the Science
Board make the Governing Council aware of this concern.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>15: Additional Items Arising from PICES V Science Committee
Meetings</B>
<UL>
<LI>Coordination of data exchange for intercomparison of results
from regional experiments.
</UL>
<P>
The REX group has asked for TCODE's recommendation on facilitating
data exchange amongst PICES CCCC participants. TCODE will review
various strategies and report to the CCCC-IP in 1997,<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Bathymetric data for numerical models
</UL>
<P>
Discussion at the POC meeting pointed out the need for high resolution
gridded bathymetry for regional models. TCODE and POC will work
together to produce a list of existing sources for these data.
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Results from presentations on the Inventory of Long Time Series
to MEQ, BIO, POC and FIS 
</UL>
<P>
TCODE members presented a review of the Inventory for the members
of each committee. BIO members suggested categories of Sea Birds
and Marine Mammals be added. WG 11 will assist in creating the
entries. In addition, The MEQ group requested a Contaminants category
and offered assistance in creating the entries.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Concerns about XBT data migration to national/international
archives
</UL>
<P>
WG 9 reported a concern that some XBT data may not be retained
in national data centres. TCODE agrees to report on the data collection,
archival and access situations in each country.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Procedures for updating inventory entries and metadata
</UL>
<P>
The PICES Secretariat will be the contact point for requests for
corrections, modifications and additions to the Inventory of Long
Time Series. These changes will be coordinated with the TCODE
chairman. TCODE reaffirms that the primary responsibility for
maintaining detailed information about the data) rests with the
data holder, not with PICES/TCODE.

<P>temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, primary production, sedimentation</P>
<H4>MEASUREMENT DETAILS:</H4>
<P>Scientists working within the Hawaiian Ocean Time-series (HOTS) project have been making repeated observations of the hydrography, chemistry and  biology at a station north of Hawaii since October 1988. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive description of the ocean at a site representative of the central North Pacific Ocean. Cruises are made approximately once a month to Station ALOHA, the HOT deep-water station (22 45'N, 158W) located about 100 km north of Oahu, Hawaii. 
Measurements of the thermohaline structure, water column chemistry, currents, primary production and particle sedimentation rates are made over a 72-hour period on each cruise.</P>

<P>Trawl catch and effort data is available from 1954-1995.  Information for trap is available from 1979-1995 and longline information is available from 1979-1985.  
Collection of catch and effort data is continuing but data will be housed in a new 
relational database that is in its final phases of development.
Throughout the years the GFCATCH database has evolved and most changes have only been documented internally.  Please contact the custodian for more details on the database.</P>

<P>The data collection process provides many opportunities for error and misinterpretation.  Although the data sets have been cleaned up *enormously* in the past year, they should not be thought of as 100% accurate.  Accuracy is improved as time and new information permits. Currently the data resides in a set of independent MS ACCESS databases for each fishery or species.  Eventually they will all be consolidated into a single ORACLE database.</P>

<P>
The Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) has undertaken
the task of assembling a list of important datasets that are relevant
to the study of long term trends in the physical, chemical and
biological environment of the North Pacific. These datasets are
particularly important for the retrospective analyses that are
to be carried out in the PICES Climate Change and Carrying Capacity
(CCCC) studies.
<P>
The primary objective of TCODE in assembling this inventory was
to provide short descriptions and &quot;pointers&quot; to the
locations of the datasets, to assist researchers in selecting
and accessing a diverse set of long term data. The criteria for
inclusion were loose - we were interested in any data that was
considered to be relevant to the PICES area that spanned (or will
eventually span) a period of 10 years or more. We have included
references to some global datasets, as well as references to some
observations in equatorial waters which are know to have impacts
on the North Pacific.
<P>
For convenience, we have classified the datasets into four types:
<OL>
<LI>Biological Oceanographic Data
<LI>Fisheries data
<LI>Meteorological data
<LI>Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data
</OL>

<P>
It is important to note that some datasets are difficult to fit
in this scheme (for example, marine mammal abundance data are
included in the &quot;Fisheries Data&quot; category) and some
datasets span more that one category (e.g. the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmospheric
dataset - COADS contains sea surface temperature data , which
fits in the Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data category
and atmospheric pressure data, which is Meteorological data).
We have placed each dataset in the most appropriate category,
so users may want to scan associated categories when searching
for data. The inventory is organized as SUMMARY pages (one for
each of the above categories) with a DETAIL page for each dataset.
<P>
Where possible, we have included Internet URL (universal resource
Locators) for institutions that provide on-line access to these
data. In general, the URL's presented here are the entry points
to the organization's WWW pages rather than a low-level pointer
to the exact web page where the specified data may be accessed.
It is our view that the Higher level links are likely to be more
robust than the more direct lower level links, which will fail
as the organization re-organizes its WWW pages.
<P>
We attempted to gather the following information about each dataset:
<P>
<B>parameters measured: </B>what exactly is included/measured
in the dataset
<P>
<B>measurement frequency: </B>how often are measurements made
(e.g. hourly, daily, monthly, annually or variable)?
<P>
<B>measurement details: </B>additional information about the measurements,
if required.
<P>
<B>geographic area: </B>text description of the area; may include
latitude and longitude limits
<P>
<B>Start and End dates: </B>continuing datasets noted as &quot;ongoing&quot;
<P>
<B>Custodian: </B>name and address for the person/institution
who are the primary holders of these data
<P>
<B>Publication: </B>list publications that explain or document
this dataset.
<P>
<B>Data Distribution: </B>how does one get the data? Are there
any restrictions or costs involved?
<P>
<B>Other Comments: </B>any important notes that don't fall into
the above categories
<P>
<B>Internet URL: </B>link to Internet &quot;resource&quot; (WWW,
ftp, telnet) if available
<P>
<B>Contributor: </B>name of person who contributed this item.
<P>
If you have any questions about the inventory, please feel free
to contact the PICES Secretariat (pices@ios.bc.ca), the TCODE
Chairman (Robin Brown; rmbrown@ios.bc.ca) or one of your national
representatives on TCODE. <B>PLEASE feel free to contribute notes
on additional data series that you feel may be useful!</B>

<P>Sea Ice Concentrations</P>
<H4>MEASUREMENT DETAILS:</H4>
<P>Monthly sea ice concentration for the Arctic Ocean (1901-1990) and southern oceans (1973-1990) have been digitized on a standard 1-degree grid (cylindrical projection) to provide a"relatively uniform set of sea ice extent for all longitudes, as a basis for hemispheric scale studies of observed sea ice fluctuations." (Walsh, J.E., 1978a)  Arctic grid covers Arctic Ocean and portions of peripheral seas where sea ice occurs during all or part of the year.  Southern ocean grid extends to about 50 deg. South.  This data is available by digital transfer.</P>

<P> The JASADCP is reponsible for the acquisition, review, documentation, archival, and distribution of shipboard ADCP data sets. The archive primarily handles US national cruises, although it also supports several completed multi-national programs such as TOGA COARE, WEPOCS, and US-PRC cruises. The JASADCP is also a Data Assembly Center for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) in collaboration with the Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC). The WOCE archive consists of 15 cruise lines and 55 of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) cruises. The growing JASADCP now totals 135 cruises.</P>

An excellent inventory of cruise schedules, vessel descriptions
and other information is maintained by the Data Information Unit
at the University of Delaware, College of Marine Studies . The
contents include U.S. and international contributions and the
DIU is making a serious effort to provide access to all research
vessel information world-wide. This facility maintains an excellent
searchable database of cruise schedules. This is the best starting
place for vessel and cruise information. All that being said this
database appears to have little information for the PICES nations,
with the exception of the U.S.:
<P>
On April 25, 1996 - the University of Delaware database was searched
(by country) for records of research vessel activities in the
Pacific. The following activity categories were included: Physics/Physical
Oceanography; Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Air. The results are
as follows:
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=2>Canada:         2 entries (John P. Tully); no entries for FRV W.E. Ricker
China:          no entries
Korea:          no entries
Japan:          2 entries (Hakuho Maru); there MUST be many more 
Russia:         no entries
U.S.A.          MANY entries

The present version is not too useful. No vessel information is
included and the schedule is difficult to interpret. Schedule

(CSS John P. Tully) is included in the University of Delaware

<H4>MEASUREMENT DETAILS:</H4>
<P>Scientists working within the Hawaiian Ocean Time-series (HOTS) project have been making repeated observations of the hydrography, chemistry and  biology at a station north of Hawaii since October 1988. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive description of the ocean at a site representative of the central North Pacific Ocean. Cruises are made approximately once a month to Station ALOHA, the HOT deep-water station (22 45'N, 158W) located about 100 km north of Oahu, Hawaii. 
Measurements of the thermohaline structure, water column chemistry, currents, primary production and particle sedimentation rates are made over a 72-hour period on each cruise.</P>

<P>Trawl catch and effort data is available from 1954-1995.  Information for trap is available from 1979-1995 and longline information is available from 1979-1985.  
Collection of catch and effort data is continuing but data will be housed in a new 
relational database that is in its final phases of development.
Throughout the years the GFCATCH database has evolved and most changes have only been documented internally.  Please contact the custodian for more details on the database.</P>

<P>The data collection process provides many opportunities for error and misinterpretation.  Although the data sets have been cleaned up *enormously* in the past year, they should not be thought of as 100% accurate.  Accuracy is improved as time and new information permits. Currently the data resides in a set of independent MS ACCESS databases for each fishery or species.  Eventually they will all be consolidated into a single ORACLE database.</P>

<P>
The Technical Committee on Data Exchange (TCODE) has undertaken
the task of assembling a list of important datasets that are relevant
to the study of long term trends in the physical, chemical and
biological environment of the North Pacific. These datasets are
particularly important for the retrospective analyses that are
to be carried out in the PICES Climate Change and Carrying Capacity
(CCCC) studies.
<P>
The primary objective of TCODE in assembling this inventory was
to provide short descriptions and &quot;pointers&quot; to the
locations of the datasets, to assist researchers in selecting
and accessing a diverse set of long term data. The criteria for
inclusion were loose - we were interested in any data that was
considered to be relevant to the PICES area that spanned (or will
eventually span) a period of 10 years or more. We have included
references to some global datasets, as well as references to some
observations in equatorial waters which are know to have impacts
on the North Pacific.
<P>
For convenience, we have classified the datasets into four types:
<OL>
<LI>Biological Oceanographic Data
<LI>Fisheries data
<LI>Meteorological data
<LI>Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data
</OL>

<P>
It is important to note that some datasets are difficult to fit
in this scheme (for example, marine mammal abundance data are
included in the &quot;Fisheries Data&quot; category) and some
datasets span more that one category (e.g. the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmospheric
dataset - COADS contains sea surface temperature data , which
fits in the Physical and Chemical Oceanographic data category
and atmospheric pressure data, which is Meteorological data).
We have placed each dataset in the most appropriate category,
so users may want to scan associated categories when searching
for data. The inventory is organized as SUMMARY pages (one for
each of the above categories) with a DETAIL page for each dataset.
<P>
Where possible, we have included Internet URL (universal resource
Locators) for institutions that provide on-line access to these
data. In general, the URL's presented here are the entry points
to the organization's WWW pages rather than a low-level pointer
to the exact web page where the specified data may be accessed.
It is our view that the Higher level links are likely to be more
robust than the more direct lower level links, which will fail
as the organization re-organizes its WWW pages.
<P>
We attempted to gather the following information about each dataset:
<P>
<B>parameters measured: </B>what exactly is included/measured
in the dataset
<P>
<B>measurement frequency: </B>how often are measurements made
(e.g. hourly, daily, monthly, annually or variable)?
<P>
<B>measurement details: </B>additional information about the measurements,
if required.
<P>
<B>geographic area: </B>text description of the area; may include
latitude and longitude limits
<P>
<B>Start and End dates: </B>continuing datasets noted as &quot;ongoing&quot;
<P>
<B>Custodian: </B>name and address for the person/institution
who are the primary holders of these data
<P>
<B>Publication: </B>list publications that explain or document
this dataset.
<P>
<B>Data Distribution: </B>how does one get the data? Are there
any restrictions or costs involved?
<P>
<B>Other Comments: </B>any important notes that don't fall into
the above categories
<P>
<B>Internet URL: </B>link to Internet &quot;resource&quot; (WWW,
ftp, telnet) if available
<P>
<B>Contributor: </B>name of person who contributed this item.
<P>
If you have any questions about the inventory, please feel free
to contact the PICES Secretariat (pices@ios.bc.ca), the TCODE
Chairman (Robin Brown; rmbrown@ios.bc.ca) or one of your national
representatives on TCODE. <B>PLEASE feel free to contribute notes
on additional data series that you feel may be useful!</B>

<P>Sea Ice Concentrations</P>
<H4>MEASUREMENT DETAILS:</H4>
<P>Monthly sea ice concentration for the Arctic Ocean (1901-1990) and southern oceans (1973-1990) have been digitized on a standard 1-degree grid (cylindrical projection) to provide a"relatively uniform set of sea ice extent for all longitudes, as a basis for hemispheric scale studies of observed sea ice fluctuations." (Walsh, J.E., 1978a)  Arctic grid covers Arctic Ocean and portions of peripheral seas where sea ice occurs during all or part of the year.  Southern ocean grid extends to about 50 deg. South.  This data is available by digital transfer.</P>

<H4>MEASUREMENT DETAILS:</H4>
<P> The JASADCP is reponsible for the acquisition, review, documentation, archival, and distribution of shipboard ADCP data sets. The archive primarily handles US national cruises, although it also supports several completed multi-national programs such as TOGA COARE, WEPOCS, and US-PRC cruises. The JASADCP is also a Data Assembly Center for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) in collaboration with the Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC). The WOCE archive consists of 15 cruise lines and 55 of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) cruises. The growing JASADCP now totals 135 cruises.</P>

An excellent inventory of cruise schedules, vessel descriptions
and other information is maintained by the Data Information Unit
at the University of Delaware, College of Marine Studies . The
contents include U.S. and international contributions and the
DIU is making a serious effort to provide access to all research
vessel information world-wide. This facility maintains an excellent
searchable database of cruise schedules. This is the best starting
place for vessel and cruise information. All that being said this
database appears to have little information for the PICES nations,
with the exception of the U.S.:
<P>
On April 25, 1996 - the University of Delaware database was searched
(by country) for records of research vessel activities in the
Pacific. The following activity categories were included: Physics/Physical
Oceanography; Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Air. The results are
as follows:
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=2>Canada:         2 entries (John P. Tully); no entries for FRV W.E. Ricker
China:          no entries
Korea:          no entries
Japan:          2 entries (Hakuho Maru); there MUST be many more 
Russia:         no entries
U.S.A.          MANY entries

The present version is not too useful. No vessel information is
included and the schedule is difficult to interpret. Schedule
information for one of two major vessels doing offshore research
(CSS John P. Tully) is included in the University of Delaware
searchable database. Additional contacts are:

<P>
Where in the universe will we travel to next? Thanks to the efforts and courage of the early pace pioneers, a bright spot in the night sky is just another exploratory destination to be visited  and studied. In the past thirty years, humans have traveled far beyond the earth's gravitational  field to explore the universe. The current exploration of space is setting new goals and new  destinations to travel beyond. A return to the <A HREF="moon.htm">moon</A>? Mission to <A HREF="mars.htm">Mars</A>? A permanent settlement  in space? None of those destinations are too far away. In this area, explorers will sit along side  Space Shuttle astronauts and mission control engineers as they prepare the way and chart the  course for the next chapter in manned and unmanned space exploration, including:

<P>
This is the fifth of nine planned missions to Mir and the second one involving
an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut <A HREF="blaha.htm">John Blaha</A>, who has been on Mir
since September 19, 1996, will be replaced by astronaut Jerry Linenger.
Linenger will spend more than four months on Mir. He will return to Earth on
Space Shuttle Mission STS-84, scheduled for launch in May 1997.
<P>
<A HREF="atlantis.htm">Atlantis</A> will again be carrying the SPACEHAB module in the payload bay of
the orbiter. The double module configuration will house experiments to be
performed by Atlantis' crew along with logistics equipment to be transferred
to Mir.
<P>
The <A HREF="81crewlg.jpg">STS-81 crew</A> will be commanded by <A HREF="baker.htm">Michael A. Baker</A> who will be making his fourth Shuttle flight. The pilot, <A HREF="Jett.htm">Brent W. Jett, Jr.</A>, will be making his
second flight. There are four mission specialists assigned to this flight.
<A HREF="wis.htm">Peter J.K. "Jeff" Wisoff</A>, serving as Mission Specialist-1, is making his third
flight. Mission Specialist-2 <A HREF="grun.htm">John M. Grunsfeld</A> is making his second space
flight. <A HREF="ivins.htm">Marsha S. Ivins</A> serving as Mission Specialist-3 is making her fourth
space flight. <A HREF="line.htm">Jerry M. Linenger</A> will be Mission Specialist-4 for launch
through docking with Mir. Shortly after docking, Linenger and Blaha will
conduct their handover with Linenger becoming a member of the Mir crew and
Blaha becoming Mission Specialist-4 through the end of the flight.
<P>
Atlantis is targeted for an early morning launch on or about January 12, 1997
from NASA's Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39-B. The current launch
time of 4:27 a.m. EST may vary by a few minutes based on calculations of
Mir's precise location in space at the time of liftoff due to Shuttle
rendezvous phasing requirements. The STS-81 mission is scheduled to last
10 days, 3 hours, 30 minutes. An on-time launch on January 12 and nominal
mission duration would have Atlantis landing back at Kennedy Space Center
on January 22 at about 8 a.m. EST.
<P>
Atlantis&#39; rendezvous and <A HREF="dock.htm">docking</A> with the Mir actually begin with the
precisely timed launch setting the orbiter on a course for rendezvous with
the orbiting Russian facility. Over the next two to three days, periodic
firings of Atlantis' small thruster engines will gradually bring the Shuttle
within closer proximity to Mir.
<P>
The STS-81 mission is part of the NASA/Mir program which consists of nine
Shuttle-Mir dockings and seven long duration flights of U.S. astronauts
aboard the Russian space station. The U.S. astronauts will launch and land on
a Shuttle and serve as Mir crew members while the Mir cosmonauts use their
traditional Soyuz vehicle for launch and landing. This series of missions will
expand U.S. research on Mir by providing resupply materials for experiments
to be performed aboard the station as well as returning experiment samples
and data to Earth.
<P>
The current Mir 22 mission began when cosmonauts Valeri Korzun and
Aleksandr Kaleri were launched on August 17, 1996, in a Soyuz vehicle and
docked with the Mir two days later. John Blaha joined the Mir 22 crew with
the September 19, 1996, docking of STS-79. Blaha will complete his stay on
Mir and return with the STS-81 crew. Linenger will work with the Mir 22
crew until the arrival of Mir 23 cosmonauts Vasili Tsibliev, Aleksandr
Lazutkin and German researcher Reinhold Ewald in early February 1997. After
the Mir 22 crew and Ewald return to Earth in a Soyuz, Linenger will complete
his tour with the Mir 23 crew. Linenger will be replaced by NASA Astronaut
Mike Foale when Atlantis again docks with Mir in May.
<P>
The STS-81 mission also will include several experiments in the fields of
advanced technology, Earth sciences, fundamental biology, human life
sciences, microgravity, and space sciences. Data also will supply insight for
the planning and development of the International Space Station, Earth-based
sciences of human and biological processes, and the advancement of
commercial technology.
<P>
STS-81 will involve the transfer of 5,975 pounds of logistics to and from
the Mir, the largest transfer of items to date. During the docked phase, 1,400
pounds of water, 1,137.7 pounds of U.S. science equipment, 2,206.1 pounds of
Russian logistics along with 268.2 pounds of miscellaneous material will be
transferred to Mir. Returning to Earth aboard Atlantis will be 1,256.6 pounds
of U.S. science material, 891.8 pounds of Russian logistics and 214.6 pounds
of miscellaneous material.
<P>
STS-81 will be the 18th flight of Atlantis and the 81st mission flown since
the start of the Space Shuttle program in April 1981.

<H2>NASA Discovers Water on the Moon</H2><BR>


<B>Analysis of Clementine Bistatic Radar data has revealed the possibility of 
a permanent frozen water-ice lake in a crater near the south pole of the Moon.</B>
<P>
Clementine was a joint project between the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization and NASA.  The objective of the mission was to
test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the
space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and
the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos.  The observations 
included imaging at various wavelengths including ultraviolet and
infrared, laser ranging altimetry, and charged particle measurements.
These observations were originally for the purposes of assessing the surface
mineralogy of the Moon and Geographos, obtaining lunar altimetry from
60N to 60S latitude, and determining the size, shape, rotational
characteristics, surface properties, and cratering statistics of
Geographos.  


<P>
<IMG ALIGN="left" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="144" SRC="art/clem2.gif" ALT="CLENENTINE">
The probe, known as "<A HREF="art/clem.gif">Clementine</A>," was sent to the moon
in 1994 and has been sending data back to scientists since. Clementine was launched on 25 January 1994 at 16:34 UTC 
(12:34 PM EDT) from Vandenburg AFB
aboard a Titan IIG rocket. The Clementine mission mapped most of the lunar surface at a number of resolutions and wavelengths from UV to IR. The spacecraft was launched on
January 25, 1994 at 16:34 and the nominal lunar mission lasted until the
spacecraft left lunar orbit on May 3.  Clementine had five different imaging systems
on-board. The UV/Visible camera had a filter wheel with six different
filters, ranging from 415 nm to 1000 nm, and including a broad-band filter
covering 400 to 950 nm. The Near Infrared camera also had a six-filter
wheel, ranging from 1100 nm to 2690 nm. The Longwave Infrared camera had a
wavelength range of 8000 to 9500 nm. The Hi-Res imager had a broad-band
filter from 400 to 800 nm and four other filters ranging from 415 to 750 nm.
The Star Tracker camera was also used for imaging. The
program is funded by the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, and is monitored by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="right" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="288" SRC="art/arist.gif" ALT="Crater Aristarchus Composit Image">
<P>
The presence of ice indicates to scientists that
microbial life forms on
the moon might be more likely than previously thought,
and that it may
be easier to sustain human colonies on the moon than
once believed. The patch of ice is thought to be
about 25 feet thick and roughly the
size of a small lake or pond.

<P>


One theory suggests the ice arrived
as a comet -- which is mostly
ice --
that plowed into the moon at or
near
the south pole, an area said to be
roughly twice the size of Puerto
Rico and which never sees the sun.
The water molecules could then
have migrated south to collect in a crater.
<P>

The images from Clementine constitute the first color global digital          
data set of the Moon. The NASA Science Team advised the project on the        
selection of color filters for the two principal mapping cameras: the         
UV/Visible camera and the NIR camera. The color of the Moon in the            
visible to near-infrared part of the spectrum is sensitive to variations      
in both the composition of the surface material and the amount of time        
material has been exposed to space. The Clementine filters were selected      
to characterize the broad lunar continuum and to sample parts of the          
spectrum that are known to contain absorption bands diagnostic of iron-       
bearing minerals and plagioclase feldspar, the dominant mineral               
constituents of the lunar crust. By combining information obtained            
through several filters, multispectral image data are being used to map       
the distribution of rock and soil types on the Moon.    
<P>
<A HREF="art/bean.jpg"><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="8" WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="180" SRC="art/surv3.gif" ALT="Alan Bean retrieves Surveyor 3 camera"></A>
Six visits to the moon by Apollo spacecraft turned up
no known
evidence of life there. Twelve men, all from the U.S.,
have walked on
the surface of the moon, which is about 245,000 miles
from the Earth. <A HREF="ap11.htm">Apollo 11</A> was the first to land there in 1969. Five
subsequent Apollo
missions successfully landed there before the moon
shots were
discontinued. The missions ended with Apollo 17.
<P>

The Apollo program was designed to land humans on the Moon and bring
them safely back to Earth. Six of the missions (Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15,
16, and 17) achieved this goal. <A HREF="ap7.htm">Apollos 7</A> and 9 were Earth orbiting
missions to test the Command and Lunar Modules, and did not return
lunar data. Apollos 8 and 10 tested various components while orbiting
the Moon, and returned photography of the lunar surface. Apollo 13 did
not land on the Moon due to a malfunction, but also returned photographs.
The six missions that landed on the Moon returned a wealth of scientific
data and almost 400 kilograms of lunar samples. Experiments included
soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismic, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic
fields, and solar wind experiments.

 <H3>METEORITE YIELDS EVIDENCE OF PRIMITIVE LIFE ON EARLY MARS</H3>
<B>15 million years ago, a huge comet or <A HREF="video/asteroid.qt">asteroid struck Mars</A> (1.3 MB QuickTime video), ejecting a piece of the
    rock from its subsurface location with enough force to escape the planet.</B>

    <P>A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space Center and at Stanford
    University has found evidence that strongly suggests primitive life may have
    existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.

    <P>The NASA-funded team found the first organic molecules thought to be of Martian
    origin; several mineral features characteristic of biological activity; and
    possible microscopic fossils of  primitive, bacteria-like organisms inside of an
    ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite.

    <P>
<IMG HSPACE="6" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="231" HEIGHT="180" SRC="art/potato2.jpg" ALT="Martian rock">The igneous rock in the 4.2-pound, potato-sized meteorite has been age-dated to
    about 4.5 billion years, the period when the planet Mars formed. The rock is
    believed to have originated underneath the Martian surface and to have been
    extensively fractured by impacts as meteorites bombarded the planets in the early
    inner solar system. Between 3.6 billion and 4 billion years ago, a time when it
    is generally thought that the planet was warmer and wetter, water is believed to
    have penetrated fractures in the subsurface rock, possibly forming an underground
    water system.
    <BR>
    <P>Because the water was saturated with carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere,
    carbonate minerals were deposited in the fractures. The team's findings indicate
    living organisms may also have assisted in the formation of the carbonate, and
    some remains of the microscopic organisms may have become fossilized, in a
    fashion similar to the formation of fossils in limestone on Earth. Then, 15
    million years ago, a huge comet or <A HREF="video/asteroid.qt">asteroid struck Mars</A> (1.3 MB QuickTime video), ejecting a piece of the
    rock from its subsurface location with enough force to escape the planet. For
    millions of years, the chunk of rock floated through space. It encountered
    Earth's atmosphere 13,000 years ago and fell in Antarctica as a meteorite.
    <BR>
    <P>It is in the tiny globs of carbonate that the researchers found a number of
    features that can be interpreted as suggesting past life. Stanford found easily
    detectable amounts of organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
    (PAHs) concentrated in the vicinity of the carbonate. Researchers at JSC found
    mineral compounds commonly associated with microscopic organisms and the possible
    microscopic fossil structures.
   
    <P>The meteorite, called <A HREF="art/potato.jpg">ALH84001</A>, was found in 1984 in Allan Hills ice field,
    Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the National Science Foundation's
    Antarctic Meterorite Program. It was preserved for study in JSC's Meteorite
    Processing Laboratory and its possible Martian origin was not recognized until
    1993. It is one of only 12 meteorites identified so far that match the unique
    Martian chemistry measured by the Viking spacecraft that landed on Mars in 1976.
    ALH84001 is by far the oldest of the 12 Martian meteorites, more than three times
    as old as any other. 
 
    
    <P>The formation of the carbonate or fossils by living organisms while the meteorite
    was in the Antarctic was deemed unlikely for several reasons. The carbonate was
    age dated using a parent-daughter isotope method and found to be 3.6 billion
    years old, and the organic molecules were first detected well within the ancient
    carbonate. In addition, the team analyzed representative samples of other
    meteorites from Antarctica and found no evidence of fossil-like structures,
    organic molecules or possible biologically produced compounds and minerals
    similiar to those in the ALH84001 meteorite. The composition and location of PAHs
    organic molecules found in the meteorite also appeared to confirm that the
    possible evidence of life was extraterrestrial. No PAHs were found in the
    meteorite's exterior crust, but the concentration of PAHs increased in the
    meteorite's interior to levels higher than ever found in Antarctica. Higher
    concentrations of PAHs would have likely been found on the exterior of the
    meteorite, decreasing toward the interior, if the organic molecules  are the
    result of contamination of the meteorite on Earth.<BR>

Project Apollo in general, and the flight of Apollo 11 in particular,
should be viewed as a watershed in the nation's history. It was an
endeavor that demonstrated both the technological and economic
virtuousity of the United States and established national preeminence
over rival nations--the primary goal of the program when first
envisioned by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It had been an
enormous undertaking, costing $25.4 billion (about $95 billion in 1990
dollars) with only the building of the Panama Canal rivaling the Apollo
program's size as the largest non-military technological endeavor ever
undertaken by the United States.<P>

 The primary objectives for the Apollo 7 engineering test flight, were
     simple: "Demonstrate CSM/crew performance; demonstrate crew/space
     vehicle/mission support facilities performance during a manned CSM
     mission; demonstrate CSM rendezvous capability."

Mr. Cunningham may be contacted by email at <A HREF="mailto:waltc@spacezone.com">waltc@spacezone.com.</A>
<HR>
Walt Cunningham is perhaps best known as America's second civilian astronaut.
<P>
On October 11, 1968, he occupied the lunar module pilot seat for the eleven-day flight of 
<A HREF="ap7.htm">Apollo 7</A> - the first manned flight test of the third generation United States spacecraft. With 
Walter M. Schirra, Jr., and Donn F. Eisele, <A HREF="art/waltcap.gif">Cunningham</A> participated in and executed 
maneuvers enabling the crew to perform exercises in transposition and docking and lunar 
orbit rendezvous with the <A HREF="art/s1vb.gif">S-IVB</A> stage of their <A HREF="art/s1bpad.gif">Saturn IB</A> launch vehicle; completed eight 
successful test and maneuvering ignitions of the service module propulsion engine; measured 
the accuracy of performance of all spacecraft systems; and provided the first effective 
television transmission of onboard crew activities.
<P>
The 263-hour, four-and-a-half million mile shakedown flight was <A HREF="art/7crew.jpg">successfully concluded</A> on 
October 22, 1968, with splashdown occurring in the Atlantic - some eight miles from the 
carrier ESSEX (only 3/10 of a mile from the originally predicted aiming point).

<P>

Mr. Cunningham's last assignment at the Johnson Space Center was as Chief of the Skylab Branch of the Fight Crew Directorate. In this capacity he was responsible for the operational inputs for five major pieces of manned space hardware, two different boosters and 65 major on-board experiments that comprised the Skylab program. The Skylab program also utilized the first manned systems employing arrays for electrical power, molecular sieves for environmental control systems, and inertia storage devices for attitude control systems.
<P>

He worked as a scientist for the Rand Corporation prior to joining NASA. While with Rand, he worked on classified defense studies and problems of the earth's magnetosphere.
<P>
Mr. Cunningham joined the Navy in 1951 and began his flight training in 1952. In 1953 he joined a Marine squadron and served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps until August 1956 and in the Marine Corps Reserve program until 1975. His present rank is Colonel, USMCR (Retired).
<P>
He has accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time, including more than 3,400 in jet 
aircraft and 263 hours in space.
<P>
<A HREF="wcprof.htm">Currently</A>, Mr. Cunningham is a successful business man, investor and Director of numerous public and private companies.  He is author of <I>The All American Boys</I>, the human side of the space program. He is a radio talk show host and <A HREF="lec.htm">frequent lecturer</A> throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. He is a civic leader, is listed in all major Who's Who publications and is a recipient of numerous national and international honors.

 The primary objectives for the Apollo 7 engineering test flight were

     vehicle/mission support facilities performance during a manned CSM
     mission; demonstrate CSM rendezvous capability."<P>
<DT>
<B>Launch:</B>
<DD>
     October 11, 1968, 11:02:45am EST. October 11 at Cape Kennedy was hot
     but the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze when Apollo 7 lifted off
     in a <A HREF="art/flame.gif">two-tongued blaze of orange-colored flame</A>. The Saturn IB, in its
     first trial with men aboard, provided a perfect launch and its first
     stage dropped off 2 minutes 25 seconds later. The S-IVB second stage
     took over, giving astronauts their first ride atop a load of liquid
     hydrogen, and at 5 minutes 54 seconds into the mission, Walter Schirra,
     the commander, reported, "She is riding like a dream." About five
     minutes later an elliptical orbit had been achieved, 140 by 183 miles
     above the Earth.<P>

<B>Landing:</B>
<DD>
     The CSM's service propulsion system, which had to fire the CSM into and
     out of lunar orbit, worked perfectly during eight burns lasting from
     half a second to 67.6 seconds. Apollo's flotation bags had their first
     try-out when the spacecraft, a "<A HREF="art/capcol.gif">lousy boat</A>," splashed down in the
     Atlantic southeast of Bermuda, less than two kilometers from the
     planned impact point. Landing location was 27deg 32min North and 64deg
     04min West. The module turned upside down; when inflated, the brightly
     colored bags flipped it aright. The tired, but happy, voyagers were
     picked up by helicopter and deposited on the deck of the U.S.S. Essex
     by 08:20am EDT. Spacecraft aboard ship at 09:03am.<P>

Once Apollo 7 cleared the pad, a three-shift mission control team-led
     by flight directors Glynn Lunney, Eugene Kranz, and Gerald D. Griffin
     -- in Houston took over. Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham inside the
     command module had listened to the sound of propellants rushing into
     the firing chambers, had noticed the vehicles swaying slightly, and had
     felt the vibrations at ignition. Ten and a half minutes after launch,
     with little bumpiness and low g loads during acceleration, Apollo 7
     reached the first stage of its journey, an orbital path 227 by 285
     kilometers above the earth.
<P>
     The S-IVB stayed with the CSM for about one and one-half orbits, then
     separated. Schirra fired the CSM's small rockets to pull 50 feet ahead
     of the S-IVB, then turned the spacecraft around to simulate docking, as
     would be necessary to extract an LM for a Moon landing. The next day, when
     the CSM and the S-IVB were about 80 miles apart, Schirra and his mates
     sought out the lifeless, tumbling 59-foot craft in a rendezvous
     simulation and approached within 70 feet.
<P>
     Walter Cunningham reported the spacecraft lunar module adapter panels
     had not fully deployed. This naturally reminded Stafford, on the
     capsule communicator (CapCom) console, of the "angry alligator" target
     vehicle he had encountered on his Gemini IX mission. This mishap would
     have been embarrassing on a mission that carried a lunar module, but
     the panels would be jettisoned explosively on future flights.
<P>
     After this problem, service module engine performance was a joy. This
     was one area where the crew could not switch to a redundant or backup
     system; at crucial times during a lunar voyage, the engine simply had
     to work or they would not get back home. On Apollo 7, there were eight
     nearly perfect firings out of eight attempts. On the first, the crew
     had a real surprise. In contrast to the smooth liftoff of the Saturn,
     the blast from the service module engine jolted the astronauts, causing
     Schirra to yell "Yabadabadoo" like Fred Flintstone in the contemporary
     video cartoon. Later, Eisele said, "We didn't quite know what to
     expect, but we got more than we expected." He added that it was a real boot in the rear that just plastered them into their
     seats. But the engine did what it was supposed to do each time it
     fired.
<P>
     The Apollo vehicle and the CSM performed superbly. Durability was shown
     for 10.8 days - - longer than a journey to the Moon and back. With few
     exceptions, the other systems in the spacecraft operated as they
     should. Occasionally, one of the three fuel cells supplying electricity
     to the craft developed some unwanted high temperatures, but
     load-sharing hookups among the cells prevented any power shortage. The
     crew complained about noisy fans in the environmental circuits and
     turned off one of them. That did not help much, so the men switched off
     the other. The cabin stayed comfortable, although the coolant lines
     sweated and water collected in little puddles on the deck, which the
     crew expected after the Kerwin team's test in the altitude chamber.
     Schirra's crew vacuumed the excess water out into space with the urine
     dump hose.
<P>
     A momentary shudder went through Mission Control when both AC buses
     dropped out of the spacecraft's electrical system, coincident with
     automatic cycles of the cryogenic oxygen tank fans and heaters; but
     manual resetting of the AC bus breakers restored normal service.
<P>
     Three of the five spacecraft windows fogged because of improperly cured
     sealant compound (a condition that could not be fixed until Apollo 9).
     Visibility from the spacecraft windows ranged from poor to good, during
     the mission. Shortly after the launch escape tower jettisoned, two of
     the windows had soot deposits and two others had water condensation.
     Two days later, however, Cunningham reported that most of the windows
     were in fairly good shape, although moisture was collecting between the
     inner panes of one window. On the seventh day, Schirra described
     essentially the same conditions.
<P>
     Even with these impediments, the windows were adequate. Those used for
     observations during rendezvous and stationkeeping with the S-IVB
     remained almost clear. Navigational sighting with a telescope and a
     sextant on any of the 37 preselected "Apollo" stars was difficult if
     done too soon after a waste-water dump. Sometimes they had to wait
     several minutes for the frozen particles to disperse. Eisele reported
     that unless he could see at least 40 or 50 stars at a time he found it
     hard to decide what part of the sky he was looking toward. On the
     whole, however, the windows were satisfactory for general and landmark
     observations and for out-the-window photography.
<P>
     Most components supported the operations and well-being of the
     spacecraft and crew as planned, in spite of minor irritations like
     smudging windows and puddling water. For example, the waste management
     system for collecting solid body wastes was adequate, though annoying.
     The defecation bags, containing a germicide to prevent bacteria and gas
     formation, were easily sealed and stored in empty food containers in
     the equipment bay. But the bags were certainly not convenient and there
     were usually unpleasant odors. Each time they were used, it took the
     crew member from 45 to 60 minutes, causing him to postpone it as long
     as possible, waiting for a time when there was no work to do. The crew
     had a total of only 12 defecations over a period of nearly 11 days.
     Urination was much easier, as the crew did not have to remove clothing.
     There was a collection service for both the pressure suits and the
     inflight coveralls. Both devices could be attached to the urine dump
     hose and emptied into space. They had half expected the hose valve to
     freeze up in vacuum, but it never did.
<P>
     Chargers for the batteries needed for reentry (after fuel cells
     departed with the SM) returned 50 to 75 percent less energy than
     expected. Most serious was the overheating of fuel cells, which might
     have failed when the spacecraft was too far from Earth to return on
     batteries, even if fully charged. But each of these anomalies was
     satisfactorily checked out before Apollo 8 flew.
<P>
     Some of the crew's grumpiness during the mission could be attributed to
     physical discomfort. About 15 hours into the flight, Schirra developed
     a bad cold, and Cunningham and Eisele soon followed suit. A cold is
     uncomfortable enough on the ground; in weightless space it presents a
     different problem. Mucus accumulates, filling the nasal passages, and
     does not drain from the head. The only relief is to blow hard, which is
     painful to the ear drums. So the crewmen of Apollo 7 whirled through
     space suffering from stopped up ears and noses. They took aspirin and
     decongestant tablets and discussed their symptoms with the doctors.
<P>
     Several days before the mission ended, they began to worry about
     wearing their suit helmets during reentry which would prevent them
     from blowing their noses. The buildup of pressure might burst their
     eardrums. Slayton, in mission control, tried to persuade them to wear
     the helmets, anyway, but Schirra was adamant. They each took a
     decongestant pill about an hour before reentry and made it through the
     acceleration zone without any problems with their ears.
<P>
     Apollo 7 accomplished what it set out to do - - qualifying the command and
     service module and clearing the way for the proposed lunar-orbit
     mission to follow. And its activities were of national interest. A
     special edition of NASA's news clipping collection called "Current
     News" included front page stories from 32 major newspapers scattered
     over the length and breadth of the nation. Although the postmission
     celebrations may not have rivaled those for the first orbital flight of
     an American, John Glenn in 1962, enthusiasm was high and this fervor
     would build to even greater heights each time the lunar landing goal
     drew one step closer.
<P>
     In retrospect it seems inconceivable, but serious debate ensued in NASA
     councils on whether television should be broadcast from Apollo
     missions, and the decision to carry the little 4 1/2 pound camera was
     not made until just before this October flight. Although these early
     pictures were crude, it was informative for the public to see
     astronauts floating weightlessly in their roomy spacecraft, snatching
     floating objects, and eating the first hot food consumed in space. Like
     the television pictures, the food improved in later missions.
<P>
     Apollo 7's achievement led to a rapid review of Apollo 8's options. The
     Apollo 7 astronauts went through six days of debriefing for the benefit
     of Apollo 8, and on October 28 the Manned Space Flight Management
     Council chaired by Mueller met at MSC, investigating every phase of the
     forthcoming mission. The next day came a lengthy systems review of Apollo
     8's Spacecraft 103. Paine made the go/no-go review of lunar orbit on
     November 11 at NASA Headquarters in Washington. By this time nearly all
     the skeptics had become converts.<P>

     July 1996 marks the twenty-seventh anniversary of the epochal lunar
     landing of Apollo 11 in the summer of 1969. Although President John F.
     Kennedy had made a public commitment on 25 May 1961 to land an American
     on the Moon by the end of the decade, up until this time Apollo had
     been all promise. Now the realization was about to begin. Kennedy's
     decision had involved much study and review prior to making it public,
     and his commitment had captured the American imagination, generating
     much positive support. Project Apollo had originated as an effort to
     deal with an unsatisfactory situation (world perception of the Soviet
     Union's leadership in space and technology), and it addressed these
     problems very well. Even though Kennedy's political objectives were
     essentially achieved with the decision to go to the Moon, Project
     Apollo took on a life of its own over the years and left an important
     legacy to both the nation and the proponents of space exploration. Its
     success was enormously significant, coming at a time when American
     society was in crisis.
<P>
     A unique confluence of political necessity, personal commitment and
     activism, scientific and technological ability, economic prosperity,
     and public mood made possible the 1961 decision to carry out an
     aggressive lunar landing program. It then fell to NASA, other
     organizations of the federal government, and the aerospace community to
     accomplish the task set out in a few short paragraphs by the president.
     By the time that the goal was accomplished in 1969, only a few of the
     key figures associated with the decision were still in leadership
     positions in the government. Kennedy fell victim to an assassin's
     bullet in 1963, and science adviser Jerome B. Wiesner returned to MIT
     soon afterwards. Lyndon B. Johnson, of course, succeeded Kennedy as
     president but left office in January 1969 just a few months before the
     first landing. NASA Administrator James E. Webb resolutely guided NASA
     through most of the 1960s, but his image was tarnished by, among other
     things, a 1967 Apollo accident that killed three astronauts. He retired
     from office in October 1968. Several other early supporters of Apollo
     in Congress and elsewhere died during the 1960s and never saw the
     program successfully completed.
<P>
     The first Apollo mission of public significance was the flight of
     Apollo 8. On 21 December 1968 it took off atop a Saturn V booster from
     the Kennedy Space Center. Three astronauts were aboard--Frank Borman,
     James A. Lovell, Jr., and William A. Anders- -for a historic mission to
     orbit the Moon. At first that mission had been planned as a flight to
     test Apollo hardware in the relatively safe confines of low Earth
     orbit, but senior engineer George M. Low of the Manned Spacecraft
     Center at Houston, Texas, and Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program
     Manager at NASA headquarters, obtained approval to make it a
     circumlunar flight. The advantages of this could be important, they
     believed, both in technical and scientific knowledge gained as well as
     in a public demonstration of what the U.S. could achieve.
<P>
     After Apollo 8 made one and a half Earth orbits its third stage began a
     burn to put the spacecraft on a lunar trajectory. It orbited the Moon
     on 24-25 December and then fired the boosters for a return flight; it
     "spashed down" in the Pacific Ocean on 27 December. The public reaction
     to the Apollo 8 circumlunar mission was enthusiastic. It rekindled the
     excitement felt in the early 1960s during the first Mercury flights,
     and set the stage for the Apollo landing missions.
<P>
     Perhaps most important, the flight was a significant accomplishment
     because it came at a time when American society was in crisis over
     Vietnam, race relations, urban problems, and a host of other
     difficulties. And if only for a few moments the nation united as one to
     focus on this epochal event. Two Apollo Earth- orbital missions
     occurred before the climax of the program, but they did little more
     than confirm that the time had come in mid- 1969 for a lunar landing.
<P>
     That landing came during the flight of Apollo 11, which lifted off on
     16 July 1969 and, after confirmation that the hardware was working
     well, began the three day trip to the Moon. Then, at 4:18 p.m. EST on
     20 July 1969 the Lunar Module--with astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and
     Edwin E. Aldrin aboard--landed on the surface of the Moon while Michael
     Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo Command Module. After checkout,
     Armstrong set foot on the surface, telling millions who saw and heard
     him on Earth that it was "one small step for man--one giant leap for
     mankind." Aldrin soon followed him out, and the two plodded around the
     landing site in the 1/6 lunar gravity, planted an American flag but
     omitted claiming the land for the U.S. as had been routinely done
     during European exploration of the Americas, collected soil and rock
     samples, and set up scientific experiments. The next day they launched
     back to the Apollo capsule orbiting overhead and began the return trip
     to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific on 24 July.
<P>
     The flight of Apollo 11 met with an ecstatic reaction around the globe,
     as everyone shared in the success of the mission. Ticker tape parades,
     speaking engagements, public relations events, and a world tour by the
     astronauts served to create good will both in the U.S. and abroad.
<P>
     Five more landing missions followed at approximately six month
     intervals through December 1972, each of them increasing the time spent
     on the Moon. Three of the latter Apollo missions used a lunar rover
     vehicle to travel in the vicinity of the landing site, but none of them
     equalled the excitement of Apollo 11.
<P>
     The scientific experiments placed on the Moon and the lunar soil
     samples returned through Project Apollo have provided grist for
     scientists' investigations of the Solar System ever since. The
     scientific return was significant, but the Apollo program did not
     answer conclusively the age-old questions of lunar origins and
     evolution.
<P>
     Project Apollo in general, and the flight of Apollo 11 in particular,
     should be viewed as a watershed in the nation's history. It was an
     endeavor that demonstrated both the technological and economic
     virtuousity of the United States and established national preeminence
     over rival nations--the primary goal of the program when first
     envisioned by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It had been an
     enormous undertaking, costing $25.4 billion (about $95 billion in 1990
     dollars) with only the building of the Panama Canal rivaling the Apollo
     program's size as the largest non-military technological endeavor ever
     undertaken by the United States and only the Manhattan Project to build
     the atomic bomb in World War II being comparable in a wartime setting.
<P>
     There are several important legacies (or conclusions) about Project
     Apollo that need to be remembered at the twenty-fifth anniversary of
     the Apollo 11 landing. First, and probably most important, the Apollo
     program was successful in accomplishing the political goals for which
     it had been created. Kennedy had been dealing with a Cold War crisis in
     1961 brought on by several separate factors--the Soviet orbiting of
     Yuri Gagarin and the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion only two of
     them--that Apollo was designed to combat. At the time of the Apollo 11
     landing Mission Control in Houston flashed the words of President
     Kennedy announcing the Apollo commitment on its big screen. Those
     phrases were followed with these: "TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969." No
     greater understatement could probably have been made. Any assessment of
     Apollo that does not recognize the accomplishment of landing an
     American on the Moon and safely returning before the end of the 1960s
     is incomplete and innaccurate, for that was the primary goal of the
     undertaking.
<P>
     Second, Project Apollo was a triumph of management in meeting
     enormously difficult systems engineering and technological integration
     requirements. James E. Webb, the NASA Administrator at the height of
     the program between 1961 and 1968, always contended that Apollo was
     much more a management exercise than anything else, and that the
     technological challenge, while sophisticated and impressive, was
     largely within grasp at the time of the 1961 decision. More difficult
     was ensuring that those technological skills were properly managed and
     used.
<P>
     Webb's contention was confirmed in spades by the success of Apollo.
     NASA leaders had to acquire and organize unprecedented resources to
     accomplish the task at hand. From both a political and technological
     perspective, management was critical. For seven years after Kennedy's
     Apollo decision, through October 1968, James Webb politicked, coaxed,
     cajoled, and maneuvered for NASA in Washington. In the process he
     acquired for the agency sufficient resources to meet its Apollo
     requirements.
<P>
     More to the point, NASA personnel employed a "program management"
     concept that centralized authority over design, engineering,
     procurement, testing, construction, manufacturing, spare parts,
     logistics, training, and operations. The systems management of the
     program was recognized as critical to Apollo's success in November
     1968, when Science magazine, the publication of the American
     Association for the Advancement of Science, observed:
<P>
     In terms of numbers of dollars or of men, NASA has not been
     our largest national undertaking, but in terms of complexity,
     rate of growth, and technological sophistication it has been
     unique. . . . It may turn out that [the space program's] most
     valuable spin-off of all will be human rather than
     technological: better knowledge of how to plan, coordinate,
     and monitor the multitudinous and varied activities of the
     organizations required to accomplish great social
     undertakings.
<P>
     Understanding the management of complex structures for the successful
     completion of a multifarious task was a critical outgrowth of the
     Apollo effort.
<P>
     Third, Project Apollo forced the people of the world to view the planet
     Earth in a new way. Apollo 8 was critical to this fundamental change,
     for on its outward voyage the crew focused a portable television camera
     on Earth and for the first time humanity saw its home from afar, a
     tiny, lovely, and fragile "blue marble" hanging in the blackness of
     space.
<P>
     When the Apollo 8 spacecraft arrived at the Moon on Christmas Eve of
     1968 the image of Earth was even more strongly reinforced when the crew
     sent images of the planet back while reading the first part of the
     Bible--"And God created the heavens and the Earth, and the Earth was
     without form and void"--before sending holiday greetings to humanity.
     Writer Archibald MacLeish summed up the feelings of many people when he
     wrote at the time of Apollo, that "To see the Earth as it truly is,
     small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats,
     is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that
     bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now that they
     are truly brothers." The modern environmental movement was galvanized
     in part by this new perception of the planet and the need to protect it
     and the life that it supports.
<P>
     Finally, the Apollo program, while an enormous achievement, left a
     divided legacy for NASA and the aerospace community. The perceived
     "golden age" of Apollo created for the agency an expectation that the
     direction of any major space goal from the president would always bring
     NASA a broad consensus of support and provide it with the resources and
     license to dispense them as it saw fit. Something most NASA officials
     did not understand at the time of the Moon landing in 1969, however,
     was that Apollo had not been conducted under normal political
     circumstances and that the exceptional circumstances surrounding Apollo
     would not be repeated.
<P>
     The Apollo decision was, therefore, an anomaly in the national
     decision-making process. The dilemma of the "golden age" of Apollo has
     been difficult to overcome, but moving beyond the Apollo program to
     embrace future opportunities has been an important goal of the agency's
     leadership in the recent past. Exploration of the Solar System and the
     universe remains as enticing a goal and as important an objective for
     humanity as it ever has been. Project Apollo was an important early
     step in that ongoing process of exploration.<P>

<P>
Space America Foundation for Education was created to inspire children and young adults with hope for the future using the heroic accomplishments of American space exploration as a model for leadership, innovation, teamwork and dedication to academic excellence. 
<P>
<B>Program Summary</B>
<P>
The primary goal of Space America&#39;s educational program is to provide schools across the country with a dynamic educational resource centered on the achievements of American space exploration to enhance learning in mathematics, the sciences and other core academic subjects. The program consists of special teaching materials provided to schools, training and support for teachers on the effective use of the program, and a motivational youth awards program.
<P>
The classroom materials include a thirty-volume video series chronicling the history of the American space program, called The American Space Odyssey, a comprehensive teacher&#39;s resource and curriculum guide, a youth awards program and other related teaching and promotional materials. The resource materials are designed to provide practical lessons for educators to apply the content of the video series to math and science learning while developing critical thinking and problem solving skills in their students. The initial goal of Space America and Spaceweek International is to facilitate placement of the program in all Texas elementary, intermediate and secondary schools (approximately 7000). Following implementation in Texas, Space America plans to broaden the program nationally and internationally.
<P>
The development of interesting and effective teaching resources is a key component to continuous educational improvement in schools across the country. This is especially true in the areas of mathematics and the sciences. Space exploration is a unique educational framework, providing students an exciting context for learning science and mathematics concepts while giving teachers a variety of challenging applications that make learning accessible to all. Current state and national curriculum reforms emphasize more interactive approaches to teaching math and science concepts, drawing educators away from teaching strictly from textbooks and more toward a curriculum which integrates several educational mediums. The Space America's classroom program combines exciting film and video footage from over thirty years of space exploration with practical academic lessons in the core science subject areas.
<P>
<B>Spaceweek International Mission</B>
<P>
Spaceweek International is an organization dedicated to space education.

<A NAME="Educational"><B>The Educational Program</B></A>
<P>
Space America&#39;s classroom education program combines the excitement and wonder of space exploration with challenging lessons in math and science. The program is designed for grades K-12, and consists of an American Space Odyssey video library, an accompanying teacher's curriculum and resource guide, Spaceweek International youth awards and other classroom materials.
<P>
<B>The American Space Odyssey Video Library</B>
<P>
The video series chronicles the history of the American Space program, from its inception over thirty years ago through the successful operation of the current space shuttle program. The separate volumes consist of original film and video footage collected from NASA archives. Each tape opens with a personal introduction from a NASA mission astronaut who describes the tape&#39;s content. The series follows the courageous efforts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts as they worked through the Sixties to meet President Kennedy's challenge of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth. Students will experience the first lunar landing, watch the historic Apollo 13 rescue and see Apollo astronauts perform scientific experiments in the mountains of the moon. They will see the historic rendezvous between the United States and Russia during the Apollo/ Soyuz mission and spend several weightless days aboard the Skylab Space Station. Other tapes in the series explore the evolution of the universe and the mysteries of distant planets, such as Jupiter, Mercury and Mars through the eyes of the Pioneer space probes. One tape, narrated by Orson Welles, searches for life outside our solar system while uncovering the basic building blocks which make up life itself. In all, the series shows students the historic accomplishments of manned space exploration while exposing them to the enormous benefits space exploration has given this country and the world.  
<P>
<B>The Teacher&#39;s Resource Guide</B>

Space America is honored to have the support of a number of former astronauts serving as Directors and Advisors to the foundation. Each brings his unique experience of space exploration to the continuing development of Space America&#39;s educational program. Their accomplishments include piloting lunar preparatory missions of the Mercury and Gemini programs, successfully commanding missions to the moon in the Apollo program, and serving as astronauts in Skylab and Space Shuttle missions. They were instrumental in the development of the American Space Odyssey video library, contributing their collective knowledge and experience as astronauts and space pioneers to put the series together. Each of the thirty tapes in the American Space Odyssey has a personal astronaut introduction describing the content of each tape, including particular flight missions highlighted and the discoveries made during the mission. The astronauts are contributing the experience of their own adventures in space to help inspire and educate the next generation of space pioneers.

<A NAME="History"><B>History: Space America</B></A>
<P>
NASA&#39;s original intention for documenting the progress of space exploration with film and video cameras was to keep the public in constant touch with America&#39;s achievements in space and to educate and inspire the next generation of space pioneers. Unfortunately, however, hundreds of hours of breathtaking historical footage lay relatively unseen in NASA archives.
<P>
In January of 1993, Talas Enterprises in Houston, Texas, a producer of historical video products, created the comprehensive video series that visually told the history of the American space program. Talas recognized the enormous educational potential of the American Space Odyssey and saw a special opportunity to make the history of space exploration available to students across the country for their educational benefit. They recognized the great impact our space program has had in this country and the world; progress in aerospace design and engineering, computer technology, advances in medical science, atmospheric research, weather tracking and numerous other applications that directly impact our daily lives. Even more important was what traveling beyond the bounds of earth has given the American spirit. America looked beyond the odds and obstacles and put a man on the moon. That triumphant day in July of 1969 was the culmination of a unique kind of teamwork and collective courage, showing the country and the world what can be accomplished when we look beyond our limits to pursue a dream. It was this spirit that embodies the American space program that Talas wanted to instill in students across the country.

<H2><A NAME="benefits">Benefits of Advertising on SpaceZone</A></H2>

<B>Advertising on SpaceZone provides several benefits for sponsors.</B>
<P>
<B>Credible Environment:</B> The SpaceZone Brand name provides a credible environment for your advertising message. The high quality and standards that consumers have come to trust is translated to the Internet and your product&#39;s message.
<P>
<B>Drawing Power:</B> The SpaceZone site has the proven ability to draw traffic to the Interactive Web site. Page views have grown to an average weekly number of 1 to 2 hundred thousand and can grow substantially during shuttle missions, NASA briefings and as breaking news happens. Therefore, advertising on SpaceZone will insure that large numbers of demographically attractive Internet users will see your message.
<P>
<B>SpaceZone Cross-Promotion:</B> SpaceZone is cross-promoted across a family of products and through our strategic partners. This promotion generates additional awareness and also serves to generate traffic to the site.
<P>
<B>High Frequency of Visits:</B> The nature of the ever-changing content on the SpaceZone Web site demands that viewers return to the site frequently to keep abreast of the news. This means that your ad will be seen again and again, thereby reinforcing your message to the consumer.
<P>
<B>Highly Visible Ad Locations:</B> Sponsor&#39;s ads appear on all Main Pages and next to key features of the site, including our platforms for live audio and video feeds. The benefit to the advertiser is that this allows the ad to be seen on the screen as that page is downloaded without having to scroll down the page.
<P>
<B>Ability to Customize a Package:</B> SpaceZone will work with advertisers to create a customized advertising package and sponsorship opportunity if the advertiser is interested in such an opportunity. These packages are created based on the advertiser&#39;s marketing and interactive objectives and strategies. This package allows your advertising to work harder for you within SpaceZone.
<P>
<B>Clean Graphic Design:</B> The clean graphic design of SpaceZone means that your ad will be easily seen and read.
<P>
<B>Audience Quality:</B> The SpaceZone brand attracts a highly desirable target of upscale, educated and professional adults, as well as a strong contingency of students and young adults. Comprehensive demographics on the typical SpaceZone patron are available for your review.
<P>
<B>Fast Internet Connection:</B> SpaceZone is connected right into the backbone of the Internet through 2 T1 connections. This large threshold bandwidth connection means that your ad will be delivered as much as 20 times faster on SpaceZone than through most other sites on the Web.
<P>
<B>Uncluttered Advertising Environment:</B> With the SpaceZone Interactive site being so rich in content, there is no need to overburden any one page with multiple advertiser messages. Main Pages in SpaceZone contain only one ad, providing you with the undivided attention of the consumer.
<P>
<B>Ad Tracking Reports:</B> On a weekly basis, SpaceZone provides sponsors with a report that tracks the delivery of your advertising. The report provides daily gross impressions or page views of the sponsor&#39;s banner as well as the number of users that click on your banner and transfer to the your Web site.


<P>
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="270">
<P>



<H2><A NAME="sponsorship">Sponsorship Opportunities</A></H2>

SpaceZone offers advertisers monthly, quarterly and annual sponsorship opportunities. A sponsorship package on the SpaceZone web site includes a banner inviting viewers to link to your web site. Banners are available on the SpaceZone Home Page, Main Section pages and subsection pages.
<P>
In addition, SpaceZone Interactive will work with advertisers to create a customized sponsorship opportunity based on web site programming or features.

<p></DL>

<H2>Mission Objectives:</H2>
<DL><p>
<dd>   The fifth docking mission will carry the Spacehab double module
providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments.
During the five days of docked operations with Mir, the crews will
transfer water and supplies from one spacecraft to the other.  A
spacewalk by Linenger and one of his Russian cosmonaut crewmates will
be after Atlantis departs.
<p></DL>

<H2>Launch:</H2>
<DL>  
<dd>  Launch 1/12/97 4:27am EST (ESTIMATED).  Window is 7-10 minutes.
A launch on 1/12/97 would lead to a Mir docking on Jan 14 at about
10:50pm EST.
<P>  
<dd>  On 1/7/97, ordnance operations and pressurization of the 
Reaction Control System (RCS) were completed.  Final stowage of 
experiments in the Spacehab were underway.  The STS-81 crew is
scheduled to arrive at about 10 p.m. EST on 1/8/97 and the
countdown clock is scheduled to begin at the T-43 hour mark at
7 a.m. Thursday, 1/9/97. 

<p><dd>  On 1/3/97, All Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) functional tests 
were complete.  The payload bay doors were open and payload operation
close-outs continue.  Functional tests on Atlantis's C-hatch (EVA hatch)
are complete and the hatch is closed for flight.  The countdown is
expected to begin on January 9, 1997. 

<p><dd>  On 12/17/96, The STS-81 crew successfully completed the Terminal
Countdown Demonstration Test and returned to their homes in Houston.
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) calibrations were also completed and
the pad was closed for normal access as work began on the loading of
hypergolic propellants into Atlantis.  Once the pad is opened again,
efforts will resume to complete the installation and functional checks
of the newly reworked airlock <A HREF="hatch.htm">hatch actuators</A> that failed on STS-80.
All actuators will be installed by 12/21/96 and functional checks
completed by 12/24/96. 

<p><dd> On 11/22/96, the new replacement fuel cell No. 2 has been installed
and interface connections and testing will be conducted 11/23/96.  The
payload bay doors are scheduled to be closed as early as Monday
night. External tank and solid rocket booster close-outs continue in
the Vehicle Assembly Building.  

<p><dd> On 11/20/96, removal of fuel cell No. 1 was complete. Due to concerns
with marginal pH levels, managers have decided to remove and replace
fuel cell No. 2, as well.  Today, managers are determining if this
work can be done with the Spacehab tunnel adapter in place or if the
tunnel must be removed.  

<p><dd> On 10/11/96, APU installation was complete. Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS)
pod functional checkout and fuel cell voltage tests were in work.  Close
outs continued on the mated left aft and left forward center segments of
STS-81's  stack in VAB hi-bay 1.

<H2>FIFTH SHUTTLE-MIR DOCKING FLIGHT</H2>


<H1 align=center> MIR RENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING</H1>

<p>
  Atlantis' rendezvous and docking with the Russian Space 
Station Mir actually begins with the precisely timed launch of the 
shuttle on a course for the Mir, and, over the next two days, 
periodic small engine firings that will gradually bring Atlantis 
to a point eight nautical miles behind Mir on docking day, the 
starting point for a final approach to the station.

<BR CLEAR="all">
  <B>Mir Rendezvous -- Flight Day 3</B>
<p>
       About two hours before the scheduled docking time on Flight 
Day Three of the mission, Atlantis will reach a point about eight 
nautical miles behind the Mir Space Station and conduct a Terminal 
Phase Initiation (TI) burn, beginning the final phase of the 
rendezvous. Atlantis will close the final eight nautical miles to 
Mir during the next orbit. As Atlantis approaches, the shuttle's 
rendezvous radar system will begin tracking Mir and providing 
range and closing rate information to Atlantis. Atlantis' crew 
also will begin air-to-air communications with the Mir crew using 
a VHF radio.
<p>
       As Atlantis reaches close proximity to Mir, the Trajectory 
Control Sensor, a laser ranging device mounted in the payload bay, 
will supplement the shuttle's onboard navigation information by 
supplying additional data on the range and closing rate. As 
Atlantis closes in on the Mir, the shuttle will have the 
opportunity for four small successive engine firings to fine-tune 
its approach using its onboard navigation information. Identical 
to prior Mir dockings, Atlantis will aim for a point directly 
below Mir, along the Earth radius vector (R-Bar), an imaginary 
line drawn between the Mir center of gravity and the center of 
Earth. Approaching along the R-Bar, from directly underneath the 
Mir, allows natural forces to assist in braking Atlantis' 
approach. During this approach, the crew will begin using a 
handheld laser ranging device to supplement distance and closing 
rate measurements made by other shuttle navigational equipment.
<p>
       The manual phase of  the rendezvous will begin just as 
Atlantis reaches a point about a half-mile below Mir. Commander 
Mike Baker will fly the shuttle using the aft flight deck controls 
as <A HREF="video/docking.qt">Atlantis begins moving up toward Mir</A> (896 K QuickTime.) Because of the approach 
from underneath Mir, Baker will have to perform very few braking 
firings. However, if  such firings are required, the shuttle's 
jets will be used in a mode called "Low-Z," a technique that uses 
slightly offset jets on Atlantis' nose and tail to slow the 
spacecraft rather than firing jets pointed directly at Mir. This 
technique avoids contamination of the space station and its solar 
arrays by exhaust from the shuttle steering jets.
<p>
       Using the centerline camera fixed in the center of Atlantis' 
docking mechanism, Baker will center Atlantis' docking mechanism 
with the Docking Module mechanism on Mir, continually refining 
this alignment as he approaches within 300 feet of the station.
<p>
       At a distance of about 30 feet from docking, Baker will stop 
Atlantis and stationkeep momentarily to adjust the docking 
mechanism alignment, if necessary. At that time, a final go or no-
go decision to proceed with the docking will be made by flight 
control teams in both Houston and Moscow.
<p>
        When Atlantis proceeds with docking, the shuttle crew will 
use ship-to-ship communications with Mir to inform the Mir crew of 
the shuttle's status and to keep them informed of major events, 
including confirmation of contact, capture and the conclusion of 
damping. Damping, the halt of any relative motion between the two 
spacecraft after docking, is performed by shock absorber-type 
springs within the docking device. Mission Specialist Jeff Wisoff 
will oversee the operation of the Orbiter Docking System from 
onboard Atlantis.
<p>
  <B>Undocking, Separation and Mir Fly-Around</B>
<p>
       Once Atlantis is ready  to undock from Mir, the initial 
separation will be performed by springs that will gently push the 
shuttle away from the docking module. Both the Mir and Atlantis 
will be in a mode called "free drift" during the undocking, a mode 
that has the steering jets of each spacecraft shut off to avoid 
any inadvertent firings.
<p>
       Once the docking mechanism's springs have pushed Atlantis 
away to a distance of about two feet from Mir, where the docking 
devices will be clear of one another, Atlantis' steering jets will 
be turned back on and fired in the Low-Z mode to begin slowly 
moving away from Mir.
<p>
       Atlantis will continue away from Mir to a distance of about 
600 feet, where Pilot Brent Jett will begin a flyaround of the 
station. Atlantis will circle Mir twice before firing its jets 
again to depart the vicinity of the station.
