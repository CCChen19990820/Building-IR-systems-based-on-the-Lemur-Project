It is a perplexing dilema for those that feel the love and difficult for those that see it from the outside. The Color of Love is  the bridge that will explore a universe toward understanding, a place of harmony, a place where love will conquer over injustice, a place where hopefully all will gain new insight toward a new one world philosophy of togetherness. Afterall, isn't that what we all desire, to be what we are and to be excepted as we are, no matter where we are from or what color our skin may be?</B>

<h1><b>Ebola Virus Hemorrhagic Fever:  General Information</b></h1>
<hr>
<b>What are viral hemorrhagic fevers?</b>
<p>
Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of diseases caused by viruses from four distinct families of viruses:  filoviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses.  The usual hosts for most of these viruses are rodents or arthropods (such as ticks and mosquitoes).  In some cases, such as Ebola virus, the natural host for the virus is unknown.  All forms of viral hemorrhagic fever begin with fever and muscle aches.  Depending on the particular virus, the disease can progress until the patient becomes very ill with respiratory problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems, and shock.  The severity of viral hemorrhagic fever can range from a relatively mild illness to death.
<p>

<b>What is Ebola virus?</b>
<p>
The Ebola virus is a member of a family of RNA viruses known as filoviruses.  When magnified several thousand times by an electron microscope, these viruses have the appearance of long filaments or threads.  Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 and was named for a river in Zaire, Africa, where it was first detected.  

<p>
<b>Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever:  How common is it? </b>
<p>
Until recently, only three outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever among people had been reported.  The first two outbreaks were in 1976: one in Zaire and one in western Sudan.  These were large outbreaks, resulting in more than 550 cases and 340 deaths.  The third outbreak, in 1979 in Sudan, was smaller, with 34 cases and 22 fatalities.  During each of these outbreaks, a majority of cases occurred in hospital settings under the challenging conditions of the developing world.  These conditions, including a lack of adequate medical supplies and the frequent reusing of needles and syringes, played a major role in the spread of disease.  The outbreaks were quickly controlled when appropriate medical supplies and equipment were made available and quarantine procedures were used.
<p>
The source of the Ebola virus in nature remains unknown. In an attempt to identify the source, investigators tested thousands of specimens from animals captured near the outbreak areas, but their efforts were unsuccessful.  Monkeys, like humans, appear to be susceptible to infection and may serve as a source of virus if infected.  
<p>


<b>What do we know about the recent outbreak of Ebola virus infection?</b>
<p>
The recent Ebola virus outbreak is centered in Kikwit, Zaire. (Kikwit is a city of 400,000 located 400 kilometers east of Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire.)  The outbreak appears to have started with a patient who had surgery in Kikwit on April 10, 1995.  Members of the surgical team then developed symptoms similar to those of a viral hemorrhagic fever disease.  Ebola hemorrhagic fever was suspected by a Belgium physician who reported the disease to the Zairian government.  At the request of Zairian health officials, medical teams from CDC, the World Health Organization, and from Belgium, France, and South Africa are collaborating to investigate and control the outbreak in Zaire.

<p>
<b>What are the symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever?</b>
<p>
Symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever begin 4 to 16 days after infection.  Persons develop fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and loss of appetite.  As the disease progresses, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sore throat, and chest pain can occur.  The blood fails to clot and patients may bleed from injection sites as well as into the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and internal organs.

<p>
<b>How is the Ebola virus spread from person to person?</b>
<p>
Ebola virus is spread through close personal contact with a person who is very ill with the disease.  In previous outbreaks, person-to-person spread frequently occurred among hospital care workers or family members who were caring for an ill person infected with Ebola virus.  Transmission of the virus has also occurred as a result of hypodermic needles being reused in the treatment of patients.  Reusing needles is a common practice in developing countries, such as Zaire and Sudan, where the health care system is underfinanced.  Medical facilities in the United States do not reuse needles.  
<p>
Ebola virus can also be spread from person to person through sexual contact.  Close personal contact with persons who are infected but show no signs of active disease is very unlikely to result in infection.  Patients who have recovered from an illness caused by Ebola virus do not pose a serious risk for spreading the infection.  However, the virus may be present in the genital secretions of such persons for a brief period after their recovery, and therefore it is possible they can spread the virus through sexual contact.  
<p>

<b>How is Ebola hemorrhagic fever diagnosed?</b>
<p>
A diagnosis is made by detection of Ebola antigens, antibody, or genetic material, or by culture of the virus from these sources.  Diagnostic tests are usually performed on clinical specimens that have been treated to inactivate (kill) the virus.  Research on Ebola virus must be done in a special high-containment laboratory to protect scientists working with infected tissues.
<p>

<b>How will health officials control the outbreak?</b>
<p>
Previous outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been limited.  These outbreaks were successfully controlled through the isolation of sick persons in a place requiring the wearing of mask, gown, and gloves; careful sterilization of needles and syringes; and proper disposal of waste and corpses.
<p>

<b>How do hospital personnel isolate an ill person?</b>
<p>
Hospital personnel isolate ill persons through a method called "barrier technique."  Barrier technique includes the following actions:  1) doctors and nurses wear gowns, mask, gloves, and goggles when caring for patients;  2) the patient's visitors are restricted;  3) disposable materials are removed from the room and burned after use; 4) all reusable materials are sterilized before reuse; and 5) since the virus is easily destroyed by disinfectants, all hard surfaces are cleaned with a sanitizing solution.
<p>

<b>Are persons in the United States at risk?</b>
<p>
Persons in the United States are at risk only if they have had close personal contact with patients in Zaire who are infected with Ebola virus.  There are no reports that infected persons have left the country of Zaire.  The Zairian government has quarantined all persons in the affected areas and restricted movement of persons in and out of these areas.  Any persons who wish to travel to Zaire are encouraged to contact the U.S. State Department (202-647-5225) for travel advisories.
<p>

<b>What is CDC's role in the outbreak investigation?</b>
<p>
CDC has sent three medical scientists to Zaire to assist with the investigation.  They will provide advice and assistance in helping to control the outbreak and prevent additional cases, collect specimens for diagnostic testing, study the clinical course of the disease in the ill persons, and look for others who may have been in contact with the infected individuals.  They will also be instruct the hospital staff in Zaire about how to limit the spread of the disease.  Efforts will also made to find the source of the infection.
<p>
CDC also has a role in educating the U.S. public about this outbreak and about the potential threat of emerging infectious diseases.  For the next several days, CDC will issue press releases and will inform the state health departments about any updates on the disease outbreak in Zaire.

<H3>HOW TO GIVE MEDICINE TO CHILDREN</H3><P>
</FORM>
</CENTER>
<BODY>
<CITE>by Rebecca D. Williams</CITE><P>
        "Open wide ... here comes the choo-choo."<P>
        When it comes to giving children medicine, a little imagination never hurts.<P>
        But what's more important is vigilance: giving the medicine at the right time at the right dose, avoiding interactions between drugs, watching out for tampering, and asking your child's doctor or the pharmacist about any concerns you may have.<P>
        Whether it's a prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drug, dispensing medicine properly to children is important. Given incorrectly, drugs may be ineffective or harmful.<P>

<STRONG>Read the Label</STRONG><P>
        "The most important thing for parents is to know what the drug is, how to use it, and what reactions to look for," says Paula Botstein, M.D., pediatrician and acting director of the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Drug Evaluation III. She recommends that a parent should ask the doctor or pharmacist a number of questions before accepting any prescription:<UL>
<LI>    What is the drug and what is it for?
<LI>    Will there be a problem with other drugs my child is taking?
<LI>    How often and for how long does my child need to take it?
<LI>    What if my child misses a dose?
<LI>    What side effects does it have and how soon will it start working?</UL>
        It's also a good idea to check the prescription after it has been filled. Does it look right? Is it the color and size you were expecting? If not, ask the pharmacist to explain.<P>
        Check for signs of tampering in any OTC product. The safety seal should be intact before opening. Also, parents should be extra careful to read the label of over-the-counter medicines.<P>
        "Read the label, and read it thoroughly," says Debra Bowen, M.D., an internist and director of FDA's medical review staff in the Office of OTC Drugs. "There are many warnings on there, and they were written for a reason. Don't use the product until you understand what's on the label."<P>
        Make sure the drug is safe for children. This information will be on the label. If the label doesn't contain a pediatric dose, don't assume it's safe for anyone under 12 years old. If you still have questions, ask the doctor or pharmacist.<P>
        Children are more sensitive than adults to many drugs. Antihistamines and alcohol, for example, two common ingredients in cold medications, can have adverse effects on young patients, causing excitability or excessive drowsiness. <A HREF="#aspirin">Some drugs, like aspirin, can cause serious illness or even death in children with chickenpox or flu symptoms</A>. Both alcohol and aspirin are present in some children's medications and are listed on the labels.<P>

<STRONG>Younger and Trickier</STRONG><P>
        The younger the child, the trickier using medicine is. Children under 2 years shouldn't be given any over-the-counter drug without a doctor's OK. Your pediatrician can tell you how much of a common drug, like acetaminophen (Tylenol), is safe for babies.<P>
        Prescription drugs, also, can work differently in children than adults. Some barbiturates, for example, which make adults feel sluggish, will make a child hyperactive. Amphetamines, which stimulate adults, can calm children.<P>
        When giving any drug to a child, watch closely for side effects.<P>
        "If you're not happy with what's happening with your child, don't assume that everything's OK," says Botstein. "Always be suspicious. It's better to make the extra calls to the doctor or nurse practitioner than to have a bad reaction to a drug."<P>
        And before parents dole out OTC drugs, they should consider whether they're truly necessary, Botstein says.<P>
        Americans love to medicate--perhaps too much. A study published in the October 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association found that more than half of all mothers surveyed had given their 3-year-olds an OTC medication in the previous month.<P>
        Not every cold needs medicine. Common viruses run their course in seven to 10 days with or without medication. While some OTC medications can sometimes make children more comfortable and help them eat and rest better, others may trigger allergic reactions or changes for the worse in sleeping, eating and behavior. Antibiotics, available by prescription, don't work at all on cold viruses.<P>
        "There's not a medicine to cure everything or to make every symptom go away," says Botstein. "Just because your child is miserable and your heart aches to see her that way, doesn't mean she needs drugs."<P>

<STRONG>Dosing Dilemmas</STRONG><P>
        The first rule of safety for any medicine is to give the right dose at the right time interval.<P>
        Prescription drugs come with precise instructions from the doctor, and parents should follow them carefully. OTC drugs also have dosing instruction on their labels. Getting the dosage right for an OTC drug is just as important as it is for a prescription drug.<P>
        Reactions and overdosing can happen with OTC products, especially if parents don't understand the label or fail to measure the medicine correctly. Similar problems can also occur when parents give children several different kinds of medicine with duplicate ingredients.<P>
        "People should exercise some caution about taking a bunch of medicines and loading them onto a kid," Botstein says.<P>
        Pediatric liquid medicines can be given with a variety of dosing instruments: plastic medicine cups, hypodermic and oral syringes, oral droppers, and cylindrical dosing spoons.<P>
        Whether they measure teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, or milliliters, these devices are preferable to using regular tableware to give medicines because one type of teaspoon may be twice the size of another. If a product comes with a particular measuring device, it's best to use it instead of a device from another product.<P>
        It's also important to read measuring instruments carefully. The numbers on the sides of the dosing instruments are sometimes small and difficult to read. In at least one case, they were inaccurate. In 1992, FDA received a report of a child who had been given two tablespoons of acetaminophen rather than two teaspoons because the cup had confusing measurements printed on it. The incident prompted a nationwide recall of medicines with dosage cups.<P>
        The following are some tips for using common dosing instruments:<UL>
<IMG ALIGN="right" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=254 HSPACE=10 SRC="/images/syringe.gif" ALT="[syringes]"><LI>     <EM>Syringes:</EM> Syringes are convenient for infants who can't drink from a cup. A parent can squirt the medicine in the back of the child's mouth where it's less likely to spill out. Syringes are also convenient for storing a dose. The parent can measure it out for a babysitter to use later. There are two kinds of syringes: oral syringes made specifically for administering medicine by mouth, and hypodermic syringes (for injections), which can be used for oral medication if the needles are removed. For safety, parents should remove the needle from a hypodermic syringe. Always remove the cap on the end of all syringes before injecting the medication into the child's mouth. The cap can pop off in the child's mouth and create a choking hazard. FDA is working with manufacturers to eliminate the safety hazards posed by the caps. Until then, parents must be extra cautious when using capped syringes.
<LI>    <EM>Droppers:</EM> These are safe and easy to use with infants and children too young to drink from a cup. Be sure to measure at eye level and administer quickly, because droppers tend to drip.
<LI>    <EM>Cylindrical dosing spoons:</EM> These are convenient for children who can drink from a cup but are likely to spill. The spoon looks like a test tube with a spoon formed at the top end. Small children can hold the long handle easily, and the small spoon fits easily in their mouths.
<LI>    <EM>Dosage cups:</EM> These are convenient for children who can drink from a cup without spilling. Be sure to check the numbers carefully on the side, and measure out liquid medicine with the cup at eye level on a flat surface.</UL>

<STRONG>FDA Proposes New Regulations</STRONG><P>
        FDA is working on changing the labels of over-the-counter medications to make them more eye-catching, easier to read, and consumer-friendly. One such label appears on the recently approved OTC version of children's Motrin.<P>
        For prescription drugs, FDA took measures in December 1994 to provide more information to health-care providers about use of those products in children. This rule was final in January 1995.<P>
        The agency now lets prescription drug manufacturers base pediatric labeling on data extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled adult studies, together with other information about safety and dosing in children. This is allowed as long as the agency concludes that the course of the disease and the drug's effects are sufficiently similar in children and adults.<P>
        Presently, most prescription drugs do not contain pediatric doses on their labels. A 1979 regulation required full clinical trials in children as the basis for pediatric labeling. Doctors who need to prescribe those drugs to children do so based on their own experience and reports in medical literature. The new regulations will give health-care providers more information to prescribe medicine for children safely.<P>
        In addition, FDA is taking steps to increase the numbers of drugs being tested in children, and the agency is working closely with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to conduct pediatric studies.<P>
        The goal of FDA's changes is to help ensure that whenever a child receives medication, it is as safe and effective as possible.<P>

<A NAME="aspirin"><HR></A>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Aspirin and Children</H2>
        Remember those orange-flavored baby aspirin tablets? They're not usually for kids anymore.<P>
        Children and teenagers should never take aspirin, or products containing aspirin or other salicylates, if they have chickenpox or flu symptoms or are recovering from these or other viral illnesses. Such aspirin use has been associated with Reye syndrome, a rare but serious condition that can cause death.<P>
        "The incidence of Reye syndrome has dropped dramatically," says Debbie Lumpkins, an FDA microbiologist in the Office of OTC Drugs, "but that doesn't mean it can't still happen."<P>
        FDA has proposed adding a more descriptive warning label on aspirin and other products containing salicylates. The label would describe symptoms of Reye syndrome in more detail than it does now.<P>
        To reduce fever safely in children, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen products.<P>

<B>DOCTORS SAY McDONALD'S LIES IN KIDS PROMOTION!</B><P>


WASHINGTON, D.C.,  The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a public-interest group
based in Washington D.C., has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the McDonald’s restaurant chain for use of false claims about the benefits of foods in the meat group.<P>
In a complaint to the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, the Physicians Committee states that McDonald’s ignores the abundance of medical evidence which proves that meat is harmful to human health. Instead, the Committee claims, McDonald’s has slickly produced a children’s promotional campaign which tells kids that they can "climb higher and ride their bikes farther" if they eat foods from the meat group. Although the meat group also includes beans and nuts, most of the foods in the group are high-fat animal products.<P>
The Physicians Committee insists that the concept that meat improves endurance was abandoned more that 100 years ago. Endurance depends on carbohydrates, which are abundant in grains, vegetables and beans. The organization of doctors has asked the FTC to intervene to stop McDonald’s from beginning the campaign.<P>
The Physicians Committee’s complaint to the FTC, which was released to the media , reads in part, "Telling kids they can climb higher and ride their bikes farther by eating foods in the meat group is like telling them they can get more homework done by watching TV. There is absolutely no evidence which supports their position.... Scientific evidence inextricably links meat to heart disease, some forms of cancer, diabetes and stroke."<P>
Studies has shown that the coronary artery blockages that ultimately lead to heart attacks begin in childhood. Studies during the Korean War showed that more than three-quarters of American soldiers had the beginnings of coronary artery blockages by age 23, mainly attributable to the meat-based diet American children consume. Diet also contributes to at least 35% of cancer deaths, and again meat is a major contributor, particularly to colon cancer.<P>
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has also written a letter to McDonald’s corporate headquarters explaining its objections to the promotion. The letter asks that McDonald’s offer vegetarian burgers and fresh fruit to its customers as a way of showing that it genuinely cares about the nutritional value of its products. The letter further asks that McDonald’s rewrite its promotional literature to teach children about the potential dangers of eating meat products.<P>
The McDonald’s campaign is being co-sponsored by the American Dietetic Association (ADA).<P>

<H3>HHS Issues Annual "Health, United States" Report, with Special Profile
of Women's Health......</H3><P>
</FORM>
</CENTER>
<BODY>

<B>HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala released a special report on the health of American women, as HHS issued the 20th edition of its annual report on the nation's health, Health, United States, 1995.</B><P>

Prepared by the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual report covers health status, health care resources and utilization, and health care expenditures. A special chartbook section this year tracks major trends in women's health and compares the health of women and men.<P> 

"We need to pay more attention to women's health issues," said Secretary Shalala. "Much of this report contains good news for women, but these statistics also tell us that there remains a great deal of work ahead. The Clinton Administration has committed to do its part toward improving the health of American women."<P> 

Since 1993, HHS has launched a number of initiatives aimed at special health needs for women. These include a first-ever National Breast Cancer Plan, as well as new efforts to counter domestic violence, including a new toll-free hot-line for reporting or discussing abuse (1-800-799-SAFE).<P> 

<B>Among the women's health highlights in this report:</B><P> 

Life expectancy at birth for U.S. women is 79 years now, up from 48 at the turn of the century and almost 7 years longer than for men. Death rates for most causes are higher for men than for women.<P> 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for all women, but for those ages 25-74, cancer is the leading cause of death and lung cancer the leading cause of cancer mortality.<P> 

Death rates due to smoking-related illnesses are rising rapidly among women. Between the early 1970s and the early 1990s, the incidence of lung cancer more than doubled and the death rate for lung cancer almost tripled among women. The death rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (includes asthma, bronchitis and emphysema) more than doubled for women between 1979 and 1993.<P> 

As tobacco use declined over the past few decades, the drop has been more notable for men. In 1965, 52 percent of men 18 years of age and older and 34 percent of women smoked; by 1990 men were only slightly more likely (28 percent) than women to smoke (23 percent), with little change from 1990 to the present.<P> 

The pattern of breast cancer incidence and mortality differs by race. Between 1973 and 1991 breast cancer incidence was 15-25 percent higher for white women, but mortality among black women is higher and that gap is increasing. In 1993, breast cancer mortality was 28 percent higher for black women.<P> 

The percent of women 50 years of age and older who had a mammogram in the past two years more than doubled between 1987 and 1993, from 27 to 60 percent. However, the use of mammography varied significantly by health care coverage. In 1993, women 50-64 years of age enrolled in HMOs were three times as likely to have a recent mammogram as women with no insurance.<P> 

Almost a third of adult women lead a sedentary life, and the proportion of women who are overweight has increased from 1 in 4 to 1 in 3 over the past decade.<P>  

AIDS and AIDS-opportunistic illnesses among women in the United States have been increasing, diminishing the gender differential in the prevalence and impact of AIDS. In 1985, AIDS-opportunistic illnesses were an estimated 13 times as prevalent among men as among women, but with the latest data for 1994, the rate among men was just under 5 times that for women.<P>  

Although men are still at higher risk than women for many fatal diseases, women are at higher risk for many nonfatal chronic conditions, including arthritis and osteoporosis. Severe or moderately reduced bone density affects 7 out of 10 women over age 50, and arthritis affected a third of women aged 45-64 and half of women age 65 and older.<P> 

Because many of the conditions that are more prevalent among women are disabling, middle- aged and older women are about 80 percent more likely than men to report difficulties taking care of themselves or their homes. And women are much more likely to be under the care of a home health agency.<P> 

Women, and particularly poor women, were much more likely to be victims of violent crime committed by an intimate (a current or former partner) or relative. In 1992-93, the victimization rate of women by intimates was nearly seven times as high for women as for men, and for women in the lowest income group more than 4 times that for women in the highest.<P>  

The annual Health, United States report provides a comprehensive survey of the major indicators of health in America. The report also examines health care resources and utilization:<P> 

According to the new report, HMO enrollment is increasing, with 18 percent of the population -- 46 million people --enrolled in health maintenance organizations in 1995. HMO enrollment ranged from 11 percent in the South to 29 percent in the West.<P> 

The age-adjusted proportion of persons with private health care coverage dropped from 77 to 70 percent for those under 65 years of age and there was a increase from 6 to 10 percent in the population covered by Medicaid between 1989 and 1994. <P> 

Health care coverage was closely associated with family income. Among persons with the lowest family income of less than $14,000, 35 percent were without health care coverage. The situation was little improved for those in the income group of $14,000 to $25,000, where 30 percent were without coverage. In the highest income group ($50,000 or more), only 6 percent had no health care coverage.<P>

<B>IT'S TURKEY TIME AGAIN, MAKE SURE YOUR SAFE!</B><P>

<body>


U.S. Department of Agriculture<br>
Food Safety and Inspection Service<br>
Washington, DC 20250      <br>
<h5>Consumer Education and Information</h5>
<h3><center>Timing's Not Everything</h3>
</center>
In the summer of 1995, USDA issued new guidelines for roasting whole turkeys. These changes
were based on a study conducted by the University of Georgia, which showed that the existing
USDA cooking times were longer than needed to assure safety and doneness. The data supported
reductions of 15 minutes to one hour, depending on the size of the bird.<p>

        "Some callers to USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline this past November indicated that their
turkeys did not reach 180&#176; F in the recommended times," said Diane Van, acting
supervisor of the hotline. "When we asked about their individual methods of roasting, some said
they had used deep pans, some had covered most of the bird with foil throughout most of the
cooking time, and some thought their turkeys were not completely thawed prior to roasting."<p>

        It appears that "timing's NOT everything." Recommended cooking <i>techniques</i> must also be
followed. A meat thermometer should be used to check the internal temperature of the bird in
<i>several places</i> for safety's sake and to prevent overcooking.<p>

Many variables can affect the roasting time of the whole bird:<p>


<ul>
  <li>A partially frozen bird requires longer cooking.</li>
  <li>Dark roasting pans cook faster than shiny metals.</li>
  <li>The depth and size of the pan can reduce heat circulation to all areas of the bird.</li>
  <li>The use of a foil tent for the entire time can slow cooking.</li>
  <li>Use of the roasting pan's lid speeds cooking.</li>
  <li>An oven cooking bag can accelerate cooking time.</li>
  <li>A stuffed bird takes longer to cook.</li>
  <li>The oven may heat food unevenly.</li>
  <li>Calibration of the oven's thermostat may be inaccurate.</li>
  <li>The rack position can have an affect on even cooking and heat circulation.</li>
  <li>A turkey or its pan may be too large for the oven, thus blocking heat circulation.</li>
  <li>The meat thermometer must be placed properly in the thigh joint.</li>
</ul>
        All these factors must be considered when roasting a turkey or any meat product. They can
lengthen or shorten the total cooking time. Safe cooking relies on a combination of factors and
the use of a meat thermometer.<p>

        The roasting methods or techniques used in the University of Georgia study to determine the new
<em>approximate</em> cooking times did show that turkeys were cooking faster. The new times are based
on cooking turkeys according to the following recommendations.<p>

<h4><center>ROASTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAFETY AND DONENESS:</h4>
</center>
<b>1. Set the oven temperature no lower than 325&#176; F.</b> Pre-heating is not necessary.<p>

<b>2. Be sure the turkey is completely thawed.</b> Times are based on fresh or completely thawed
frozen birds at a refrigerator temperature of about 40&#176; F or below.<p>

<b>3. Place turkey breast-side up on a flat wire rack in a shallow roasting pan 2 to 2 1/2 inches
deep.</b> Optional steps:<p>


<ul>
  <li>Tuck wing tips back under shoulders of bird (called "akimbo").</li>
  <li>Add one-half cup water to the bottom of the pan.</li>
  <li>In the beginning, a tent of aluminum foil may be place loosely over the breast of the turkey for
the first 1 to 1-1/2 hours, then removed for browning. Or, a tent of foil may be placed over the
turkey after the turkey has reached the desired golden brown.</li>
</ul>
<i>As part of the study, some birds were tented with foil for the entire cooking time; this increased
the cooking time required.</i><p>

<b>4. For uniform results, it is recommended to cook stuffing outside the bird. If stuffed, stuff
loosely. </b>It requires additional cooking time for the turkey and stuffing to reach a safe internal
temperature (turkey, 180&#176; F; and stuffing, 165&#176; F).<p>

<b>5. For safety and doneness, the internal temperature should be checked with a meat
thermometer.</b> Several types of thermometers are available on the market: regular, oven-proof;
instant read and digital; pop-up timers; and microwave-safe thermometers.<p>

        Make sure the thermometer you buy or use is designed for meat and poultry. At the beginning or
toward the end of the roasting time an oven-proof thermometer may be placed in the thigh joint of
the turkey to check the internal temperature at intervals during the cooking time. Or an instant-read may be used periodically to check the internal temperature during cooking.<p>

        After each use, wash the stem section of the thermometer thoroughly in hot, soapy water. Check
periodically to see if the "pop-up" temperature indicator device has activated indicating that the
bird has reached final temperature for safety and doneness. However, it is also suggested that the
temperature be checked with a conventional thermometer in several places.<p>

        <b>The temperature must reach a minimum of 180&#176; F in the thigh before removing
from the oven. The center of the stuffing should reach 165&#176; F after stand time.</b><p>

<p>

<b>6. Juices should be clear.</b> In the absence of a meat thermometer, pierce the turkey with a fork in
several places; juices should be clear with no trace of pink.<p>

<b>7. Let the bird stand 20 minutes before removing stuffing and carving.</b><p>

        The new roasting times are based on the recommendations above. These times are approximate
and should always be used in conjunction with a properly placed thermometer.<p>

                    E. Coli 0157:H7 OUTBREAK
       ASSOCIATED WITH ODWALLA BRAND APPLE JUICE PRODUCTS
 
     Odwalla, Inc., in cooperation with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), is announcing the voluntary recall of all
Odwalla brand apple juice products, as well as all Odwalla brand
blended juice products containing apple juice, because these
products have been epidemiologically linked with an outbreak of
Escherichia coli 0157:H7 illnesses.
     To date, thirteen cases of E. Coli 0157:H7 illness have been
confirmed by laboratory cultures of stool samples, and an
epidemiological investigation conducted by the Seattle-King
County Department of Public Health and the Washington State
Department of Health has shown that at least ten of these 13
patients had consumed Odwalla brand apple juice in the Seattle,
Wash., area.  Onset of illness occurred between approximately
October 15 and October 24, 1996.
     Consumers are advised not to consume any Odwalla brand fruit
juices that contain apple juice.  Persons who have developed a
diarrheal illness within two weeks after consuming and Odwalla
product that contains apple juice may wish to consult their
physician.  Consumers with questions about E. Coli 0157:H7
illness should contact their local or state department of health.
Persons who consumed the apple juice but do not develop illness
are not at risk for complications and do not need to seek medical
care.
     E. coli 0157:H7 causes a diarrheal illness, often with
bloody stools.  Most persons recover completely within a week.
However, some develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic
Uremic Syndrome (HUS).
     Odwalla brand fruit juices are produced by Odwalla, Inc.,
Half Moon Bay, Calif.  The firm is voluntarily recalling all of
its products that contain apple juice and is cooperating fully
with local, state, and Federal officials.
     Odwalla is recalling its pure apple juice as well as 12
other juice products that, despite their names, also contain
apple juice.  The following products, all of which contain apple
juice, are being recalled:
         Apple Juice                  Mo'Beta
         Blackberry Fruitshake        Femme Vitale
         Mango Tango                  Strawberry C-Monster
         Super Protein                Superfood
         Strawberry Banana Smoothie   Serious Ginseng
         Raspberry smoothie           Deep in Peach
         C-Monster
 
     The following Odwalla products that do not contain apple
juice are not affected by this recall:
         Water                        Lemonade
         Orange Juice                 Strawberry Lemonade
         Grapefruit Juice             Lemon Juice
         Carrot                       Lime Juice
         Organic Carrot               Menage A Tropique
         All Vegetable Cocktail       C-Monster Light
 
     Odwalla's apple juice products have been distributed in
seven states -- California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Texas and Washington -- as well as British Columbia, Canada.
     The current investigation of cases of E. coli 0157:H7
associated with Odwalla brand apple juice products is continuing,
to determine definitively how this outbreak occurred.

<B>On the Teen Scene: Eating Disorders Require Medical Attention</B><P>

by Dixie Farley<P>

<B>This article is part of a series with important health information for teenagers.</B><P>

For reasons that are unclear, some people--mainly young women--develop potentially life-threatening eating disorders called bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. People with bulimia, known as bulimics, indulge in bingeing (episodes of eating large amounts of food) and purging (getting rid of the food by vomiting or using laxatives). People with anorexia, whom doctors sometimes call anorectics, severely limit their food intake. About half of them also have bulimia symptoms.<P>

The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that 7,000 bulimia cases and 7,000 anorexia cases were diagnosed in 1993, the latest year for which statistics are available. Studies indicate that by their first year of college, 4.5 to 18 percent of women and 0.4 percent of men have a history of bulimia and that as many as 1 in 100 females between the ages of 12 and 18 have anorexia.<P>

Males account for only 5 to 10 percent of bulimia and anorexia cases. While people of all races develop the disorders, the vast majority of those diagnosed are white.<P>

Most people find it difficult to stop their bulimic or anorectic behavior without professional help. If untreated, the disorders may become chronic and lead to severe health problems, even death. The National Center for Health Statistics reports 62 deaths from anorexia and two deaths from bulimia in 1992, the latest year for which it has figures.<P>

As to the causes of bulimia and anorexia, there are many theories. One is that some young women feel abnormally pressured to be as thin as the "ideal" portrayed by magazines, movies and television. Another is that defects in key chemical messengers in the brain may contribute to the disorders' development or persistence.<P>

<B>The Bulimia Secret</B><P>

Once people begin bingeing and purging, usually in conjunction with a diet, the cycle easily gets out of control. While cases tend to develop during the teens or early 20s, many bulimics successfully hide their symptoms, thereby delaying help until they reach their 30s or 40s. Several years ago, actress Jane Fonda revealed she had been a secret bulimic from age 12 until her recovery at 35. She told of bingeing and purging up to 20 times a day.<P>

Many people with bulimia maintain a nearly normal weight. Though they appear healthy and successful--"perfectionists" at whatever they do--in reality, they have low self-esteem and are often depressed. They may exhibit other compulsive behaviors. For example, one physician reports that a third of his bulimia patients regularly engage in shoplifting and that a quarter of the patients have suffered from alcohol abuse or addiction at some point in their lives.<P>

While normal food intake for a teenager is 2,000 to 3,000 calories in a day, bulimic binges average about 3,400 calories in 1 1/4 hours, according to one study. Some bulimics consume up to 20,000 calories in binges lasting as long as eight hours. Some spend $50 or more a day on food and may resort to stealing food or money to support their obsession.<P>

To lose the weight gained during a binge, bulimics begin purging by vomiting (by self-induced gagging or with an emetic, a substance that causes vomiting) or by using laxatives (50 to 100 tablets at a time), diuretics (drugs that increase urination), or enemas. Between binges, they may fast or exercise excessively.<P>

Extreme purging rapidly upsets the body's balance of sodium, potassium, and other chemicals. This can cause fatigue, seizures, irregular heartbeat, and thinner bones. Repeated vomiting can damage the stomach and esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach), make the gums recede, and erode tooth enamel. (Some patients need all their teeth pulled prematurely). Other effects include various skin rashes, broken blood vessels in the face, and irregular menstrual cycles.<P>

<B>Complexities of Anorexia</B>

While anorexia most commonly begins in the teens, it can start at any age and has been reported from age 5 to 60. Incidence among 8- to 11-year-olds is said to be increasing.<P>

Anorexia may be a single, limited episode with large weight loss within a few months followed by recovery. Or it may develop gradually and persist for years. The illness may go back and forth between getting better and getting worse. Or it may steadily get more severe.<P>

Anorectics may exercise excessively. Their preoccupation with food usually prompts habits such as moving food about on the plate and cutting it into tiny pieces to prolong eating, and not eating with the family.<P>

Obsessed with weight loss and fear of becoming fat, anorectics see normal folds of flesh as "fat" that must be eliminated. When the normal fat padding is lost, sitting or lying down brings discomfort not rest, making sleep difficult. As the disorder continues, victims may become isolated and withdraw from friends and family.<P>

The body responds to starvation by slowing or stopping certain bodily processes. Blood pressure falls, breathing rate slows, menstruation ceases (or, in girls in their early teens, never begins), and activity of the thyroid gland (which regulates growth) diminishes. Skin becomes dry, and hair and nails become brittle. Lightheadedness, cold intolerance, constipation, and joint swelling are other symptoms. Reduced fat causes the body temperature to fall. Soft hair called lanugo forms on the skin for warmth. Body chemicals may get so imbalanced that heart failure occurs.<P>

Anorectics who additionally binge and purge impair their health even further. The late recording artist Karen Carpenter, an anorectic who used syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, died after buildup of the drug irreversibly damaged her heart.<P>

<B>Getting Help</B><P>

<B>Early treatment is vital. As either disorder becomes more entrenched, its damage becomes less reversible.</B><P>

Usually, the family is asked to help in the treatment, which may include psychotherapy, nutrition counseling, behavior modification, and self-help groups. Therapy often lasts a year or more--on an outpatient basis unless life-threatening physical symptoms or severe psychological problems require hospitalization. If there is deterioration or no response to therapy, the patient (or parent or other advocate) may want to talk to the health professional about the plan of treatment.<P>

<B>There are no drugs approved specifically for bulimia or anorexia, but several, including some antidepressants, are being investigated for this use.</B><P>

If you think a friend or family member has bulimia or anorexia, point out in a caring, nonjudgmental way the behavior you have observed and encourage the person to get medical help. If you think you have bulimia or anorexia, remember that you are not alone and that this is a health problem that requires professional help. As a first step, talk to your parents, family doctor, religious counselor, or school counselor or nurse.<P>

Dixie Farley is a staff writer for FDA Consumer.<P>



                                 <B> Disorders' Definitions</B><P>

According to the American Psychiatric Association, a person diagnosed as bulimic or anorectic must have all of that disorder's specific symptoms:<P>

<B>Bulimia Nervosa</B><P>

Recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months) a feeling of lack of control over eating during the binges regular use of one or more of the following to prevent weight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or diuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise persistent over-concern with body shape and weight. <P>

<B>Anorexia Nervosa</B><P>

Refusal to maintain weight that's over the lowest weight considered normal for age and height intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight distorted body image in women, three consecutive missed menstrual periods without pregnancy. <P>

<B>ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SHOULD COMPLEMENT TREATMENT OF
CHRONIC PAIN AND INSOMNIA</B><P>
<B>Medical and surgical approaches alone have failed!</B><P>
<B>CHICAGO--</B>Treating chronic pain and insomnia can be much more effective by combining behavioral and relaxation techniques with traditional interventions such as drugs and surgery, according to a special communication in this week's issue of <B>The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA</B>).<P> 
A 12-member, nonfederal technology assessment panel of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made the recommendation following a three- day conference in which 23 experts presented data.<P> 
<B>Panel members write:</B> "(We) found strong evidence for the use of relaxation techniques in reducing chronic pain in a variety of medical conditions as well as strong evidence for the use of hypnosis in alleviating pain associated with cancer. The evidence was moderate for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral techniques and biofeedback in relieving chronic pain. Regarding insomnia, behavioral techniques, particularly relaxation and biofeedback, produce improvements in some
aspects of sleep, but it is questionable whether the magnitude of the improvement in sleep onset and total sleep time are clinically significant." Enhancing Chronic Pain Relief.<P>
<B>Relaxation techniques</B> generally achieve nondirect relaxation through two basic components: 1) repetitive focus on a word, sound, prayer, phrase, body sensation, or muscular activity; and  2) the adoption of a passive attitude toward intruding thoughts and a return to focus. The panel reviewed information showing that relaxation techniques appear to alter pain transmission in the body by decreasing oxygen consumption, lowering respiratory and heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and
increasing certain brain waves called the electroencephalographic slow waves.<P> 
Hypnosis has been shown to help reduce several types of pain, including lower back and burn pain, by changing pain perception through intense relaxation. The panel says information also suggests that hypnosis can block pain from entering consciousness through various brain functions.<P> 
The panel found cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to be moderately effective in altering pain intensity. Depression and anxiety has been shown to increase subjective complaints of pain. CBT can reduce depression and anxiety, as well as alter a patient's expectation about pain and increase the feeling of self control.<P> 
<B>Enhancing Treatment of Insomnia:</B><P>
The panel examined information finding some improvement in treating insomnia with relaxation and biofeedback. Relaxation can reduce cognitive and physiological arousal, thus allowing the body to fall asleep more easily with fewer sleep interruptions. Biofeedback is a technique that allows an individual to gain some control over automatic body functions.<P> 
<B>Barriers to Integration of Alternative Therapies:</B><P>
The panel admits that it may be difficult to integrate these therapies into mainstream treatment. One barrier is the sole emphasis on biomedics in medical education. Other barriers include a lack of standard methodology to assess the success or failure of these interventions, a low compliance rate on the part of the patient because these interventions are time-intensive, and an unwillingness on the part of some insurance companies to provide reimbursement for certain treatments.<P> 
<B>The panel writes:</B> "Although specific structural, bureaucratic, financial, and attitudinal barriers exist to the integration of these techniques, all are potentially surmountable with education and additional research, as patients shift from being passive participants in their treatment to becoming responsible, active partners in their rehabilitation." <P>
Information cited in the report says chronic pain and insomnia afflict millions of Americans, costing the United States billions of dollars as a consequence of functional impairment. The panel was convened by NIH to evaluate available scientific information related to the treatment of chronic pain and insomnia because, "to date, conventional medical and surgical approaches have failed, at considerable expense."<P><HR>

<H3>Plain Talk About... Wife Abuse</H3><P>
</FORM>
</CENTER>
<BODY>




 
<B>* "To have and to hold. . . to love and to cherish. . . "</B><P>

<B>* "Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home. "</B><P>

     <B>These sentiments reflect the feelings of most people toward
marriage, home, and family--but not all. The surprising fact is that a
lot of violence, bringing fear and pain, is reported among family
members.</B><P>

     For example, about one-quarter of all murders in the United States
take place within the family. Surveys of American couples show that 20
to 50 percent have suffered violence regularly in their marriages. The
records indicate that between two and four million incidents of domestic
violence occur every single year. Wife abuse is one kind of family
violence that probably occurs far more often than most people imagine.
The tragedy is that many women suffer this abuse for years without
getting help. This flier explores what wife abuse is, who experiences
it, some reasons it occurs, the pattern it usually takes, and why women
don't get help. Finally, it looks at what women can do if they are
abused and how, ultimately, the abuse might be prevented.<P>

<B>WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "WIFE ABUSE"?</B><P>

     Defining wife abuse or wife battering is not easy. For starters,
whom are we thinking of when we use the word "wife"? Actually, any woman
who maintains an intimate relationship with a man (her husband,
ex-husband, boyfriend or lover) could become a battered or abused
"wife." The words "abused" or "battered" which are used here do not
refer to the normal conflict and stress that occur in all close
relationships, but rather to the violence that can cause serious injury
and death. In the pamphlet "Assaults on Women: Rape and Wife-beating,"
Natalie Jaffe cites a typical description of the kind of physical harm
suffered by battered women surveyed in shelters and treatment in
California<P>

     "Most injuries were to the head and neck and, in addition to
bruises, strangle marks, black eyes, and split lips, resulted in eye
damage, fractured jaws, broken noses, and permanent hearing loss.
Assaults to the trunk of the body were almost as common and produced a
broken collarbone, bruised and broken ribs, a fractured tailbone,
internal hemorrhaging, and a lacerated liver."<P>

     These are serious consequences of serious assaults. Another serious
aspect is that once wife beating occurs, it is likely to happen again
and again, with violence getting worse over time.<P>

<B>A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THE ABUSED WOMAN FEELS
</B><P>
     A woman who has been abused over a long period of time is afraid.
Not only is she afraid that she, herself, will be seriously hurt, but if
she has children, she fears for their safety also. Her feelings of fear
link her to all other women, from all classes of society, in similar
situations.<P>

     Fear might be a woman's first and most immediate feeling during or
after a beating, but other negative feelings may surface when she is not
in physical danger. The abused woman is apt to develop doubts about
herself. She might wonder if she is justified in fearing for her life
and calling herself an "abused wife." Most likely, however, a woman who
thinks or feels she is being abused, probably is.<P>

     Or, she may feel guilty, even though she's done nothing wrong. An
abused wife may feel responsible for her husband's violence because in
some way she may have provoked him. This has her placing the shame and
blame on herself--instead of her abuser. The longer she puts up with the
abuse and does nothing to avoid or prevent it, the less she likes
herself. Along with the feeling of being a failure, both as a woman and
in her marriage, may come a real feeling of being trapped and powerless,
with no way out.<P>

<B>WHY DO MEN ABUSE THEIR WIVES?</B><P>

     Instances of wife abuse have been on record in the United States
since the 1830s, but only every now and then does it arouse public
concern. Generally, public opinion supports traditional family relations
and male authority. The battering syndrome is both cause and effect of
stereotyped roles and the unequal power relations between men and women.
No social class is exempt. Wife abuse occurs in wealthy as well as in
poor communities--in middle class as well as in working class families.
Over the years it has been tolerated by those who govern community
affairs, the courts, medicine, psychiatry, police, schools, and the
church. History shows that the helping professions often protected
patterns of family authority, unwittingly sanctioning wife abuse rather
than condemning it.<P>

     In present-day society, violence in the movies, on TV, and in the
newspapers is familiar and accepted. Many husbands who abuse their wives
have learned that violence, especially against women, is okay. They
often were abused themselves as children or saw their mothers abused.
The battered wife most likely grew up in a similar environment.<P>

     There are other psychological reasons. A wife abuser tends to be
filled with anger, resentment, suspicion, and tension. He also,
underneath all his aggressive behavior, can be insecure and feel like a
loser. He may use violence to give vent to the bad feelings he has about
himself or his lot in life. Home is one place he can express those
feelings without punishment to himself. If he were angry with his boss
and struck him, he would pay the price. But all too often he gets away
without penalty when he beats his wife. She becomes the target of his
vengeance, and he gets the satisfaction he's looking for.<P>

     What about the victimized wife? If she accepts her husband's
traditional male authority, she may be labeled as immature. If she
fights back or if she refuses to sleep with him if he's drunk, she might
be accused of being hostile, domineering, and masculine. These are
complaints of abused women.<P>

<B>PATTERNS</B><P>

     Familiar patterns of wife abuse often develop in three phases: the
tension-building phase, the explosion or the actual beating phase, and
the loving phase.<P>

     The tension builds over a series of small occurrences such as a
wife's request for money, her refusal to do all the household chores
without her husband's help, her serving a meal not pleasing to him, or a
similar incident. What follows is inevitable. She may become the object
of any or all of the following assaults: punching with fists, choking,
kicking, knifing, slamming against a wall, throwing to the floor, or
shoving down the stairs. Sometimes even threats with a gun have been
reported.<P>

     When the beating is over, the couple move into the third phase. The
batterer feels guilty about what he has done. He is sorry and may become
loving toward her. He assures his wife that he will never do anything
violent or hurtful to her again. At that moment, he may believe he will
never hurt her again. She wants to believe him, hoping that he will
change. However, even with professional help, the tension building and
the beatings may continue.<P>

<B>WHY DO WOMEN STAY?</B><P>

     Women have learned that it may be their own feelings of fear,
guilt, or shame that keep them in a relationship that is physically
abusive. Often, social and economic pressures compel a woman to stay.
Sometimes she stays for lack of somewhere to go for shelter and advice
or because she feels that she loves her husband and lives with the hope
that he might change, if only she can "hang in there." Tragically, in
most cases, the abuse continues, for in fact her husband's behavior has
nothing to do with her actions.<P>

     Other reasons for staying with him may seem as compelling. A woman
may feel that a divorce is wrong and that she should keep her marriage
together at all costs. Perhaps she feels her children need a father. She
may be isolated with no outside job and few friends. The friends and
relatives she does talk to may give her little support, perhaps because
her situation frightens them and they don't want to admit to themselves
that such violence could occur. If she confides in a counselor, she may
also be encouraged to "save the marriage." And, along with her emotional
dependence, she may worry about being able to find a job to support
herself and her children. If she has her husband arrested, he may not be
able to support her. If she doesn't have him arrested, he may beat her
even more severely for trying to leave him. Is there a way out? Most
women suffer these attacks for years before they finally find the
courage and determination to take steps to keep from being victims of
further abuse.<P>


<B>WHAT CAN A BATTERED WOMAN DO?</B><P>

     The first step for a woman to take is to admit to herself that she
is being abused and that she is not being treated fairly. She has the
right to feel safe from physical harm, especially in her own home.<P>

<B>EMERGENCY ACTION</B><P>

     A woman can do a number of things to protect herself. She can hide
extra money, car keys, and important documents somewhere safe so that
she can get to them in a hurry. The phone number of the police
department should be handy. She should have a place to go, such as an
emergency shelter, a social service agency, or the home of a trusted
friend or relative.<P>

     During an actual attack, the woman should defend herself as best
she can. As soon as she is able, she should call the police and get
their names and badge numbers in case she needs a record of the attack.
Most importantly, she should leave the house and take her children with
her. She may need medical attention, too, because she might be hurt more
severely than she realizes. Having a record of her injuries, including
photographs, can protect her legally should she decide to press charges.<P>

<B>LONG-RANGE PLANS</B><P>

     A woman needs to talk to people who can help. Good friends can lend
support and guidance. Organizations that are devoted to women's concerns
and not bound by society's traditions can assist her. They might help
her explore her options in new ways. Emergency shelters for women,
hotlines, women's organizations, social service agencies, community
mental health centers, and hospital emergency rooms are all possible
sources of support. The following organizations have information about
State contacts and shelters where a battered woman can go for help:<P>

<B>*  Center for Women Policy Studies<P>
   2000 P Street, NW, No. 508<P>
   Washington, DC 20036<P>
   (202) 872-1770<P></B>

<P>

     <B>Above all, a woman has to determine her own best course of action.</B><P>

Positive measures such as confiding in a relative on whom she can
depend, talking seriously with a trusted friend, or consulting with a
sympathetic counselor are steps in the right direction. With the help of
informal and formal help sources, including individual counseling for
the husband as well as her- self, a woman may be able to bring an end to
the problem.<P>

     It has been observed that abused women need to develop better
feelings about themselves--that is, change their self- image. In her
book "Stopping Wife Abuse," Jennifer Baker Fleming says the following
attitudes are positive and useful:<P>

 <B> * I am not to blame for being beaten and abused.<P>
  * I am not the cause of another's violent behavior.<P>
  * I do not like it or want it.<P>
  * I do not have to take it.<P>
  * I am an important human being.<P>
  * I am a worthwhile woman.<P>
  * I deserve to be treated with respect.<P>
  * I do have power over my own life.<P>
  * I can use my power to take good care of myself.<P>
  * I can decide for myself what is best for me.<P>
  * I can make changes in my life if I want to.<P>
  * I am not alone. I can ask others to help me.<P>
  * I am worth working for and changing for.<P>
  * I deserve to make my own life safe and happy.<P></B>

<B>PREVENTION</B><P>

     Since there is no one cause of wife abuse, there is no easy way to
prevent it. Until society rejects its tolerance and acceptance of
violence for resolving conflict and expressing anger, meaningful changes
in family relationships will not occur. Prevention starts with people
changing their attitudes toward violence and women. No one deserves to
be beaten or physically threatened, no matter what the excuse. It is a
crime to beat anyone--a stranger, a friend, or your wife--and the law
should be enforced. The tolerance of family violence as a way of life in
one generation encourages family violence in another generation. Since
the wife abuser didn't learn to deal with anger appropriately as a
child, he handles his frustrations through aggression. He needs to know
that it's human to feel anger, but inhuman to release those feelings by
beating others. By learning to deal with these emotions through
acceptable behavior, he can gain respect for himself and others. It's
another positive step toward developing mutual respect in the
husband/wife relationship where each sees the other as a worthy human
being.<P>

<h1>BETA CAROTENE AND VITAMIN A HALTED IN LUNG
CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL</h1>
 <p>

Beta Carotene and Vitamin A Halted in Lung Cancer Prevention Trial Investigators conducting
the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), a large study of the combination of beta
carotene and vitamin A as preventive agents for lung cancer in high-risk men and women,
terminated the intervention last week after an average of four years of treatment and told the
18,314 participants to stop taking their vitamins. Interim study results indicate that the
supplements provide no benefit and may be causing harm.  <p>

Investigators in another trial, the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, said today that their study of 22,071
U.S. male physicians ended on schedule, Dec. 31, 1995, after more than 12 years of treatment.
The study showed no significant evidence of benefit or harm from beta carotene on cancer or
cardiovascular disease. <p>

Both studies have been funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of
<strong>Health</strong> (NIH). The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study was also funded by NIH's National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute.<p>

CARET's lead investigator, Gilbert S. Omenn, M.D., Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center and the University of Washington School of Public <strong>Health</strong> in Seattle, explained
that regular independent review of the study data showed that lung cancer incidence was unlikely
to be reduced by the daily intervention of 30 milligrams (mg) of beta carotene and 25,000
international units (IU) of vitamin A by the scheduled end of the study and that there was a
substantial possibility that the supplements might be harming the participants, who are smokers,
former smokers, and men exposed to asbestos on the job. <p>

 <p>

CARET results to date, including 388 people diagnosed with lung cancer and 974 deaths from all
causes, showed 28 percent more lung cancers and 17 percent more deaths in participants taking
beta carotene and vitamin A. While these interim results are not significant evidence of harm from
a statistical standpoint, they are similar to the results of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene
(ATBC) Lung Cancer Prevention Trial published in 1994, which showed 18 percent more lung
cancers and 8 percent more deaths in the portion of the 29,133 male smokers in Finland who took
20 mg of beta carotene daily for five to eight years.<p>

 <p>

Letters asking the 18,314 CARET participants to stop taking their vitamin supplements or
placebos were mailed Jan. 13. Investigators plan to follow the participants for at least five more
years to determine the long-term effects of the intervention, which was interrupted 21 months
early. Omenn said that CARET data also raise the possibility that former smokers, who comprised
34 percent of the participants when recruited, may respond more favorably to vitamin A and beta
carotene than current smokers, but that the data are too limited to draw any conclusions at this
time. Results from the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, the trial of 22,071 U.S. male physicians taking 50
mg of beta carotene or a placebo every other day for 12 years, showed that beta-carotene
supplements had no significant effect -- positive or negative -- on cancer or cardiovascular disease
in this population of mostly nonsmokers (11 percent are current smokers while 51 percent
smoked at some time in their life). Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., of Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, headed this study, which showed in 1988
that low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of a first heart attack.<p>

 <p>

In response to the lack of benefit seen in CARET, the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, and the ATBC
trial, another ongoing trial is removing beta carotene supplements from its intervention. The
Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study, a trial of 40,000 female <strong>health</strong> professionals, headed by Julie Buring,
Sc.D., of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, began in 1992. The study
will continue to evaluate every-other-day doses of 600 IU of vitamin E and 100 mg of aspirin or
placebos.  <p>

<p>

<h4>Public <strong>Health</strong> Concern </h4>
 <p>

The results of CARET and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study provide strong evidence of no benefit
from beta carotene supplements and raise questions about their safety for the general public. "The
National Cancer Institute has never had a recommendation for Americans to take supplements,"
said Peter Greenwald, M.D., Dr.P.H., director of NCI's Division of Cancer Prevention and
Control. "The best advice for smokers who want to reduce their risk of lung cancer is still the
most direct: Stop smoking. Results from CARET and the ATBC Trial do suggest, however, that
smokers should avoid beta carotene supplements."<p>

 Omenn underscored the "quit smoking" message by praising the many CARET participants who
were smokers at the beginning of the trial and who have quit during the study. Twenty-two
percent of those who smoked at the beginning of the trial have quit.<p>

 <p>

Greenwald continued, "For all Americans who wish to reduce their risk of lung and other cancers,
a low-fat diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains is the choice to make. These studies
show nothing to suggest that smokers or nonsmokers might benefit from beta carotene
supplements." Hennekens concurred, noting that "taken together, the results of CARET, ATBC,
and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study clearly tell us that beta-carotene supplementation is not a magic
bullet -- it can neither substitute for a good diet nor compensate for a bad one."<p>

 <p>

NCI Director Richard Klausner, M.D., praised the work of the researchers and participants of
CARET and the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study, as well as applauding the process of science. "Medicine
and public <strong>health</strong> must be based, whenever possible, on evidence. These trials discussed today
provide that essential evidence... While the results are disappointing, the research process, I
believe, is working."<p>

 <p>

<h4>CARET Background and Study Design  </h4>
The study is being conducted in six areas of the United States with a principal investigator at each
site and Omenn coordinating the trial. The six investigators and cities participating in CARET are:
Gary E. Goodman, M.D., Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Wash.; Barbara G.
Valanis, Dr.P.H., Kaiser Center for <strong>Health</strong> Research, Portland, Ore.; James P. Keogh, M.D.,
University of Maryland at Baltimore, Baltimore, Md.; John R. Balmes, M.D., University of
California-San Francisco, San Francisco, Calif.; Frank Meyskens, Jr., M.D., University of 
California-Irvine, Irvine, Calif.; Mark R. Cullen, M.D., Yale University School of Medicine, New
Haven, Conn. <p>

The study is comprised of two groups: 14,254 current and former smokers with a long history of
smoking and 4,060 asbestos-exposed individuals. The total number of participants is 18,314.   <p>

Recruited in Seattle, Portland, and Irvine were 14,254 men and women ages 50 to 69 who are
current smokers or are smokers who had quit within six years of enrolling in the study. Smokers 
and former smokers must have had a smoking history of at least 20 pack years (one pack per day
for 20 years or two packs for 10 years, etc). These participants are 56 percent male (7,965) and
44 percent female (6,289) and had an average of 50 pack years of smoking. About 34 percent
were former smokers when they joined the study. All participants were counseled to quit smoking
during their visits to the study centers. The racial distribution of the participants is 95 percent
white, 2 percent African-American, 1 percent Hispanic, and 2 percent Asian or other.<p>

 <p>

At five of the six centers (Irvine, Calif. excluded), 4,060 men ages 45 to 69 years who had been
exposed to asbestos while at work were enrolled in CARET. These participants had to have
extensive occupational asbestos exposure beginning at least 15 years earlier, determined by either
a chest X-ray that showed asbestos exposure or employment for more than five years in trades
that carry a high risk of exposure to asbestos: plumbers and pipefitters, steam fitters, shipyard
boilermakers, nonshipyard boilermakers, shipyard electricians, shipscalers, insulators, plasterboard
workers, or sheetmetal workers. In addition, they had to be either current smokers or had to have
quit smoking within the last 15 years. One- half the CARET participants in both groups took a
combination of beta carotene and vitamin A and one-half took inactive placebos. <p>

Beta carotene is an antioxidant, a compound that may prevent cancer-causing substances from
damaging DNA. Epidemiologic studies have linked high dietary intake of beta carotene and high
serum levels of this micronutrient to a reduced risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer. Vitamin A
was chosen for study because it is known to play a part in cell differentiation, a process of
"maturing" cells that helps prevent them from inappropriate growth, such as the uncontrolled cell
growth that is seen in cancer. Vitamin A (retinol) and its analogues have been shown to be
effective in preventing cancers in animals exposed to chemicals like those in cigarette smoke. Beta
carotene and vitamin A were given as a combination under the hypothesis of a potentially
favorable interaction between the two compounds. The dose of beta carotene in CARET was 30
mg/day, which is equivalent to 50,000 IU of vitamin A or about five medium-sized carrots.
Vitamin A was given as retinyl palmitate in a dose of 25,000 IU.<p>

 <p>

<h4>Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study Background and Study Design</h4>
 <p>

The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study was conducted nationwide among 22,071 U.S. male physicians ages
40 to 84 years, 11 percent of whom were current smokers and 51 percent of whom had smoked at
some time in their life when recruited to the study in 1982. <p>

 <p>

The participants took either 50 mg of beta carotene every other day or a placebo and 325 mg of
aspirin or a placebo on the alternate day. The randomized aspirin component ended early, after
five years, primarily because a benefit of aspirin on risk of first heart attack was found (a 44
percent reduction was seen in those taking aspirin). The beta carotene treatment continued until
its scheduled termination on Dec. 31, 1995. Questions and Answers about these studies follow.<p>

 <p>

<h4>Questions and Answers: Beta Carotene Chemoprevention Trials</h4>
 <p>

1. What is a chemoprevention trial?  <p>

A chemoprevention trial is a type of clinical trial, which is a research study conducted with
people. In a cancer chemoprevention trial, natural or laboratory-made substances are tested to see
if they prevent cancer. The people who participate in such a study are healthy or are at risk of
developing cancer, or in some studies, people who have been diagnosed with cancer and are at
risk of developing a second cancer. <p>

 <p>

2. What is the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial?<p>

 <p>

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial or ATBC Trial was conducted by
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in collaboration with the National Public <strong>Health</strong> Institute of
Finland. The purpose of the study was to see if certain vitamin supplements would prevent lung
and other cancers in a group of 29,133 male smokers in Finland. The 50 to 69 year old
participants took a pill containing either 50 milligrams (mg) alpha tocopherol (a form of vitamin
E), 20 mg beta carotene (a precursor of vitamin A), both, or a placebo (inactive pill that looks like
the vitamin) daily for five to eight years.<p>

 <p>

3. What is the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial or CARET?<p>

 <p>

The Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial or CARET is a large chemoprevention trial that is
being conducted in six areas in the United States and is funded by NCI. The purpose of the study
was to see if the combination of beta carotene and vitamin A (a retinol) supplements would
prevent lung and other cancers in men and women who are smokers or former smokers ages 50 to
69 years, and men who have been exposed to asbestos ages 45 to 69 years. The 18,314
participants stopped taking the supplements prior to the completion of the trial.<p>

 <p>

4. What is the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study?<p>

 <p>

The Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study is a chemoprevention trial with 22,071 male U.S. physicians, of
which only 11 percent smoked. The purpose of the study was to test whether a beta carotene
supplement reduces the risk of cancer and heart disease as well as whether low-dose aspirin
reduced the risk of heart disease. The aspirin component was stopped in early 1988 due to a 44
percent reduction in risk of first heart attack among those taking aspirin. The beta carotene
component ended Dec. 31, 1995 after more than 12 years of study. <p>

 <p>

5. What did these trials show?<p>

 <p>

In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial, 18 percent more lung cancers
were diagnosed and 8 percent more overall deaths occurred in study participants taking beta
carotene. In CARET, after an average of four years of receiving supplements, 28 percent more
lung cancers were diagnosed and 17 percent more deaths occurred in participants taking beta
carotene and vitamin A than in those taking placebos. Neither of these studies showed a benefit
from taking supplements. <p>

 <p>

Because the interim results of CARET were similar to the ATBC study, the intervention was
stopped 21 months early. Both of these studies involved persons who were specifically invited to
participate because of their high risk for developing lung cancer.  The Physician's <strong>Health</strong> Study
was completed at the end of 1995 and showed no benefit or harm in people taking beta carotene
supplements for more than 12 years. <p>

 <p>

6. Why did CARET stop early?<p>

 <p>

The study itself was not stopped, but the participants were told to stop taking the beta carotene
and vitamin A or placebos. The Safety and Endpoints Monitoring Committee for CARET and an
ad hoc committee assembled by NCI saw that the interim results clearly showed no benefit from
the supplements and also showed there was a possibility that they were harming participants.
CARET investigators made the decision to stop the intervention, but they will follow the study
group for five more years to determine the long-term effects of the intervention.<p>

 <p>

The intervention was halted on Jan. 11, 1996 by the CARET investigators. Letters were mailed to
participants by Jan. 13 and a public announcement made Jan. 18.  <p>

<p>

7. Who were the participants in CARET?<p>

 <p>

The study had two groups: 14,254 current and former smokers with a long history of smoking
and 4,060 asbestos-exposed individuals.  The smokers and former smokers included 14,254 men
and women ages 50 to 69 who are current smokers or are smokers who had quit within six years
of enrolling in the study. Smokers and former smokers must have had a smoking history of at least
20 pack years (one pack per day for 20 years or two packs for 10 years, etc). These participants
are 56 percent male (7,965) and 44 percent female (6,289) and had an average of 50 pack years of
smoking. About 34 percent were former smokers when they joined the study. All participants
were counseled to quit smoking at their visits to the study centers.<p>

 <p>

The asbestos-exposed participants were 4,060 men ages 45 to 69 years who had been exposed to
asbestos while at work. These participants had to have extensive occupational asbestos exposure
beginning at least 15 years prior to enrollment, determined by either a chest X-ray that showed
asbestos exposure or employment for more than five years in trades that carry a high risk of
exposure to asbestos: plumbers and pipefitters, steam fitters, shipyard boilermakers, nonshipyard
boilermakers, shipyard electricians, shipscalers, insulators, plasterboard workers, or sheetmetal
workers. In addition, they had to be either current smokers or had to have quit smoking within the
last 15 years.  <p>

8. What is beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

Beta carotene, which is found in plants, is a precursor of vitamin A. The body converts beta
carotene to vitamin A. It occurs mainly in fruits and vegetables that are deep yellow, orange, or
dark green in color, such as carrots, squash, yams, peaches, apricots, spinach, collard or mustard
greens, and broccoli. It is an antioxidant, a compound that may prevent cancer-causing substances
from damaging DNA. Epidemiologic studies have linked high intake of foods rich in beta carotene
and high serum levels of the micronutrient to a reduced risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer.<p>

 <p>

9. What is vitamin A?<p>

 <p>

Vitamin A is a vitamin, a substance found in foods that is necessary for human <strong>health</strong>. Vitamin A
is found in liver, various dairy products with fat, such as milk, cheese, butter and ice cream, and in
fatty fish such as herring, sardines, and tuna. It can also be found in the liver oils of shark, cod,
and halibut.<p>

Vitamin A is known to play a part in cell differentiation, a process by which cells "mature."
Differentiation helps prevent cells from inappropriate growth, such as the uncontrolled cell
growth that is seen in cancer. Many studies in animals show that vitamin A and similar compounds
decrease the incidence of cancer.<p>

 <p>

10. Should Americans who smoke avoid taking beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

The NCI has never had a recommendation for Americans to take supplements. The best advice for
smokers who want to reduce their risk of lung cancer is still the most direct: Stop smoking. The
results from CARET and the ATBC Trial suggest that smokers should avoid taking beta carotene
supplements. <p>

 <p>

11. Should Americans who don't smoke take beta carotene supplements?<p>

 <p>

The results of the Physicians' <strong>Health</strong> Study showed no benefit or harm to nonsmokers who took
beta carotene every other day for 12 years. The results from CARET and the ATBC Study do not
provide information about the effects of beta carotene supplements on non-smokers. NCI does
not recommend that Americans take supplements. For those who wish to reduce their risk of
cancer, NCI advises that it is prudent to adopt a low-fat diet containing plenty of fruits,
vegetables, and grains.<p>

 <p>

12. Should Americans stop eating five fruits and vegetables daily (5-A-Day)?<p>

 <p>

No. 5-A-Day remains a good idea. In both the ATBC Study and CARET, participants with the
highest levels of beta carotene in their blood, measured before the study began, went on to have 
fewer lung cancers. These results are consistent with the possibility that a different compound or
compounds in foods that have high levels of beta carotene may be responsible for the protective
effect of dietary beta carotene seen in epidemiologic studies. Because these are studies of pills,
not food intake, NCI stresses that the study results do not change the results of studies that show
that eating a variety of fruits and vegetables each day remains a good way to reduce the risk of
some cancers.<p>

 <p>

13. What other chemoprevention studies are under way with beta carotene?<p>

 <p>

The NCI has a number of different agents under study, including calcium, fiber, tamoxifen, and
others. Only one large-scale study including beta carotene (the Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study) was 
ongoing when CARET stopped its intervention, and the beta carotene portion of that study has
been halted. Principal investigators of smaller or shorter-term studies including beta carotene were
alerted and advised to consider the results of these studies in making decisions about the trials
they are conducting.<p>

In the Women's <strong>Health</strong> Study, sponsored by the National Institutes of <strong>Health</strong>, 40,000 apparently
healthy women <strong>health</strong> professionals ages 45 and older were being assigned at random to 50 mg
beta carotene, 600 IU vitamin E, 100 mg aspirin, and/or placebos every other day. The beta
carotene portion of this trial is being dropped. The trial, which will show the balance of benefits
and risks of these agents on cancer and cardiovascular disease, began in 1992.<p>

<H2>ULCERS ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER</H2>
</center>

	Peptic ulcers, which are in the stomach and the duodenum (the first part of the intestine leading from the stomach) can occur at any age and affect both men and women.  Untreated, sufferers can look forward to a long siege with them.  But today's peptic ulcer sufferers have a brighter prospect for relief than did those of even a single generation ago.  There is now less than 1 chance in 18 that surgery will every be necessary and new medications act faster and better and offer more relief than ever before.<P>

	The warning sign of active ulcers you will most likely experience (if you get any warning at all) is a gnawing discomfort in the middle or upper abdomen that typically comes between meals or in the middle of the night.  Food or liquids, including antacids and milk, can provide some temporary relief, but milk might not be all that good a remedy since it stimulates production of hydrochloric acid and other digestive juices which further aggravates the pain.<P>

	Antacids blended from aluminum, calcium or magnesium salts, have long been the non prescription drugs most people quickly reach for to get relief from their stomach pains.  But, because antacids interfere with absorption of some medications, be sure to go over this with your doctor and get his approval.

	You should never ignore any warning signs of ulcers.  Ulcer complications are serious and in some cases can be life-threatening.  If paid from ulcers persists after more than 10 to 14 days of self-treatment or comes back when treatment ends, you should see your doctor.  The passing of blood through the bowels may be caused by some other problem, but it can also be an urgent warning of a bleeding ulcer.<P>

	Bleeding ulcers can cause anemia or, if the ulcer gets larger it may expand into a major blood vessel, a leak can turn into a hemorrhage, with only minutes available for life saving emergency treatment.  Ulcers can also perforate and may erode completely through the wall of the stomach or duodenum.  If this happens and the stom§ach's contents flow into the abdominal cavity, severe infection can result.  A perforated ulcer is an emergency that requires immediate surgery.<P>

	It has been determined that smoking doubles a person's risk for ulcer disease.  Physicians and researches have found that ulcers heal a lot slower for smokers, and smokers also have a higher relapse rate.<P>

	And you're definitely at risk for ulcers if you take aspirin and any of the other products containing aspirin.  High-dose Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Maproxen and Piroxicam are in wide use today for many conditions, especially to relive pain and swelling among the millions of people who have arthritis.  These medications can irritate the stom§ach's lining and cause gastrointestinal bleeding.<P>

	Ulcers have frequently been the target for humor in describing the stereotypical aggressive, pressured, goal-or-career-oriented person.  But for those who have them, ulcers are certainly no laughing matter.  Peptic ulcers strike 1 out of ever 50 Americans each year.<P>

	As research continues, there is now mounting evidence that something other than smoking, drinking, spicy meals, or a possible battle with the boss may be associated with ulcers.  It is now believed that ulcers are the result of a combination of conditions, the dynamics of which researchers don't yet fully understand.<P>

<FONT SIZE="4">Nine Out of Ten Women Suffer</FONT><BR>
from symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) . Most will be familiar with a number of the 150 symptoms associated with this condition; anxiety, depression, mood swings, bloating, weight gain, backache, and the list goes on. The monthly disruption and distress that PMS can cause women and those close to them can be devastating. For the female athlete, it makes matters even worse. When a 100th of a second can mean the difference between winning or losing, PMS can tilt the scales against you. Even the top athlete can be striped of their energy, stamina and strength over night. This has to be the most frustrating aspect in a female athlete's training and competition calendar. To combat this effectively, the band-aid approach will not do. If you wait for the symptoms to surface it is to late, for that cycle anyway. Staying up to speed is the key and making sure you incorporate the PMS calendar into your training to avoid the symptoms will be of great benefit. The bottom line here is prevention!<P>
Here is a brief description of the body chemistry involved in many PMS symptoms. Progesterone receptors normally transport the molecules of progesterone into the nucleus of cells, where progesterone can be converted and used to regulate blood sugar. It is now believed that a significant cause of PMS is progesterone receptors not functioning properly when the level of the hormone in the blood is raised, such as those days between ovulation and menstruation. So therefore the regulation of blood sugar by nutrition is a key issue in the management.<P>
Resent studies have shown that as many as 30% of severe PMS sufferers can be helped by proper nutrition alone. It is advised that PMS sufferers cut down on saturated fats from meat and dairy products; reduce intake of processed carbohydrates (white flour products) and concentrated carbohydrates (fruit juices, dried fruits), diet sodas and caffeine. You should eat more complex carbohydrates and fiber foods from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Complex carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta and rice, play an important role in the diet of an athlete, as they cause a gradual rise in blood sugar levels and a gradual fall. Sugar causes a rapid rise and rapid drop in blood sugar and is not the solution to the low blood sugar levels associated with PMS. Meal spacing is also a critical  part of the recommended nutritional regime. Small portions of food rich in complex carbohydrates should be eaten at 3-hour intervals during the day. Using this regime, the blood sugar levels should be balanced and many PMS symptoms relieved.
<P>
Other then nutrition, there are several other simple alternatives that can alleviate this monthly ordeal:<P>
Reflexology: A recent study revealed that women with stressful premenstrual symptoms who received ear, hand, and foot reflexology once per week for an eight week period in 30 minute sessions reported a considerable reduction in PMS symptoms and discomfort.
Magnesium Supplements have been shown to be helpful in a recent study. Taking 400mg of magnesium daily during PMS reduced pain, weight gain, and nervous tension by over 90%. 50mg of vitamin B-6 should be taken with the magnesium as this helps with absorption.
Ayurvedic; Treatments can be very effective in treating severe PMS problems. An example is a woman who had endured terrible PMS, 10 days a month, for 22 years. Various conventional drugs brought no relief. She was   then taken off certain foods and given herbs to put her in balance. She went on a special ayurvedic purification and detoxification program which took away all of her PMS symptoms.
<P>
In naturopathic medicine, the strategic use of herbs can considerably reduce or alleviate the discomfort of PMS. Here are some recommendations:
<P>
Vitus agnus-castus: (40 drops liquid extract or one capsule dried extract, once daily in the morning) to restore the normal balance of progesterone and estrogen.
<P>
Evening Primrose oil (3-4g daily with meals) to correct the imbalanced metabolism of the essential fatty acids which in turn will release the hormone prostaglandin which reduces cramps in the uterus and breast tenderness.
<P>
Milk thistle extract (420mg daily, divided into 3 doses; it should contain 70-80% silymarin) to support the liver function where excess estrogen is metabolized.
<P>
Two preventatives that work great, which I have developed for the athlete on the go:
<P>
Perfect Woman; a homeopathic medicine which will help balance and regulate the female endocrine, hematological and reproductive systems. Many report complete remission after one cycle. It also reduces symptoms of menopause.
<P>
The Perfect Meal; A whole food derived from herbs provides a complete meal. Just mix 2 scoops into your favorite liquid and drink. This is key to maintaining blood sugar levels and feeding nutrients directly to cell level. 
<P>
NOTE: Those persons that read this and utilize the program, please e-mail me with your comments and success stories, thank you.

 Herbal Detoxification
  <HR>
</TR>
  </TABLE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>



Herbal detoxification is an extremely valuable procedure that will tune you up for the summer and rid your body of the winter build-up. Eliminate it, or forever be clogged up, this is one of the  key principles of well-being. Your body is equipped with a variety of natural channels of elimination, including the colon, skin, lungs, kidneys, and lymphatic system. The ease and success of your body's natural rhythms of elimination in turn depend on healthy metabolism and digestion.
<P>
But Too often our lifestyles and dietary choices and the simple stress of living can weaken, even clog up the entire bio system. In Naturopathic medicine we suggest that at least once a year persons do a little internal housecleaning. So without any further ado, here are some herbal suggestions for your complete self-care detoxification program.
<P>
STEP ONE<BR>
Get it moving: Mix 3 parts psyllium husks, 1 part Ayurvedic Triphala powder, and the powders of marshmallow root (1/3 part), Licorice root (1/4 part), and Ginger root (1/8 part). This makes a blend that will gently dredge and empty the 25 feet of your intestines. Use 1 teaspoon of dry mixture with 10 ounces of warm water, shake thoroughly, and drink this twice daily, on rising and before bed. Continue this for 5 days, then allow your body to rest and rebalance for two days. On the eight day begin again for another 3 days. During this time you should drink plenty of distilled water as this will serve as a transporter to eliminate toxins and as well to rehydrate the system. This is extremely important. In addition, you should do as little as possible any activities that are strenuous.
<P>
STEP TWO<BR>
Energize your liver: This organ never takes a break, in fact did you know that the liver actually begins filtering toxins transferred by the mother during pregnancy, and from that point on never stops. Everything we put into our bodies, including the good stuff is poison to the system and if the liver does not first filter and refine what we eat before it is sent into the bloodstream, we would die from poisoning. So it is extremely important to take care of this organ for we only get one and without it, you can say good bye. Make an Elixir of Bitters to aid your liver and whole digestive system. Mix dried amounts of Indian gooseberry (2 parts), Turmeric root (3 parts), Milk thistle seed (2 parts), Calamus root (1 part), Wild yam root (1.5 parts), Gentian root (1 part), Fennel seed (1 part), Cardamon seeds (1 part), Ginger (1/4 part), Bitter orange oil (pinch), Extract of marine algae (pinch). Boil in 1/2 gallon of distilled water for 45 minutes; then strain off the liquid and dispose of the herbs (I put mine in the soil of my house plants and they thrive on it). Drink 4 ounces of this as a tea, 3 times per day, before meals. Continue this for 5 days, then two days off for rebalancing. On day eight begin again for another three days and your done with step three.
<P>

STEP THREE<BR>
Give your kidneys a break: Your kidneys are also organs that never get a vacation, not even for a minute, so give them support and your body will thank you in ways you could never imagine. Prepare a mixture of dried herbs including Juniper berry (4 parts), Goldenrod flowers and leaves (3.2 parts), Horsetail (2 parts), corn silk (2 parts), Cleavers (2 parts), Marshmallow root (1 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon of distilled water for 45 minutes; then strain off the liquid and dispose of the herbs in your plant soil. Drink 4 ounces of this as a tea 3 times per day between meals. Continue for 5 days, then rest for 2 to rebalance , then continue for another 3 days. Always remember to drink extra water through each and every step of this program.
<P>
STEP FOUR<BR>
ENHANCE YOUR BLOOD: This mixture helps remove metabolic wastes from your blood while remineralizing it. Mix fresh amounts Red clover blossoms (3 parts), Stinging nettle leaf ,
(1 part), Cleavers (1 part), Yellow dock root (1.5 parts), Burdock root (2 parts), Yarrow flowers (1 part), Plantain leaf (1 part), Licorice root (1 part), Prickly ash bark (1/2 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon of distilled water for 45 minutes; then strain off the liquid and dispose of the herbs in your house plant soil. Drink 4 ounces of this tea 3 times per day, between meals. Continue for 5 days; then two days off for rebalancing, then continue for another three days. Now your annual detoxification self-care program is finished.
<P>
It is important for you to complete each and every step of this internal cleansing program in order to gain the optimal benefits. Short cuts will not work and can even cause blockages. At the same time , give your body a break by eating lighter and fresher foods, less frequently, and simply less. This is a perfect time to replace one or two meals with The Perfect Meal. Please do not forget to increase your liquid intake, especially warm water, having at least a cup every 20 minutes. Get extra exercise and fresh air and enjoy your greater sense of well-being. Until Next Time, Stay Healthy!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's summer again and everyone is breaking out the barbecue and having picnics. This picture is as American as any innocent Rockwell sculpture. However, there are more illnesses and fatalities in the summer due to contaminated food than any other time. The sad affair is that this, food contamination problem has it's most serious effects on young children. I know that we all say "it could never happen to me", but there are many parents that are sitting in the emergency room right now saying "why us". When this happens to a loved one it can traumatize the entire family, not to mention putting a damper on the weekend festivities. So once again, as I do every time this year, I will outline the steps to a safe and tasty summer without incident.<P>
Most of us think of summer food safety as the abc's that we learned as a child from our parents. Like not letting the potato salad sit in the sun, or keeping the milk in a cooler. However, times have changed and there are environmental circumstances in existence now, that either did not exist or were a low level threat in the good old days. Now we must re-think our rules governing food safety. To follow are the tips that will reduce and or eliminate the threat of food contamination, illness or death.<P>
<B>1. SAFETY STARTS AT THE SUPERMARKET.</B> Here is where much of the cross contamination will occur and spread quickly to everything at home. When you buy meats, poultry or fish, place them in one of those bags found in the produce department. Although they are sealed, some juices may leak from the package and contaminate other items in the shopping cart. So double bag it and separate it from everything else in the cart. Think about it, if you place this package in with your produce and some juice from one of these packages drips onto your vegetables, it is now contaminated and you did not even pay for it yet. When you get home and place this produce in the refrigerator, you are well on your way to contaminating everything in the refrigerator.
<B>A</B>. Select non-perishable items to be placed in the cart first so that perishable items are in the cart for a shorter time period.
<B>B.</B> Check all meat, poultry and fish packages for leakage and double wrap before placing in the cart. Keep away from fruits and vegetables and put them in a separate place in the cart.
<B>C.</B> After purchasing, go straight home. Don't run a bunch of errands while leaving food in the back seat or trunk of the car. Keep it cool!<P>
<B>2. DON'T BE FOOLED BY TIME. </B>These persistent forms of bacteria will remain alive in the refrigerator as well as the freezer. The freezer temperature will not kill this bacteria. They will simply wait for you to defrost the package and begin unleashing it's venom on everything it comes in contact with. Counter tops, hands (which will touch everything), plates, etc. So when taking meat, poultry or fish from the refrigerator or freezer, walk it directly to the sink and un-wrap it there. This is much easier to contain and clean up without cross contamination. Just make sure you wash the sink out thoroughly before washing your produce, with an anti-bacterial soap.<P>
<B>3. ASSUME THAT ALL POULTRY, FISH & MEAT </B>is contaminated. When cutting, do not use a wooden block as bacteria will hide in the grooves and scratches. Use an impervious plastic board. Never use a sponge to clean up, instead use a paper towel and throw it away at once and don't forget to clean any utensils before using it on anything else. Use an anti-bacterial soap or a solution of bleach and water. If the package says take directly from the freezer to the stove, don't even think of it. The Federal guidelines specify defrosting first, no matter what the label says. Cooking frozen foods will not ensure that all the bacteria will be killed in the center. So never go from the freezer to the stove or grill. Defrost in the refrigerator or microwave first! Remember, even if the package tells you to go directly from the freezer to the stove to cook, DON'T! This is not the position of the Department of Agriculture food safety personal.<P>
<B>4. PAY ATTENTION AT THE GRILL.</B> You bring out a plate of raw hamburger and use a spatula to take it from the plate to place on the grill. You now take more raw meat from the plate to cook and then use the same spatula to remove the cooked meat from the grill. You have just contaminated the cooked meat with the juices from the uncooked meat you just placed on the grill. And please do not put the cooked meat on the same plate with the uncooked meat or juices. Use two different spatulas and plates.
<B>A. </B>Cook all meat and poultry until all the juices run clear, not red or pink.
<B>B</B>. Cook all meat and poultry until there is no pink in the center.<P>
<B>5. BEWARE OF RE-PACKAGED MEAT, POULTRY & FISH.</B> Did you know that most states allow stores to remove these items from the shelves upon expiration and then re-package it with a new expiration date and then put it back out on the shelf for you to buy? Don't be afraid to speak up and demand to know if your store does this. In addition, there is no research that indicates that these items bought in a butcher shop is any less contaminated then that found in the supermarket. Two or three states have passed legislation that requires markets to place an (R) on the label if they have re-packaged it. So find out if your state has passed this law and then look for the (R). If your store does not do this, look for another store to shop in.<P>
I know that this is not every tip in the book, and there are many others. However, I can write forever on this topic. These are the most important keys to keeping food safe in the summer or anytime for that matter<P>
<B>Until Next Time, STAY HEALTHY!</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Stamina seems to be the buzz word of the nineties that everyone is trying to capture. For most men and women, especially athletes, is a commodity they wish would buzz more consistently in their everyday performance. To achieve the peak performance, stamina is the key factor in an athlete's road to the gold. In my experience, stamina continuity is more a matter of fatigue liquidation than it is non-nutritional stimulation. Master this and you will attain 24 hour stamina. The first things to consider when experiencing a lack of stamina is vitamin deficiencies, such as iron, protein, folic acid, copper, absorbic acid, etc.<P>
Deficiencies in some or all of the above will contribute to a loss of stamina. For those that are complete vegetarians, beware of a B-12 deficiency. In vegetarian diets the folic acid content is high and thus will mask a B-12 deficiency. This can lead to a condition called pernicious anemia. If this progresses undetected, it can be fatal. Should you suspect this see a healthcare professional at once. Make them aware that you may be deficient in B-12 and a good safe guard would be to order a hematological (blood) work-up if you have been fatigued for a period of time.<P> 
Increasing stamina nutritionally is the only way to attain consistent results. The use of non-nutritional stimulants is a waste of time and can be dangerous. The rebound can send you into a physical and psychological decline that you may never rebound from. Not to mention the potential damage to vital organs. To follow are a few no-nonsense ways to achieve 24 hour stamina nutritionally and most importantly, in a safe manner.<P>
I always stress that your vitamin intake should come from whole foods, not processed, cooked, or from synthetic vitamins, (that is why I developed The Perfect Meal, for convenience). Consume foods high in zinc, vitamins E and C, selenium, and protein.
One easy to follow rule in selecting whole foods is that most foods that grow 
underground tend to be sedatives and foods that grow above tend to be energizing. So if lacking stamina focus on above ground foods and if hyper, focus on below ground foods. Also stay away from any oils, butter, coffee, caffeine's, or any other stimulants that do not provide nourishment to the body. Other naturals that will increase and maintain stamina are fresh ambrosia (Bee Pollen). This is at the top of my list. Bee pollen will nourish and supply almost every nutrient necessary to sustain life and is often consider the nectar of the God's. Nutrition for every inch of your bio-system and organs. (However, some persons will have an allergic reaction, so if you suspect you may be, this would not be a good idea). In addition, the bee pollen should be fresh and from a local bee keeper. This will reduce the risk of reactions and can also be beneficial in reducing pollen born allergies. Do a test first if you are not sure, just put a few grains in your mouth and wait for 2 hours to see if there is a reaction. If you do not get one increase the amount and wait again. continue to do this until you reach two tablespoons. If there is no reaction by this time you should not experience any at all.<P> 
<B>HERBAL TINCTURES</B> such as Astrgalus and Shizandra will increase stamina. I use these three times per week.<P>
<B>HOMEOPATHIC'S </B>such as Sepia 30-c potency will aid in counter effecting fatigue and subconscious suppression: 3 granules three times per day, 3 times per week or as needed. A liquid formula I prepare homeopathically is Alfalfa 1-X, China 3-C, Eleutherococcus 1-X, Kalium phosphoricum. Mix in equal parts and take 20-40 drops under the tongue in morning and at noon. To help stimulate brain function, I use Homeopathic Gingko bilbo 1 to 3-X potency; 10 to 20 drops under tongue twice per day (morning and afternoon), three times per week or as needed. To balance and regulate the male and female endocrine system, hematological, reproductive systems, as well as prostrate and testes in men and relieving PMS and menopausal symptoms in women. I take 10 drops under the tongue 2 to 3 times per day (upon rising, afternoon, before bed). These two formulas get great reviews and works for me and all my clients. the two formulas are called<B> ( Perfect Woman and Perfect Man).</B> It figures that to find perfection in either, it would be in a bottle. Wouldn't it be great if we could just go to the store and select our perfect mate conveniently stored in a bottle awaiting our arrival. Well, at least this will give you the stamina to keep looking.<P> 
These are only a few ways to capture 24 hour stamina safely. If anyone wants the nutritional break down for ambrosia let me know I will email it to you. I'm sure you will be impressed. Remember, I can always be reached at<B> 800-644-0682 ext:2339.</B> If anyone would like to make an editorial contribution with articles, I will be more than happy to review and publish it for you. Just email the article to me.<P>
<B>Until Next Time, STAY HEALTHY!</B><P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Mounts Attack On Victim's Lifestyle</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Jan. 6, Evening) -- Defense lawyers began their assault on Nicole Brown Simpson's character Monday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, eliciting testimony that Brian "Kato" Kaelin told police she "used coke."</P>

<P>Other defense witnesses this afternoon included Los Angeles Police officer Richard Aston; Otis Marlowe and Paul Tippin, two former detectives who worked for the plaintiffs as investigators; and Rachel Ferrara, whose criminal trial testimony was read into the court record. Earlier in the day, the plaintiffs confronted a defense photo expert with new photos of Simpson allegedly wearing <A HREF="/casefiles/simpson/updates/jan6a.html">Bruno Maglis</A> -- the same type of rare Italian shoes the killer allegedly wore.</P>

<P>Court recessed until Wednesday morning because a juror asked to be off on Tuesday for religious reasons. Among the scheduled witnesses Wednesday are: Kaelin, Al Cowlings, and Cora Fischman. The defense has also said it wants to read the criminal trial testimony of Laura Hart McKinny -- the aspiring screenwriter who taped Mark Fuhrman bragging about manufacturing evidence and making racist comments. However, the plaintiffs are vigorously opposing her testimony and Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki has not ruled on the issue.</P>

<P>Although three officers who worked on the Simpson investigation took the stand this afternoon, the defense was unable to produce the accusatory fireworks that marked the testimony of other police witnesses. Aston, whose partner Daniel Gonzalez was accused on the stand of being part of the police conspiracy to frame Simpson, left the witness stand relatively unscathed.</P>

<P>Part of the reason for Aston's lackluster testimony was his memory. Although he was at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes in the early morning after the murders, Aston has never testified about his work on the investigation. He told jurors that he could not remember seeing Mark Fuhrman climbing over the wall into the Rockingham estate, nor could he remember any discussion about police being worried about Simpson's safety. However, Aston did recall seeing blood on the console of the Bronco, although he was not sure which window he looked in to see it. The defense sharply questioned Aston about an impound report on the Bronco he filled out. The report noted that the Bronco's battery and alternator were in working condition -- a fact the police could not have known unless they pooped the hood or turned on the car.</P>

<P>Former homicide detectives Otis Marlowe and Paul Tippin were called to the stand mainly to highlight what the defense says is their conflict of interest -- working as investigators for the plaintiffs. Both Marlowe and Tippin denied they had a conflict, pointing out that they were not in charge of the criminal investigation and merely helped "work clues" called into the LAPD.</P>

<P>But Tippin, who is now an investigator for the Orange County District Attorney's office,  was also questioned about his interview of Kaelin at the West Los Angeles police station the day after the murders. Defense attorney Daniel Leonard quizzed Tippin about what Kaelin told him about Nicole Brown Simpson's "lifestyle." </P>

<P>"He said she used Coke," Tippin said.</P>

<P>Leonard also noted that Kaelin provided the police with a list of Nicole Brown Simpson's friends. At the top of the list was Cora Fischman, who the defense plans to call on Wednesday and ask more questions about Nicole's friends and habits.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs first question to Tippin on cross-examination, although the judge sustained an objection to it, gave a taste of things to come: "Did [Kaelin] tell you that Cora Fischman used coke?"</P>

<H2>Try Out Your Lawyer</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="DD0000"><I>You've been "downsized," but now there's a
younger person sitting at your old desk . . . You have a new baby, but you
still don't have a will . . . Three days after a snowstorm, your mother slipped
and broke her hip outside a supermarket.</I></FONT></P>

<P>If you're like most people, you don't already have a lawyer to offer advice
when you need it. So how do you find a good attorney? Ask your brother-in-law,
pick the flashiest ad in the Yellow Pages, hire one with an office around the
corner, consult an Internet directory?</P>

<P>Those aren't very good ways of hiring someone you're going to rely on in
such important matters. <B>Try Out Your Lawyer</B>, a free service of the Court
TV Law Center, can help. Give us a brief description of your legal needs, we'll
post it, without your name or address, on Counsel Connect, the largest
collection of online attorneys in the world. We'll also place notices, where
appropriate, with other groups of attorneys and in the regional legal
newspapers owned by our parent company, Anerican Lawyer Media. In no case
will we reveal your name, phone number or e-mail address.</P>

<P>Interested lawyers respond, providing a description of their practice, a
list of references and a proposal for how they would handle your case. We'll
forward responses from qualified lawyers to you, and you can decide who you
want to talk to about representing you. While we'll do our best to bring you
proposals from qualified lawyers, we can't guarantee results. <I>(Note: If
you're a business person with a need to find counsel, <A
HREF="http://www.counsel.com/qrfp/">click here</A>.)</I></P>

<P>We think you'll agree <B>Try Out Your Lawyer</B> is the smart way to look
for an attorney. There's absolutely no cost to you. And you get real
information, not the hype of a TV or Yellow Page ad, on which to base your
decision.</P>

<H3>The Estate of Jerry Garcia v. Carolyn Adams Garcia<br>
<A HREF="update5.html">Read updates from the trial</A></H3>

<P>Jerry Garcia, leader of the Grateful Dead, sang about peace and love, but
his heirs are fighting it out in court over his money.</p>

<P>Garcia may have been making some great music in concert arenas across the
country in 1993. But years of drug abuse, combined with his bout with diabetes
rendered him susceptible to his second wife's bullying when he agreed to a $5
million divorce settlement, the Garcia estate claims. (<A
HREF="/library/newsmakers/wills/garcia.html">Garcia's will</A> is in the Court
TV library.)</P>

<P>Carolyn Adams Garcia, known as "Mountain Girl," met Jerry in 1964. They
became lovers two years later and continued a steady live-in relationship until
1975, with their two children -- Annabella and Theresa -- and Carolyn daughter,
Sunshine, from a previous marriage with Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest." They remained friends after the break-up and married in 1981.
But the couple didn't live together until Jerry was hospitalized in 1986 for
diabetes. They separated in 1990.</P>

<P>When a separation was initiated, Jerry agreed to pay $24,000 in monthly
family support. Frustrated by the slow pace of the legal action, the two met in
the office of David Hellman, Jerry's longtime personal attorney and
accountant, with no lawyers present. Jerry allegedly wanted Carolyn to tell him
what she wanted so they could finalize a property agreement and proceed with
the divorce. She said she offered two proposals: the first called for a joint
accounting of all their assets -- including Jerry's record business -- which
Jerry rejected. Her second proposal was for Jerry to pay her $5 million over 
20 years, at no less than $250,000 a year, she said. He agreed to the second
option and payments of $20,833 a month ($250,000 divided by 12) were set up in
January of 1994. </P>

<P>The marriage was dissolved, although no final judgment was entered by the
court because community property issues remained at the time of Jerry's death.
Nevertheless, Jerry was free to marry Deborah Koons on Feb. 14, 1994. The
monthly payments to Carolyn under the $5 million agreement continued until
Jerry's death in August of 1995. According to the estate, Jerry had been
taking steps to rescind the agreement.

<P><B>The Estate </B><BR>
Court documents reveal only hints of the value of the estate. Jerry' Garcia's 1993
earnings exceeded $3 million, more than half of which was earned from touring
with the Grateful Dead. His estate allegedly earns up to $250,000 a year from
Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream to use the "Cherry Garcia" name for one of its flavors.
Income from the "J. Garcia" line of fashion ties and Grateful Dead merchandise
has not been disclosed but is believed to be considerable.</P>

<P><B>The Defense's Argument</B><BR>
Carolyn Adams Garcia says that contrary to the estate's claim, her husband was
in very good physical and mental condition -- and knew exactly what he was
doing -- when he entered into the agreement. Although they met at Hellman's
office, Hellman was not acting as Jerry's attorney, a point the estate
will challenge. Though they lived apart, the Garcias were happily married for
many years, they vacationed together, he took her on his tours, and they
planned to buy a home in Marin County, Calif., she says, claiming they lived
apart only because of tax problems.</P>

<P><B>The Plaintiff's Argument</B><BR>
The estate plans to offer expert testimony to show that Jerry's drug addiction
left him in a state of "hyper-suggestibility," a condition in which a person
can be easily manipulated. Combine that condition with the bullying and
conspiratorial tactics of Hellman and the defendant and you have a person who
didn't knowingly enter into an agreement, the estate says.</P>

<P>The estate also says Carolyn and Jerry Garcia's marriage was a phony, a
mere tax shelter for Jerry.  Hellman was working on setting up Carolyn with a
home in Oregon even before the marriage, the estate says. They took out a
confidential marriage certificate so their friends and the public wouldn't
think it strange that the two remained living apart. The estate promises to
produce witnesses to refute Carolyn's claim that although she lived separately
from Jerry, she often toured with the band. The estate will contend that since
the couple never lived as man and wife, their community property is scant.</P>



<P>Furthermore, the estate claims the agreement is just a step toward a final
settlement, which was never reached, rather than an enforceable contract.</P>

<H2>Court TV Contest</H2>

<H3>For the week of January 6, 1997</H3>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Question:</FONT></B><BR>
TV's "Kojak" series was inspired by a New York detective from Manhattan's 23rd Precinct. Actor Telly Savalas first played Kojak in the 1973 movie, "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," which was based on a 1963 double-murder solved by this detective. In the movie, a 19-year old man admitted to killing two young women in their apartment. He might have faced the death penalty if convicted. But he was exonerated and his confession was found to have been coerced when another man was arrested. Some people say this incident played a role in New York banning the death penalty in 1965. Who was the detective?<P>

<blockquote>
<h3>Welcome to the Courtroom Challenge.</h3>  
<b>
I'll present you with real landmark cases decided by the Supreme Court and other
courts around  the country. You can explore the facts, research the law, consider
various arguments and then either decide the case or argue one side or the other.
I'll tell you how the real case came out -- but not until after you have made up
your mind about what should have happened. <p>If you argue one side of the case,
you'll get points for choosing facts, cases and arguments that best support your
side, whether or not your client ultimately wins. Enjoy the advocacy process! 

I hope you will learn something interesting about the law along the way.
<P>

Apple Computer Inc.'s recent reunion with co-founder Steven Jobs and his company, Next Software Inc., was a prime example of how quickly business alliances change in Silicon Valley. But the $400 million merger also illustrates how lawyers often change sides in the volatile high-tech world.</P>


<P><A HREF="106a.html">Tobacco Takes a Hit</a><BR>
A federal judge rejects a bid by the tobacco giants to bar the state from suing them, clearing the way for a state court slugfest.</P>


<P><A HREF="1230d.html">The Tale of Victims' Rights</a><br>

The victims' rights movement saw substantial legislative victories in 1996. Implementation of these legislative successes, however, left much to be desired. If 1996 was a winning year for victims at the voting booth and in the legislatures, it was all too often a losing year for them in court.</P>


<P><A HREF="1230c.html">New Gingrich Counsel: A Rough Welcome</a><br>
 House Speaker Newt Gingrich's new lawyer in his ethics investigation, J. Randolph Evans, is a longtime Gingrich friend and adviser who is no stranger to tough political fights. His newest assignment may be his toughest yet, as evidenced by the fact that he began drawing fire before he'd even settled into the job. </P>

<P><A HREF="1230b.html">Escape Routes Slamming Shut for Inmates on Death Row</a><br>

Twenty years after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, impatient lawmakers in April drastically cut back on death row appeals. Then, for good measure, Congress did away with the 20 federal law offices that help represent the condemned. Law-and-order enthusiasts say the system is finally free to punish murderers as demanded by justice. But advocates for death row inmates warn that the slashing of safeguards is pushing the nation toward an indiscriminate jump in executions, and that inevitably some who die will be innocent.</P>



<P><A HREF="1223d.html">Gun Ban Snares Cops</a><BR> 


A tough new federal law that bars anyone convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse from owning or carrying a gun is creating chaos in police and sheriff's departments across the country.</P>

<P><A HREF="1223c.html">Why Can't the Condemned Die Without a Fuss?</a><BR>


Georgia Attorney General Michael J. Bowers gets a lot of press complaining that those on death row are constantly monkeying with the courts to delay justice. No question that, for most condemned prisoners, the idea is to stay alive as long as possible, and that means manipulating the system to do so. But what really clogs up the works is when long after the conviction and sentencing some judge or panel of judges decides that the guy's trial was unfair in the first place. Commentary by Ann Woolner.</P>

<P><A HREF="1223b.html"> California High Court to Weigh In on Public Access to Civil Trials</a><br>


As the debate rages on over cameras in the courts, the California Supreme Court on December 18 took up a broader proposition: whether all the media -- and the public as well -- have a constitutional right to attend civil trials. </P>


<P><A HREF="cochran.html">Johnnie Cochran, Nancy Grace Join Court TV</A><BR>

A live, weeknight talk show, "Cochran & Grace," premiers Jan. 13 on Court TV. The one-hour program will be co-anchored by Atlanta prosecutor Nancy Grace and Los Angeles lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr.</P>

<P>Using more than one term is a good idea when searching for something using a

<H2>Simpson Civil Case: Court TV Reports and Trial Coverage</H2>

<P><a href="kardashian.html">Robert Kardashian Faces Ethics Probe</a><BR>
In sharing his doubts about Simpson's innocence on prime-time television,
Simpson defense attorney, Robert Kardashian, may have also brought some serious
ethics problems on himself. Last week, the California State Bar confirmed that
it had launched an investigation into whether Kardashian has breached the
attorney-client privilege in violation of state law. </P>

<P><A HREF="primer.html">A Trial Primer</A><BR>
If Simpson has been acquitted of murder, how can he be charged in a wrongful-death suit? What happens if he loses? Get background on the facts, issues and players in the civil suit against Simpson.</P>

<P><a href="jury.html">A Look at the Jury</a><BR>
A five-man, seven-woman jury with a white majority was sworn in to hear the
Simpson civil case. Race appeared to be a major issue during the month-long
period of jury selection, as the plaintiffs challenged mostly black jurors and
the defense mostly challenged whites. Here is a closer look at the panel.</P>

<P><A HREF="toobin.html">Court TV Chat with Jeff Toobin</A><BR>
Jeff Toobin, author of the bestseller, "The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson," was Court TV's guest Sept. 24, 1996 on America Online's Center Stage. He talked about covering the criminal trial for the New Yorker, his new book, and his thoughts on the upcoming civil trial.</P>
<P><a href="chat-shapiro.html">Court TV Chat with Robert Shapiro</a><BR>
Shortly before the start of the Simpson wrongful-death trial, defense lawyer
Robert Shapiro, who represented O.J. Simpson in the double murder trial, joined
Court TV on America Online's Center Stage. Anchor Dan Abrams acted as moderator
as Robert Shapiro took questions from the audience. The following is a
transcript of that Sept. 9, 1996 event. </P>

<P><a href="chat-goldberg.html">Court TV Chat with Simpson Prosecutor Hank
Goldberg </a><BR> 
Shortly before the start of the Simpson wrongful-death trial, Hank Goldberg, one
of the prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson Case, joined Court TV on America
Online's Center Stage. Anchor Dan Abrams acted as moderator as Goldberg took
questions from the audience. The following is a transcript of that Sept. 9,
1996 event.</P>

<H2>The O.J. Simpson Civil Case: Depositions and Documents</H2>

<P><a href="custodyrule.html"><B>Custody Case Ruling</b></a><BR>
The Brown family failed to show clear and convincing  evidence that O.J. Simpson's custody of his children with Nicole Brown Simpson would be detrimental to the youngsters, according to Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock in this Dec. 20, 1996 ruling. "The children share a relationship with their father that appears to be strong, positive, and healthy, with powerful psychological bonding," the judge writes. "All experts who had the benefit of analyzing the children with all of their significant adults, came to the same conclusion on this point.'' Read the <A HREF="brownstate.html">Brown family</A>'s and <A HREF="ojstate.html">O.J. Simpson</A>'s reactions to the rulings. <I>Please note: the custody battle is a separate action from the wrongful death suit.</i></P>

<P><a href="chase.html"><B>Bronco Ride Transcript</b></a><BR>

Here is the transcript of the conversation between O.J. Simpson and L.A. police detective Tom Lange during the infamous slow-speed Bronco ride on June 17, 1994.





<P><A HREF="planted2.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Claims Of Planted Evidence</b><BR></a>

The plaintiffs claim that Simpson has produced no evidence to back up his "wild, desperate assertion" that incriminating evidence was planted. "In the criminal trial, Simpson was given unfettered reign to advance his unsubstantiated claims of police conspiracy . . . presumably to afford him the widest possible discretion to raise doubts in the face of a double murder prosecution against him. We are now in a civil case, however, and the rules are different," Fredric Goldman's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli states in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion. "Evidence that creates only a 'reasonable doubt' is insufficient."</P>



<P><A HREF="rockbld.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Claims Of Planted Rockingham Evidence</b><BR></a>

The LAPD collected blood drops at O.J. Simpson's Rockingham estate and found that the blood match Simpson's blood, the plaintiffs contend. In this motion filed Aug. 26, 1996, the Goldman family asks the judge to prohibit the defense from advancing its theory that blood collected from Rockingham was planted in a conspiracy to frame Simpson, arguing that "the undisputed evidence -- that the vial of Simpson's blood evidence had been collected -- renders any such speculative theory logically impossible."</P>



<P><A HREF="altrock.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Claims Of Planted Glove </b><BR></a>

The plaintiffs contend that the burden of proof in the civil case to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the bloody glove found at O.J. Simpson's Rockingham estate and other incriminating items were planted. "Simpson's evidence . . . is such that no reasonable jury could find that Simpson has met his burden of proof on this issue," Daniel Petrocelli, attorney for Fredric Goldman, states in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>



<P><A HREF="bronco.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Claims Of Planted Bronco Evidence</b><BR></a>

Since "no reasonable jury could find that Simpson has met burden of proof" to establish that blood evidence was planted, the only purpose presenting such evidence could serve is to "unnecessarily prolong the trial, confuse the issues, and mislead,"  the jury with argument that the...Bronco blood...was planted," Daniel Petrocelli, attorney for Fredric Goldman, states in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>



<P><A HREF="faye.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Evidence Of Faye Resnick's Drug Use</b><BR></a>

In a video released earlier this year and in a pretrial deposition, Simpson claims that Nicole's murder is possibly related to Faye Resnick and the debts incurred from Resnick's drug use. In this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion, the plaintiffs assert that Simpson has provided no evidence to support this claim and ask the judge to prohibit defense arguments that Resnick's used drugs led to the murders at Bundy. </P>



<P><A HREF="custody.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Permit Chain Of Custody Evidence</b><BR></a>

Plaintiffs' attorneys ask in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion that they be allowed to establish the chain of custody of blood, hair and other physical evidence through LAPD criminalists Gregory Matheson and Susan Brockbank. In doing so, the plaintiffs would apparently avoid the testimony of criminalist Dennis Fung and other witnesses that hampered the prosecution in the criminal trial.</P>



<P><A HREF="fuhrman.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Fuhrman's Invoking Of 5th Amendment</b><BR></a>

The plaintiffs wants to bar any evidence relating to former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during his deposition in the civil trial and during the Simpson criminal trial. Lawyers argue that presenting such evidence "would only invite the jury to make an improper inference." This is the Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>



<P><A HREF="racism.html"><B>Plaintiff Motion To Bar Evidence Of Fuhrman's Racism</b><BR></a>

Daniel Petrocelli asks the court to bar evidence of former Detective Mark Fuhrman's alleged racist statements and conduct.  He maintain that the "theory that Fuhrman planted the bloody glove...is not based on admissible evidence...and the evidence of racism is substantially outweighed by its tendency to prejudice the jury and unduly delay the trial." This motion was filed on Aug. 26, 1996.</P>



<P><A HREF="diary.html"><B>Defense Motion on Nicole's Journal Entries and Therapists</b><BR></a>

Nicole Brown Simpson's alleged journal entries and statements she may have made to therapists Dr. Susan Forward and Jennifer Ameli are hearsay and should not be allowed to be admitted into evidence, the defense contends in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>



<P><A HREF="discord.html"><B>Defense Motion to Bar Evidence of Domestic Discord</b><BR></a>

Stating that "the death of Nicole Brown Simpson bears none of the traditional signs of spousal homicide," the defense asks the judge to bar the plaintiffs from introducing evidence of domestic discord in the Simpson marriage. This would include the Oct. 25, 1993 call to 911 and the "Zlomsowitch incident," when O.J. Simpson allegedly spied on his wife engaging in sex with another man. The defense contends that "evidence that a defendant has previously committed crimes or other bad acts is not admissible to prove how the defendant acted on a particular occasion, or to prove his propensity to commit the offense with which he had been charged," under the California Evidence Code. The defense claims that the plaintiffs' objective with this evidence is to unfairly prejudice the jury against Simpson. This pretrial motion was filed Aug. 26, 1996.</P>



<P><A HREF="fidelity.html"><B>Defense Motion to Preclude Evidence of Infidelity and Drug Use</b><BR></a>

The defense argues that the introduction of evidence of O.J. Simpson's alleged drug use or adultery would be inadmissible in the civil action because it's immaterial and would be prejudicial. Simpson's lawyers accuse the plaintiffs of attempting "character assassination" on their client. Though Al Cowlings admits that he saw Simpson use cocaine, the defense points out that that was more than seven years before the murders and that Simpson has no criminal record for drug use. In regard to allegations of infidelity, the defense claims that these are irrelevant because the Simpsons were divorced and had not been living together for more than two years before the murders. This is the Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>



<P><A HREF="opinions.html"><B>Defense Motion to Bar Witnesses' Opinions</b><BR></a>

Defense lawyers accuses the plaintiffs of "playing to the media" in the discovery phase of the case. In this Aug. 26, 1996, pretrial motion, they say plaintiffs' lawyers deliberately asked potential witnesses for personal opinions on whether O.J. Simpson is guilty of murdering his former wife and Ronald Goldman in an effort to manufacture soundbites in the media and infect the jury pool. The defense says such opinions are irrelevant and should be excluded from the trial. </P>



<P><A HREF="psychol.html"><B>Defense Motion to Preclude Psychologists and Psychological Terms</b><BR></a>

Nicole Brown Simpson should not be characterized as a "battered wife," O.J. Simpson should not be described as a "stalker" in the wrongful death trial, argues the defense in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion. These terms, used by psychologists, are also widely used by the general public and have picked up "a strong secondary meaning which itself will have a prejudicial impact" on the jury. The defense also asks that the plaintiffs not be allowed to call psychologists that would provide a psychological "profile" of the defendant.</P>



<P><A HREF="record.html"><B>Defense Motion to Bar Nicole's Police Statements</b><BR></a>

Nicole Brown Simpson's alleged statement to police on New Year's Eve in 1989 that O.J. Simpson was "going to kill her" is inadmissible because it is not part of the official police record, defense lawyers maintain. They argue that statements not on the official record can only be entered if they are made spontaneously to the police. "There is no indication that any of Brown's  . . . statements to the police were blurted out spontaneously; rather, she was responding to questioning and was not so traumatized, or in physical distress, that she was unable to reflect on the statements that she made," according to this Aug. 26, 1996 motion.</p>



<P><A HREF="worth.html"><B>Defense Motion to Bar Evidence of Simpson Financial Condition</B><BR></a>

In this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion, defense lawyers ask that the plaintiffs be barred from introducing evidence concerning O.J. Simpson's financial condition. They say that such evidence is prejudicial and irrelevant until the plaintiffs prove Simpson is liable for punitive damages. </P>



<P><A HREF="planted.html"><B>Plaintiff Declaration Against Planted Evidence Theory</B><BR></a>

Daniel Petrocelli, attorney for the Goldman family, argues in this Aug. 26, 1996 declaration that the defense does not have sufficient evidence to support its theory that evidence linking O.J. Simpson to the crime scene was planted. </P>



<P><A HREF="asstmotion.html"><B>Motion to Bar Accounts of Simpson Financial Assistance</B><BR></a>

The Brown family does not want the jury to hear any accounts that O.J. Simpson provided financial assistance. In this Aug. 26, 1996 motion, John Quinlan Kelly argues that "The true reason that such evidence may be offered by Mr. Simpson's counsel is to improperly bolster Mr. Simpson's character and stature in the eyes of the jury."</p>



<P><A HREF="salemotion.html"><B>Motion to Bar Accounts of Sales of Nicole's Items</B><BR></a>

Dominique Brown reportedly admitted in her deposition that she sold topless photos of her slain sister to a supermarket tabloid for several thousand dollars. In this Aug. 26, 1996 motion, John Quinlan Kelly, the Brown family's lawyer, asks that the jury not be allowed to hear any reference to the sale of Nicole's items or stories about her. "This alleged evidence is entirely irrelevant to the assessment of witness credibility in this case," Kelly states. "That the Brown's may have sold items, stories or materials to the media has absolutely nothing to do with the substantive issues of this lawsuit."</P> 



<P><A HREF="tvorder.html"><B>Order Barring TV Coverage</B><BR></a>

Pointing to what he described as the "circus atmosphere" of the Simpson murder trial, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki banned TV cameras from the courtroom in the civil trial. In this Aug. 23, 1996 order, the judge also upholds the "gag order" preventing lawyers, witnesses and other parties involved in the trial from speaking publicly about the case.</P>



<P><A HREF="goldcomp.html"><B>The Goldman Family's Wrongful Death Action</B></A><BR>

Fred and Kimberly Goldman, murder victim Ronald Goldman's father and sister, brought this civil complaint against O.J. Simpson. Ronald Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo, who reportedly hadn't seen him for 14 years prior to his June 12, 1994 murder, brought a separate action against Simpson. The cases have been consolidated.</P>



<P><A HREF="browncomp.html"><B>The Brown Family's Wrongful Death Action</B></A><BR>

Louis Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's father, filed this wrongful death action against O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Plaintiffs Produce New Photos Of Simpson</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Jan. 6) -- Despite strenuous objections from the defense, jurors in the O.J. Simpson civil trial examined newly discovered photographs that allegedly show Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes. On the witness stand, defense expert Robert Groden said the pictures did not change his opinion that the photographs he examined were likely doctored.</P>

<P>Also Monday morning, deposition testimony from former Los Angeles Police Department photographer Rolf Rokahr was read into the record. LAPD officer Richard Aston, who was at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes, is currently on the stand. </P>

<P>This afternoon, the defense is scheduled to read into the record deposition testimony from Hertz employees Raymond Kilduff and James Merrill and patent lawyer Mark Partridge. Simpson is scheduled to take the stand on Friday.</P>

<P>The new pictures -- taken by photographer E.J. Flammer -- were allegedly shot on the same day as the ones taken by freelance photographer Harry Scull, which were entered into evidence. The defense is arguing that Scull's photos are fake. This morning, in argument before the jury came in, the defense said it will make a similar attack on the new pictures. Simpson lawyer Daniel Leonard told Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki that the latest photographs were "highly suspicious" and that he would vigorously contest their authenticity. The plaintiffs, however, called the pictures "pure impeachment," pointing out that Simpson earlier testified that the Scull pictures were fake. </P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki allowed the plaintiffs to show the pictures to Groden -- and the jury -- but did not accept them into evidence. However, lead plaintiffs lawyer Daniel Petrocelli told the court that Flammer will be the plaintiffs' first witness when the rebuttal phase of the trial begins. The new photographs will likely be then admitted into evidence.</P>

<P>"This is total sandbagging, your honor," complained Leonard after the ruling.</P>

<P>Retorted Judge Fujisaki: "That's usually what impeachment amounts to, counsel."</P>

<P>The jury scrutinized about seven pictures taken by Flammer, some of them blowups focusing on the shoes. The plaintiffs also passed around a contact sheet showing 30 pictures that they say show Simpson wearing the Bruno Maglis. The pictures, which show Simpson talking to other people at the football game, are much clearer than the ones taken by Scull and provide a good view of the shoes at different angles. One of the photographs was published in 1993 in a Buffalo Bills newsletter. Although Flammer swore in an affidavit that those are the pictures he took, they have not yet been authenticated in court. Nor have the shoes been positively identified as Bruno Maglis.</P>

<P>Photo expert Robert Groden, confronted with the new photographs, said they would not change his opinion on the Scull pictures.</P>

<P>"If there were other photographs of Mr. Simpson taken the same day, September 26, 1993, in the same stadium, at the same football game, with a different camera, by a different photographer . . . wouldn't that compel you to conclude that your analysis was wrong?" Gelblum asked.</P>

<P>"No," replied Groden.</P>

<P>Later on redirect examination, Groden explained that the new pictures did not erase the problems he found in the Scull photographs.</P>

<P>"The anomalies I found in that photograph are still there," Groden said. "A hundred more photographs are not going to change that."</P>

<H2>Simpson Civil Trial Coverage</H2><p>

<P>Court TV reporter Dan Abrams will be inside the courtroom during the entire
trial and will provide live reports for "Families v. Simpson," a special report
airing on Prime Time Justice from 8:30pm - 9pm ET and PT.  The nightly special
report will include live reports from Abrams, exclusive analysis by host Terry
Moran and expert guest commentators, and background reports and profiles of the
key participants in the trial.  Abrams also will provide live updates
throughout the day in addition to reports on Justice Today (weekdays at 1pm
ET), The Court TV Evening News (weeknights at 7:30pm ET and 10:30pm PT) and the
network's syndicated show, Inside America's Courts. </P>

<P>The family of the late Ronald Goldman and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson
have brought a civil lawsuit against O.J. Simpson for the murders of Goldman
and Brown.  Unlike the criminal case, the plaintiffs in the civil suit need
only to prove that Simpson is guilty based on a preponderance of evidence,
rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  A civil case requires that only
nine of the twelve jurors agree upon a verdict.  In August, Judge Hiroshi
Fujisaki, Superior Court judge in Santa Monica who is presiding over the trial,
banned television cameras and still photographers from the trial and upheld a
gag order banning trial participants from discussing the case in the media or
in public.  </P>

<P>"Despite the restrictions placed on the media and participants in this
trial, we plan to provide comprehensive coverage," said Court TV Founder and
CEO Steven Brill.  "Dan Abrams, our reporter who also covered the criminal
trial, will provide live first-hand reports throughout the day on Court TV and
on the syndicated show. Viewers looking for the most accurate and thorough
information about this trial will know to watch Court TV, specifically the
nightly 'Families v. Simpson' special report."</P>
 
<P>In addition, the Court TV Law Center, the network's online service, will
provide in-depth reporting on the trial by on-site reporter Robert Schmidt. 
The Law Center plans to post court documents online and provide trial updates,
discussion groups and chats.</P>

<H2>Excerpts from O.J. Simpson's Testimony</H2>

<I><P><B>Editor's Note:</B> You can also read the <A HREF="/casefiles/simpson/transcripts/">full transcripts</A> as well as O.J. Simpson's <A HREF="/casefiles/simpson/documents/depositions/">deposition</A>.</P></I>

<P><B>Friday, November 22</B></P>

<P>Plaintiff's attorney Daniel Petrocelli questions O.J. Simpson about altercations between him and Nicole. O.J. denies ever having hit Nicole.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
<P>Q. And there were also physical altercations, true, Mr. Simpson?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Vague as to time. All these questions are vague as to time, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Time.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I'm referring to the time when the two of you began a relationship in 1977, up until the time you stopped that relationship.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: It's over broad, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>A. Yes, we had a physical altercation.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Well, there was more than one physical altercation, true?</P>

<P>A. I think you'd have to define that. There was one very physical altercation, and there were other times when they were not so physical.</P>

<P>Q. What do you mean by "not so physical," Mr. Simpson?</P>

<P>A. Well, Nicole hit me a few times, and I didn't consider that too physical.</P>

<P>Q. So the ones that were not so physical are the times when you say Nicole hit you, true?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>And one time I grabbed her at a door and pushed her outside the door. That -- if you call that physical, that's physical, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And how many times did Nicole hit you, as you say?</P>

<P>A. Numerous times.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>And how many times, Mr. Simpson, in the course of these physical altercations, did you hit Nicole?</P>

<P>A. Never.</P>

<P>Q. How many times did you strike Nicole?</P>

<P>A. Never.</P>

<P>Q. How many times did you slap Nicole?</P>

<P>A. Never.</P>

<P>Q. How many times did you kick her?</P>

<P>A. Never.</P>

<P>Q. How many times did you beat her, sir?</P>

<P>A. Never.</P>

<P>Q. And if Nicole said you hit her, she would be lying; is that true?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I object. Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Sustained.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) If Nicole told people and wrote down in her diary that you hit her --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I object to this.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Your Honor; I'm not finished with the question.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: That doesn't matter.</P>

<P>THE COURT: I'll sustain it as to form.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You are aware that Nicole has told others that you hit her?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I object to this, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: That's overruled.</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you are aware that Nicole has written down in writings that you hit her, true?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you are aware that her writings describe numerous incidents when you hit her, true?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I object to this again.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I think we need to approach.</P>

<P>THE COURT: No.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor --</P>

<P>Please answer the question.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And your view is all that is false, true?</P>

<P>A. True, yes.</P>

<P>Q. Let's talk about 1989, okay?</P>

<P>That was an angry, intense, physical confrontation, true?</P>

<P>A. Correct.</P>

<P>Q. You're what, at the time, six-two, 215 pounds?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Nicole, five-eight, 135 pounds?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you hit her that day, didn't you, sir?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. Did your hand make contact with her face at all to cause injuries on her face?</P>

<P>Yes or no?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. Didn't you testify -- you remember testifying in this deposition, sir?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Remember I took your deposition over a number of days and Mr. Kelly, Mr. Brewer also asked you questions?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Let me read from that deposition.</P>

<P>By the way, you understand and you understood then, you were under oath and subject to the same penalty of perjury, just as you are today?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Line -- page 1032, Mr. Baker, line 21.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Line again?</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Starting at 20, sir.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: To where?</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: 22.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Okay.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) By me. (Reading:) "Q. You were in such a rage that you don't remember what you did; is that right? "A. I remember exactly what I did."</P>

<P>Now, tell this jury exactly how you caused all those injuries on Nicole's face.</P>

<P>A. Well, as I told you throughout the deposition, I don't know how exactly it happened, but I felt totally responsible for everything that happened at one point.</P>

<P>Q. Mr. Simpson --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Let him answer the question.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I'm not asking about your responsibility; I'm asking about your physical movements and actions.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I move to let this witness answer the question.</P>

<P>THE COURT: The answer was not responsive.</P>

<P>Go ahead.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Please tell the jury exactly what you did to cause the injuries on Nicole's face.</P>

<P>A. Well, as I explained to you, I don't know exactly how the injuries took place, so I can't really answer that question.</P>

<P>If you want me to say what happened, I can tell you what happened.</P>

<P>Q. You said in the deposition, you remember exactly what you did, true?</P>

<P>A. And I also told you I don't know how the injuries got there.</P>

<P>Q. You said you remembered exactly what you did, true?</P>

<P>A. Correct.</P>

<P>Not to cause the injuries; I didn't say that.</P>

<P>Q. You caused all those injuries, did you not?</P>

<P>A. I feel totally responsible for every injury she had then, yes.</P>

<P>Q. Sir, I'm not asking you about your feelings of responsibility. Do you understand?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. I'm asking you about what you did.</P>

<P>You caused the injuries to her face, did you not?</P>

<P>A. I feel responsible for every injury she had.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Move to strike as nonresponsive.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Stricken. Jury is to disregard that answer.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Please answer the question.</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. You don't know what?</P>

<P>A. That I caused every injury.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Let's put some photos up.</P>

<P>And I apologize to the jury for having to show those photos.</P>

<P>Exhibit 3.</P>

<P>(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3 displayed on TV screen.)</P>

<P>Q. You've seen those photos before, Mr. Simpson?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. By the way, you say that some of the marks on -- on this photograph are caused by Nicole picking her face that night, true?</P>

<P>A. No. I told you when she cleans her face.</P>

<P>Q. That night?</P>

<P>A. A lot of this redness would normally be there most nights, once she picked and cleaned her face.</P>

<P>Q. You said in your deposition, sir, did you not, that that night she was picking at her blemishes, and that caused marks on her chin and on her cheek, true?</P>

<P>A. No. I said normally what -- when she does pick her face, that those were marks that I'd normally see, yes.</P>

<P>Q. Did you not say in your deposition that she did so that night, and that's why those marks appear on her face?</P>

<P>Yes or no?</P>

<P>A. I don't know --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: That's been asked.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>A. -- Exactly.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Excuse me?</P>

<P>A. I'm not sure if that's what I said exactly.</P>

<P>Q. Tell the jury right now, did Nicole cause any of those marks to herself that night by picking at her face?</P>

<P>A. I don't know, but --</P>

<P>Q. You don't know? Yes, no, or you don't know; that's all?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>Let's talk about the injury to the lip, the split lip. How did she get that injury, sir?</P>

<P>A. That looks more than what would normally be there. So at some point during the night, I assume that that happened, once our -- our -- our altercation began.</P>

<P>Q. Well, what did you do to cause that injury?</P>

<P>A. I wrestled her out of the room. And what happened when she was outside, I didn't see when she fell, but I feel responsible for all of that.</P>

<P>Q. But you've said you "feel responsible for," a number of times. It's not necessary to keep saying it 'cause it's not responsive to my questions.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I object to this. He can't give my client a speech.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Sustained.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let's talk about what you did physically with your hand, your foot, whatever.</P>

<P>Tell us how she got the cut on her lip, the split on her lip, that caused it to bleed that night?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. You don't know?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>Tell us how she got the welt over the right eye.</P>

<P>A. I don't know specifically how.</P>

<P>Q. You did hit her there?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. And it's your testimony, before this jury, that you never touched her face with your hand, true?</P>

<P>A. I don't know, as I told you in the deposition, in wrestling her, maybe my hand hit -- hit or was on her face. I certainly didn't punch her or slap her.</P>

<P>Q. You say your hand was on her face.</P>

<P>Did you strike her at any time?</P>

<P>A. As I told you, I had her in a head lock at one point, in trying to get her out of the door, so I would assume that my hand was somewhere around her -- her face.</P>

<P>Q. When you say "head lock," you said in the deposition that you had her head in kind of a head lock to get her out of the room, true?</P>

<P>A. At one point, yes.</P>

<P>Q. Are you saying that that's when that injury to her eye occurred?</P>

<P>A. I don't know when it occurred. But I'm assuming it occurred during the altercation or when she fell outside and --</P>

<P>Q. I would ask --</P>

<P>A. -- I was a cause of all of that.</P>

<P>Q. I would ask that you not assume anything. Either tell us what happened or --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I would ask Mr. Petrocelli not to give my client legal advice.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I just want to know what your recollection, sir, is; that's all.</P>

<P>Just tell us what you remember.</P>

<P>A. I don't -- I don't remember specifically when any single mark or injury came on her face, any of them. But I'm assuming they all happened during this altercation.</P>

<P>Q. I Would ask that you not assume anything. Just tell us what you --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Again I as that Mr. Petrocelli --</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled. He may frame the question as he wishes.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Are you saying now that it's possible that you might have struck her with your hand, delivered a below to her right eye to cause that mark?</P>

<P>Yes or no?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. It's not possible?</P>

<P>A. I did not punch her or slap her. That didn't happen.</P>

<P>Q. Did you strike her with your hand?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. Now, this thing about wrestling, your view is that Nicole started an argument that night about something that she was absolutely wrong about, true?</P>

<P>A. Exactly, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And she came into the bedroom and started hitting you, right?</P>

<P>A. (No verbal response.)</P>

<P>Q. Correct?</P>

<P>A. Essentially, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you tried to remove her from the bedroom and initially succeeded in doing so and locked your door, true?</P>

<P>A. Again, yes.</P>

<P>Q. That's what you testified to?</P>

<P>A. I testified I locked her out once.</P>

<P>She got a key and got in.</P>

<P>Q. The first time -- the first time, you got her out of the room?</P>

<P>A. No, that's not correct. First time she went out, and I locked the door.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>Did you -- was there any wrestling the first time?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>And to your knowledge, no bruising or marks or injuries to her occurred during the time that you got her out of the room?</P>

<P>A. I didn't get her out the first time.</P>

<P>Q. The time she left the room?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. You locked the door, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And then what happened is, Nicole got a key and opened the door, and you were sitting or lying on the bed, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And then you say Nicole started hitting you at that point, right?</P>

<P>A. She jumped on me.</P>

<P>Q. And then what you did was, to kind of try to just get her out of the room, right?</P>

<P>A. That was my purpose, yes.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>And you said Nicole is one of the most physically conditioned women you've ever known, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. You said, at least that night, she was quite a match for you, right?</P>

<P>A. It's tough -- it was tough to get her out of the room, yes.</P>

<P>Q. So what you did is, you started to sort of try to, from behind her, put your arms around her and get her out of the room, right?</P>

<P>A. I don't know if that's necessarily true.</P>

<P>Q. At some point, you think, in the process of trying to get her out the 15 feet or so to the door so you could close your door, you got her in a head lock; is that right?</P>

<P>A. I don't think that's necessarily true.</P>

<P>Q. Is that a fair description?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. Well, tell us, then.</P>

<P>A. She jumped on me, on the bed, and with her knees and arms -- and then I kind of grabbed her and we kind of fell over on the floor.</P>

<P>And then I was trying to get her -- to get her out of the door, and she was grabbing things and hitting. And eventually, I got her out of the door.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>And when you said you grabbed her, you put your right hand into a fist --</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. -- just now.</P>

<P>Is that what you did that night when you grabbed her?</P>

<P>A. Quite possibly when I grabbed her arm, quite possibly I did.</P>

<P>Q. When you did -- now, you just put both hands in a fist.</P>

<P>When you did it that night, did you punch her in the face with your hands?</P>

<P>A. No. No.</P>

<P>Q. Did you put your fingers and hands on her throat and leave marks on her throat, sir?</P>

<P>A. I don't recall doing that at all, no.</P>

<P>Q. You are aware she had marks on her throat, are you not?</P>

<P>A. I'm aware that someone said she did, yes.</P>

<P>Q. You believe that's false?</P>

<P>A. I never saw them. And the next day, she showed me all her bruises.</P>

<P>Q. She showed you everything the next day?</P>

<P>A. She showed me something here, and this -- this was obvious to me. (Indicating to arm and head.)</P>

<P>Q. You didn't see any marks on her throat?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. No hand print or anything like that?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. It's your testimony that you never touched her throat, right?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>When you say "touched her throat," I was wrestling her; I could have touched her throat, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And how could you have touched her throat?</P>

<P>A. I don't know. Maybe -- I don't know. If you want to wrestle, you know -- I don't know. You know, it happens in a wrestling match.</P>

<P>Q. Would you like to demonstrate to me, sir, how you had her head in a head lock with the Court's permission?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to that, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: I don't think it's necessary.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) So you don't remember how these injuries occurred, true?</P>

<P>A. I assume they occurred during this event, but I didn't see -- you know, when you're doing things, you don't see exactly, you know, when they happen. I just saw the next day or later on, to an extent that she had them, and I -- I felt I was responsible for them.</P>

<P>Q. Well, one thing you are clear about, though, is that however these injuries occurred, it didn't result from your fist striking her or your hand striking her --</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. -- and your hitting her in any way, true?</P>

<P>A. True.</P>

<P>Q. Now, once you got Nicole out of the room, you testified in your deposition, that was the end of the altercation. True?</P>

<P>A. That's correct.</P>

<P>Petrocelli questions Simpson about a call he made to Paula Barbieri on the night of the murders. O.J. claims not to have received a message from Barbieri earlier that evening breaking off their romantic involvement.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You heard her testify that you left her three messages -- at least three messages that day, correct?</P>

<P>A. That day, yes. I thought you were talking about after a certain time.</P>

<P>Q. And in the messages you said in substance, hey, what's wrong, last night we were talking about filling rooms with babies, what's wrong.</P>

<P>You heard her testify to that, correct?</P>

<P>A. In the last message at 10 something, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you left her that message because you had received her message by 6:56 p.m. telling you that the relationship was over, correct?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. Now, about a half an hour after that 6:56 p.m. call from Rockingham to your message manager, you made a call to a woman named Gretchen Stockdale, true?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And that call was made at 7:32 p.m., correct?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And in that call you left Ms. Stockdale a telephone message, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And in substance you said, hi, this is O.J., I'm unattached for the first time in my life, true?</P>

<P>A. Or words to that effect, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And the reason you left that message to Gretchen Stockdale that you were unattached for the first time in your life is because on that day you were unattached from Nicole and you were unattached from Paula Barbieri, true?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. And you had just found out from Paula that that relationship was over, and now you were without both women for the first time in your life, correct?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Objection, without foundation.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. And that's why you told Gretchen Stockdale you were unattached, right?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. Did you consider Paula an attachment at that time?</P>

<P>A. I don't think Gretchen knew about Paula and I.</P>

<P>Q. I didn't ask you if she knew about Paula.</P>

<P>I asked you, did you consider yourself attached to Paula when you left Gretchen Stockdale a message at 7:32 saying you were unattached?</P>

<P>A. I wasn't referring to Paula when I was talking to Gretchen.</P>

<P>Q. So even though you were then involved in what you say was a serious romantic relationship with Paula Barbieri, you didn't regard that as any sort of attachment; isn't that true?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: He has not said that, Your Honor.</P>

<P>Object, it's without foundation.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Sustained.</P>

<P>Petrocelli elicits an admission from Simpson that he knows of no person that saw him between 9:35 and 10:55 on the night of the murders. Petrocelli also asks Simpson directly if he killed Nicole and Ron.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
<P>Q. Now, Mr. Simpson, after you got back from McDonald's at 9:35, the next time that you ran into Kato Kaelin was about 10:55 p.m.; is that true?</P>

<P>A. I would guess so.</P>

<P>Q. And about that time, you also encountered a limousine driver, true?</P>

<P>A. I would think so.</P>

<P>Q. Now, between 9:35 p.m. and 10:55 p.m. on Sunday, June 12, there is not a single living human being who you can identify that saw or spoke to you; is that true?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely true, unless somebody drove out and saw me when I was outside --</P>

<P>Q. Excuse me. Is that true, that there --</P>

<P>A. To my knowledge.</P>

<P>Q. There's not a single living person that you know of who saw or spoke to you between 9:35 p.m. and 10:55 p.m.; is that true?</P>

<P>A. I would believe that would be true.</P>

<P>Q. You know of no such person, correct?</P>

<P>A. I don't know of anyone who saw me from 7:30 to 9:00, either.</P>

<P>Q. I didn't ask you about 7:30.</P>

<P>9:35 p.m. to 10:55 p.m. you don't know anybody who saw or spoke to you; is that true?</P>

<P>A. No one was at my house. Unless they were driving by when I was in my yard --</P>

<P>Q. Sir, I'm not asking about --</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. -- things that you don't know about.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I think that's responsive. I think he ought to be able to finish his answer.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: It's not responsive.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>Answer the question.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: It was a very simple question.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) 9:35 p.m. to 10:55 p.m., you cannot tell this jury the name of a single person, living person, that you saw or spoke to you in that time; is that correct?</P>

<P>A. That's correct.</P>

<P>Q. And the reason why you didn't get in that Bronco is because you used that Bronco to go to Nicole's condominium that evening, after you came back from McDonald's, true?</P>

<P>A. That's not true.</P>

<P>Q. You had gloves; you had a hat; you were wearing a dark sweat outfit, and you had a knife.</P>

<P>And you went to Nicole Brown's condominium at 875 South Bundy, did you not, sir?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And you confronted Nicole Brown Simpson and you killed her, didn't you?</P>

<P>A. That is absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And you killed Ronald Goldman, sir, did you or did you not?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And then you got in your Bronco and you drove back the very short distance to Rockingham, and you parked on Rockingham because you knew that there was a limousine waiting at Ashford for some time; true or untrue?</P>

<P>A. That is absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And you got on your property, sir, and you bumped into the wall of the side of your house at 10:50, 10:51 p.m.; true or untrue?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And you dropped one of your gloves there; you put other items in a bag, and you left that bag behind your Bentley to be picked up later; true or untrue, sir?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely untrue.</P>

<P>Q. And you walked from the Bentley into your house at 10:55 p.m. and were seen by Allan Park; true?</P>

<P>A. I believe when I came out, at one point, I thought whoever the limo driver was would have seen me, yes.</P>

<P>Q. You were walking from the side of your house diagonally to the Bentley, so you would not be seen by the limo driver, and then you skipped into your house. Is that true or untrue, sir?</P>

<P>A. That's absolutely not true.</P>

<P>Q. And you dropped the bag right here?</P>

<P>(Indicating to Exhibit 116.)</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you went inside at 10:55 p.m. Yes or no?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<P>Q. And you dropped a piece of blood near a cable in the back, near the wall, where you ran into the wall, correct?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. And you bled on that cable wire, didn't you, sir?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. And you bled on that air conditioner, didn't you, sir?</P>

<P>A. That's incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, you did tell the police, however, sir, when you
were interviewed the next morning, that you did cut your finger that night,
right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you told the police that you cut your finger at a time that was between
10 and 11, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. That's the time that Ron and Nicole were murdered, right?</P>

<P>A. That's what I'm told, yes.</P>

<P>Q. And you told the police that you may have reopened that cut in Chicago,
right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Now, the cut that you reopened in Chicago, sir, was on your middle finger,
right?</P>

<P>A. May have reopened, yes.</P>

<P>Q. What do you mean may have?</P>

<P>You just -- you didn't tell the cops "may have," did you?</P>

<P>A. I thought so. I thought that's what I said to them.</P>

<P>Q. Now, the cut on your middle finger is one that still bears a scar, does it
not?</P>

<P>(Witness reviews finger.)</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Left hand middle finger, right?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>(Witness displays finger to Mr. Petrocelli.)</P>

<P>Q. Right over there, right across the knuckle?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. How did that mark get on your finger between 10 and 11 on June 12 in Los
Angeles?</P>

<P>A. I didn't see that or any mark on my hand between 10 and 11 on June 12.</P>

<P>Q. How is it, then, that you reopened that cut in Chicago the next morning?</P>

<P>A. It was in -- an assumption on my part.</P>

<P>Q. What do you mean by assumption? You assumed --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Let him answer the question.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Would you answer the question.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: What do you mean by an assumption?</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: Withdraw the question.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You assumed you reopened the cut; is that what you're
saying?</P>

<P>A. Yes, because I did not see any cut, as I emphasized to the police on
numerous occasions, the night before. And I guess I did the wrong thing by
trying to assume, and I assumed that if I was cut the night before, maybe it
was the same cut because there was no other cut on my hand.</P>

<P>Petrocelli questions Simpson about the lie detector test. O.J. denies having taken one.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Mr. Simpson, you were testifying a few moments ago about
how you were, once you understood the process, happy to take a lie detector
test, but it was refused.</P>

<P>Do you recall that?</P>

<P>A. Yes.</P>

<P>Q. Now, in fact, Mr. Simpson, before you communicated that position to the
D.A.'s office, you went to the office of Dr. Edward Gelb on June 15, did you
not?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. You went to the office of some person on Wilshire Boulevard and sat down and
were wired up for a lie detector test, true?</P>

<P>A. That's not true.</P>

<P>I mean that's not true in totality.</P>

<P>Q. Well, what do you mean, "in totality?"</P>

<P>A. We didn't take a lie detector test.</P>

<P>What I was asking him is how did it work, and I wanted to understand it. And he
sort of gave me an example how it --</P>

<P>Q. And he hooked you up to the process and started asking you questions about
Nicole, and Nicole's death and whether you were responsible for it, true?</P>

<P>A. I don't know if he went that far with it.</P>

<P>Q. Okay.</P>

<P>At the end of that process, you scored a minus 22, true?</P>

<P>A. I don't know what the score was.</P>

<P>Q. And you understood that was a polygraph test, right?</P>

<P>A. I understood that once I finished, and I understood it, that I was willing
to do one for the police.</P>

<P>Q. And you understood that what you were doing that day was a polygraph test,
on June 15; true or untrue?</P>

<P>A. Not the way they explained it to me, no.</P>

<P>Q. You were wired up to a polygraph machine, were you not?</P>

<P>A. They wired me up to something and they -- the guy started to explain to me
about how it works, and we went through it once for my understanding.</P>

<P>Once I understood how it worked, I told my lawyers, let's do it.</P>

<P>And we wanted it to be in evidence.</P>

<P>Q. And the minus 22, by the way, is a score indicating extreme deception, true?</P>

<P>A. I don't --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object to that.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Sustained.</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: There's no foundation for that at all.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Well, Mr. Simpson, when I asked you in your deposition,
page 1284, lines 4 through 8, I asked you --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Page? Wait a minute.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: You got it, Mr. Baker?</P>

<P>MR. BLASIER: I'm getting there.</P>

<P>(Indicating to computer.)</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, you went to this polygraph examiner's office on
Tuesday, June 14, true?</P>

<P>A. I don't know.</P>

<P>Q. It was that time frame, right?</P>

<P>A. I believe it was that week; it was -- that week is kind of fuzzy for me.</P>

<P>Q. And I asked you in your deposition in January: (Reading) Question: "Have you
ever taken a polygraph test?</P>

<P>"A. No.</P>

<P>"Q. I was going to say, since Nicole's death, have you taken a polygraph test?</P>

<P>"A. No."</P>

<P>That was untrue, wasn't it, sir?</P>

<P>A. As far as I know, I didn't take a polygraph test.</P>

<P>"Just tell them all I'm sorry. You can tell them later on today and tomorrow
that I was sorry and that I'm sorry that I did this to the police department."</P>

know you're doing your job. You've been honest with me right from the
beginning. Mr. Lange, I appreciate that."</P>

job.</P>

hurt."</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You said none of those things to Detective Lange, did

blood found in your car, and you knew there was blood found on Bundy as of June
17, when they were going to arrest you, right?</P>

<P>Q. And at no time did you ever utter a word to Detective Lange, why aren't you
out looking for the real killer? Why didn't you -- why did you plant all this
evidence against me?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: This is argument.</P>

<P>Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Why did you frame me?</P>

<P>Q. True or untrue?</P>

correct?</P>

<P>A. Correct.</P>

<P>Q. Or framing you for a murder that you did not commit? Correct?</P>

<P>A. That's correct.</P>

<P>Q. And the reason you didn't do so, Mr. Simpson, is because you knew you
committed those murders, correct?</P>

you killed her --</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm going to object.</P>

<P>A. No, Mr. Petrocelli. That's totally, absolutely incorrect.</P>

<P>Q. And Ronald Goldman came upon you when you were there with Nicole, and you
did not expect him that night, correct?</P>

<P>MR. BAKER: I'm going to object.</P>

<P>A. I don't know Ron Goldman.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Overruled.</P>

<P>Q. And Ronald Goldman got into a fight with you as he tried to stop you, and
you cut him and you slashed him until he died, collapsed in your arms. True or
untrue?</P>

<P>A. Untrue.</P>

<P>Q. And you left him there to die, Mr. Simpson, with his eyes open, looking
right at you. True or untrue?</P>

<P>A. That's untrue.</P>

<P>MR. PETROCELLI: I have no further questions.</P>

        12            MR. PETROCELLI:  Morning.

        13            JURORS:  Morning.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  Based on Mr. Leonard's

        15     representation that he has only three or four minutes

        16     left, he's asked to reopen, and we've agreed.  It's

        17     three or four minutes.

        18            THE COURT:  All right.

        19            THE CLERK:  Sir, you are still understand oath.

        20                  Would you state your name again for the

        21     record.

        22            THE WITNESS:  Robert Groden.

        23            THE CLERK:  Thank you.

         2     the witness on the stand at the time of adjournment on

         3     Wedensday, Decmeber 18, 1996, having been previously

         4     duly sworn, was examined and testified further as

         7                       DIRECT EXAMINATION  (Continued)

         8     BY MR. LEONARD:

         9            Q.    Mr. Groden, did we have an opportunity

        10     yesterday to come to the courtroom and work a little

        11     more with the Elmo machine?

        12            A.    Yes, we did.

        13            Q.    As a result of that, were you able to

        14     illustrate a couple of these points a little bit

        15     better?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    Okay.

        18            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, with the Court's

        19     permission, I'd ask that Mr. Groden be permitted to

        20     walk down, and I can examine him from the Elmo, so he

        21     can manipulate it.

        22                  And what I'd like to -- what I'd like to

        23     do is, display one image that you -- but he's going to

        24     point out some of these elements again.

        25                  We really need to turn all the lights out

        26     in the courtroom, if that's acceptable, just for 30

        27     seconds.

        28            THE COURT:  All right.
 


                                                                     3
         1            MR. LEONARD:  Thank you.

         2            MR. P. BAKER:  The photograph on the machine is

         3     1931.

         4

         5                         (The instrument herein referred to

         6                         as Blow-up from the 1-1 photograph

         7                         purported to be Mr. Simpson's left

         8                         leg, was marked for identification

         9                         as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1931.)

        10

        11            MR. LEONARD:  As soon as you're set up, turn

        12     the lights out.

        13            THE WITNESS:  Okay.

        14            THE COURT:  Yes?

        15            JUROR:  I just need to ask the deputy something

        16     real quickly, if you don't mind.

        17                  Pardon me.

        18            THE BAILIFF:  May I approach?

        21                         voce.)

        22

        23            THE COURT:  (The Court indicates to candy.)

        24            JUROR:  Thank you.  My fellow juror has saved

        25     me.

                                                                     4
         1                         (One juror hands another juror a

         2                         cough drop.

         3            Q.    (BY MR. LEONARD)  Do you have the -- do

         4     you have the image in the position you want it, sir?

         5            A.    Yes.

         6            THE COURT:  You're going to have to speak

         7     loudly, because we can't hear you.

         8            THE WITNESS:  All right.

         9

        10                        (Lights are switched off.)

        11

        12            Q.    (BY MR. LEONARD)  Now, can you -- first

        13     of all, just so the record is clear, this is a --

        14     would you describe what this is?

        15            A.    This is a close-up of the left leg from

        16     the 1-1 photograph or a blow-up of the 1-1 photograph

        17     purported to be Mr. Simpson's leg.

        18            Q.    Okay.

        19                  Now, why don't you show again, the

        20     anomaly that you discovered in this portion of the

        21     photograph.

        22            A.    Yes.  What we were describing the other

        23     day is this area along here (indicating), this darker

        24     area with the vertical stripes on it, that looks very

        25     much like a worm, or a retouching mark.  It alternates

        26     back light and so on, and so on, which -- what appears

        27     to be brush strokes or digital domain, could be

        28     interpreted as being cleaning, which is a way of
 


                                                                     5
         1     duplicating one specific area within the photograph

         2     and putting it to another point.

         3                    This is an anomaly that is not common.

         4     This is not graphic grain; it does not appear in any

         5     way to be photographic grain, but does appear to be

         6     retouching.

         7            Q.    There another elements on the other leg

         8     that you wanted to illustrate a little more clearly?

         9            A.    Yes, there is.

        10

        11                        (Witness adjusts Elmo.)

        12

        13                  The horizontal line I discussed is this

        14     (indicating), where it is lighter, below that point

        15     and darker above.  And at the point where the

        16     horizontal line goes through the line there, is what

        17     appears to be obvious retouching or some anomaly that

        18     does not belong.  This is not part of the actual,

        19     original photograph.

        20                  That pretty much displays it as much as

        21     we can with this.

        22            MR. LEONARD:  Okay.

        23                  We can turn the lights back on.

        24

        25                        (Bailiffs comply.)

        26

        27            MR. LEONARD:  You may retake the stand.

        28
 


                                                                     6
         1                        (Witness complies.)

         2

         3            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, with that, I don't

         4     have any further questions on direct.

         5            THE COURT:  Okay.  You may cross-examine.

         6            MR. GELBLUM:  Thank you, Your Honor.

         7

         8                       CROSS-EXAMINATION

         9     BY MR. GELBLUM:

        10            Q.    Morning, Mr. Groden.

        11            A.    Morning.

        12            Q.    You're aware, sir, aren't you, that

        13     you're not the first person the defense hired to

        14     examine this photograph?

        15            MR. LEONARD:  Misstates the evidence, Your

        16     Honor.

        17            Q.    You're not aware what your -- that the

        18     defense retained a man named Pat Clark, who took the

        19     photographs -- Buffalo, New York --

        20            THE COURT REPORTER:  Your Honor, I didn't get

        21     that question.  I'm sorry.

        22            MR. BAKER:  Since it was stricken, we ask it

        23     not be repeated.

        24            THE COURT:  No, you will not repeat it.  You

        25     will approach the bench.

        26            MR. GELBLUM:  I will, Your Honor.

        27

        28                         (The following proceedings were
 


                                                                     7
         1                         held at the bench, with the

         2                         reporter.)

         3

         4            MR. PETROCELLI:  I was present at the Scull

         5     deposition with Mr. Baker in Buffalo, New York, and he

         6     had a man by the name of Pat Clark, from Hy Zazula

         7     Associates present at the deposition.

         8                  A break was taken, and Mr. Clark, with a

         9     magnifying glass and some lights, looked at the

        10     negatives and looked at all the subject photos while

        11     we're at the Scull deposition, over a period of time

        12     in the course of the deposition.  And his name is

        13     identified right here (indicating) on the record.

        14            THE COURT:  What is the relevance of that --

        15            MR. PETROCELLI:  Now, because --

        16            THE COURT:  -- with regards to this witness?

        17            MR. PETROCELLI:  We're entitled to know whether

        18     this witness is aware of the fact that there has been

        19     another examination of that photo by the defense, and

        20     what that expert's opinion was -- that expert opined

        21     that it was an authentic photograph, Your Honor.

        22            THE COURT:  You may ask him whether or not he's

        23     aware of an opinion by somebody else in forming his

        24     own opinion, but that's it.

        25            MR. GELBLUM:  Whether he's aware --

        26            THE COURT:  You can't get into the fact that

        27     some other expert examined it through this witness.

        28            MR. PETROCELLI:  If he's aware of it --
 


                                                                     8
         1            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor --

         2            MR. PETROCELLI:  He relied on this deposition.

         3     He read this deposition.  That was brought out on

         4     direct examination, that this is one of the pieces of

         5     information that he relied on in rendering his

         6     opinion.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  In the transcript, it says

         8     that -- it refers to the fact that he examined the

         9     photographs, Mr. Clark, and he's read this deposition.

        10            MR. LEONARD:  Wait.

        11            MR. BAKER:  Your Honor, we're entitled -- and

        12     we had, because we had never seen this photo, and we

        13     were entitled to, and had a consultant there.  That

        14     consultant was never named as an expert in the case;

        15     he was simply a consultant and to help me -- I'm not a

        16     photo expert -- to ask questions.  And he did

        17     certainly look the at the photo.

        18                  They're not entitled to any -- ask any

        19     questions about consultants that we had.

        20            THE COURT:  Did this consultant testify?

        21            MR. PETROCELLI:  No, he never testified, Your

        22     Honor.

        23            THE COURT:  Then what's the relevance?

        24            MR. PETROCELLI:  Whether he relied on anything

        25     that person said or did, which is part of the

        26     deposition on which this witness relied upon in giving

        27     his distinct opinion.

        28            MR. BAKER:  He did not.  There's nothing in
 


                                                                     9
         1     this deposition about Mr. Pat Clark's opinion.  It's

         2     just a cheap shot.

         3            THE COURT:  Just a minute.  Show me where he

         4     stated an opinion.

         5            MR. PETROCELLI:  Whose opinion?

         6            MR. GELBLUM:  He didn't.

         7            THE COURT:  Their expert.

         8            MR. PETROCELLI:  He did not state an opinion.

         9     This fellow, on direct, stated as part of his

        10     testimony, that he relied on this deposition

        11     transcript.

        12            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  What is it that he

        13     relied on with respect to the other expert?

        14            MR. PETROCELLI:  That's what we're trying to

        15     find out, when he talked to him.

        16            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

        17            MR. PETROCELLI:  When he talked to --

        18            THE COURT:  Did the expert say anything about

        19     those photographs?

        20            MR. PETROCELLI:  Did this fellow --

        21            THE COURT:  Yes.

        22            MR. PETROCELLI:  -- talk on the record?  No.

        23            THE COURT:  Then it's sustained.

        24            MR. PETROCELLI:  On what theory?

        25            THE COURT:  On the theory there's nothing in

        26     here which he relied upon with regards to his opinion.

        27            MR. PETROCELLI:  Suppose this fellow had a

        28     conversation with Mr. Clark?
 


                                                                    10
         1            THE COURT:  Why don't you ask him that.

         2            MR. PETROCELLI:  That's what we want to ask

         3     him; that's what we're trying to do.

         4            MR. BAKER:  I'll represent to the Court they've

         5     never spoken.

         6            THE COURT:  You can ask whether they spoke,

         7     period.

         8            MR. PETROCELLI:  Fair enough.

         9            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, why didn't they ask

        10     him that at his deposition?

        11                  He never spoke to him.

        12            THE COURT:  Beats the hell out of me.  And it

        13     doesn't matter.

        14

        15                         (The following proceedings were

        23            Q.    Before you took this assignment,

        25     lawyers were trying to prove the picture was a fake,

        26     right?

        27            A.    I knew there was an issue relating to

        28     that, yes.
 


                                                                    11

         8            A.    Yes.

         9            Q.    And you knew you wouldn't be asked to

        10     come to court to testify unless you said it was a

        11     fake, right?

        12            MR. LEONARD:  Argumentative, Your Honor.

        13            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        14            A.    I would assume I would not have been

        23     morning, nothing else.

        24            Q.    And you went over what you -- what you

         4            Q.    And you and he both had the contact

         8     enlargements that we discussed, yes.

         9            Q.    Now, Mr. Leonard asked you whether you

        10     were a professional witness, and you said you were

        11     not; is that right?

        12            A.    That's correct.

        13            Q.    And you're also not a professional photo

        14     analyst, are you?

        15            A.    Well, I've been paid.

        23            Q.    The question was asked, have you ever had

        26            A.    No.

        27            Q.    You've never taught a course in

         1            A.    No.

         2            Q.    And how many videotapes did you produce

         3     about the Kennedy assassination?

         4            A.    Two.

         5            Q.    Was one of them reedited, and -- two

         6     forms of one of them?

         7            A.    That's correct, yes.

         8            Q.    Which one is that?

         9            A.    It's called JFK, The Case for Conspiracy.

        10            Q.    And you also have consulted on some

        11     movies about the Kennedy assassination?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    Is there anything else you do for a

        14     living?

        15            A.    Right now, no.

        16            Q.    Can you tell the jury what the JFK

        17     Presidential Limo Tour is, sir?

        18            A.     The JFK Limo Tour is a recreation of the

        19     motorcade route for students of history, people who

        20     are concerned with the issues of the assassination.

        21     And it -- it started, I believe, last August in

        22     Dallas.

        23            Q.    And what's your role in that?

        24            A.    Now?

        25            Q.    Yeah.

        26            A.    None.

        27            Q.    You had some role in August?

        28            A.    Yes.
 


                                                                    19
         1            Q.    And you would write, and what happens is,

         2     they take -- is it a mock-up of the actual

         3     presidential limo that President Kennedy was shot in?

         4            A.    That's correct.

         5            Q.    You drive that from Love Field, where he

         6     landed that day, and take that route, and end up at

         7     Parkland Hospital?

         8            A.    That's correct.

         9            Q.    You have speakers in the car that have

        10     the gunshots and things like that --

        11            A.    Yes.

        12            Q.    And you sit in the car and narrate?

        13            A.    Yes.

        14            Q.    Do you not repair photo-processing

        15     machines anymore?

        16            A.    I haven't in many, many months.

        17            Q.    Are you doing any photo processing these

        18     days?

        19            A.    Not these days, no.

        20            Q.    When did you stop doing that work?

        21            A.    Possibly, last summer.  I would say a

        22     year ago this past summer.

        23            Q.    Before your deposition on September 27?

        24            A.    Of this year?

        25            Q.    Yes.

        26            A.    Yeah.

        27            Q.    Don't you recall telling me on

        28     September 27, that you repair photo-processing
 


                                                                    20
         1     machines?

         2            A.    I do.

         3                  You just asked me whether I was still

         4     doing it now, and I said I haven't done it in several

         5     months.

         6            Q.    You said you stopped before your

         7     deposition, right?

         8            A.    Well, I would still do it if the

         9     opportunity came up.  I'm not doing it now.

        10            Q.    Okay.

        11                  But you weren't doing it at the time of

        12     the deposition, even though you told me you were,

        13     right?

        14            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Argumentative.

        15            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        16            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, Mr. Leonard asked

        17     you some questions on Wednesday about the House Select

        18     Committee on Assassination.  Do you remember that?

        19            A.    Yes.

        20            Q.    Is that the only one congressional

        21     committee you've been a consultant to?

        22            A.    As a formal consultant, yes.

        23            Q.    Now, in terms of your education, you

        24     dropped out of high school after the 11th grade; is

        25     that right?

        26            A.    That's correct.

        27            Q.    Okay.  Then you spent a year in the Army?

        28            A.    That's correct.
 


                                                                    21
         1            Q.    And a year of college in the Army?

         2            A.    Yes.

         3            Q.    No photographic courses during that year?

         4            A.    No.

         5            Q.    Am I correct?

         6            A.    Yes.

         7            Q.    Why did you leave the Army after one

         8     year?

         9            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Not relevant.

        10            THE COURT:  I don't know if it is or not.

        11            MR. LEONARD:  Can we approach?

        12            THE COURT:  You may.

        13

        14                         (The following proceedings were

        15                         held at the bench, with the

        16                         reporter.)

        17

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  What our argument, Your Honor, is

        19     going to be, is that this man is not playing with a

        20     full deck and was discharged from the Army; it is

        21     related to that.

        22            THE COURT:  Excuse me?

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  His discharge from the Army is

        24     related to instability.

        25            MR. LEONARD:  What?

        26            THE COURT:  You have to be a little more

        27     specific than that.

        28            MR. GELBLUM:  Medical reasons relating to his
 


                                                                    22
         1     inability to cope with military life.

         2            MR. LEONARD:  What does that have to do with

         3     anything?

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  Our contention is that this man

         5     is not a particularly stable person.  He doesn't have

         6     any business testifying in court at all, much less as

         7     an expert.

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Number one is, why wasn't this

         9     raised during the voir dire, if you felt he was

        10     unstable.  You were making an argument that he wasn't

        11     an expert.

        12                  Number two, how can you -- the guy's 51

        13     years old -- you're trying to connect up a problem

        14     which he may or may not have had when he was 18 years

        15     old to now.  Is that what you're trying to do, based

        16     on -- on a -- on perceived problems he had in the

        17     Army?  How is that relevant?

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  Remember, Dan, you went back to

        19     when he was 12 or 13 years old when his interest in

        20     photography --

        21            MR. LEONARD:  I remember, yeah.

        22            MR. GELBLUM:  This is more recent.

        23            THE COURT:  I'll allow you reasonable --

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  It's just one question.  I'm just

        25     going to ask him the reason.  Whatever he says --

        26            THE COURT:  All right.

        27

        28
 


                                                                    23
         1                         (The following proceedings were

         2                         held in open court, in the

         3                         presence of the jury.)

         4            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Sir, you left the Army

         5     after only one year because of some health problem; is

         6     that right?

         7            A.    That's right.

         8            Q.    What was the problem?

         9            A.    Sinus problems.

        10            Q.    Sinus?

        11            A.    Sinus problems.

        12                  There are actually two -- two separate

        13     issues.  One was a sinus problem that they were not

        14     able to resolve, and the second was the fact that I

        15     was -- I was beaten up by a sergeant.  And to sweep it

        16     under the rug, they gave me a discharge instead.

        17            Q.    Did you have some inability to cope with

        18     military life, sir?

        19            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Argumentative,

        20     irrelevant.

        21            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        22            A.    Did I?

        23            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Yeah.

        24            A.    I coped with it for a year until the

        25     discharge.

        26            Q.    Didn't you testify before the Rockefeller

        27     Commission, sir, in the 1970s sometime?

        28            A.    Yes.
 


                                                                    24
         1            Q.    Didn't you tell them the reason you left

         2     the Army was you had an inability to cope with

         3     military life, having something to do with a medical

         4     problem?

         5            A.    I don't recall what I said to them back

         6     then.

         7            Q.    Would you like to see your testimony?

         8            A.    Sure.

         9

        10                        (Mr. Gelblum hands document to

        11                         witness.)

        12

        13            MR. LEONARD:  Can I see it, Counsel?

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  Before he gives the answer.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Wait.  Before you give

        16     this answer, do you recognize this as your Rockefeller

        17     Commission testimony?

        18            A.    No, I don't, but it might well be.

        19            MR. GELBLUM:  Want to look it over?

        20            MR. LEONARD:  May we have a date?

        21            MR. GELBLUM:  I don't -- I have just an

        22     excerpt.

        23            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, can we approach?

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  When did you testify

        25     before the Rockefeller Commission?

        26            A.    I believe 1975.

        27            Q.    Does that look like your testimony?

        28            A.    I can't say that it is; I can't say it
 


                                                                    25
         1     isn't.

         2                  I don't recognize this as my testimony.

         3            Q.    You don't?

         4            A.    No.

         5            Q.    You sure you testified before the

         6     Rockefeller Commission?

         7            A.    Yes.  Oh, yes.

         8            Q.    What did you testify about?

         9            A.    About the Kennedy assassination.

        10            Q.    Remember being questioned at length about

        11     your credentials?

        12            A.    No, I don't have any --

        13            Q.    Why don't you read that over.

        14

        15                        (Witness reviews document.)

        16

        17            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You recognize that now

        18     as your Rockefeller Commission testimony?

        19            A.    No, I don't.

        20            Q.    Is this a fake?

        21            A.    I don't know.  I have not seen my

        22     Rockefeller Commission testimony since I gave it.

        23            Q.    You don't remember being questioned about

        24     your credentials by the Rockefeller Commission?

        25            MR. LEONARD:  Asked and answered.

        26            A.    It was more than 20 years ago.

        27            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  That's when your

        28     experience with altered photographs is, 20 years ago?
 


                                                                    26
         1            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Misstates his

         2     testimony.  It's argumentative.

         3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, speaking about

         5     that experience, Mr. Leonard had you talk about your

         6     experience creating fake photographs on Wednesday.

         7     Remember that?

         8            A.    Yes.

         9            Q.    That was mostly what you talked about,

        10     was creating advertisements with a can of hair spray

        11     in the air.  Remember that?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    Now, when that's created, what

        14     elements -- is that created from that fake

        15     advertising?

        16            A.    It -- it can vary.  Depends on what's

        17     submitted.  It could be flat art; it could be slides;

        18     it could be negatives; it could be photographic

        19     prints.  It could be any number of things.

        20            Q.    Those are things that are submitted and

        21     created for the purpose of creating that composite

        22     photograph, correct?

        23            A.    Um-hum, yes.

        24            Q.    It's not taking a photograph as to be

        25     taken for some other purpose and altering it, correct?

        26            A.    That could happen if somebody wanted a

        27     background that was taken for some other reason.

        28            Q.    Is -- you just said, generally speaking,
 


                                                                    27
         1     you're taking pictures or other elements that are made

         2     for the purpose of creating this composite, and then

         3     you create the composite, correct?

         4            A.    That's a fair assessment, yes.

         5            Q.    Now, you also testified on Wednesday that

         6     you -- this is a quote -- "I believe I occasionally

         7     consult with others regarding the authenticity of

         8     photographs."  Is that right?

         9            A.    That is correct.

        10            Q.    "Occasionally" means that, in your entire

        11     life, there have been two times where somebody has

        12     paid you to try to determine the authenticity of a

        13     photograph, correct?

        14            A.    I can't say that's accurate, no.

        15            Q.    Do you remember testifying Wednesday

        16     morning, outside the presence of the jury, sir, in

        17     this courtroom?

        18            A.    Yes, I do.

        19            Q.    And do you remember we talked about this,

        20     and you identified two times where you had done that?

        21                  You going to change your testimony now?

        22            A.    I don't want to change anything.

        23                  What you asked me then, I do not believe

        24     is what you asked me now.

        25            Q.    Isn't it true, sir, that in your entire

        26     life, that you have been paid to determine whether a

        27     photograph is authentic exactly twice?

        28            A.    That is not true.
 


                                                                    28
         1            Q.    Okay.  How many times, sir?

         2            A.    I can't tell you how many times.  I can

         3     tell you several occasions, more than two.

         4            Q.    Okay.

         5                  Did you forget to mention those at your

         6     deposition two months ago, sir, three months ago?

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Argumentative.

         8            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         9            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Do you remember having

        10     your deposition taken?

        11            A.    Yes.

        12            Q.    Remember I asked you about all the times

        13     you had been paid to determine the authenticity of

        14     photographs?

        15                  Remember that question?

        16                  And you remember how many you listed?

        17            A.    I don't remember exactly how many.  I

        18     don't remember the terms of the question.

        19            Q.    In fact, at the time of the deposition,

        20     you actually identified once, didn't you?

        21            A.    I don't recall.

        22            Q.    Do you have a problem with your memory?

        23            A.    You've just asked me a question.

        24            Q.    Answer my question.  Do you have a

        25     problem --

        26            MR. LEONARD:  Argumentative.

        27            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        28            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  This is a real
 


                                                                    29
         1     question, sir.

         2                  Do you have a problem with your memory?

         3            A.    My memory is not always the greatest.

         4            Q.    You've had some strokes, sir?

         5            A.    Yes.

         6            Q.    And did it affect your memory?

         7            A.    Yes.

         8            Q.    Okay.

         9                  I'd like to you look at --

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  Mr. Leonard, this is on pages 30

        11     to 31 of the deposition.

        12            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  If you can review this,

        13     sir, starting at page 30, line -- line 2 -- I'm sorry.

        14     Up here, page 29, line 21, down to page 31 line 17.

        15

        16                    (Witness reviews transcript.)

        17

        18            A.    Okay.

        19            Q.    Okay.

        20                  Remember I asked you about jobs you had,

        21     where somebody had paid you for determining the

        22     authenticity of a photograph?

        23            A.    That's correct.

        24            Q.    You said the National Enquirer, 14 years

        25     ago?

        26            A.    Yes.

        27            Q.    And then you said -- I asked you if there

        28     were any others, and you said, "none I can think of
 


                                                                    30
         1     right at the moment"?

         2            A.    Yes.

         3            Q.    And then you thought of another one?

         4            A.    How do you mean?

         5            Q.    Did you think of another one because you

         6     told me at deposition there was the one?

         7            A.    No.  During the deposition, you asked me,

         8     except for the House Assassinations Committee.

         9            Q.    You weren't a paid consultant?

        10            A.    For the House Committee?

        11            Q.    Yeah.

        12            A.    Yes, I was.

        13            Q.    And your job there was what?

        14            A.    Many things, such as determining the

        15     authenticity of photographs.

        16            Q.    Let me put aside the House Committee for

        17     a second.  We'll deal with that in quite a bit of

        18     detail later on.

        19                  Putting that aside, how many times have

        20     you been paid to determine the authenticity of a

        21     photograph?

        22            A.    Not counting the House Assassinations

        23     Committee, as I recall, twice.

        24            Q.    Twice.

        25                  So, a minute ago, when I asked you how

        26     many times, you said you couldn't remember.

        27                  It's three, right?  Two plus the house?

        28     That's 3?
 


                                                                    31
         1            A.    I did it several times for the House

         2     Committee.  It wasn't just once.

         3            Q.    That's one job, right?  The House and

         4     then two other jobs?

         5            A.    Yes.

         6            Q.    Okay.

         7                  And let's talk about those two jobs.

         8                  One was the National Enquirer, 14 years

         9     ago?

        10            A.    Approximately.

        11            Q.    That was something about a voodoo ritual?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    And in fact, you didn't have to examine

        14     that closely; you looked at it and saw there was

        15     static electricity that was causing the problem?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    That wasn't an altered photograph, right?

        18            A.    No.

        19            Q.    How much were you paid for that, by the

        20     way?

        21            A.    I don't recall at all.

        22            Q.    You sure you got paid?

        23            A.    Pretty much so, yes.

        24            Q.    Now, the second one was -- was what?

        25                  What was your second job that you had

        26     where somebody paid you to determine the authenticity

        27     of a photograph?

        28            MR. LEONARD:  I assume we're still setting
 


                                                                    32
         1     aside the House --

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  We are indeed.

         3            MR. LEONARD:  Okay.

         4            A.    Someone came to me about -- about four

         5     years ago, and had a series of photographs that

         6     purported to show what was claimed to be spiritual

         7     entities within a photograph.  And I was asked to see

         8     if I could find any evidence of tampering with the

         9     photographs.

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And again, it was

        11     pretty easy to look at.  You looked at it and saw

        12     there was fogging on the print, right?

        13            A.    That is correct.

        14            Q.    Well, not a big, detailed analysis of

        15     altered photographs, right?

        16            A.    Not to determine that, no.

        17            Q.    All right.

        18                  And again, putting aside the House

        19     Committee for a minute, in addition to those two,

        20     there's only one other time in your life when somebody

        21     has asked to you determine the authenticity of a

        22     photograph, where you didn't get paid, correct?

        23            A.    No, that's not true.

        24            Q.    Well --

        25                  Reading from your deposition, starting at

        26     page 31, line 18.

        27                         Q.     Now, tell me about any

        28                  time that you've worked for somebody
 


                                                                    33
         1                  else, without getting paid, where the

         2                  job involved determining the

         3                  authenticity of a negative or a print.

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I'm going to object.

         5     That is -- there's -- that's a different question than

         6     he just asked.  He asked if he had ever been asked by

         7     anyone.  Now's he asked him if he ever worked for

         8     anyone.  That's a different question.  I object to

         9     that.

        10            THE COURT:  Overruled.  You may answer it.

        11            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  All right.  Let me ask

        12     you this one, sir, since we're apparently splitting

        13     hairs up there.

        14            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Move to strike that

        15     statement.

        16            THE COURT:  Stricken.

        17            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Other than the National

        18     Enquirer and this other photo with the nothing gone,

        19     and the -- and the spirits, how many times have you

        20     worked for somebody without getting paid, determining

        21     the authenticity of a photograph?

        22            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Vague.

        23            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        24            A.    How would you define "worked?"  Looking

        25     at a photograph, studying it?  What do you mean by

        26     that?

        27            Q.    Well, did you just phase out for a

        28     second?
 


                                                                    34
         1                  Didn't you hear your counsel use the word

         2     "work" and you nodded?

         3            A.    No.  I nodded that you were

         4     misrepresenting the question.

         5            Q.    I see.

         6                  Let's read the deposition now.

         7                         Now, tell me about any time that

         8                  you've worked for somebody else without

         9                  getting paid, where the job involved

        10                  determining the authenticity of a

        11                  negative or a print.

        12                  You didn't say anything about not

        13     understanding the word "worked."

        14

        15                         A.     About a month ago, a new

        16                  photograph turned up in Dallas that

        17                  shows the road sign that's blocking the

        18                  view from Abraham (phonetic) section

        19                  up -- standpoint from where the

        20                  president was in this photograph, which

        21                  had never been seen before, seemed to

        22                  show what appeared to be a bullet hole

        23                  in the sign.

        24                               Now, if there had been a

        25                  bullet hole there, it would have been

        26                  very interesting, because it would have

        27                  proven other than what was found.

        28                               What it actually was, it
 


                                                                    35
         1                  was just a printing mistake.  The way I

         2                  determined that was the so-called bullet

         3                  hole was about 300 percent sharper than

         4                  the rest of the picture, which is a

         5                  physical impossibility with photographic

         6                  signs.

         7                         Q.     Did you get the negative?

         8                         A.     No, but I can get the

         9                  negative.

        10                         Q.     What?

        11                         A.     Just from the print

        12                  itself, I could determine that -- I

        13                  could determine that if it had been a

        14                  closer situation, if it hadn't been so

        15                  incredibly obvious to me, if it had

        16                  looked genuine, I would have had to -- I

        17                  would have to examine the negative to

        18                  determine one way or the other.

        19                         Q.     Did you determine that was

        20                  a printing error or a deliberate

        21                  forgery?

        22                         A.     No; it seemed to be an

        23                  error.  It didn't seem to be a forgery.

        24                         Q.     And that's the same thing

        25                  with the National Enquirer photo of the

        26                  spirit; it was static electricity in the

        27                  negative?

        28                         A.     In that particular case,
 


                                                                    36
         1                  yes.

         2            MR. LEONARD:  I'm going to object at this

         3     point.

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  It's the next couple of

         5     questions.

         6                         Q.     Any other time where

         7                  somebody else has asked to you determine

         8                  whether a photograph was authentic?

         9                         A.     None that I can think of

        10                  at the moment.  But if I do, I'll let

        11                  you know.

        12                         Q.     Now is the time?

        13                         A.     No.  I can't think of any

        14                  right now.

        15                  Remember that testimony?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    Now, you have a resume, don't you, sir?

        18            A.    Yes.

        19            Q.    Mr. Leonard didn't use this yesterday,

        20     but I want to show it to you.

        21            MR. GELBLUM:  If we could have this marked next

        22     in order.

        23            THE CLERK:  2284.

        24

        25

        26                         (The instrument herein referred to

        27                         as Copy of Mr. Groden's resume

        28                         was marked for identification as

         2

         3

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Peter, can I see a copy of that,

         5     please.

         6            MR. GELBLUM:  Yes.

         7

         8                         (Mr. Gelblum hands Plaintiffs'

         9                         Exhibit 2284 to the witness.)

        10

        11            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Take a look at that and

        12     confirm if that's your resume -- actually, three pages

        13     of a resume and another five pages of what you call a

        14     profile?

        15            A.    Okay.

        16            Q.    Is that right?

        17            A.    Yes.

        18            Q.    And you created this document, these

        19     documents?

        20            A.    Yes, sir.

        21            Q.    Now, this resume starts out on the first

        22     page, work history, right?

        23            A.    Yes.

        24            Q.    And the first entry is videotape

        25     production and editing?

        26            A.    Yes.

        27            Q.    Let the jury see what are you're looking

        28     at here.
 


                                                                    38
         1

         2                         (Document displayed on Elmo.)

         3

         4            Q.    First entry is videotape production and

         5     editing, next entry is photographic optical affects

         6     experience, right?

         7            A.    Yes.

         8            Q.    And you say in the second sentence there

         9     that you've worked on many major motion pictures

        10     including one called "Executive Action."

        11                  What did you do on that movie, sir?

        12            A.    I was a consultant, not hired by the

        13     production company itself, but had made suggestions to

        14     deal with the creation of motorcade footage relating

        15     to the assassination.

        16                  In other words, finding relevant footage

        17     and connecting between the production company as

        18     liaison and the optical house where it was produced.

        19            Q.    Who did you make those suggestions to?

        20            A.    Well, among others, there were probably a

        21     couple of researchers involved, I did, from the

        22     optical house itself.

        23            Q.    You didn't get a credit on the film, did

        24     you?

        25            A.    No.

        26            Q.    And on the second page -- I'm sorry, the

        27     bottom of the first page, Steve, I apologize --

        28     there's another heading down there, photographic
 


                                                                    39
         1     laboratory technician?

         2            A.    Yes.

         3            Q.    And on the second page you say you're

         4     familiar with all portions of black-and-white lab

         5     work; is that right?

         6            A.    Yes.

         7            Q.    And then we get some management

         8     experience, and there's your repair work, and then now

         9     we get your photographic consultant work, right?

        10            A.    Yes.

        11            Q.    Okay.

        12                  Now, the first sentence says:

        13                  (Reading:)

        14                  Robert Groden has been a photographic

        15                  consultant for the United States House

        16                  of Representatives since 1975.

        17            Q.    That's just not true, is it, sir?

        18            A.    It certainly is true.

        19            Q.    You just told us that you worked for the

        20     House Select Committee in the late '70s and that's the

        21     only committee you've been a consultant for, right?

        22            A.    That's true.

        23            Q.    Okay.

        24                  And that sentence goes on to say:

        25                  (Reading:)

        26

        27                  And was staff photographic consultant

        28                  with the initial capital letters to the
 


                                                                    40
         1                  House Select Committee on assassination

         2                  from 1975 to 1979.

         3

         4            Q.    That's not true either, is it, sir?

         5            A.    It is true.

         6            Q.    Well, remember testifying here on

         7     Wednesday?  Was your memory that bad?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

         9            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        10            Q.    Remember testifying Wednesday, sir?

        11                  Do you remember testifying in this court

        12     on Wednesday?

        13            A.    Yes, I do.

        14            Q.    Two days ago?

        15            A.    Yes.

        16            Q.    Do you remember the dates you gave the

        17     jury then?

        18            A.    From the middle of 1976 until the middle

        19     of 1979.

        20            Q.    Right.

        21                  And this says 1975, right?

        22            A.    I was working with the people who were

        23     creating the committee.  I was helping raise support

        24     for it.

        25            Q.    Oh, okay.

        26                  But you weren't, in fact, called a

        27     consultant in 1975, were you?

        28            A.    No.
 


                                                                    41
         1            Q.    Okay.

         2                  You then say that you authored the

         3     dissenting opinion report for the Committee.

         4                  That's also not true, is it, sir?

         5            A.    It is true.

         6            Q.    Well, in fact what you wrote was

         7     something called "comments" on the panel's report,

         8     right?

         9            A.    Yes.

        10            Q.    Okay.

        11                  And the Committee printed a page before

        12     your little comments saying that they disagreed with

        13     you, right?

        14            A.    Yes.

        15            Q.    And this was a panel of photographic

        16     experts that you were a consultant to, right?

        17            A.    That's correct.

        18            Q.    You disagreed with the panel of

        19     photographic experts, right?

        20            A.    In many issues, yes.

        21            Q.    Okay.

        22                  And they did not adopt your conclusions

        23     at all.

        24                  In fact, they rejected them, right?

        25            A.    They adopted some, they rejected some.

        26            Q.    This was not a dissenting report for the

        27     Committee, this was just your little add-on that they

        28     agreed to publish for you, right?
 


                                                                    42
         1            A.    No, they asked me to publish my opinions.

         2            Q.    No.

         3                  You asked them if you could publish -- if

         4     they would publish it, right?

         5            A.    I don't believe so.

         6            Q.    Okay.

         7                  Let's take a look.

         8                  I'm going to show you portions of the

         9     appendix to the hearings, it's Volume 6 from the

        10     Senate -- from the House Select Committee on

        11     Assassinations, page 295.

        12            MR. LEONARD:  May I look, so I see that before

        13     it's published in any way.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  Yeah.

        15

        16                         (Witness reviews document.)

        17

        18            Q.    Is this your -- sorry, wrong side of the

        19     pen.

        20                  Is this the letter you wrote to the

        21     chairman of the Committee in January 3, 1979?

        22            A.    Yes.

        23            Q.    And you asked them to publish it, right?

        24            A.    I was told by Jane Downey (phonetic) that

        25     this is the form it should take.

        26            Q.    Somebody told you to ask them?

        27            A.    Yes, um-hum.

        28            Q.    Do you agree now that you did ask them?
 


                                                                    43
         1            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

         2            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         3            Q.    Well, here's the preface that the

         4     Committee wrote.

         5            THE COURT:  Why don't you show it to

         6     Mr. Leonard if you're going to use it.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  Sure.

         8            THE COURT:  Mr. Gelblum.

         9

        10                         (Mr. Gelblum shows document to

        11                         Mr. Leonard.)

        12

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  I think I may have an extra copy.

        14

        15            MR. LEONARD:  Is this mine?

        16            MR. GELBLUM:  No.

        17            MR. LEONARD:  I'd love to keep it.

        18                  Okay, thanks.

        19            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  See the last sentence

        20     of the first paragraph.  It says:

        21                  (Reading:)

        23                  As a consultant to the Committee, Groden

        24                  was given access to the work of the

        25                  photographic evidence panel and asked

        26                  that the Committee publish his comments

        27                  on the panel's report.

        28
 


                                                                    44
         1            Q.    Is that a true statement?

         2            A.    Yes, it's true.

         3            Q.    Okay.

         4            A.    But only in the respect that's what I was

         5     told I had -- the way I had to represent the question,

         6     the issue.

         7            MR. LEONARD:  You going to read the rest of it

         8     now or do I have to?

         9            MR. GELBLUM:  I'll read the rest of it later or

        10     more of it later.

        11            MR. BAKER:  Can we have that identified by

        12     number.

        13            THE CLERK:  Next in order.

        14                  2285.

        15

        16                         (The instrument herein described

        17                         as a Curriculum Vitae of Robert

        18                         Groden was marked for

        19                         identification as Plaintiffs'

        20                         Exhibit No. 2285.)

        21

        22            THE COURT:  What?

        23            THE CLERK:  2285.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, you know a man

        25     named Robert Blakey?

        26            A.    Yes.

        27            Q.    Who's that?

        28            A.     G. Robert Blakey is the -- or was the
 


                                                                    45
         1     director of the House Select Committee on

         2     Assassinations.

         3            Q.    Say it again?

         4            A.    He was the director and chief counsel, as

         5     I recall, of the House Select Committee on

         6     Assassinations.

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I'm going to object

         8     to this line of questioning.

         9                  May we approach briefly?

        10            THE COURT:  You may.

        11

        12                         (The following proceedings were

        13                         held at the bench with the

        14                         reporter:)

        15

        16            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I object to this.  I

        17     thought we were talking about the photographs in this

        18     case.  If he wants to go back and relitigate the

        19     assassination, the conspiracy theory, we're willing to

        20     do that.

        21                  I mean he's prepared to justify his

        22     opinions in this case.  I didn't ask him any of his

        23     opinions in that case.  I simply asked him if he was a

        24     photographic consultant.  He was.

        25                  The rest of that report says he made an

        26     important contribution to the Committee.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  That's one line.

        28            MR. LEONARD:  Yeah, it's an important line.
 


                                                                    46
         1            MR. GELBLUM:  The rest of it says that they

         2     disagree with him, he made lots of mistakes.

         3            THE COURT:  How much longer are you going to go

         4     through this?

         5            MR. GELBLUM:  Not much further.

         6            MR. LEONARD:  I want an offer of proof.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  You don't get it.

         8                  Your Honor, he's relying on this

         9     Committee as his sole claim to fame for any

        10     credibility of any kind of expertise.

        11            MR. LEONARD:  No, that's not true.

        12            THE COURT:  I'm not prepared to litigate the

        13     contents of that report.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  I'm not going to ask my more

        15     questions about his report.

        16            MR. LEONARD:  That's an absolute misstatement.

        17                  His primary expertise is the fact that he

        18     did this --

        19            THE COURT:  Mr. Leonard, you submitted that as

        20     part of his qualifications.  He has a right to

        21     cross-examine.

        22

        23                         (The following proceedings were

        24                         held in open court in the presence

        25                         of the jury.)

        26

        27            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Blakey was the

        28     director of the Committee?
 


                                                                    47
         1            A.    As I recall, the director and chief

         2     counsel.

         3            Q.    Okay.  You've heard him say that.

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.

         5            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         6            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You think Mr. Blakey

         7     would vouch for your --

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, irrelevant, hearsay.

         9            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Argumentative.

        10            MR. LEONARD:  Argumentative.  Ask the jury be

        11     admonished.

        12            THE COURT:  Jury is admonished that anything

        13     Mr. Blakey has said has not been received into

        14     evidence.  You're to disregard any reference thereto.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, your resume goes

        16     on to say that he was called upon to testify about the

        17     photographic evidence in the assassination of

        18     President John F. Kennedy before four governmental

        19     investigative bodies; the Rockefeller Commission --

        20     that's the one you couldn't recognize in your

        21     testimony, right?

        22            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  That's argumentative.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  I showed him the transcript.

        24            MR. LEONARD:  That assumes the transcript is

        25     authentic.

        26            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        27            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  When you did the

        28     Rockefeller Commission, you were you showed the
 


                                                                    48
         1     Zapruder film?

         2            A.    Yes, among other things.

         3            Q.    You didn't testify about altered

         4     photographs, did you?

         5            A.    I said it was 21 years ago.  I don't

         6     recall exactly what I testified to, but I know the

         7     Zapruder film was one of the issues.

         8            Q.    Altered photographs was not one of the

         9     issues, right?

        10            A.    I can't say that.  I don't know that.

        11            Q.    You don't remember whether it was?

        12            A.    Over 20 years ago, no, I don't --

        13            Q.    The Senate Intelligence Committee, showed

        14     them the Zapruder film?

        15            A.    No.

        16            Q.    What did you do with them?

        17            A.    Spoke about various issues relating to

        18     the assassination questions that were raised by the

        19     photographic evidence and the Zapruder film.

        20            Q.    What year was that?

        21            A.    As I recall, that was 19 -- probably --

        22     probably around 1977 or so.

        23            Q.    You didn't testify about altered

        24     photographs there, did you?

        25            A.    I don't recall.

        26            Q.    Okay.

        27                  And then we have the House Select

        28     Committee, which we've talked about.
 


                                                                    49
         1                  Then you say:

         2                  (Reading:)

         3                  I've been called upon to testify before

         4                  the Assassination Record Review Board.

         5            A.    Yes.

         6            Q.    What is the Assassination Record Review

         7     Board?

         8            A.    The Assassination Record Review Board

         9     does -- an investigation is going on now to try to

        10     determine what issues relating to the assassination,

        11     photographic and documentary, should be released to

        12     the public.

        13            Q.    You didn't testify, you didn't give

        14     expert testimony before them about altered

        15     photographs, did you?

        16            A.    I believe I did.

        17            Q.    Well, in fact, sir, you were deposed

        18     twice by the Assassination Records Review Board

        19     relating to your theft of photos from the government

        20     when you worked in the House Select Committee,

        21     correct?

        22            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  That -- There's a

        23     lack of foundation.  It's argumentative.

        24                  I'd asked to approach at this point.

        25            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Isn't that correct?

        26            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        27                  You can answer yes or no.

        28            A.    No, that is not.  If you're asking if I
 


                                                                    50
         1     stole photographs from the government, the answer is

         2     absolutely no.

         3            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  I'm asking you the

         4     subject of what you put on your resume is your

         5     testimony before the Assassination Records Review

         6     Board, it was not expert testimony, it was depositions

         7     that you were required to submit to about the subject

         8     of your theft of government documents, correct?

         9            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, first of all, there's

        10     no inconsistency.  It's also argumentative.  It's --

        11            MR. GELBLUM:  This is a speaking objection.

        12            MR. LEONARD:  It's a lack of foundation.

        13                  I'd ask to approach.

        14                  This is character assassination.  It has

        15     nothing to do with the photographs in this case.

        16            THE COURT:  Bring your proof.

        17            MR. PETROCELLI:  I'd ask --

        18            MR. LEONARD:  Ask some questions about the

        19     photographs.

        20            THE COURT:  Mr. Leonard.

        21            MR. GELBLUM:  I'd ask the jury be admonished

        22     and Mr. Leonard be admonished in front of the jury

        23     about these improper remarks.

        24            THE COURT:  I think I'd admonish both of you to

        25     stop your outbursts.

        26                         (The following proceedings were

        27                         held at the bench with the

        28                         reporter:)
 


                                                                    51
         1

         2            MR. BAKER:  I'll stand in between them.

         3            THE COURT:  Good idea.

         4                  Where's the proof?

         5            MR. GELBLUM:  I spoke with the man who took the

         6     deposition.  I don't have the documents.  I don't have

         7     depositions.  I have to subpoena him.  I have a

         8     subpoena I can serve --

         9            THE COURT:  Excuse me.

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  I don't have the depositions,

        11     Your Honor.  I spoke with the man who took the

        12     depositions for the Assassination Records Review Board

        13     and he told me that this is what happened.

        14            MR. LEONARD:  What happened?

        15            MR. GELBLUM:  The man was deposed twice.  He

        16     knows full well it's absolutely true, and he took -- a

        17     man named Jeremy Gunn (phonetic) from the

        18     Assassination Review Board took his deposition twice

        19     in June of this year and a little later.

        20            THE COURT:  Why don't you have the depositions?

        21

        22            MR. GELBLUM:  Because I just found out about it

        23     last week, Your Honor.  I just found this man.

        24            THE COURT:  I'm not going to permit you to

        25     admit these inflammatory accusations without some

        26     proof.

        27            MR. LEONARD:  He said --

        28            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor --
 


                                                                    52
         1            MR. PETROCELLI:  He admits he was in a

         2     deposition.

         3            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  You just got somebody

         4     that I don't know anything about telling you --

         5            MR. GELBLUM:  I'll give you his phone number.

         6            THE COURT:  I don't want his phone number.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  He is the man who took the

         8     deposition.

         9            THE COURT:  I'm not letting you shoot from the

        10     hip.

        11            MR. GELBLUM:  I'm not shooting from the hip.

        12            THE COURT:  Don't do it.

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  I have documents.

        14            THE COURT:  Don't do it.

        15            MR. LEONARD:  I move for mistrial.

        16            MR. GELBLUM:  Oh --

        17            MR. LEONARD:  Yes.  He put before the jury --

        18     he said you were deposed because you did steal, that's

        19     outrageous.  They cleared him.

        20            MR. PETROCELLI:  Shhh.

        21            MR. LEONARD:  I move for a mistrial.

        22            THE COURT:  You're request for a mistrial is

        23     denied.

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  Can I ask him if he was deposed?

        25            THE COURT:  No.  I don't like the way you asked

        26     him based on what you know.

        27            MR. LEONARD:  Ask the jury be admonished there

        28     is no evidence that he stole anything.
 


                                                                    53
         1            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, what better

         2     evidence --

         3            THE COURT:  You don't have any evidence at this

         4     point.

         5            MR. GELBLUM:  The person who took the

         6     deposition --

         7            THE COURT:  Where is he?

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  He's in Washington, D.C.

         9            THE COURT:  Exactly.

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  If you want --

        11            THE COURT:  Exactly.

        12            MR. GELBLUM:  I'll bring him in.  We'll

        13     subpoena the records and bring him in.

        14            THE COURT:  You bring him in.

        15                  But you're not going to do it now.

        16            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, he's on the stand, I

        17     have to ask him the question.

        18                  It's absolutely true, Your Honor.  It is

        19     absolutely true.

        20            MR. LEONARD:  What's true?

        21            THE COURT:  You're not going to ask it in that

        22     fashion.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  Let me ask it --

        24            THE COURT:  You've already done your damage.

        25            MR. GELBLUM:  Let me ask him whether he's been

        26     deposed.

        27            THE COURT:  You've already done the damage.

        28                  And you can ask him whether he's been
 


                                                                    54
         1     deposed, period.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  On the subject --

         3            MR. PETROCELLI:  Can we ask him about the

         4     subject matter?

         5            THE COURT:  No.

         6            MR. LEONARD:  He already did that and

         7     misrepresented to the jury --

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  I did not.

         9            MR. LEONARD:  You did.

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  I did not.  Knock it off.

        11            THE COURT:  I'm not going to permit this.

        12            MR. LEONARD:  Ask the --

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  I ask him if he's been deposed --

        14            THE COURT:  You already asked him --

        15            MR. GELBLUM:  I thought you could ask him that,

        16     but he didn't answer that question.  If you go back in

        17     the record, he doesn't answer.

        18            THE COURT:  You can ask him if he's been

        19     deposed, period.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Okay, fine.

        21            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I ask that the jury

        22     be -- he made a representation in his question --

        23            THE COURT:  I'm not going to -- I have already

        24     admonished them.

        25            MR. LEONARD:  Thank you.

        26            MR. LEONARD:  I ask that they be admonished.

        27            THE COURT:  You've already asked me.  I said I

        28     would.  Why do you have to ask me again?
 


                                                                    55
         1

         2                         (The following proceedings were

         3                         heal in open court in the presence

         4                         of the jury.)

         5

         6            THE COURT:  Okay.

         7                  Ladies and gentlemen, the Court is

         8     instructing you to disregard Mr. Gelblum's question to

         9     the effect that the question accuses this witness of

        10     having stole anything.

        11                  This is a case in which the law requires

        12     that evidence be produced to show a fact.

        13                  The plaintiff or any counsel, even

        14     defense counsel, cannot establish evidence by

        15     innuendo.

        16                  That was a question that had innuendo in

        17     it.  There is no evidence whatsoever before you to

        18     show that this witness stole anything at any time.

        19                  Everybody understand that?

        20            JURORS:  Yes.

        21            MR. LEONARD:  Thank you.

        22            THE COURT:  Now, let's cut out that type of

        23     question.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Groden, isn't it

        25     true you've been deposed by the Assassination Report

        26     Review Board twice this year?

        27            A.    That is correct.

        28            Q.    On the next page of your resume you say
 


                                                                    56
         1     Mr. Groden has been called to present photographic

         2     evidence as an expert consultant in the Manning case,

         3     international bombing incidents, and several other

         4     court cases.

         5                  Do you see that?

         6            A.    Yes.

         7            Q.    In fact, you never testified in court as

         8     an expert on photographic evidence before this case,

         9     correct?

        10            A.    That is correct.

        11            Q.    But you have appeared on -- what does it

        12     say, 2,000 television and radio shows?

        13            A.    Approximately, yes.

        14            Q.    That includes nine times on "Inside

        15     Edition"?

        16                  You want to look at page three of your

        17     profile?

        18            A.    Yes.

        19            Q.    "Oprah Winfrey" and "Geraldo," right?

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            Q.    Now, turn to the last page of the

        22     profile, please.  It talks about your videotape you

        23     produced?

        24            A.    Yes.

        25            Q.    And I think you told us before that the

        26     "Case for Conspiracy" you re-edited and are selling a

        27     second version; is that right?

        28            A.    That's correct.
 


                                                                    57
         1            Q.    And that's because somebody asked you to

         2     take some footage out?

         3            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, hearsay, irrelevant.

         4                  Ask to approach.

         5

         6                         (The Court reviewed real-time

         7                         computer screen.)

         8

         9            THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.

        10                  Your request to approach is denied.

        11            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Okay.

        12                  Are you using footage in that videotape

        13     from somebody named Haskel (phonetic)?

        14            A.    Yes.

        15            Q.    And somebody else named Tower (phonetic)?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    Did you have their authorization to use

        18     that?

        19            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, irrelevant.

        20            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        21            A.    I had permission from the agent, for

        22     Steve Haskel prior to it's use.  And I had not had

        23     permission from Tina Tower.  I tried to get it but

        24     could not locate her, she had changed her name and

        25     moved to a different town.

        26            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  So you used the footage

        27     anyway?

        28            A.    Yes.  I had done a lot of work for her
 


                                                                    58
         1     that I had not been paid for and I didn't think that

         2     she would mind.

         3            Q.    And is she suing you now because of that?

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, irrelevant.

         5            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         6            A.    Yes, she has filed suit.

         7            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, turning to the

         8     photograph in this case --

         9            THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll take a 10-minute

        10     recess, ladies and gentlemen.

        11

        12                         (Recess.)

        13

        14                         (Jurors resume their respective

        15                         seats.)

        16

        17            THE COURT:  You may examine.

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  Thank you, Your Honor.

        19            Q.      (BY MR. GELBLUM)  On Wednesday, sir,

        20     you and Mr. Leonard had an exchange about a couple

        21     times you've had deals with "National Enquirer."

        22                  You recall that?

        23            A.    Yes.

        24            Q.    The one we talked about this morning

        25     already, 14 years ago with the voodoo ritual?

        26            A.    Yes.

        27            Q.    The second is with the photo at issue in

        28     this case?
 


                                                                    59
         1            A.    That's correct.

         2            Q.    And you were contacted by the "National

         3     Enquirer" and asked to look at this photograph; is

         4     that right?

         5            A.    That's correct.

         6            Q.    And you agreed to do it?

         7            A.    Yes.

         8            Q.    And then they didn't call you back?

         9            A.    No.  They called me back once after that

        10     to try to set up an appointment, and they never called

        11     me back after that.

        12            Q.    They didn't hire you to do it, right?

        13            A.    That's correct.

        14            Q.    Now, were you trying to suggest, sir,

        15     with that testimony that you -- the "Enquirer" didn't

        16     ask you to render an opinion about this photograph

        17     because you would have said that it was not authentic?

        18            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

        19            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        20            A.    What I told the gentleman who contacted

        21     me was that I would tell them whatever it was that I

        22     found no matter which way it went.

        23                  I never heard from them again.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Okay.

        25                  You hadn't seen the photo at that point?

        26            A.    No.

        27            Q.    Are you telling -- trying to suggest,

        28     sir, that the reason -- I'm sorry -- that one reason
 


                                                                    60
         1     that you think this photo may not be genuine is

         2     because it was first published in the "Enquirer"?

         3            A.    I never said that.

         4            Q.    You're not trying to suggest that, are

         5     you?

         6            A.    No.

         7            Q.    Because you yourself have sold photos to

         8     tabloids, correct?

         9            A.    That's a misrepresentation.

        10            Q.    Okay.

        11                  In December 1991, sir, didn't you sell

        12     autopsy photographs of John F. Kennedy to the "Globe"

        13     tabloid?

        14            A.    I did not.

        15            Q.    Okay.

        16                  Did you enter into a contract with the

        17     "Globe" to sell autopsy photos of John F. Kennedy for

        18     $50,000, sir?

        19            A.    I did not.

        20            Q.    Do you recognize what I'm putting in

        21     front of you now?

        22            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I object, not

        23     relevant.

        24            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        25

        26                         (Witness is handed magazine.)

        27

        28            A.    Yes, I recognize it.
 


                                                                    61
         1            Q.    What is it?

         2            A.    It a copy of the "Globe" dated

         3     December 31, 1991.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And the cover story is

         5     about autopsy photos of John F. Kennedy, correct?

         6            A.    That is correct.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  I'd like to mark next in order, a

         8     contract between you and the "Globe" for the sale of

         9     those photographs.

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Is that what that is,

        11     sir?

        12

        13                         (Witness reviews document.)

        14

        15            A.    Would you repeat the question.

        16            Q.    Yes, sir.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  What's the number on that?

        18            THE CLERK:  2286.

        19

        20                         (The instrument herein described

        21                         as a copy of appendix to hearings

        22                         was marked for identification as

        23                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2286.)

        24

        25            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Exhibit 2286, that's a

        26     contract between you and the "Globe" bearing your

        27     signature on page 2, for $50,000 to sell autopsy

        28     photographs of John F. Kennedy to the "Globe," isn't
 


                                                                    62
         1     it, sir?

         2            A.    No, it is not.

         3            Q.    Okay.

         4                  Is your name on it?

         5            A.    Yes, it is.

         6            Q.    Okay.

         7                  And you're agreeing to sell some

         8     photographs for $50,000?

         9            A.    No, I'm not.

        10            Q.    What are you agreeing to do, sir?

        11            A.    To give them exclusive rights to a story

        12     about autopsy photographs being faked and to consult

        13     with them for the writing of such a story.

        14            Q.    Okay.

        15                  And you gave them the photographs to use

        16     in the story?

        17            A.    I allowed them to use the photographs in

        18     the story.

        19            Q.    You were paid $50,000 for that, right?

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            Q.    So you didn't sell them the photos, you

        22     just sold them the right to publish the photos?

        23            A.    I sold them the rights to the story and

        24     allowed them to use the photographs in the story to

        25     prove a point.

        26            Q.    Those are some of the photos you obtained

        27     from the House Select Committee when you were there?

        28            A.    That's correct.
 


                                                                    63
         1            Q.    Those are autopsy photos of John F.

         2     Kennedy, right?

         3            A.    That's correct.

         4            Q.    So you certainly don't have any problem

         5     with Harry Scull selling the photograph of Mr. Simpson

         6     to the "Enquirer," do you?

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Objection argumentative.

         8            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         9            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, you read

        10     Mr. Scull's deposition, didn't you?

        11            A.    Yes, I did.

        12            Q.    And you saw he testified that he had the

        13     original negative of the photograph of Mr. Simpson

        14     wearing the Bruno Magli shoes at the Buffalo Bills

        15     game, right?

        16            A.    That's what he testified to, yes.

        17            Q.    Are you're saying he's lying, right.

        18            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, vague, argumentative.

        19            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        20            Q.    You're saying he's lying when he says he

        21     has the original negative because you think it's a

        22     copy negative, right?

        23            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

        24            THE COURT:  Why don't you ask a question

        25     instead of a -- why don't you ask a question as a

        26     question instead of an accusation.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  I'm entitled to ask leading

        28     questions.
 


                                                                    64
         1            THE COURT:  Now, you may ask a question so it

         2     sounds like a question.

         3            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Groden, isn't it

         4     true that you're contending that Mr. Scull was lying

         5     at his deposition when he said he had the original

         6     negative?

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Same objection.

         8            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         9            MR. LEONARD:  Vague.  Had the negative when?

        10            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        11            A.    I don't know whether he has the original

        12     negative or not.  What I testified to in my deposition

        13     is what was shown to me, and purports to be the

        14     original negative, is not.

        15            Q.    Well, and that's what was shown to you by

        16     Mr. Scull's attorney, right, Michael O'Connor?

        17            A.    In Buffalo?

        18            Q.    Yes.

        19            A.    Yes.

        20            Q.    As the purported original negative,

        21     right?

        22            A.    Yes.

        23            Q.    So if it's another negative and Mr. Scull

        24     says he still has the original negative, then your

        25     position is he's lying about that, right?

        26            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative, asked

        27     and answered.

        28            THE COURT:  That's argumentative.  Sustained.
 


                                                                    65
         1            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You also read the

         2     deposition of Gerry Richards (phonetic), didn't you?

         3            A.    Yes.

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I object, at this

         5     point.  Ask to approach.

         6            THE COURT:  Are we going to spend our time up

         7     here?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  No, Your Honor, but --

         9            THE COURT:  Okay, approach.

        10            MR. LEONARD:  Thank you.  Very briefly.

        11

        12                         (The following proceedings were

        13                         held at the bench with the

        14                         reporter.)

        15

        16            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, Gerald Richards is

        17     the ex -- photographic expert that the plaintiffs

        18     retained and did not call in their case.

        19            MR. GELBLUM:  So what?

        20            MR. LEONARD:  I'm objecting to any publishing

        21     of his opinion through this expert.  This expert did

        22     not rely on his opinion in any way.  I think that's

        23     improper hearsay.

        24            MR. BAKER:  This is their second attempt to get

        25     this in.

        26            MR. LEONARD:  They tried to do this through

        27     Bodziak.

        28            THE COURT:  Was his deposition taken?
 


                                                                    66
         1            MR. LEONARD:  Yes.

         2            THE COURT:  Did their witness take this -- read

         3     this deposition?

         4            MR. LEONARD:  Yes.  But he's not relying on his

         5     opinion.  I think it's improper.

         6            THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain the objection.

         7                  Lay foundation that he relied on it.  If

         8     not, then you can't use it.

         9            MR. GELBLUM:  He reviewed it.

        10            THE COURT:  I don't care whether he reviewed it

        11     or not.  If he didn't rely on it, you can't use it.

        12                  You got it?

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  He also opined about

        14     Mr. Richards' credentials.  Can I ask him about his

        15     credentials?

        16            THE COURT:  If you don't lay foundation that he

        17     relied on it, you can't use it.  Period.  Okay.

        18                  Let's get going.  Get to the subject

        19     matter.

        20

        21                         (The following proceedings were

        22                         held in open court in the presence

        23                         of the jury.)

        24

        25            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You read Mr. Richard's

        26     deposition?

        27            A.    Yes.

        28            Q.    Do you rely on that in any way in forming
 


                                                                    67
         1     your opinion in this case?

         2            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, vague what portions.

         3            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         4            A.    I'm not sure that I did.  I noted what he

         5     said.

         6            Q.    Did you rely on any portion of it in

         7     forming your opinions in this case?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, vague.

         9            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        10            A.    I don't specifically remember whether I

        11     did or I didn't.

        12            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Well, you recall that

        13     he said that?

        14            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, calls for hearsay.

        15            THE COURT:  The witness says he may have, he

        16     may not have.

        17                  You may inquire.

        18            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Do you recall

        19     Mr. Richards opined that he made no -- found no

        20     indication of forgery whatsoever in this photograph?

        21            A.    I read his -- that he found no

        22     indication.

        23            Q.    Do you recall that he opined that he did

        24     not find any indication of forgery of this photograph?

        25            A.    I do not specifically recall that he said

        26     that.

        27            Q.    Okay.

        28                  He didn't say it was a fake, did he?
 


                                                                    68
         1            A.    I don't believe he did, no.

         2            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I move to strike.  No

         3     evidence he relied on that.

         4            MR. PETROCELLI:  Said he may have.

         5            THE COURT:  He said he may have, may not have.

         6     It's vague.

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Now he's refreshed his

         8     recollection to a specific portion.  I ask that it be

         9     stricken.

        10            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        11            MR. LEONARD:  Without a foundation being laid.

        12            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        13            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Groden, you recall

        14     from reading the deposition of Mr. Richards an expert

        15     witness being retained by the plaintiffs in the case?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    You found, as you said, his deposition,

        18     that he had incredible credentials?

        19            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.

        20            THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.

        21            MR. LEONARD:  Move to strike.

        22            THE COURT:  Stricken.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor --

        24            THE COURT:  You already tested me.

        25            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Are you also -- in

        26     preparation for this -- in connection with this

        27     photograph, you read the article in the "Enquirer"

        28     where this photograph is printed, didn't you?
 


                                                                    69
         1            A.    No, I have not.

         2            Q.    Did you look at it?

         3            A.    I glanced at it for a moment in a

         4     supermarket, while standing in the checkout line.

         5            Q.    And you recall that in the article --

         6            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, calls for -- this is

         7     going to call for hearsay.

         8            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         9            MR. LEONARD:  I'm trying to -- okay.

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Did you rely on

        11     anything in the article in forming your opinion that

        12     you've given in this case?

        13            A.    No.

        14            Q.    You also recall Mr. Scull's deposition

        15     that he said he -- he testified at his deposition that

        16     about a week after he took the picture, he sent a

        17     print of this very photograph that we're talking about

        18     to Pro Football Weekly?

        19            A.    I don't remember the specific timing.  I

        20     remember that he said he sent a copy of it.  But I

        21     don't recall that --

        22            Q.    Do you recall he said he sent it shortly

        23     after he took it?

        24            A.    He said that he took it --

        25            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, irrelevant.

        26            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        27            A.    I remember that he said he sent it, but I

        28     don't -- I don't recall exactly when he said he did
 


                                                                    70
         1     it.

         2            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Just want to show you

         3     Mr. Scull's deposition --

         4            MR. LEONARD:  I have an objection to that.

         5            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         6            THE COURT:  Witness has indicated he relied on

         7     portions of Scull's deposition.

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I withdraw the

         9     objection.

        10            THE COURT:  As there is no opinion?

        11            MR. LEONARD:  I assumed he was going to publish

        12     it.  I withdraw the objection.

        13            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  On page 84 of

        14     Mr. Scull's deposition, the question from Mr. Baker:

        15     Why is it that you sent an image of Mr. Simpson to Pro

        16     Football Weekly?

        17            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, he's publishing to

        18     the jury.

        19            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Would you read that to yourself.

        21            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I move to strike what

        22     he just said.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  The witness said he didn't

        24     recall.

        25            THE COURT:  Well, let him read it.

        26            MR. PETROCELLI:  Your Honor, for the record,

        27     this entire deposition was played to the jury in our

        28     case in chief, this entire deposition, on videotape.
 


                                                                    71
         1            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Does that refresh your

         2     recollection, sir, that Mr. Scull testified that he

         3     sent the picture to Pro Football Weekly about a week

         4     after he took the picture?

         5            A.    That appears to be what he said.

         6            Q.    That was about nine months before the

         7     murders here?

         8            A.    I have no idea.

         9            Q.    Well, if the murders were in June of '94,

        10     the picture was taken September 1993, about nine

        11     months, right.

        12            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.

        13            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        14            A.    Would be about nine months, yes.

        15            Q.    Obviously long before any issue arose in

        16     this case -- or in the criminal case, rather, about

        17     the shoes that were worn by the killer, right?

        18            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

        19            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Now, Steve, could you put the

        21     contact sheet up.  1832.

        22

        23                        (Exhibit 1832 displayed.)

        24

        25            THE CLERK:  1832.

        26            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, there's two

        27     photographs of Mr. Simpson on this roll, right?  And

        28     then one on the other roll; is that right?
 


                                                                    72
         1            A.    Technically no, technically it appears

         2     that there are three in this one.

         3            Q.    There are three photographs of

         4     Mr. Simpson?

         5            A.    Technically, the back of somebody, second

         6     from the top, second from the left, that may be the

         7     back of Mr. Simpson, I don't know.

         8            Q.    There's two that you can recognize

         9     Mr. Simpson, right?

        10            A.    That's correct.

        11            Q.    And one on the other roll?

        12            A.    That's correct.

        13            Q.    I want to be clear before we get deeply

        14     into that photograph.

        15                  Your opinion is that just the one

        16     photograph of Mr. Simpson walking, where you can see

        17     his shoes, that's the only one that you say is fake?

        18            THE COURT:  Just a minute.

        19                  Did you guys screw this thing up.

        20

        21                         (Referring to focusing Elmo

        22                          screen.)

        23

        24            MR. P. BAKER:  I didn't touch it.

        25            MR. FOSTER:  The --

        26            MR. PETROCELLI:  The witness was working with

        27     it and can't get it back to its original shape, Your

        28     Honor.
 


                                                                    73
         1            MR. LEONARD:  He can correct it in a second.

         2                  You want to have him come down?

         3            THE COURT:  It was working perfectly before

         4     yesterday.

         5            MR. LEONARD:  Because there was a manual

         6     override.  I can actually adjust the focus.

         7            MR. PETROCELLI:  Can you fix it the way it was?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Can you come down and fix it?

         9            THE WITNESS:  Sure.

        10            MR. LEONARD:  With the Court's permission.

        11

        12                         (Witness adjusts Elmo.)

        13

        14            THE COURT:  That used to be a thousand percent

        15     better than that.

        16            THE WITNESS:  If they had this top light it

        17     would possibly be better.  They have this bottom

        18     light.

        19

        20                        (Witness adjusts Elmo.)

        21

        22            THE WITNESS:  There you go.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  You have the slides, Mr. Groden,

        24     from yesterday -- from Wednesday?

        25            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        26            MR. GELBLUM:  May I?

        27

                                                                    74
         1                         brief case and hands them to

         2                         Mr. Gelblum.)

         3            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  The question is, so

         5     everybody's clear about what you're saying, you're

         6     opining only that the one photo of Mr. Simpson

         7     walking, where you can see his shoes, that's the

         8     one -- only one that's fake, right?

         9            A.    That's the only one that I've determined

        10     is fake.

        11            Q.    Right.

        12                  Well, part of your determination is that

        13     there's things there you don't see on any other of the

        14     photographs, right?

        15            A.    That's part of it, yes.

        16            Q.    Now, one of the things you mentioned was

        17     something about a blue line on the bottom of the

        18     photograph, right?

        19            A.    That's correct -- well, no, that's not

        20     correct.  It's outside the bottom of the photograph.

        21            Q.    Right between the image and the sprocket

        22     holes, right?

        23            A.    Well, would you clarify that?

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  Well, let's put the slide up.

        25     Steve, would you put this up.

        26            THE COURT REPORTER:  Does that have a number?

        27            MR. P. BAKER:  It's number 4 of 2282, I

        28     believe.
 


                                                                    75
         1            THE CLERK:  Yeah.

         3                  (Number 4 of Exhibit No. 2282 displayed.)

         4

         5            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You're saying the fact

         6     there's a blue line in the blackness there or the --

         7     or a cyan line is, and it's only on this photograph on

         8     all the images on the contact sheet is evidence that

         9     it's fake, right?

        10            A.    Well, may I -- maybe it's not my position

        11     to do so.  I'd like to clarify.  You asked me about

        12     the bottom of the photograph.  This is the side.

        13            Q.    As you told us yesterday, it was the

        14     bottom of the strip of negatives?

        15            A.    Oh, that's true, yes.

        16            Q.    You know the film goes in horizontally?

        17            A.    Yes, of course I know.

        18            Q.    Can you point where the blue line is?

        19

        20                        (Witness indicates to Elmo TV

        21                        screen.)

        22

        23            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You've got an

        24     enlargement here.  It might be a little easier to see.

        25     This is an enlargement of that photograph.

        26            MR. LEONARD:  Can I see it before it's

        27     published to the jury?

        28
 


                                                                    76

         2                         to Mr. Leonard.)

         3

         4            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  It's this blue line

         5     here that you're talking about?

         6            A.    Yes, it's the series of short blue lines

         7     by the sprocket holes.

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  May I exhibit this to the jury,

         9     Your Honor?

        10            THE COURT:  You may.

        11                         (Blow-up of number 4 of 2282

        12                         displayed by counsel.)

        13

        14            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And you're saying this

        15     indicates -- this is one indication that this

        16     photograph is a fake, because that's not on any of the

        17     other pictures, right?

        18            A.    What I'm saying is that we're seeing an

        19     anomaly there that I cannot detect on any of the other

        20     negatives in the contact sheet.

        21            THE COURT:  Is that particular board you held

        22     up, was that marked as something or other?

        23            MR. FOSTER:  Enlarged of 2071.

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  Enlarged version of 2071.  Do you

        25     want to call it a new number or 2071X?

        26            THE COURT:  You want to use it?

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  Next in order.

        28            THE CLERK:  2287.

        26     enlarged version of 2076 (sic).  It's another

        27     photograph of Mr. Simpson taken by Mr. Scull that day.

        28                  You see the same blue lines, Mr. Groden?

         4            A.    I see blue lines, but it did not appear

         5     to be the same.

         6            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  They're in the same

         7     position, aren't they, sir?

         8            A.    I would think not.

         9                  Can I compare the two?

        10            Q.    Absolutely.

        11            MR. GELBLUM:  This would be next in order.

        21                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2288.)

        22            A.    They do not appear to be the same.

        23            Q.    They're in the same location, aren't

        24     they, sir?

        25            A.    No, they're not.  They're close but

        26     they're not in the same location.

        27            Q.    They're between the sprocket holes and

        28     the image, right?
 


                                                                    79
         1            A.    That's correct.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Show these to the jury?

         3            THE COURT:  You may.

         4

         5                         (Counsel displays Exhibit 2288 to

         6                         jury.)

         7

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, just for the

         9     record --

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  A juror has asked that we hold

        11     them up together, if that's okay with you.

        12            THE COURT:  You'll be able to examine the

        13     photographs when you go into the jury room, ladies and

        14     gentlemen.  Right now you're just looking at the

        15     exhibits.

        16            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Also want to show you

        17     an enlargement of 2072.

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  Next in order.

        19            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Another blow-up of

        20     Mr. Simpson.  This one is horizontal so relatively to

        21     the others we're looking at this side, right, the

        22     bottom of a negative, sir, this would be the bottom of

        23     the negative --

        24            A.    That's correct.

        25            Q.    -- over here?

        26                  See a blue line on that one, too, sir?

        27

        28                        (Witness reviews blow-up.)
 


                                                                    80
         1

         2            A.    Yes, I do.

         3            Q.    Also between the sprocket holes and the

         4     image?

         5            A.    Yes, but not the same as either of the

         6     other two.

         7            THE CLERK:  That's Exhibit 2289.

         8

         9                         (The instrument herein described

        10                         as a blow-up of Exhibit 2072 was

        11                         marked for identification as

        12                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2289.)

        13

        14            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Same color, same

        15     position?

        16            A.    No, different position.

        17            MR. LEONARD:  Object.

        18            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Different position?

        19            A.    Yes.

        20            Q.    Between the sprocket holes and image?

        21            A.    That's correct.

        22            Q.    Okay.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  May I show this to the jury as

        24     well?

        25            THE COURT:  You may.

        26

        27                         (Counsel displays Exhibit 2289 to

        28                         jury.)
 


                                                                    81
         1

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Steve, could you put up the --

         3     the enlargement of the two negatives.

         4            MR. FOSTER:  1929.

         5

         6                        (Exhibit 1929 displayed.)

         7

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  Can you enlarge -- zoom in on the

         9     top one.

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  See the same blue line

        11     here, Mr. Groden?

        12            A.    I see a blue line.  I can't determine

        13     that it's the same.

        14            Q.    It's between the image and a sprocket,

        15     and it's the same color, right?

        16            A.    I can't tell.  This appears white.

        17            Q.    Are you color-blind?

        18            A.    No.

        19            Q.    That appears white to you?

        20            A.    Um-hum.

        21            Q.    Like Mr. Simpson's shirt appeared pink to

        22     you?

        23            A.    Mr. Simpson's shirt is pink.

        24            Q.    It is?

        25            A.    In this photograph it is.

        26            Q.    You sure you're not color-blind?

        27            A.    I'm positive.

        28            Q.    Okay.
 


                                                                    82
         1                  How did you miss all these lines,

         2     Mr. Groden?

         3            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

         4            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  I didn't hear the

         5     question.

         6            MR. GELBLUM:  I'll withdraw it.

         7            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  How did you simply not

         8     see these lines when you were doing your examination?

         9                  Are you trying to deliberately mislead

        10     the jury?

        11            MR. LEONARD:  Argumentative, Your Honor.

        12            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        13            A.    They don't appear on what I was furnished

        14     with.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Oh?

        16            A.    They're not there.

        17            Q.    Okay.

        18                  You looked at the original negatives,

        19     right?

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            Q.    Okay.

        22                  Why didn't you show the jury these other

        23     frames, Mr. Groden?

        24            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, argumentative.

        25            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        26            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, Mr. Groden, these

        27     lines are caused by scratches and caused by the

        28     camera, right, Mr. Groden?
 


                                                                    83
         1            A.    I have no way of knowing that.

         2            Q.    Right.

         3            MR. GELBLUM:  Can you put up, please, the

         4     photograph of the back of the camera.

         5            Q.    So that for all unique these lines are

         6     caused by the scratch caused by the camera than on the

         7     film?

         8            A.    It can be a negative transport.

         9            Q.    It can be a scratch?

        10            A.    It could be.

        11            Q.    Okay.

        12                  You can recognize this, Mr. Groden?

        13            A.    Do I recognize it?

        14            Q.    Yeah.  You know what kind of camera it

        15     is?

        16            A.    There's no indication as to what kind it

        17     is.

        18            Q.    You're an expert.  You don't recognize

        19     it?

        20            A.    It's a 35 millimeter SLR camera, appears

        21     to be an SLR camera.

        22            Q.    That's all you can say about it?

        23            A.    From what I'm seeing here.

        24            Q.    Okay.

        25                  Take as close a look as you want.

        26            A.    It's a 35 millimeter SLR camera with the

        27     back open and has a motor drive attached at the

        28     bottom.
 


                                                                    84
         1            Q.    You recognize this as a Canon F1, the

         2     same kind of camera used by Mr. Scull to take these

         3     pictures?

         4            A.    It may very well be.

         5            Q.    But you don't know?

         6            A.    No.

         7            Q.    And the way that the film works -- you

         8     know what these are called, Mr. Groden?

         9            A.    Film guides.

        10            Q.    You ever heard them called rails?

        11            A.    Could be called rails.

        12            Q.    Okay.

        13                  When the film comes across here, it's

        14     loaded on the -- what's on the left side of the

        15     screen, and it's pulled across into -- it's called the

        16     take up reel --

        17            A.    Yes.

        18            Q.    -- on the right side of the screen, and

        19     it rides on these rails in between -- I'm sorry, it

        20     rides on the two center rails in between the outer

        21     rails which are guides, correct?

        22            A.    That's correct.

        23            Q.    Okay.

        24                  And on a Canon F1, sir, you have these

        25     rollers here, right?

        26            A.    It's a sprocket drive.

        27            Q.    Okay.

        28                  You don't have those on all cameras, do
 


                                                                    85
         1     you?

         2            A.    You have it on most.

         3            Q.    Okay.

         4                  And when the film comes over this edge of

         5     the inside rails, there can be spurs or deformities on

         6     the edge of the metal that cause scratches, right?

         7            A.    Absolutely.

         8            Q.    That's what caused the scratches here,

         9     nothing about fakery, right?

        10            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.

        11            A.    That's an absurd thing to say.  I have no

        12     idea that they came from the camera.  They could

        13     have -- they could have come from when they were

        14     printed.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Exactly.  You have no

        16     idea.

        17            A.    There's no way to determine that if you

        18     don't have the original camera.

        19            Q.    Well, you're willing to sit here and tell

        20     the jury what it is.

        21                  On Wednesday you sat here and told the

        22     jury there was -- that was evidence of fakery or

        23     something being overlaid on top of the negative,

        24     didn't you?

        25            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, objection,

        26     argumentative.

        27            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        28            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You have no way of
 


                                                                    86
         1     knowing what it is.  But I'll tell the jury -- you

         2     told the jury what it was, you told the jury it was

         3     evidence of something being laid over the negative,

         4     didn't you?

         5            A.    I said it could be.

         6            Q.    But you have no idea.

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, argumentative, asked

         8     and answered.

         9            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        10            A.    You asked me now if I could determine

        11     that these scratches came specifically from the camera

        12     and I said, no, I could not.

        13            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  By the way, can you

        14     tell the jury what the structure of color film is?

        15            A.    The structure of color film?

        16            Q.    The structure of color film?

        17            A.    Color film basically is an acetate base

        18     with an emulsion made up of grain with three separate

        19     layers; yellow, cyan, and magenta.

        20            Q.    You forgot the yellow block in between

        21     the first and third layers, didn't you?

        22            A.    There are other aspects to it as well.

        23     There are binders, things of that nature, certainly.

        24            Q.    Okay.

        25                  Now, another point that you talked to the

        26     jury about on Wednesday with Mr. Leonard, was that the

        27     photographs weren't properly -- that this frame was

        28     not properly aligned with the others, right?
 


                                                                    87
         1            A.    That's correct.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Can you put up the slide?

         3            THE COURT REPORTER:  Excuse me.  Did he have a

         4     number for this?

         5            THE CLERK:  2290.

         6            THE COURT:  Back of a camera.

         7

         8                         (The instrument herein described

         9                         as a photograph back of a camera

        10                         was marked for identification as

        11                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2290.)

        12

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  Put up the frame which was 2 of

        14     2282.

        15

        16                         (Frame No. 2 of Exhibit 2282

        17                         displayed.)

        18

        19            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Remember that testimony

        20     on Wednesday, you said that wasn't aligned?

        21            A.    That's correct.

        22            Q.    And you also said that's the only frame

        23     in the whole roll that's not aligned, right?

        24            A.    Correct.

        25            Q.    And that's false?

        26            A.    What do you mean it's false?

        27            Q.    I mean it's false, isn't it?

        28            A.    What are you talking about?
 


                                                                    88
         1            Q.    There are other frames that are

         2     misaligned, aren't there?

         3            A.    No, there are not.

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  Steve.

         5            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  I show you frames -- I

         6     show you and the jury the alignment of No.'s 12 and

         7     13, same contact sheet, the picture of Mr. Simpson.

         8

         9                         (No. 12 and No. 13 displayed.)

        10

        11            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, I object.  That's a

        12     different contact sheet.

        13            A.    It is a different contact sheet.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  You want to use their contact

        15     sheet.

        16            MR. P. BAKER:  We need --

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  If you give it to us we'll use

        18     it.

        19            MR. P. BAKER:  Mr. Groden.

        20

        21                         (Mr. Groden removes contact sheet

        22                         from brief case.)

        23

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  If these are the Court exhibits,

        25     if they are, I'd like to have them all.

        26            THE COURT:  Why does he have the exhibits?

        27            MR. P. BAKER:  We -- I just --

        28            MR. PETROCELLI:  Are those the original copies?
 


                                                                    89
         1            MR. P. BAKER:  We laser copied --

         2            THE COURT:  Where are the ones we used?

         3            MR. P. BAKER:  We used prints in Court.

         4            THE CLERK:  I need a number.  I don't know --

         5            MR. P. BAKER:  I believe --

         6            MR. PETROCELLI:  Where are the slides he used

         7     on Wednesday?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  The slides --

         9            MR. PETROCELLI:  What does he have in his brief

        10     case?

        11            MR. GELBLUM:  Is this the rest of the exhibits?

        12            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  May I?

        14            THE COURT:  What exhibit are we using?

        15            MR. P. BAKER:  We're using 1924.

        16

        17                         (The clerk reviewed exhibit book.)

        18

        19            THE CLERK:  That's a new exhibit.

        20

        21                         (The instrument herein referred to

        22                         as contact sheet was marked for

        23                         identification as Plaintiffs'

        24                         Exhibit No.1924.)

        25

        26            MR. LEONARD:  Is Mr. Foster using a post-it to

        27     do this?

        28                  I object.
 


                                                                    90
         1            THE COURT:  What are you objecting to?

         2            MR. LEONARD:  His using a post-it as a straight

         3     edge.

         4            THE COURT:  So he's using a post-it.

         5                  What's the problem?  Is it a wrong

         6     exhibit?  If it's a wrong exhibit, tell me it's a

         7     wrong exhibit.

         8            MR. LEONARD:  No.  I'm objecting to this

         9     demonstration with a post-it.

        10            MR. PETROCELLI:  Served me well, Your Honor.

        11            MR. LEONARD:  What?

        12            MR. PETROCELLI:  These post-its.

        13

        14                         (Pause for counsel to review

        15                         exhibits.)

        16

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Can you put up on the Elmo,

        18     please, the contact sheet showing frames 12 and 13.

        19

        20                         (Contact sheet displayed.)

        21

        22            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, you didn't use a

        23     square when you showed us, you just lined something up

        24     on the side?

        25            THE COURT REPORTER:  Excuse me.  Is there a

        26     number for this?

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  What number is this?

        28            MR. P. BAKER:  1929.
 


                                                                    91
         1            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, you see,

         2     Mr. Groden, how this is lined up along the top of this

         3     frame?

         4            A.    That's crooked.  It's diagonal.  There's

         5     nothing here in this space over here.  This is not

         6     accurate.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  Exactly.  Move it up.  I'm sorry.

         8                  I see what you're saying.

         9            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

        10            MR. LEONARD:  I'm going to object.  This is not

        11     a valid --

        12            MR. GELBLUM:  We didn't have the right contact

        13     sheet because Mr. Groden had it in his brief case.

        14            MR. LEONARD:  That was the original contact

        15     sheet.

        16            THE COURT:  Will you stop that, Mr. Leonard?

        17            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, but I object --

        18            THE COURT:  Mr. Leonard, will you stop that?

        19            MR. LEONARD:  Yes.

        20            THE CLERK:  For the record, that's not exhibit

        21     1929.  I don't know what number that is.

        22            MR. GELBLUM:  We'll come back to it and deal

        23     with it.

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  We'll come back to that when we

        25     handle the contact sheet properly.

        26            MR. FOSTER:  1932 --

        27

        28                        (Indicating to the clerk.)
 


                                                                    92
         1

         2            THE COURT:  Let's take a 10-minute recess.

         3                  Why don't you get your act together.

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, Mr. Groden took the

         5     Court exhibits with him.

         6            MR. FOSTER:  1832.

         7            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, that was not the

         8     exhibit.  Your Honor --

         9            THE BAILIFF:  We're in recess.

        10

        11                         (Recess.)

        12

        13

        14                         (A bench conference was held which

        15                         was not reported.)

        16

        17                         (Jurors resume their respective

        18                         seats.)

        19

        20                         (The following proceedings were

        21                         held in open court in the presence

        22                         of the jury.)

        23

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  We were talking about

        25     the alignment of the pictures, remember that,

        26     Mr. Groden?

        27            A.    Yes.

        28            MR. GELBLUM:  Steve, could you put up Exhibit
 


                                                                    93
         1     1832, please.

         2

         3                         (Exhibit 1832 displayed.)

         4

         5            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Now, when you measured

         6     on your slide, you didn't square it off at the top,

         7     you just put a straight edge along the side, correct?

         8            A.    That's correct.

         9            Q.    Wouldn't you agree squaring it off is a

        10     more accurate way of measuring it?

        11            A.    No, not necessarily.

        12            Q.    It's crooked if you don't square it off?

        13            A.    It depends what you're comparing it to.

        14            Q.    Yeah, okay.

        15                  Do you agree -- focus up here, please,

        16     the top.  This is 12 and 13.  That's square across the

        17     top.

        18

        19                         (Indicating to individual slide on

        20                         the exhibit.)

        21

        22            A.    No, it's not.

        23            Q.    All right.

        24            MR. GELBLUM:  I guess --

        25            A.    There's a greater space on this side than

        26     there is here.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  Move it up, Steve.

        28
 


                                                                    94
         1                         (Elmo adjusted.)

         2

         3            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Is it straight along

         4     the side?

         5            A.    I can't tell.

         6            Q.    All right.

         7            A.    It's because it's part of the picture.

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  Move it up, Steve.

         9            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  This is the next frame

        10     down, right?

        11            A.    Yes.

        12            Q.    Okay.

        13                  You see a gap in the space here, a gap,

        14     much more showing on that than the one above it?

        15            A.    Yes.

        16            Q.    Okay.  Okay.

        17                  Just like the picture of Mr. Simpson

        18     where you showed the gap between the straight edge and

        19     the side, right?

        20            A.    No.

        21            Q.    You viewed from the outside, this is the

        22     inside?

        23            A.    No.  This appears thinner on top and

        24     wider on the bottom, it's diagonal, it's not a

        25     straight edge.

        26            Q.    The post-it is not straight?

        27            A.    That's what I'm saying.  That's what I

        28     said before.
 


                                                                    95
         1            Q.    We'll let the jury decide.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Can you show me 33 and 34,

         3     please.

         4

         5                         (Slide No. 33 displayed.)

         6

         7            A.    This is 33.

         8

         9                         (Indicating to slide 33.)

        10

        11            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Is it straight along

        12     the bottom, covers up the side?  Agree with me on

        13     that?

        14            A.    Again, I can't tell because you have part

        15     of the picture covered up.

        16            Q.    They're all covered up.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Go ahead up to 34.

        18

        19                         (Slide 34 displayed.)

        20

        21            Q.    Do you see that there's a space showing

        22     that is not showing in 33?

        23            A.    Again, it's diagonal, it's not flush to

        24     the edge.

        25            Q.    It's because it's misaligned, right?

        26            A.    No.  No.

        27            Q.    Do --

        28            A.    No, wait, you asked me a question.
 


                                                                    96
         1            Q.    Do you know how film --

         2            MR. LEONARD:  I object and ask that he be

         3     allowed to answer the question.

         4            THE COURT:  Ask another question.

         5            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Do you have any idea

         6     how film moves through a camera?

         7            A.    Of course.

         8            Q.    This is a camera?

         9            A.    It's a camera.  Of course.

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  Let the record reflect I'm

        11     holding up a 35 millimeter single lens reflex camera?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    Pentax?

        14            A.    Yes.

        15            Q.    Now, load the film in the camera like

        16     this, right, pull it over, across the -- what do you

        17     call that?

        18            THE COURT:  I'm sure the jury has a nice view

        19     of your back.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  I'm trying to coordinate and the

        21     witness --

        22            THE COURT:  Why don't you stand over here.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  All right.

        24                  Good idea.  Thank you.

        25            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Pull the lens across --

        26     what do you call this opening?

        27            A.    It's frame aperture.

        28            Q.    And then you stick it in the take-up
 


                                                                    97
         1     reel, right?

         2            A.    Um-hum.

         3            Q.    Okay.

         4                  And to get it flat you have to advance

         5     the film; is that right?

         6            A.    You have to put the film in the right

         7     place.

         8            Q.    Right.  Okay.

         9                  Now, as we looked at it before, it rides

        10     on top of two rails and inside the metal guides; is

        11     that right?

        12            A.    That's correct.

        13            Q.    And there's a little bit of play up and

        14     down, isn't there?

        15            A.    May I examine it?

        16            MR. BAKER:  With the camera open or closed?

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  With the camera open.  You can't

        18     see it if it's closed.

        19            MR. LEONARD:  The question is is there play?

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Little bit of play up and down

        21     with the film, right?

        22            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  That's how cameras

        23     work, right?

        24            A.    On this particular camera there appears

        25     to be an extreme --

        26            Q.    On all cameras there's some play so that

        27     the film can move through, right?

        28            A.    I can't say on all cameras.
 


                                                                    98
         1            Q.    And even with the camera closed, with the

         2     pressure plate, there's still some play because the

         3     film has to be able to advance, correct?

         4            A.    That's correct.

         5            Q.    Okay.

         6                  May I pass this to the jury so they can

         7     see the play in here, Your Honor.

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  That is not the

         9     camera that was used for this shot.  I think it's an

        10     improper demonstration.  I don't think -- I think it's

        11     not relevant.

        12            THE COURT:  It's not the same camera.

        13     Sustained.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  It's a typical camera.

        15            THE COURT:  Excuse me, are you an expert on

        16     cameras?  You haven't been sworn.

        17            MR. PETROCELLI:  I object to the Court's

        18     comment.

        19            THE COURT:  Well, it's overruled.

        20            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Groden, it is

        21     typical in 35 millimeter single lens reflex cameras

        22     for there to be some play up and down so the film can

        23     move through the camera, correct.

        24            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, vague.

        25            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        26            A.    I would say that it would vary from

        27     camera to camera it that there is no specific

        28     instance, for instance, an Icon camera perhaps would
 


                                                                    99
         1     have less.

         2            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  But some play because

         3     it has to move through, right?

         4            A.    They can't bind it, they can't seize it,

         5     yeah.

         6            Q.    Okay.

         7                  It has to have some play?

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, asked and answered.

         9            MR. GELBLUM:  I think that what the witness

        10     said -- can I pass the camera around?

        11            THE COURT:  No.

        12            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And because the film

        13     moves up and down a little bit because there's some

        14     play, it is absolutely typical on every contact sheet

        15     in the world for adjoining frames to not be perfectly

        16     in line with each other, true or false?

        17            A.    False.

        18            Q.    Now, another of your points, sir, you

        19     said that the questioned frame was too long, right?

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            Q.    And that simply is false, isn't it?

        22            A.    Of course, it's not false.

        23            Q.    Of course, it is false.

        24            MR. LEONARD:  Objection.

        25            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        26            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You --

        27            THE COURT:  Jury to disregard that last

        28     comment.
 


                                                                   100
         1            MR. GELBLUM:  I apologize.

         2            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You said you used a

         3     compass like this to measure it?

         4            A.    Not like that.

         5            Q.    This type of compass?

         6            A.    Yes.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  Steve, would you put the contact

         8     sheet up, please.

         9

        10                        (Mr. Foster complies.)

        11

        12            MR. GELBLUM:  Would you put the compass point

        13     around the edge of frame --

        14                  How do you want to do it, frame 2 versus

        15     frame 1 or frame 1 versus frame 2, Mr. Groden?

        16            THE WITNESS:  Doesn't matter.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Do it on frame 2.

        18            THE COURT REPORTER:  And this exhibit, please?

        19            MR. FOSTER:  1832.

        20

        21                        (Exhibit 1832 displayed.)

        22

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  Compass point right at the edges,

        24     top and bottom.

        25            MR. LEONARD:  Your Honor, can we ask the

        26     witness to be able to do it.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  No, I don't want the witness to

        28     do it.
 


                                                                   101
         1            MR. LEONARD:  Not Mr. Foster.

         2            THE COURT:  It is sustained.

         3                  Let the witness do it.

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, the jury can see --

         5     it's for -- this is not expert -- this is holding a

         6     compass next to a photograph.  The jury can see

         7     whether they're aligned or not.

         8            MR. LEONARD:  Object, and ask the witness be

         9     permitted --

        10            THE COURT:  Witness, you do it.

        11            THE WITNESS:  He's damaging the original.  I'm

        12     sorry.

        13

        14                  (Indicating to Mr. Foster placing compass

        15                   on contact sheet.)

        16

        17            MR. PETROCELLI:  Let him do it.

        18            MR. LEONARD:  We got a couple of holes.

        19            THE COURT:  Do it on the copy.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, we have to do it on

        21     the original.

        22            THE COURT:  I don't want the original damaged.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  This witness testified that he

        24     did this with this frame.  It's a very important

        25     point.  We have to demonstrate it's exactly the same

        26     size.  We have to do it on the original.  We have

        27     other copies of 1832, we have other copies of that

        28     one.
 


                                                                   102
         1

         2                        (Witness approaches Elmo.)

         3

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  Not with an enlarged one that you

         5     made, sir, with the actual size.

         6            THE COURT:  Use the -- use a laser copy from

         7     that original.

         8            MR. GELBLUM:  No, Your Honor, use the compass

         9     that has the fixed compass, not the one that can be

        10     adjusted with your fingers with pressure.

        11            MR. BAKER:  Adjusted what?

        12

        13                        (Compass is placed on copy.)

        14

        15            MR. GELBLUM:  The record should reflect that

        16     the compass points are around the top and bottom of

        17     frame 2.

        18            THE COURT:  Well, it appears that the bottom

        19     part of the compass is within the frame.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  It does indeed.  That's why I

        21     wanted my person to do it.

        22            THE WITNESS:  Mine has an easier to see point

        23     than this.  This is -- has a somewhat strange 2-stage

        24     point.

        25                  Your Honor, if I may, the one that I've

        26     been using uses a straight fixed point.  These are

        27     adjustable and have a 2-stage taper to it, this would

        28     not be as accurate.
 


                                                                   103
         1            THE COURT:  A point is a point.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Another suggestion.

         3            THE COURT:  No, use the fixed compass so that

         4     it cannot be moved.

         5            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor, I might suggest it

         6     might take less time to let the jurors have the

         7     compass and contact sheet and pass it around, they can

         8     see for themselves.

         9            MR. LEONARD:  I would object to that.

        10            THE COURT:  I would sustain the objection.

        11            MR. GELBLUM:  Just a suggestion.

        12                  You're still inside.  Top one's inside.

        13            THE WITNESS:  You said the bottom.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  Now they're both inside, sir.

        15            THE WITNESS:  Now they're both outside.  That's

        16     outside.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Let the record reflect those are

        18     at least pretty close to on the line.

        19            THE WITNESS:  The bottom is still outside.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  I don't think so.

        21

        22                         (Witness continues to place

        23                         compass on slide.)

        24

        25            THE WITNESS:  All right.

        26            THE COURT:  Go ahead.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  Go ahead, put it on frame 1.

        28                  Don't push the edge out there, sir.
 


                                                                   104
         1            THE WITNESS:  On the other one we would make

         2     adjustments.  This one I'm not.

         3            MR. GELBLUM:  No adjustments.

         4            THE WITNESS:  That's what I said.  Can't lay it

         5     flat.

         6            THE COURT:  Okay, counsel, this is ridiculous.

         7            MR. GELBLUM:  Your Honor --

         8            THE COURT:  You put your own expert on and you

         9     can give measurements.  This --

        10            MR. GELBLUM:  There you go, Your Honor, it's

        11     done.

        12            THE WITNESS:  It's on the inside.

        13            MR. GELBLUM:  That's why I wanted the jury to

        14     pass it around, so they can see for themselves.

        15            MR. LEONARD:  Object, he's arguing at this

        16     point.

        17            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  All right.

        19            THE COURT:  Go off of measurements -- off your

        20     own expert to make measurements.

        21            MR. GELBLUM:  We will, Your Honor.

        22

        23                         (Witness resumes seat at witness

        24                         stand.)

        25

        26            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Mr. Groden, you said at

        27     your deposition something you didn't say yesterday

        28     about the measurements, which is you actually measured
 


                                                                   105
         1     the difference?

         2            A.    I measured it by examining it with a

         3     compass.

         4            Q.    At your deposition you said you measured

         5     it and it was a quarter of a millimeter difference at

         6     8 times enlargement, remember that?

         7            A.    Approximately.

         8            Q.    Okay.

         9                  So actual size, that would mean a 32nd of

        10     a millimeter, right, one-eighth times one-fourth,

        11     one-thirty-second?

        12            A.    Where, on the contact sheet?

        13            Q.    Yes, one-eighth of a millimeter?

        14            A.    It's an arbitrary figure.

        15            Q.    Your measure is arbitrary?

        16            A.    As I've said time and again, the

        17     measurement is so small that it would be virtually

        18     impossible to do an accurate measurement.  You can

        19     only compare one to another.

        20            Q.    Exactly.

        21                  Because one-thirty-second of a millimeter

        22     is about 10, 12 thousandths of an inch, and you can't

        23     possibly measure that?

        24            A.    I can't with this.

        25            Q.    With any measuring tools when you

        26     measured it, right?

        27            A.    That's correct.  That's why I blew it up

        28     400 percent and measured one to the other.
 


                                                                   106
         1            Q.    Exactly.

         2                  When you made that enlargement, did you

         3     make any adjustment to your enlarger?

         4            A.    No, I didn't make it, it was a xerox copy

         5     directly, no changes, nothing, no alterations.

         6            Q.    With the enlargement?

         7            A.    Sorry?

         8            Q.    With the enlargement?

         9            A.    Yes.

        10            Q.    That's why you got a quarter millimeter

        11     at 8 X?

        12            A.    No, it was much greater than a quarter of

        13     a millimeter.

        14            Q.    Like to show you what was marked as

        15     Exhibit 4 at your deposition, sir.

        16            MR. GELBLUM:  Mark that next in order.

        17            THE CLERK:  2291.

        18

        19                         (The instrument herein described

        20                         as copy of notes of Mr. Groden was

        21                         marked for identification as

        22                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2291.)

        23

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Point number 9:  The

        25     negative is too long, one-quarter millimeter at 800

        26     percent?

        27            A.    That's an approximation.  This was a

        28     rough note to myself.  That was not a report.
 


                                                                   107
         1            Q.    That's what you provided to me at your

         2     deposition, the record of your observations, right?

         3            A.    You asked me --

         4            Q.    Isn't that right?

         5            A.    You asked me --

         6            Q.    Isn't that right?  Please answer the

         7     question.

         8            A.    Yes.

         9            Q.    Thank you.

        10                  You made a written report?

        11            A.    No.

        12            Q.    Now, another of your points was this,

        13     what you call a second edge or something like that, a

        14     false edge; is that right?

        15            A.    At the bottom of frame 1, below frame 1?

        16            Q.    Right, yes.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Remember which slide number that

        18     was, Phil?  I think you had it.

        19            MR. P. BAKER:  Slide 3, I think this is.

        20            MR. GELBLUM:  Slide 3.

        21            MR. P. BAKER:  Is that the correct slide?

        22            THE WITNESS:  It appears to be.

        23            MR. P. BAKER:  Slide 3 of 2282.

        24

        25                        (Slide 3 of Exhibit 2282

        26                        displayed.)

        27

        28            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And just to refresh the
 


                                                                   108
         1     jury's recollection, you're talking about this space

         2     down here where it gets lighter than the black, right?

         3            A.    That's correct.

         4            Q.    And it has some of those vertical lines

         5     in it that appear to get closer together over here --

         6            A.    That's correct.

         7            Q.    -- is that right?

         8                  And you said there is no natural

         9     phenomenon in photography whatsoever that could

        10     possibly account for that, right?

        11            A.    It didn't appear by itself.

        12            Q.    You said there's no -- I'm going to quote

        13     you, "no natural situation in photography that would

        14     give you that false edge by itself"; is that correct?

        15            A.    That is correct.

        16            Q.    Okay.

        17            MR. GELBLUM:  Can I have the camera, please?

        18

        19                        (Mr. Petrocelli hands camera to

        20                        Mr. Gelblum.)

        21

        22            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  As we saw before with

        23     the camera, you put the film in and you shoot off a

        24     few frames and you advance it, right?

        25            A.    That's correct.

        26            Q.    When you first load the film?

        27            A.    That's correct.

        28            Q.    And you're aware, sir, that when people
 


                                                                   109
         1     use long lenses like the 500 millimeter lens, they

         2     don't have a lens cap on them, you're familiar with

         3     that, that's a practice of professional photographers?

         4            A.    That's correct.

         5            Q.    So you've got the film in, and you're

         6     loading it up and you're clicking away a few clicks,

         7     there's going to be some film (sic) that comes in

         8     through the camera lens, right?

         9            THE COURT:  Some what?

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Light, I call it some

        11     light that comes in through the lens?

        12            A.    I'm not sure that you're representing

        13     that exactly -- what do you mean by "comes in"?

        14            Q.    Light enters through the lens.

        15            A.    Oh, yes.

        16            Q.    And hits the film?

        17            A.    Not if it's a good camera it won't.

        18            Q.    Not if you're clicking like that, it

        19     won't come in, it won't enter through the lens and hit

        20     the film?

        21            A.    As you're advancing it?

        22            Q.    Yes, as you're advancing it.

        23            A.    Um-hum.

        24            Q.    Frame 1 isn't the first numbered frame on

        25     a roll?

        26            A.    There should be a zero.

        27            Q.    And a zero zero and a zero zero zero?

        28            A.    No.
 


                                                                   110
         1            Q.    Haven't seen that?

         2            A.    Not a zero zero zero.

         3            Q.    But there is a zero?

         4            A.    Yes.

         5            Q.    And this picture would be just below

         6     frame 1, right?

         7            A.    Yes, that's correct.

         8            Q.    And that frame as you're clicking through

         9     to advance the film could get exposed a little bit,

        10     right, through the lens, 'cause there's no lens cap

        11     on, 'cause there's a long lens?

        12            A.    It would be exposed a lot.

        13            Q.    Not if the camera is stopped down to a

        14     small aperture, right, then it could be underexposed?

        15            MR. LEONARD:  I object to this.  There's no --

        16     there's a lack of foundation, assumes facts not in

        17     evidence.

        18            THE COURT:  Overruled.  He's asking him a

        19     question.

        20            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  If the camera is

        21     stopped down to a small aperture, could be

        22     underexposed, right?

        23            A.    Yes.

        24            Q.    Okay.

        25                  And so you could get an image on frame 0,

        26     it could be very underexposed, correct?

        27            A.    Theoretically.

        28            Q.    Okay.
 


                                                                   111
         1                  When you take the film -- when the

         2     photographer takes the film out of the camera -- in

         3     this case Mr. Scull developed it himself; you read

         4     that, right?

         5            A.    Yes.

         6            Q.    And he takes it out -- and he takes it

         7     out of the -- the little cartridge and he just cuts it

         8     off, right, because -- he cuts off the first couple

         9     ones because they're over -- 'cause they're exposed

        10     from the back of the camera?

        11            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, that assumes facts not

        12     in evidence.

        13            THE COURT:  Sustained.

        14            MR. LEONARD:  Scull never testified to that.

        15     Never sustained to that.

        16            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You're familiar how you

        17     process film?

        18            A.    Of course.

        19            Q.    And you clip off the end?

        20            A.    You cut the tongue off at one end.

        21            Q.    Right at this end, right (indicating),

        22     the front of it?

        23            A.    Much farther down.

        24            Q.    Right.

        25                  But you don't want to cut too far --

        26     close to the image, the film, and on frame 1, because

        27     you don't want to cut into the image?

        28            A.    Correct.
 


                                                                   112
         1            Q.    Okay.

         2            MR. GELBLUM:  Now, can you put up -- leave that

         3     up and put up frame 12 from the contact sheet

         4            THE COURT REPORTER:  Again, this exhibit,

         5     please?

         6            MR. GELBLUM:  Zoom in on frame 12.

         7            MR. FOSTER:  1924.

         8

         9                        (Exhibit 1924 displayed.)

        10

        11            MR. FOSTER:  They both won't fit.

        12            MR. GELBLUM:  That's all right.  Just leave

        13     this one up, then.

        14                  Can you focus?

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  See a series of

        16     parallel lines that get closer together as they go

        17     back, sir?

        18            A.    You mean on the field?

        19            Q.    Yes.

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            MR. GELBLUM:  You want to put the other one

        22     back up, please.

        23            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  A lot like these

        24     parallel lines getting closer together only turned the

        25     other way, don't they?

        26            A.    No, of course not.

        27            Q.    Well, in fact, say that's what that is,

        28     isn't it?  That's a very underexposed image of the
 


                                                                   113
         1     field caught when Mr. Scull was loading his film in

         2     the camera and clicking off the film to get to frame

         3     1?

         4            A.    No way in the world.

         5            Q.    No way in the world?

         6            A.    No.

         7            Q.    Are you sure of that?

         8            A.    Not that I can see photographically.

         9     First of all, they're too sharp.

        10            Q.    You're just as sure as you were that

        11     there were no blue lines on any of the pictures except

        12     frame 11?

        13            MR. LEONARD:  Argue -- objection,

        14     argumentative.

        16            THE WITNESS:  Can you make that lighter?

        21            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Okay.

        22                  Let's go to -- let's talk about your

        23     retouching mark.

        24            MR. LEONARD:  I object to that.  It's not his

        25     mark.

        26            MR. GELBLUM:  There is no mark.

        27                  Let's go to the mark we talked about.

        28            MR. FOSTER:  1931.
 


                                                                   114

         3

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  On the -- let's start with the

         5     left, left pant, left leg.  This one.  Can you zoom in

         6     on this area.

         7

         8                        (Elmo adjusted.)

         9

        10            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  And you're saying the

        11     mark is where, sir, right along here?

        12            A.    (Witness indicates.)

        13            MR. LEONARD:  Might be helpful to get a

        14     back light.

        15            MR. FOSTER:  It is back lit.

        16            MR. LEONARD:  And adjust it like we had on

        17     direct.

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  They saw it this morning.

        19            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  Just point the area

        20     out?

        21            A.    Right along here.

        22            Q.    Right along the crease in his pants,

        23     right?

        24                  You see a crease in his pants there?

        25            A.    I don't see a crease.  Do you see a

        26     crease?

        27            Q.    You don't see a crease in his pants

        28     there?
 


                                                                   115
         1            A.    I see a bend in the material.  I don't

         2     see a crease.

         3            Q.    A fold in the material?

         4            A.    Okay.  Yeah.

         5            Q.    Okay.

         6                  What are you saying here-- by the way,

         7     are you saying that how this was this done -- were

         8     false pants put on, a false shirt on, false shoes?

         9     What happened with this picture?

        10            A.    I didn't create the picture.  I have no

        11     idea what was done to it.

        12            Q.    You have --

        13            A.    There are many ways it could have been

        14     done.  I have no personal knowledge of how it was

        15     done.

        16            Q.    You have an opinion about how it was

        17     done, given all your expertise?

        18            A.    In this particular place, in this

        19     particular place, the issue that we're talking about

        20     now, looks like somebody took either a retouching

        21     brush and attempted to hide something, either a crop

        22     line or something of that nature, or if it was done

        23     digitally, it could be a process known as cloning.

        24            Q.    Now I'm talking about the whole

        25     photograph.  You're saying this a photograph of

        26     Mr. Simpson that somebody put new pants and shoes on,

        27     or is it a photograph of somebody else entirely that

        28     somebody put Mr. Simpson's head on?  What are you
 


                                                                   116
         1     saying was done here?

         2            A.    What I'm saying is there are anomalies in

         3     the photograph that are not typical, that you would

         4     not find in an unretouched photograph or that you

         5     would not expect to find in an unretouched photograph,

         6     and there are indications of more than one process

         7     possibly being used.

         8            Q.    In fact, sir, you're not sure whether

         9     this is a fake, are you?

        10            A.    I'm sure, to my satisfaction I'm sure

        11     it's a fake.

        12            Q.    Okay.

        13                  Do you remember at your deposition --

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  14, Mr. Leonard.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  You're sure it's a

        16     fake?

        17            A.    I'm convinced to a great deal of

        18     certainty that it's a fake.

        19            Q.    Let's look at your deposition

        20     testimony -- but you're not sure?

        21            MR. LEONARD:  Objection, vague, Your Honor.

        22            MR. GELBLUM:  Put it up.

        23            MR. LEONARD:  Asked and answered.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. GELBLUM)  (Reading:)

        25                         Your bottom line opinion here is

        26                  that you observed what you perceived are

        27                  some problems with the negative?

        28                         Yes.
 


                                                                   117
         1                         That leads you to believe on

         2                  balance it's probably not genuine, it's

         3                  probably a fake, but you're not sure; is

         4                  that fair?

         5                         I'd say that's accurate, yeah.

         6                  Remember giving that testimony?

         7            A.    Yes.

         8            THE COURT:  Okay.  1:30.

         9                  Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about

        10     the case, don't form or express any opinions.

        11     we're going to suspend our examination of Mr. Groden

        12     for now, but we're not finished.

        13            THE COURT:  Okay.

        28            THE WITNESS:  I do.
 


                                                                   119

        10                       DIRECT EXAMINATION

        11     BY MR. BLASIER:

        12            Q.    Dr. Rieders, you are a forensic

        13     toxicologist?

        14            A.    Yes.

        15            Q.    Can you tell the jury what that means?

        16            A.    A toxicologist -- a toxicologist is a

        17     professional in the field of -- you might say poisons,

        18     except that everything is a poison when it's too much.

        19                  So the toxicologist concerns himself with

        20     the analysis of foreign compounds, usually in

        21     biological materials, but also inanimate materials,

        22     with the effect of chemical substances that are

        23     harmful for man and, with the way that man handles

        24     those chemical substances; what the chemicals do to

        25     the body and what the body does to the chemicals.

        26                  I said "man."  Men of course, it is also

        27     applied to other areas, such as veterinary toxicology,

        28     ecological toxicology, et cetera.  But the science
 


                                                                   120
         1     arose from the study of the interaction between

         2     chemicals and man, along the line of harm.

         3                  "Forensic" refers to the application of

         4     toxicology to things that have to do with the open

         5     court -- in Latin, it's call the forensic arena -- and

         6     so it does deal with the application to legal

         7     proceedings, to various other things which may not

         8     involve legal proceedings, but making of law from a

         9     legislature.

        10                  And in many cases, the evaluation of

        11     substances as to their safety and potential

        12     harmfulness, which then may become legal issues,

        13     although they're not always -- some are medical, but

        14     they can be come legal because they are man-made

        15     things or man intervention things.

        16                  So, really, what forensic toxicology is,

        17     in simple words, the application of chemical-harm

        18     study to legal matters.

        19            Q.    Have you been retained by the defense in

        20     this case to examine the question of whether or not

        21     there is a chemical called EDTA frequently present in

        22     some of the blood stains in this case?

        23            A.    Yes.

        24            Q.    Can you briefly tell the jury what your

        25     educational background is.

        26            A.    I'm a graduate of New York University's

        27     Washington Square College, where, after World War II,

        28     I completed my education, which I had done here and
 


                                                                   121
         1     there in the country prior to that.  I immigrated here

         2     in 1939.

         3                    My -- following military service, I

         4     returned to finish my education under the GI Bill.  I

         5     received a bachelor's -- bachelor of arts degree from

         6     New York University in 1948.  No.  I'm sorry.  19 --

         7     Yes, in '48.

         8                  In 1940  -- My major subject was

         9     chemistry and my minor subject was biology.

        10                  In 1949, I received a master's of science

        11     degree from New York University in chemistry,

        12     primarily in -- well, in analytical chemistry -- that

        13     was my specialization -- and in particular,

        14     toxicological chemistry.

        15                  I was at the same time a trainee in

        16     forensic toxicology in the medical examiner's office

        17     in New York.

        18                  Following that, I received a special

        19     fellowship to the Jefferson Medical College in

        20     Philadelphia, its division of graduate studies, not

        21     towards a medical degree, but a doctor of philosophy

        22     degree, which was in the graduate division of the

        23     school.  And in 1951, I completed the requirements.

        24     And in early  I received the degree in 1952, doctor of

        25     philosophy.  My major subject was pharmacology and

        26     toxicology.

        27                    Pharmacology is the study of the

        28     interaction between chemicals and man.  In the medical
 


                                                                   122
         1     school, it is mostly centered on the interaction of

         2     medicinal substances.

         3                    In man, only, in a very general plane,

         4     how to prescribe and how to use.

         5                    Toxicology is that part of pharmacology

         6     which deals specifically with the harmful effects of

         7     chemicals.  And then, of course, that, of course, is

         8     broader than just medicine; it includes nonmedicine

         9     substances.  That was my major subject.  And my minor

        10     subject was pathology, the study of disease, and

        11     physiology, the study of the functions of the human

        12     body.

        13                    That I wrote a -- did research and

        14     wrote a doctoral thesis on toxicology, and in 1952,

        15     was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy.

        16            Q.    Dr. Rieders, you are currently the

        17     founder and director of a laboratory called National

        18     Medical Services; is that correct?

        19            A.    Yes.

        20            Q.    Can you tell the jury very briefly what

        21     your employment experience prior to start of that

        22     laboratory.

        23            A.    My employment was quite varied.

        24                  Of course, when I came here as an

        25     immigrant, I was anything from a steam blower to a

        26     glass blower, to a dish washer.  You know what I mean;

        27     in 1939 that was a different time as far as relevance

        28     to this field is concerned.  And experience -- the
 


                                                                   123
         1     experiences I had in the area, not particularly just

         2     toxicology, but of the medical sciences.

         3                  I was a surgical technician and as a --

         4     as a company aid man in World War II in Europe, which

         5     gave me some background.  I -- during my last year

         6     working for a bachelor's degree in New York, I

         7     obtained a position with the Office of the Chief

         8     Medical Examiner of New York as a trainee.  And as a

         9     junior toxicologist, actually being trained in the

        10     methods and procedures of autopsy tissue analysis in

        11     the toxicology division.

        12                  I left there after two years to complete

        13     my -- to work for my doctorate in Philadelphia.  That

        14     was a special fellowship in which I did perform some

        15     service work for the hospital of Jefferson -- Thomas

        16     Jefferson Hospital, along the lines of toxicology

        17     because I had some training in it.

        18                  Also as a teaching assistant and mainly

        19     in toxicology, although some pharmacology.

        20                  After completing the doctoral degree, I

        21     became a teacher at Jefferson and an instructor the

        22     department of pharmacology and industrial medicine,

        23     with the emphasis on industry, a pharmacologist, and I

        24     taught medical students, graduate students.  Conducted

        25     research and published research on that I did, in

        26     addition to continuing some of the service work until

        27     I trained some other people to take over in the

        28     hospital laboratory.
 


                                                                   124
         1                  In 1956, the City of Philadelphia changed

         2     from coroner to medical examiner.  And the first

         3     medical examiner of the city required the services of

         4     a full-time toxicologist, whose responsibility was

         5     to -- to actually develop a toxicology service which

         6     didn't exist there before.

         7                  And there were several candidates.  I was

         8     among them.  We were examined and I was selected for

         9     the position as chief toxicologist in the office of

        10     the medical examiner of the City of Philadelphia,

        11     which there, was in the health department.

        12                  In addition to that, I also became

        13     responsible for organizing the center and operating a

        14     poison information center.

        15                  I conducted my work for the City Medical

        16     Examiner's Office, servicing some of the hospitals in

        17     emergency toxicology and in other areas in the poison

        18     information center, but mainly in developing and

        19     carrying out, and then supervising the analyses of

        20     autopsy specimens for foreign substances, which helped

        21     them to delineate cause of death, manner of death,

        22     circumstances, et cetera.

        23                  At the same time, I retained my

        24     affiliation with Jefferson and am still a full

        25     professor, although now I'm an adjunct until I have a

        26     teaching loan, 'cause most of my time is spent there.

        27                  And I continue to teach and train at

        28     Jefferson.  I still do that.
 


                                                                   125
         1                  This went from 1956, when I became chief,

         2     until 1970, when I founded and started an independent

         3     toxicological laboratory and consulting company,

         4     National Medical Services.

         5                  I no longer own the company; it is owned

         6     by my family.  I turned over my share of ownership and

         7     direction of the company over to them.  I am

         8     laboratory director, and of course, since it's a

         9     family business, I'm also Chairman of the Board,

        10     whatever that means.

        11                  And so I continue to, except for

        12     administrative duties, to be active in the field of

        13     toxicology, both professionally and as a teacher.

        14            Q.    Dr. Rieders, have you testified as an

        15     expert in courts across the country on the subject of

        16     toxicology?

        17            A.    Yes.

        18            Q.    Approximately how many times?

        19            A.    Well over 100 times.  I really don't know

        20     how many times.

        21            Q.    Have some of those times been for the

        22     prosecution in criminal cases and sometimes for the

        23     defense?

        24            A.    Predominantly prosecution.

        25            Q.    And National Medical Services,

        26     approximately how many employees do you have now?

        27            A.    It now has 120 employees.

        28            Q.    And do you do a lot of work -- or what's
 


                                                                   126
         1     called reference work for other labs, do various law

         2     enforcement agencies send you work to do?

         3            A.    Yes.  That's our major source of work, is

         4     reference work for other large clinical laboratories.

         5     We do the toxicology for them, as specialists.

         6            Q.    Now, in the past, have you been consulted

         7     by Special Agent Roger Martz of the  FBI?

         8            A.    Yes.  We have known each other for some

         9     years.  We've worked together, and still do.

        10            Q.    He performed some testing in this

        11     particular case on certain blood stains?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    Do you have -- still have a professional

        14     relationship with Special Agent Martz?

        15            A.    Very much.  Still working on cases

        16     together.

        17            Q.    Now, could you tell the jury which blood

        18     stains were analyzed in this case by the FBI?

        19            A.    The blood stains that were analyzed by

        20     the FBI that I became concerned with -- they may have

        21     analyzed others, which I don't know -- are stains

        22     which I was told originated from the back gate at

        23     Mr. Simpson's home, and stains that came from a sock

        24     that was Mr. Simpson's sock, and blood stains --

        25            Q.    Now, by "back gate," do you mean back

        26     gate of 875 South Bundy?

        27            A.    At his residence, yes; Bundy.

        28            Q.    Where the murder scene was?
 


                                                                   127
         1            A.    Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's --

         2            Q.    Now, what technique did Special Agent

         3     Martz use to examine those stains for the presence of

         4     EDTA?

         5            A.    He used a technique which is a so-called

         6     hyphenated technique.  It consists of essentially

         7     three -- four separate steps that are combined into a

         8     unit.  They are not retrofitted like an instrument is

         9     to design -- to perform all four steps.

        10                  The first step is called liquid

        11     chromatography.  This consists of placing a sample

        12     into a tube which has some material in it.  That helps

        13     to separate compounds from each other, and then

        14     pushing the materials through the tube with a liquid.

        15                  In the course of that, the mixture -- a

        16     mixture of compounds becomes separated either into

        17     individual, truly individual compounds, totally

        18     separated from each other, but at least also into

        19     groups of compounds.  But you get separation in that

        20     fashion.

        21                  The effluent which comes out the other

        22     end when these substances march out in an orderly

        23     fashion, one after the other, is then transferring the

        24     substances or the liquid as it marches out to a

        25     connecting device, to another instrument.  And that is

        26     called an electro spray interface.

        27                  When material enters the electro spray

        28     interface -- this is a heated, very fine tube -- it is
 


                                                                   128
         1     heated to a high enough temperature, and all of those

         2     things that can vaporize and -- vaporize and become a

         3     vapor and march out partly as a vapor, partly either

         4     as a gas, if the material is actually made into gas,

         5     into -- or else is a very, very fine particulate

         6     spray, that is accomplished by putting a very high

         7     electric voltage charge on that tube.  And that's why

         8     it's called electro spray.

         9                  At the same time, there are two gases

        10     pass through:  One of them is around that tube, and it

        11     carries away the vapors of water and other highly

        12     volatile materials.  The other one goes through the

        13     tube and drives the vapors that stay in that path of

        14     the tube, and the very fine particles, into a piece of

        15     equipment called a mass spectrometer.

        16                  The best way that I can explain to you a

        17     mass spectrometer is that, it is a device which, as a

        18     molecule, or as molecules comes into -- into that

        19     device, it weighs them and it sorts them into

        20     molecules that weigh a certain amount and other

        21     molecules that weigh a different amount.

        22                    And that is fairly characteristic of a

        23     substance; it's essentially -- it's molecular weight,

        24     whether -- whatever number it is.  And there are

        25     several substances with the same number, but anyways,

        26     it's certainly a characteristic.

        27                  What it then does, though, it applies

        28     energy to the molecules, and particularly -- well, to
 


                                                                   129
         1     the molecules to such an extent that they actually

         2     break into pieces.  A molecule breaks into pieces.

         3                  It doesn't break like a beer bottle, you

         4     know, into all kinds of various bits and pieces, but

         5     more like a diamond that is being cut by a jeweler.

         6     It breaks along certain energy planes and gives

         7     predictable parts of the molecule appearing in there.

         8            Q.    Doctor, can you push the microphone away

         9     from you just a little bit?

        10            A.    From my --

        11                  Then it goes ahead and weighs the pieces.

        12     To some of these pieces, we'll add up to the sum, to

        13     the total molecule, and it displays the pieces and how

        14     many of each piece there are present.

        15                    So that you get what is called a mass

        16     spectrum, which one sees usually is lines along an

        17     axis and of certain height.

        18                  This is a picture of the molecule with

        19     whatever else was broken off at that point in time,

        20     and had appeared at the particular time at the end of

        21     the tube.  That is characteristic for a compound that

        22     we look for.

        23                  Different compounds have different times

        24     at which it takes them to march through the tube,

        25     appear, and be put into the mass spectrometer.  So by

        26     then, we have a characterization of a compound.

        27                  That -- how did we get in to it.  It was

        28     extracted, for example, with water from something,
 


                                                                   130
         1     either from tissue or from a swatch or from anything.

         2                  So it's water soluble.  We know that.

         3                  It goes through the liquid chromatograph.

         4     That means the liquid is able to push it through, and

         5     it doesn't hang up front a lot.  A lot of things hang

         6     up.  Not only that, but it takes it a certain time to

         7     get through.  That's called a retention time.  So that

         8     is another characteristic.

         9                  It's water soluble; it goes through the

        10     column; it has a given retention time; it is capable

        11     of being ionized in that -- in that electro

        12     spectrometer tube and brought into the mass

        13     spectrometer.

        14            Q.    Doctor, is there a shortcut way to

        15     describe what's going on here?

        16            A.    The rest of it, yes.

        17                         (Laughter.)

        18

        19

        20            A.    The -- one of these molecules that --

        21     well, the main molecule itself is weighed and

        22     displayed.  So you now have the weight of the

        23     molecule.  Actually, it's a little bit more than that,

        24     because it's also electrically charged.  But you know

        25     what the weight is.

        26                  Then it is broken up, and one of the

        27     pieces usually -- or two pieces, the larger pieces are

        28     filtered into another mass spectrometer, which now
 


                                                                   131
         1     breaks them up further, and goes into a third mass

         2     spectrometer, if necessary.

         3                  In this case, it only went two ways.  The

         4     first one, the molecule that came through and was

         5     filtered out is called the parent ion.  It is the

         6     parent for the next two break-up ions.

         7                  The ions which are call the daughter ion,

         8     each of these has a specified weight.  Each of these

         9     appears at the same retention time as the molecular

        10     ion, the parent ion did.  And so it's characterized

        11     as -- each one of these characterizes the substance

        12     that you're looking for.  In this case, EDTA.

        13                  So we have the characteristic of EDTA;

        14     that it was water soluble; it went through the system;

        15     it came out at a certain point in time at the end of

        16     the tube; and its molecular size at that point was

        17     weighed, was the right size to be EDTA or not;

        18     and that the break-ups, the daughter ion, also had

        19     appeared at the same retention time and weighed like

        20     characteristic pieces of EDTA.

        21                  That is how you characterize or exclude a

        22     substance.  And that is called -- the long name is

        23     liquid high performance liquid chromatograph electro

        24     spray tandem mass spectrometry tandem, but it's two

        25     mass spectrometers -- actually, three that we're

        26     dealing with here.

        27            Q.    The shortcut for that is LCESMSMS (sic)?

        28            A.    Yes.
 


                                                                   132
         1            Q.    Okay.

         2                  And is it accurate that what you're

         3     looking for if you're trying to identify whether EDTA

         4     is present in something, you're looking for the

         5     retention time; you're looking for whether it's water

         6     soluble; you're looking for whether it has the right

         7     molecular weight; and you're looking for whether the

         8     pieces are the right size.  Correct?

         9            A.    Yes.

        10            Q.    Okay.

        11            Q.    Let me show you a couple of charts that

        12     have been marked for identification 1216 and 1215.

        13

        14                         (The instrument herein referred to

        15                         as Chromatogram of Q206 No. 4088

        16                         was marked for identification as

        17                         Defendants' Exhibit No. 1215.)

        18

        19

        20                         (The instrument herein referred to

        21                         as Chromatogram of Q206 No. 4094

        22                         was marked for identification as

        23                         Defendants' Exhibit No. 1216.)

        24

        25            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Do those purport to be

        26     charts resulting from this type of -- kind of analysis

        27     for the stain from the sock?

        28
 


                                                                   133
         1                        (Witness reviews Denfendants'

         2                         Exhibits 1215 and 1216.)

         3

         4            A.    Yes, these are the -- the characteristic

         5     type of results that you get in a tandem mass

         6     spectrometry.

         7                  All the other things went on before to

         8     get us to this point, finally, from the --

         9            Q.    Now, can we --

        10            A.    And this is sample O2 -- Q206.

        11            Q.    What I'd like to do is show you a drawing

        12            THE COURT:  Mr. Blasier?

        13            MR. BLASIER:  Yes, sir.

        14            THE COURT:  Are you identifying separately 1215

        15     and 16?

        16            MR. BLASIER:  Yes, I am.  And it will tie into

        17     his charts, as well.

        18            THE COURT:  What?

        19            MR. BLASIER:  We'll show these charts in a

        20     second.

        21            THE COURT:  No.

        22                  My question is, the witness was

        23     describing something, and it's not clear which exhibit

        24     he's referring to.

        25            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  1215 and 1216 are two

        26     charts.

        27                  Are those two separate testings of the

        28     blood stain from the sock?
 


                                                                   134
         1            A.    If this is from the sock, these are the

         2     stains from the sock, yes.

         3            Q.    Okay.  And --

         4            A.    Q  206, that number refers to the stain

         5     from the sock.

         6            Q.    That's another number that the FBI

         7     assigned --

         8            A.    Yes.

         9            Q.    -- to that stain?

        10            A.    The number that they gave it, yeah.

        11            THE COURT:  Is that tied to some other exhibit

        12     number that we have with which sock it is?

        13            MR. BLASIER:  Yes.  That's what this chart will

        14     tie to.

        15            MR. P. BAKER:  Next chart is going to be next

        16     in order.

        17            THE CLERK:  2292.

        18            MR. LAMBERT:  No.  This is marked.

        19            MR. P. BAKER:  Marked?

        20            MR. LAMBERT:  Yeah.

        21            MR. BLASIER:  That is 1208.

        22

        23                         (The instrument herein referred to

        24                         as EDTA chart with six charts

        25                         collectively, was marked for

        26                         identification as Defendants'

        27                         Exhibit No. 1208.)

                                                                   135
         1            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Now Doctor, the sock

         2     we're talking about is the sock that was purportedly

         3     found in Mr. Simpson's bedroom, and there was a large

         4     cut-out made where there was a blood stain on the

         5     ankle of one of those socks, correct?

         6            A.    Yes.

         7            Q.    Okay.

         8                  And this isn't to scale, certainly, but

         9     Q206 is the stain that was tested by the FBI, correct?

        10            A.    Yes.

        11            Q.    And where did that come from in relation

        12     to the ankle stain itself?

        13            A.    It came from a large area.

        14            Q.    That came from a large area adjacent to

        15     the cut-out in the ankle of the socks?

        16            A.    Yes, where Q206 is, that is a tiny area

        17     that was cut out and transferred to a swatch, or was a

        18     swatch.

        19            Q.    Now, let me put Exhibit 1215 on the Elmo.

        20

        21                         (Exhibit No. 1215 displayed on the

        22                         Elmo screen.)

        23

        24            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Can you tell us just

        25     briefly what this chart depicts?

        26            A.    This chart depicts on the 3-6 scan along

        27     the long axis, down -- these are the number of scans.

        28     It's like somebody with a pair of binoculars going
 


                                                                   136
         1     like this (indicating) and looking along the line, and

         2     they detect a peak, which is in the right position for

         3     EDTA.

         4                  And the instrument that's used to scan it

         5     is set to look only at things that have a weight of

         6     160.  And the weight of 160 appears as a prominent

         7     peak at -- is it 36 scan?  I can't quite make it out

         8     from here -- 37, where EDTA standard was located.

         9                  So this is another characteristic of EDTA

        10     here.  (Indicating.)

        11            Q.    What do we see?

        12            A.    What we see is, when the spyglass is set

        13     to look at all ions, combined and find -- it finds one

        14     peak for all the ions in the same position, so that is

        15     the original broken-up molecule.  All of them.  They

        16     all come together at that one position 36, again,

        17     characteristic for EDTA.

        18                  So that this, in conjunction with all the

        19     other things we have talked about, is evidence for the

        20     actual presence of EDTA in that particular sample and

        21     in that particular analytical run.

        22            Q.    And looking at Exhibit 1216, this was a

        23     second run of the same blood stain?

        24            A.    Yes, it was.  At a different time I

        25     believe.

        26            Q.    And does that also indicate the presence

        27     of EDTA?

        28            A.    Yes.  It does the same thing the RIC, the
 


                                                                   137
         1     rate the combined pieces show up at the retention.

         2                  In this case, again, I can't see the

         3     number for certain, but it's around 37, 38 again!

         4     Also, the 160 daughter ion.  That means the split ion

         5     also at the same retention, and it appears as a

         6     defined peak.

         7                  So that is a repetition.  There are two

         8     analytical runs, each showing the presence of EDTA.

         9            Q.    Did FBI or Agent Marx indicate a

        10     negligence test, a negative control?

        11            A.    Yes.

        12            Q.    Was that a piece of the sock from

        13     someplace other than where the blood stain was?

        14            A.    It was a piece of the sock where no blood

        15     was seen, and presumably none was present.

        16            Q.    And did that reveal any EDTA?

        17            A.    No, it did not.

        18            Q.    And what can you tell from the fact that

        19     two runs of the the stain show EDTA and the negative

        20     control doesn't?

        21            A.    Well, it shows that the sock itself

        22     didn't have EDTA in it, because it only had the EDTA

        23     where the swatch came from, where the blood stain was.

        24     It did not have EDTA where there wasn't any blood.

        25            Q.    Now, did Special Agent Marx also test

        26     stain Q204 for -- the back gate?

        27            A.    Yes, he did

        28            Q.    Let me show you what's been marked
 


                                                                   138
         1     Exhibits 1218 and 1219.

         2                  And can you tell the jury what those two

         3     charts are?

         4

         5                         (The instrument herein referred to

         6                         as Chromatogram of Q204 No. 4084

         7                         was marked for identification as

         8                         Defendant's Exhibit No. 1218.)

         9

        10                         (The instrument herein referred to

        11                         as Chromatogram of Q204 No. 4049

        12                         was marked for identification as

        13                         Defendant's Exhibit No. 1219.)

        14

        15                         (Exhibits 1218 and 1219 displayed

        16                         on Elmo.)

        17

        18            A.    Those two charts are the same type of

        19     charts as we just saw for the sock.

        20                  These are two analyses which were made on

        21     extract from swatches of what appear to be blood taken

        22     from the back gate.  And they show the same kind of

        23     pattern as we saw before for the sock, from the back

        24     gate.

        25                  They show that the total of combined ions

        26     have a retention of 39, and that the 160 molecular

        27     weight piece -- break-up piece from the parent.  The

        28     daughter ion, 160 molecular weight daughter ion, also
 


                                                                   139
         1     has a peak at the 39 retention.

         2                  So again, this is a run that is positive

         3     for EDTA.

         4            Q.    Now, were there also runs for negative

         5     controls for the back gate?

         6            A.    Yes, there were.

         7            Q.    How many were there?

         8            A.    As I recall, there were four runs that

         9     were labeled as -- as controls.

        10            Q.    Now, the back gate was just a swatch that

        11     was taken from the blood stain known as number 117; is

        12     that correct?

        13            A.    Yes.  And the other one from where there

        14     was no blood stain, or none was seen, anyway.

        15            Q.    Now, what did the four negative controls

        16     indicate?

        17            A.    One of the negative controls showed the

        18     presence that supposedly came from another place on

        19     there, and it showed the presence of EDTA.  Even

        20     though it was considered a negative control, it came

        21     from where there wasn't supposed to be any blood.

        22                  The other three did not show any EDTA, so

        23     they came from other areas on the back gate, and

        24     showed none of these characteristics that we have been

        25     discussing -- didn't show any EDTA.

        26            Q.    Three of the negative controls didn't

        27     show any EDTA, one showed possible presence of EDTA?

        28            A.    One that -- one that was labeled negative
 


                                                                   140
         1     control did show it, yes.

         2            Q.    Was there actually a third test that was

         3     labeled as coming from the back-gate stain that showed

         4     no EDTA?

         5            A.    Yes, there was.  There were -- there was

         6     one other area.

         7            MR. BLASIER:  I need two new numbers, please.

         8            A.    (Continuing.)  There's one other one,

         9     Q204, that is negative for EDTA, does not have the

        10     requisite peaks, as we call them, in that area.

        11                  And then there's one which is -- well,

        12     this is called  Q204 control.

        13                  No.  I'm sorry.  The  Q204 control shows

        14     it; that's the one I mentioned before.

        15                  The repeat of  Q204, which was actually

        16     the blood, supposedly blood, is stained, doesn't show

        17     it.

        18                  So there is one that supposedly comes

        19     from the bloody stain, but doesn't show any EDTA.

        20            MR. BLASIER:  Could we have two numbers?

         5            MR. BLASIER:  I'll make 2292 the repeat of

         6     Q204, and 2293 the control from Q204.

         7                  Let me put these both on the Elmo.

        11

        12            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Now, Dr. Rieders, I've

        13     indicated that of the two sock stains that were

        14     tested, came up positive for EDTA and the negative

        15     control came up negative, correct?

        16            A.    Yes.

        17            Q.    And for the back gate, there were two

        18     tests for the presence of EDTA from the blood stain

        19     that -- that came back above, and there were three

        20     negative controls that came back negative, correct?

        21            A.    Yes.

        22            Q.    Now, do you have an opinion on why this

        23     negative control here showed presence of EDTA and the

        24     actual stain doesn't?

        25            A.    Yes, I do.

        26            Q.    And what's that opinion?

        27            A.    I believe that there was an accidental

        28     switch made somewhere along the line, between what was
 


                                                                   142
         1     supposed to be the negative control and what was

         2     supposed to be the bloody stain control.

         3            Q.    Is it accurate to say that all of the --

         4     The charts that were run in this run are consistent

         5     with there being EDTA present on the back gate and the

         6     sock, with the exception of these two?

         7            A.    Yes.

         8            Q.    Okay.

         9                  Now, did Special Agent Martz attempt to

        10     quantify the amount of EDTA that was located on the

        11     back gate and on the sock?

        12            A.    No.  He, according to everything that I

        13     saw in the record -- all that he told me, he did not

        14     attempt to quantify it; he merely wanted to see is

        15     there some there or isn't there any.

        16            Q.    Now, you have seen some charts that Agent

        17     Martz produced showing differences in known quantities

        18     of EDTA blood and the stains in this case?

        19            A.    Yes, I have.

        20            Q.    And do you have an opinion as to whether

        21     the analysis that was done with respect to the

        22     quantity of EDTA that was found is a valid analysis?

        23            A.    You mean on the stains and the controls

        24     that we are talking about here?

        25            Q.    Yes.  The stains and the known EDTA.

        26            A.    It's only valid qualitatively.  Let me

        27     tell you why.

        28                  There are two measures of amount.  One of
 


                                                                   143
         1     them is just the amount you know how much is on that

         2     picture here.

         3                  In order to have an idea of what that is,

         4     you have to have standards.  And the standards, as

         5     well as the sample, have to contain one additional

         6     thing.  And that is called an internal standard.

         7                  That means, in another chemical substance

         8     which is very close to the substance that you're

         9     looking for, but is sufficiently different so that it

        10     will separate from it and have a different retention

        11     time.  And the reason for that is that, particularly

        12     electro spray gives you variable amounts every time

        13     you run it.  There are slight variations and sometimes

        14     very substantial ones.

        15                  If you have an internal standard, then

        16     that is affected the same way as the chemical that

        17     you're looking for; so if there's only a low peak in

        18     one, then the other one's lower, too.  The ratio

        19     between the two remains unaffected.

        20                  So if you know how much the internal

        21     standard represents and what the ratio is, you can go

        22     back to your curve and determine what the amount is.

        23                  If you do not have that internal

        24     standard, you can -- you can guess, you know.  It's

        25     there; it's more than an amount that couldn't detect.

        26     It's less than a lot.  So it's a tiny bit of the EDTA

        27     that is there.  Now, that is amount.

        28                  The important thing is to know
 


                                                                   144
         1     concentration.  And that simply means amount perfect

         2     what.

         3                  If you take a drop of blood, a measured

         4     drop of blood, which is usually around 50 microliters,

         5     and you analyze it, and you find and use an internal

         6     standard and you calculate an amount, then you can say

         7     this is the concentration, so many nanograms, let us

         8     say, per microgram of blood.

         9                  But if you don't measure how much blood

        10     you have, that you started with, then you have no way

        11     of knowing what the concentration is.

        12                  It's like saying, you know, I've got --

        13     I've got some alcohol here; I've got a half an ounce

        14     of alcohol.  So is this from beer or is it from

        15     whiskey, or is it from wine?

        16                  You have to know how much wine or how

        17     much liquid you analyzed.  If you know how much

        18     liquid, then you know that this amount is 6 percent of

        19     the liquid.  It's probably beer if it's 50 percent of

        20     the liquid; it's probably 100-proof spirits.  But if

        21     you don't know how much of the total you had, you

        22     can't get to a concentration.

        23                  And there was no -- I saw no measurements

        24     of the amount of blood that was used in the analysis

        25     from the -- from the -- from the gate or from the

        26     socks or in the controls.

        27                  Controls, it would be zero.  You know,

        28     that's the amount that you find, which is not in
 


                                                                   145
         1     the -- nothing.  Which, in the case of blood, you have

         2     to know what's in the lower part of the equation.

         3                  The denominator, so many milligrams of

         4     micrograms per milliliter of blood or whatever you

         5     want, but you have to know how much you use to

         6     calculate that.

         7            Q.    Now, Dr. Rieders, do you have an opinion

         8     as to the source of the EDTA in the back gate stain

         9     and the sock stain?

        10            A.    To the source?

        11                  Other than the blood from a living person

        12     who has not been -- from a living person who has not

        13     received EDTA intravenously -- it is given

        14     intravenously as a treatment in lead poisoning and in

        15     other poisonings -- but normal blood, there's -- not

        16     come from someone who's had it injected into them does

        17     not contain any by this means at that level of

        18     sensitivity, detectable amount of EDTA.

        19            Q.    All right.  Do you know what a purple-top

        20     tube is?

        21            A.    Well, if you're referring to a medical

        22     laboratory purple-top tube, yes.

        23                  When you draw blood from a patient for

        24     testing, you have to draw it into a tube.  If you want

        25     to test a whole blood where it doesn't coagulate, so

        26     you put an anticoagulant in it.

        27                  There are various anticoagulants.  Of the

        28     purple tube, or sometimes called lavender-top tube is
 


                                                                   146
         1     one which has EDTA, which dries up all the calcium in

         2     the blood, and the blood won't coagulate.  So that's

         3     called EDTA blood.

         4                  That's what you do when you draw blood

         5     for various measurement purposes.

         6            Q.    Do you have an opinion whether or not the

         7     EDTA that was detected by Special Agent Martz could

         8     have come from a purple-top tube?

         9            A.    I do have an opinion.

        10            Q.    What is your opinion?

        11            A.    And that is in terms of finding in blood

        12     the most common source, unless, of course, there's

        13     some outside contamination introduced otherwise.  But

        14     the most common reasonable source is that it has to be

        15     purple-top-tube blood.

        16            Q.    Now, EDTA is used in a lot of different

        17     things, is it not?

        18            A.    Yes.

        19            Q.    And are there studies that examine the

        20     question of how much EDTA a person might have in their

        21     blood just normally, from eating food that has it in

        22     it?

        23            A.    Yes.  There have been studies very early,

        24     as a matter of fact, and with a technique that you

        25     can't even use anymore.  They won't allow you to.

        26            Q.    And do those studies indicate that the

        27     source of EDTA in this case could have come from

        28     normal ingestion of food?
 


                                                                   147
         1            A.    No, not even from abnormal ingestion.

         2                  The amount that is found -- that was

         3     found by this radioactive label technique -- that's

         4     really what it was -- was absolutely minuscule of a

         5     measure after measured amounts even greater than what

         6     we get in food today were given to people.

         7                  The reason I say it's not done now is,

         8     you can't give radioactive -- that kind of radioactive

         9     material to people to find out whether they're

        10     absorbing something.

        11            Q.    In your opinion, is there any source of

        12     EDTA other than a purple-top tube, that could account

        13     for the findings of the FBI in this case?

        14            A.    Well, contamination, of course, can --

        15     accidental, other contamination of those that were

        16     positive.

        17            Q.    And was there any indication of that in

        18     this case?

        19            A.    I really don't know where it came from,

        20     but those are the two things that I can tell you where

        21     it may come from, either from EDTA blood or from some

        22     contamination that was introduced at some point in

        23     time into the material.

        24            Q.    Now, contamination, could that have been

        25     something in the laboratory -- let me rephrase that.

        26                  There were other blank samples that were

        27     run along the stains in this case, were there not?

        28            A.    Yes.
 


                                                                   148
         1            Q.    And other than the one control that we

         2     talked about, did any of those show the presence of

         3     EDTA?

         4            A.    No.

         5            Q.    Is that consistent with the source of

         6     EDTA in this case being something other than

         7     contamination?

         8            A.    No, it really isn't.  Contamination is

         9     usually a random thing.  You know, accidental

        10     contamination, and this is not random.  You have a set

        11     of positives and a set of negatives.  With the

        12     exception of the two samples that you mentioned, and

        13     as I mentioned, my opinion is that these are switched

        14     samples, you know, one is supposed to be the other.

        15            Q.    So is there -- Is there any indication of

        16     contamination as being a source to the positive

        17     results that the FBI found in this case?

        18            A.    No.

        19            Q.    Is there a phenomenon that's known as

        20     ghosting, ghosting?

        21            A.    Ghosting.

        22            Q.    Let me ask it this way.  Is it possible

        23     to have EDTA or any other compound left over in the

        24     column that you use for the chromatography stage?

        25            A.    I'm sorry, you mean ghosting, like -- you

        26     mean like spirit.

        27            Q.    Yes.

        28            A.    Yes, there is.  There is such a
 


                                                                   149
         1     phenomenon.

         2            Q.    Describe briefly what that is?

         3            A.    Well, if you -- let's say you inject into

         4     this equipment a lot -- relatively large amount of

         5     EDTA, let's say it comes out with a reading of 20 and

         6     then you make -- right after that, you make another

         7     injection or what should be a negative, a blank, for

         8     instance, and there you see a peak, but instead of

         9     being 20 it's between one and two.

        10                  That is very much likely or -- Well it's

        11     sufficiently likely to be a ghost, that what happened

        12     in the first one that some of the EDTA got stuck on

        13     the injection side or somewhere along the line and the

        14     second injection that came with it cleared it off,

        15     pushed it out and showed it up.

        16                    But I have never seen ghosting that is

        17     more than ten percent, it's almost always less than

        18     ten percent of the previous injection.

        19                  So unless there is an injection before

        20     that which is at least ten times as high as a little

        21     bit that shows up, I don't believe that this could be

        22     a ghost.  There's no way in here anything that --

        23     looks like it was just injected before and was very

        24     high.

        25            Q.    So is it your opinion that the two sock

        26     stains and the three gate stains that tested positive

        27     for EDTA, were not due to ghosting?

        28            A.    That is my opinion, yes.
 


                                                                   150
         1            MR. BLASIER:  Thank you, that's all I have.

         2            THE COURT:  Take a ten-minute recess ladies and

         3     gentlemen, don't talk about the case.  Don't express

         4     any opinions.

         5

         6                        (Recess.).

         7

         8                         (The following proceedings were

         9                         held in the Court's chambers,

        10                         outside the presence of the jury.)

        11

        12            THE COURT:  Okay.  Let the record show we're in

        13     chambers with Mr. Blasier, Mrs. Blasier, Mr. Baker,

        14     Mr. Brewer, Mr. Petrocelli, our court staff.

        15                  And state your name.

        16            DEPUTY TYKO:  Deputy Tyko T-I-K-O.

        17            THE COURT:  Mrs. Tyko, can you relate to me

        18     again what occurred?

        19            DEPUTY TYKO:  This morning, at the morning --

        20     Mrs. Blasier -- I don't know the lady's name with

        21     you -- came into the Court with a mike, Mrs. Blasier's

        22     mike.  I asked -- I don't know her name -- I keep

        23     saying -- I asked her if she was recording.  She said

        24     no.  Vickie went up and asked her if she was

        25     recording.  She said no.

        26                  We found out this is obviously not a

        27     recording device, well here's another one, but they

        28     are -- they are wireless mikes, and they can broadcast
 


                                                                   151
         1     up to a quarter of a mile away.

         2                  And when I -- Mrs. Blasier, this

         3     afternoon when I asked her -- I told them both that it

         4     was a problem to have them in the courtroom.  I took

         5     them.  I said, we'll keep them for you, when we leave,

         6     because the other news media have noticed them.  Okay.

         7                  And I took -- and I asked you for yours,

         8     and the red light was on, which meant it was on.

         9            MRS. BLASIER:  I could have done that in trying

        10     to get it out of my pocket, because it was in kind of

        11     tight, (indicating to pants pocket) and I could have

        12     flipped it when I was simply taking it out.  Because

        13     we've been turning them off.

        14            THE COURT:  Why do you have them, ma'am?

        15            MRS. BLASIER:  My agency is Missing Persons and

        16     Sensitive Crime Investigations.

        17                  Lena came out from New York to interview

        18     me.  She works with America's Most Wanted.

        19                  I have a lot of my clients on the show,

        20     plus I've done some things for it.  I do a lot of

        21     missing-person cases, especially children, and Lena is

        22     doing a segment on me and my work.

        23            THE COURT:  So why do you have to have it in

        24     this courtroom?

        25            MRS. BLASIER:  Well, I didn't.  It just saved

        26     us having to go out to the car when we were talking,

        27     like at lunchtime and that.

        28            THE COURT:  What's the purpose of this
 


                                                                   152
         1     equipment?

         2            MRS. BLASIER:  Because we are very short in

         3     time on her interviewing me on my work.

         4            THE COURT:  This is a remote transmitter.

         5                  Where are you transmitting to?

         6            MRS. BLASIER:  We did a minute of it, I

         7     believe, in the parking lot this morning, and then

         8     during lunch, so we could do a few minutes; that was

         9     all.  And I think that I possibly pushed the button in

        10     getting it out of my pocket when I was sitting down.

        11     I handed it to her, that's all.

        12            THE COURT:  Who receives the transmissions?

        13            MRS. BLASIER:  The news crew that's with Lena.

        14     They were going to do some taping, so that --

        15            THE COURT:  Let me ask you this:  Where is the

        16     news crew located?

        17            MRS. BLASIER:  Someplace where -- wherever they

        18     parked.  I don't know.  And then they met with us at

        19     lunchtime for about one minute.

        20            THE COURT:  Where -- bring the other woman in.

        21            THE CLERK:  What is her name?

        22            MRS. BLASIER:  Lena Nozizwe.

        23            THE COURT REPORTER:  Can you spell that?

        24            MRS. BLASIER:  N-o-z-i-w-e.

        25            THE CLERK:  She's not in the courtroom, so

        26     Vickie is going to look for her.

        27            MRS. BLASIER:  I think she may be in the

        28     bathroom.  I'm not sure.
 


                                                                   153
         1            THE CLERK:  Vickie's out looking for her.

         2     She's checking the bathroom.

         3

         4                         (Pause in proceedings.)

         5

         6            MR. BLASIER:  Your Honor, Charlotte just told

         7     me security was aware, she said these --

         8            MRS. BLASIER:  This morning when we first got

         9     here.  When we went through the metal detector, it was

        10     beeping.  I said oh, it's this, and I took it out, and

        11     I said these are hers.  She wanted to know if we

        12     had -- I basically asked him if I needed to leave it

        13     out.

        14                  And he said no, it was okay to take them

        15     in, so . . . I didn't think anything of it.  And I'm

        16     not positive, I think Lena may have even told him what

        17     it was.

        18            THE BAILIFF:  This is Judge Fujisaki.

        19            THE COURT:  What is your name?

        20            MS. NOZIZWE:  Lena Nozizwe.

        21            THE COURT:  You're with?

        22            MS. NOZIZWE:  America's Most Wanted.

        23            THE CLERK:  Spell your name please.

        24            MS. NOZIZWE:  N-o-z-i-z-w-e.

        25            THE COURT:  And you work with Mrs. Blasier?

        26            MS. NOZIZWE:  I don't work with her.  I mean,

        27     we're not -- we don't work together.  I work -- I work

        28     for Fox Television, America's Most Wanted.
 


                                                                   154
         1            THE COURT:  And what is your relationship with

         2     her?

         3            MS. NOZIZWE:  She's somebody who I know and

         4     somebody that I'm doing a story about.

         5            THE COURT:  You had a piece of electronic

         6     equipment on you?

         7            MS. NOZIZWE:  Yes.

         8            THE COURT:  And she had one on also?

         9            MS. NOZIZWE:  Correct.

        10            THE COURT:  Why do you both have them on?

        11            MS. NOZIZWE:  They're wireless microphones.  We

        12     were getting recordings of our conversation --

        13     conversation as -- as we came up to the courtroom, as

        14     we came through security, the bailiff -- or the deputy

        15     did see them.  I mean, he saw that I had it and they

        16     were turned off.

        17                  And also, it's not possible for it to

        18     have been transmitted because the receiver is outside.

        19     And, I mean, nothing was being broadcast inside the

        20     courtroom.  Nothing was being broadcast, I guess, is

        21     what I'm trying to say, or transmitted.

        22            THE COURT:  Do both of those belong to you,

        23     your firm?

        24            MS. NOZIZWE:  Yes.

        25                  Well, not my firm, but the photographer

        26     who I'm working with.  They belong to him.

        27            THE COURT:  Both of them?

        28            MS. NOZIZWE:  Yes.
 


                                                                   155
         1            THE COURT:  Well, one of them was on.

         2            MS. NOZIZWE:   Right.  It was the one that

         3     Charlotte had on.  We were in earlier and turned them

         4     off.  When we came in, we came back from lunch, I

         5     turned mine off.  I don't know that Charlotte -- she's

         6     not used to necessarily turning on and off, the

         7     switch, remembered to turn her's off.

         8                  But in order for any sound to be

         9     recorded, the camera has to be turned on, and it was

        10     not turned on, because the audio and video was only

        11     taken when we were outside, you know, walking up to

        12     the courthouse.

        13            THE COURT:  Well, you know the Court can only

        14     go on the objective manifestations of what I've been

        15     shown.  And what I've been shown is that there's two

        16     remote transmitters brought into the courtroom, one of

        17     which was on when it was observed by the sheriffs.

        18                  So, regretfully, I'm going to have to

        19     exclude you from the proceedings.

        20            MS. NOZIZWE:  Okay Your Honor.

        21            THE COURT:  And I'm going to have to exclude

        22     Mrs. Blasier from the proceedings, as well.

        23                  Okay.  That will be the order.

        24            THE CLERK:  Is this sealed, Your Honor?

        25            THE COURT:  No.

        26     .

        27                  (Jurors resume their respective seats.)

        28
 


                                                                   156
         1            THE COURT:  You may resume.

         2            MR. BAKER:  May we approach?

         3            THE COURT:  Yes.

         4            MR. BAKER:  On the record.

         5

         6

         7                         (The following proceedings were

         8                         held at the bench:)

         9

        10            MR. BAKER:  Two things, one is that we suggest

        11     that the other side -- Groden is going to have to come

        12     back.  We would like to adjourn after this witness,

        13     number one.

        14                  Number 2, and perhaps much more

        15     importantly, I've been informed by one of the

        16     spectators that this morning when the two jurors who

        17     are elderly come up the elevator, there's one or more

        18     demonstrators, and this morning -- and I didn't see

        19     this, I'm just reporting it; that there's a fellow

        20     that he called Julius.

        21                  I don't know who Julius is, but when I

        22     asked him, I got the impression it's the fellow that's

        23     in the courtroom now that has "Veggie Power" on his

        24     chest and he held up a photograph, a composite

        25     photograph of O.J. behind Nicole slitting her throat

        26     as the jurors were walking from the elevator

        27     towards -- whenever they entered back here.

        28                  Obviously, it's terribly inappropriate.
 


                                                                   157
         1     I didn't visualize it, I don't know that it occurred.

         2     But I think it would be -- the whole sheriffs and the

         3     security people are on the inside of the magnetometer.

         4                  This occurred on the outside of the

         5     magnetometer as they came up the elevator on the

         6     second floor.

         7            THE COURT:  Sitting right here?

         8            MR. BAKER:  Right here as they came out of

         9     elevator, those two jurors don't walk up the stairs as

        10     you're probably aware, so they walk -- come up the

        11     elevator and walk into whatever entrance, they both

        12     get into here.

        13            THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll take care of that.

        14            MR. BAKER:  Thank you.  I'm led to believe it's

        15     the guy down in the corner that has "Veggie Power,"

        16     I'm not sure.

        17            THE COURT:  Okay.

        18            MR. BAKER:  May we quit after this witness.

        19     The other one reason is --

        20            THE COURT:  Okay.  Off the record.

        21

        22                        (A discussion was held off the

        23                         record.)

        24

        25            MR. GELBLUM:  I asked him to produce,

        26     voluntarily, the transcript from the deposition that I

        27     was asking about earlier from the Assassination

        28     Records Review Board and they said no.  I'd like you
 


                                                                   158
         1     to order the witness, while he's here, to bring those,

         2     to produce those for us.

         3            MR. BAKER:  Discovery is over in this case.

         4            MR. GELBLUM:  We may be calling -- you ordered

         5     one of our witnesses to produce a record, Your Honor,

         6     the next day in court.

         7            THE COURT:  Mr. Gelblum, I think you're getting

         8     very collateral on that issue and under 352 I am not

         9     going to -- that's not even an accusation just because

        10     he was deposed on an issue, you cannot use that as an

        11     accusation of --  or proof that he stole anything.

        12     And I have -- I will not allow you to use any

        13     innuendo.

        14            MR. GELBLUM:  I understand.  I don't want to

        15     use innuendo.

        16            THE COURT:  That was innuendo.  I call it as

        17     innuendo.

        18            MR. GELBLUM:  I know you did.  I'm asking you

        19     to, as you said, you asked for the evidence.  This is

        20     the evidence and so the point is clear.  Okay.  It is

        21     not simply -- it is not to assassinate his character.

        22     He puts on his resume, he has testified that his

        23     great -- his claim to his credibility is that he's

        24     testified before these various governmental agencies,

        25     okay?  Mr. Leonard brought that out on his resume.

        26            MR. LEONARD:  I didn't bring that out.

        27            MR. GELBLUM:  You brought out the House Select

        28     Committee.
 


                                                                   159
         1            THE COURT:  I said I am not going to order it.

         6            THE COURT:  Who was examining?

         7            MR. LAMBERT:  My turn Your Honor.

         8            THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead.

        10                       CROSS-EXAMINATION

        11     BY MR. LAMBERT:

        12            Q.    Good afternoon, Dr. Rieders?

        13            A.    Good afternoon, sir.

        14            Q.    Now, just so we're clear on this, in

        15     regard to the test for whether the stains from the

        16     sock and the back gate could have come from a purple

        17     top test tube, you didn't do any tests at all in that

        18     regard yourself, did you?

        19            A.    That is correct.

        20            Q.    And you didn't run any experiment, at

        21     all, yourself, did you, Doctor?

        22            A.    Not this time, no.

        23            Q.    All right.  So everything that was done

        24     here was done by Agent Martz of the FBI?

        25            A.    Yes.

        26            Q.    Right.

        27                  So you're relying entirely upon the work

        28     that was done by Agent Martz of the FBI.
 


                                                                   160
         1            A.    And submitted to me, that I'm aware of.

         2            Q.    Yes.

         3            A.    This your --

         4            Q.    Sure.  Whatever you've looked at is

         5     entirely work results of Agent Martz, correct?

         6            A.    As far as I know, yes.

         7            Q.    Now, Agent Martz did three different

         8     types of tests to determine whether or not the blood

         9     on the socks and the back gate could have come from a

        10     purple-top-test tube; isn't that true?

        11            A.    I thought one type, but tell me what that

        12     is.

        13            Q.    Let's go through that.

        14                  He did, and as Mr. Blasier pointed out,

        15     we can use shorthand like LCMSMS, can't we, as one of

        16     the kinds of --

        17            A.    Yeah, LCEMSMS.

        18            Q.    The electro spray is the E?

        19            A.    Yes.  Part of --

        20            Q.    He did an LCEMSMS test in the positive

        21     ion mode, correct?

        22            A.    That's correct.

        23            Q.    And he also did an LCESMSMS test in the

        24     negative ion mode correct?

        25            A.    I honestly don't recall.

        26            Q.    You don't recall?

        27            A.    Yeah.  But I --

        28            Q.    We'll get to it.
 


                                                                   161
         1            A.    It was positive ion.

         2            Q.    He also did it in the negative-ion mode.

         3     Do you remember that?

         4            A.    No, I don't.  But it's not unlikely.

         5            Q.    Okay.

         6                  And he also did something called an HPLC

         7     test, didn't he?

         8            A.    I didn't think he did an HPLC test to

         9     rule in or rule out EDTA, just to check the LC, that

        10     it would work, because it's part of the -- you know,

        11     first you have to establish that the compound has a

        12     retention and LC; then you can go ahead with the other

        13     thing.

        14                  I wasn't aware that he was doing actually

        15     analysis for EDTA in the materials --

        16            Q.    All right.

        17            A.    -- by LC.

        18            Q.    You don't remember that, but I'll show

        19     you.

        20                  MR. LAMBERT:  Why don't we put this up on

        21     the Elmo, please.

        22

        23                         (The instrument herein referred to

        24                         as chart dated 2/19/95 RE: EDTA

        25                         analysis was marked for

        26                         identification as Plaintiffs'

        27                         Exhibit No.561.)

        28
 


                                                                   162
         1                         (Exhibit 561 displayed on the Elmo

         2                         screen.)

         3            MR. LAMBERT:  This is a chart done by Agent

         4     Martz; it's Exhibit 561.

         5            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Perhaps this will help

         6     you remember this, Doctor.

         7                  This is a chart that's out of focus right

         8     now.

         9            MR. FOSTER:  It's getting there.

        10            MR. LAMBERT:  Getting there.  A little more.

        11     See if you can get me these numbers down here, Steve.

        12     (Indicating to Elmo screen.)

        13                  That's good.  We can do it a part at a

        14     time.

        15            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  This is a chart,

        16     Doctor, of -- that you've seen before, which is a bar

        17     graph done by Roger Martz to show his test results of

        18     these evidence samples and the known samples in the

        19     negative ion mode of the LCESMSMS test.

        20                  And you remember, Doctor, that he tested

        21     for both back gate and the socks known samples; that

        22     is, samples of blood that contain EDTA as if they came

        23     from a purple-top tube, correct?

        24            A.    Yeah.  I don't recall that it was

        25     negative ion, but fine.

        26            Q.    Okay?

        27            A.    Fine.  That's all right.

        28            Q.    Trust me, it is.
 


                                                                   163
         1            A.    Yeah.

         2            Q.    So on this negative ion test, he got

         3     these very large results showing the presence of EDTA

         4     in the two known samples.  Do you recollect that,

         5     Doctor?

         6            A.    Yeah.  He had known amounts of blood that

         7     he processed, and that's what he got from it.

         8            Q.    And he used that to establish how EDTA

         9     in -- in blood from a purple-top-test tube would look

        10     on his system, correct?

        11            A.    If he took that amount of blood that he

        12     used in the analysis, yes.

        13                  If you take less, you see less; if you

        14     take more, you take more.

        15            Q.    Now, move the chart over a little bit.

        16            A.    Um-hum.

        17            Q.    And then these are the two charts for the

        18     evidence samples that he tested in the negative ion

        19     mode.  And you'll recall now, won't you, Doctor, that

        20     he found no evidence that of EDTA at all in a negative

        21     ion mode, correct?

        22            A.    No, I don't recall that.

        23            Q.    You don't remember that?

        24            A.    I mean, you know.

        25            Q.    You've just forgotten that part of it?

        26            A.    I -- it's been a year and a half since I

        27     looked at all of these, and --

        28            Q.    All right.  Well, Agent Martz will come
 


                                                                   164
         1     out and tell us about that later.

         2                  Let's now go to the next one.

         3                  This is another chart that Agent Martz

         4     put together, and this is from that second test that

         5     he did the -- which I -- maybe we'll remember now --

         6     the AHPLC test.

         7                  And again, Agent Martz had got the same

         8     kind of results when he did the HPLC test; that is,

         9     very clear, distinct EDTA results from the known

        10     samples; no EDTA in the two evidence samples.

        11                  Do you remember that, Doctor?

        12            MR. BLASIER:  What's the number on that?

        13            MR. LAMBERT:  That number is 566.

        14            THE REPORTER:  the previous one.

        15            MR. FOSTER:  561.

        16            A.    That isn't quite how I remember.

        17                  May I tell you how I remember?

        18            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  You answer my

        19     questions, and you can have Mr. Blasier ask the

        20     questions later.

        21            A.    That's not how I remember.

        22            Q.    So you don't remember Roger Martz saying

        23     that he tested for EDTA in the HPLC test and got

        24     completely negative for EDTA?

        25                  You don't remember that?

        26            A.    I remember it differently.

        27            Q.    Okay.  We'll have Agent Martz testify

        28     about that.
 


                                                                   165
         1            MR. BLASIER:  Objection.  Move to strike the

         2     commentary.

         3            THE COURT:  Sustained.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Now, you do recall the

         5     third kind of test was the so-called positive ion test

         6     in the LCESMSMS mode, right?

         7            A.    Yes.  That's one that I was asked to

         8     review for this occasion.

         9            Q.    So that's the only one that you

        10     recollect, sitting right here, now?

        11            A.    I reviewed it, so naturally, I recollect

        12     it.

        13            Q.    Say again?

        14            A.    I reviewed it for this occasion, and so I

        15     recollect that, but. . .

        16            Q.    Okay.  You don't remember the other stuff

        17     as well because it's been a long time?

        18            A.    I didn't review it, so I can't tell you I

        19     don't remember.

        20            Q.    All right.

        21                  Now, and again when he ran his test in

        22     the positive ion mode, he ran both known samples

        23     containing EDTA and these two evidence samples,

        24     correct?

        25            A.    Yeah.  He did them differently, though.

        26     He ran them, but differently.

        27            Q.    Well, he ran known samples and he ran

        28     evidence samples.  True?
 


                                                                   166
         1            A.    But differently.

         2            Q.    Okay.  Well, we'll get to that.

         3                  And when he ran them, it produced some of

         4     those little grafts like you were shown by

         5     Mr. Blasier?

         6            (BY MR. LAMBERT)  This is 562.

         7            THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  What was this?

         8            MR. LAMBERT:  That one was 566.

         9

        10                         (The instrument herein referred to

        11                         as six test charts collectively

        12                         was marked for identification as

        13                         Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 562.)

        14

        15                         (The instrument herein referred to

        16                         as chart dated 2/23/95 RE: EDTA

        17                         analysis was marked for

        18                         identification as Plaintiffs'

        19                         Exhibit No. 566.)

        20

        21            MR. LAMBERT:  These look familiar.

        22            MR. FOSTER:  566 on the monitor now.

        23            MR. GELBLUM:  The first one is 561.  The second

        24     read paragraph is 566.

        25            THE COURT:  This is not a third one, it's the

        26     second.

        27            MR. FOSTER:  This is the second.

        28            MR. GELBLUM:  The witness has the third.
 


                                                                   167
         1            MR. BLASIER:  May I see that?

         2            MR. LAMBERT:  I'm going to put them on the --

         3            A.    Yes.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  These are a couple of

         5     the graphs.  These happen to be for Q206 and the

         6     control for Q206, K67, right, Doctor?

         7            A.    Yeah, the positive control.

         8            Q.    The positive control.

         9                  Let me show them to Mr. Blasier so he

        10     knows which one I'm talking about.

        11                  Let's put up first the test result for

        12     the evidence item.

        13                  Now, this is one of the test results that

        14     you have pointed to, to establish that your you

        15     believe EDTA could be in this particular evidence

        16     sample.  Correct, Doctor?

        17            A.    Not quite.  I said I believe it was in

        18     the particular evidence sample.  It could be.

        19                  And it actually was.

        20            Q.    Okay.  So you believe that this actually

        21     establishes that EDTA is present?

        22            A.    In my opinion, yes.

        23            Q.    And this is where they were testing at

        24     for the 160 ion, correct?

        25            A.    The daughter ion, yes.

        26            Q.    The daughter ion?

        27            A.    This is the total ion.

        28            Q.    And this is the -- is this one of the
 


                                                                   168
         1     critical tests, from your perspective, to determine

         2     EDTA is present in this evidence sample?

         3            A.    It's one of them, both of them are,

         4     really.  They're equally important.

         5            Q.    And all of this stuff that we see right

         6     here, that's noise, isn't it?

         7            A.    That's correct.

         8            Q.    So this particular peak that you're

         9     seeing for the evidence sample is very close to the

        10     noise in this test?

        11            A.    No.  Heavens, no.

        12            Q.    It's -- well, there are many scientists

        13     who will say the peak should be at least three times

        14     the height of the noise, true?

        15            A.    For what purpose?

        16            Q.    For determining whether a peak should

        17     even be called a peak, Doctor.

        18            A.    Well, not anymore, that's not the

        19     standard way of measuring noise, by comparing noise

        20     with signals as such.  But you use a statistical

        21     approach.

        22            Q.    Um-hum.  What's your statistical

        23     approach?

        24            A.    That you average this noise.  And when

        25     you do that, you get an average and variations around

        26     it.

        27                  And the unit of variations is called a

        28     standard deviation.
 


                                                                   169
         1                  And what you're -- what you look for --

         2     at least what I look for, and my colleagues look for,

         3     is three standard deviations above noise is an

         4     acceptable detection limit.  In some cases, two

         5     standard units.

         6            Q.    In case -- did you actually do the

         7     calculations and running all that out?

         8            A.    Huh?

         9            Q.    Did you actually do the calculations of

        10     the standard deviation in this case?

        11            A.    Well, only roughly, because I have no

        12     numbers.  I had to measure those peaks.

        13                  But Yes, I did.

        14            Q.    And what were they?

        15                  You calculated them?

        16            A.    Yeah.  I don't know.

        17                  But this was much more than three times

        18     the standard deviation.

        19            Q.    We'll get to that.  Let's take a look --

        20            THE COURT REPORTER:  What was that number

        21     first?

        22            MR. LAMBERT:  These are both 562.

        23            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  This is the same test

        24     run on the unknown sample.  True, Doctor?

        25            A.    I beg your pardon?

        26            Q.    This a test run on the known sample?

        27            A.    This a positive control --

        28            Q.    Right.
 


                                                                   170
         1            A.    -- with a known amount of blood and a

         2     known amount of EDTA.

         3            Q.    Right.

         4                  And here there's reason for noise on this

         5     chart, right, Doctor?

         6            A.    That's correct.

         7            Q.    And that's because this peak is really

         8     way, way larger than the peak to -- for the evidence

         9     sample, isn't it?

        10            A.    Yeah.  What he put on there is just

        11     totally beyond -- beyond that.  Certainly, I mean, the

        12     amount that he put on is so much more than the

        13     evidence sample that it swamps all the noise.

        14            Q.    You weren't there at all 'cause -- you

        15     weren't there?

        16            A.    I beg your pardon?

        17            Q.    You don't -- you weren't there; you don't

        18     know whether he put on more or not?

        19            A.    Yes, he did.  He said how much he put on.

        20            Q.    How much -- what he put on?

        21            A.    He put how much EDTA actually went on

        22     that sample to make it a positive control.

        23            Q.    He put the amount of EDTA on that sample

        24     that would be found in blood from a purple-top-test

        25     tube?

        26            A.    Yes.

        27            Q.    Now, this is --

        28            A.    But he put --
 


                                                                   171
         1            Q.    -- now?

         2            A.    -- no, no.

         3            Q.    I want you to answer my question.

         4            A.    No.  The answer is no.

         5            Q.    The answer is no.  Fine.  All right.  Let

         6     it be no, then.

         7                  Now, this peak is way higher than the

         8     peak in the evidence sample; isn't that right?

         9            A.    Of course.

        10            Q.    And the machine automatically calibrates

        11     itself to take into account the difference in peak

        12     height, doesn't it?

        13            A.    It ratios itself, yeah, yes.  This is 100

        14     percent.  Whatever that is, and it's a lot.  So any

        15     small amount can just disappear below it.  It would be

        16     less than 1 percent or something like that.

        17            Q.    So let me show you another chart.

        18            MR. LAMBERT:  This will be the next in order.

        19            THE CLERK:  2294.

        20

        21                         (The instrument herein described

        22                         as a comparative chart was marked

        23                         for identification as Plaintiffs'

        24                         Exhibit No. 2294.)

        25

        26                         (Exhibit 2294 displayed.)

        27

        28            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Now, this is a chart,
 


                                                                   172
         1     where we have now placed on this chart both the

         2     information from the known sample that we know

         3     contains EDTA, and the information from the evidence

         4     sample, okay?

         5            MR. BLASIER:  May I look at this just a second?

         6

         7                         (Pause.)

         8

         9            A.    Yeah, that's an artificial on the --

        10     okay.

        11            MR. BLASIER:  Could I have him look at it

        12     directly because it's difficult to see the numbers.

        13            MR. LAMBERT:  Yeah.

        14                        Maybe you have a copy.  I'll put it

        15     back on this chart that's been prepared by Detective

        16     Terry Lee from the City of Hope who the jury will be

        17     hearing from shortly.

        18            MR. BLASIER:  Move to strike the comment.

        19            MR. LAMBERT:  It is --

        20            MR. BAKER:  Could we get a ruling instead of

        21     dialogue?

        22            THE COURT:  Just a minute.

        23                  Are you representing that you're going to

        24     lay foundation on that?

        25            MR. LAMBERT:  Yes, I am.

        26            THE COURT:  You may inquire as to that but you

        27     may not describe who did it or why.

        28            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  What this is, Doctor,
 


                                                                   173
         1     is a chart that contains all of the information from

         2     those that we just saw, that is the evidence sample,

         3     Q206, and the control, all charted on one graph, okay,

         4     rather than on separate graphs.

         5            A.    But it's not because in the other ones

         6     there are numbers attached to this, both as to

         7     retention and to peak height and to area.

         8            Q.    We have numbers right over here and

         9     numbers right up here.  (Indicating.)

        10            A.    Well, yeah, I don't see any numbers for

        11     this.

        12            Q.    Right here?

        13            A.    Or for this.

        14            Q.    Well, this is the one I'm going to ask

        15     you about, this Q206.

        16            A.    May I see it again?

        17            Q.    Okay.

        18            A.    Okay.

        19            Q.    Okay.

        20            MR. LAMBERT:  Let me put this back up on the

        21     Elmo.

        22            MR. BLASIER:  Do you have an extra copy of

        23     that?

        24            MR. LAMBERT:  I don't.

        25            A.    I'd like to have it while you ask

        26     questions.

        27            MR. BLASIER:  Your Honor, we have not seen it.

        28            THE COURT:  Well, go stand over there so you
 


                                                                   174
         1     can see it, Mr. Blasier.

         2

         3                         (Indicating to go to the Elmo

         4                         screen.)

         5

         6            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  The truth of the matter

         7     is, Doctor, that the evidence sample tested by Roger

         8     Martz is showing this level of a peak compared to the

         9     control sample; isn't that true?

        10            A.    Yes.

        11            Q.    It's a huge difference?

        12            A.    Compared to EDTA blood from a tube.

        13            Q.    Right.  There's a very dramatic

        14     difference between the two?

        15            A.    About 15 fold, 15 times less blood found

        16     here than up there, so you expect --

        17            Q.    15 times?

        18            A.    Less.

        19            Q.    EDTA?

        20            A.    No, less blood.

        21            Q.    Well, you don't know that, Doctor, do you

        22     Doctor?

        23            A.    Yes.  I mean it if it's EDTA blood it has

        24     to be 15 times less.  In one case it's half a cc.  In

        25     another case it's 15 times less.

        26            Q.    Well, Doctor, you're just guessing at

        27     that, aren't you, there's nothing at all in Roger

        28     Martz's test results that lead you to that conclusion
 


                                                                   175
         1     at all, is there, Doctor?

         2            A.    He didn't have any idea of how much blood

         3     he used, but if this is supposed to be EDTA blood,

         4     then it is merely 15 times less of the blood than the

         5     other one.  If you take less blood, you get a smaller

         6     peak.

         7            Q.    Or this could be not blood from a purple

         8     top test tube, correct, Doctor?

         9            A.    It could be mixed blood, yeah.  It could

        10     be anything.

        11            Q.    Exactly.  And this we know is blood from

        12     a purple top test tube?

        13            A.    So I'm assuming, certainly.

        14            Q.    It could be there's a lot of explanations

        15     for it.  One explanation you're trying to give is that

        16     the quantification wasn't done properly?

        17                  I'm asking you.

        18            A.    No.

        19            Q.    You're not giving us an answer.

        20            A.    That is not the explanation for this.

        21            Q.    When Roger Martz says that's what he

        22     did --

        23            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, hearsay.

        24            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        25            Q.    When Roger Martz says that what he did to

        26     be sure that the amount of blood that he used in the

        27     evidence sample was actually greater than the amount

        28     of blood he used in the control sample, you're saying
 


                                                                   176
         1     that he must have been wrong?

         2            A.    He didn't know what he was doing.  He

         3     never measured the evidence sample blood so he doesn't

         4     know how much he put on there, whether that is 1100

         5     drops or 150.

         6            Q.    So you're saying he is wrong?

         7            A.    He is wrong.

         8            Q.    And he's got to be wrong at least 10

         9     fold?

        10            A.    15.

        11            Q.    15 fold?

        12            A.    If this is EDTA blood.

        13            Q.    You're assuming it is.

        14                  It might not be, this might not be,

        15     right?

        16            A.    Well, this is blood with EDTA in it.  He

        17     didn't know how much blood he analyzed here, he knows

        18     how much he analyzed there, so he can't say

        19     anything --

        20            Q.    But it might not be blood from a purple

        21     top test tube because it isn't a mountain, it's a

        22     molehill, isn't it, Doctor?

        23            A.    Look, this might not be blood from a

        24     purple top test tube.

        25            Q.    What might this one?

        26            A.    The other one but you tell me it is, so I

        27     accept that.

        28            Q.    Good.  Accept that.
 


                                                                   177
         1            A.    I don't know where this came from.  All

         2     I'm saying is that most commonly, EDTA blood comes

         3     from an EDTA test tube.

         4            Q.    Right.

         5                  And if it is blood from an EDTA test

         6     tube, and if Roger Martz is correct as to the

         7     quantities that he used, then this molehill should be

         8     a mountain, and it's not?

         9            A.    Well, I can't make two assumptions based

        10     on each other, but if permitted to, then if both these

        11     things are true, then that is true.

        12            Q.    Okay.  Thank you.

        13                  And you don't know yourself, of your own

        14     personal knowledge, whether Roger Martz is correct or

        15     incorrect in his statement that he used less blood

        16     here than he did there?  You don't know that of your

        17     own personal knowledge?

        18            A.    That he used less blood?

        19            Q.    Less blood for the evidence sample than

        20     he did for the control, you don't know?

        21            A.    Less blood?

        22            Q.    Yes, sir.

        23                  You don't know of your own -- no, I'm

        24     sorry, more blood from the evidence sample than the

        25     control sample, you don't know of your own personal

        26     knowledge whether he's right or wrong about that?

        27            A.    Yes, I know from my own personal

        28     knowledge, from studying what he has done, that he's
 


                                                                   178
         1     absolutely wrong, he has no idea how much blood he

         2     used there, he can't have any, he never measured it.

         3            Q.    Well, he didn't measure it the way you

         4     would measure it, right?

         5            A.    He didn't measure it, period.

         6            Q.    Well, he -- no, he did measure it, and in

         7     the sense -- sense that he took swatches of different

         8     sizes making sure he used a smaller swatch for the

         9     control, true?

        10            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, argumentative.

        11            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        12            A.    That's -- I believe what he did is he

        13     took swatches of different sizes.

        14            Q.    Right?

        15            A.    No, actually, he made lots of different

        16     sizes.  That's what he -- what I remember, blood dots

        17     of different sizes.

        18            Q.    Right.  And then he also testified and,

        19     you will recollect this, I'm sure, sir, 'cause you

        20     heard him say it, that he looked at this blood and

        21     determined that this blood had a consistency that was

        22     sufficiently strong, it was dark red blood, it wasn't

        23     diluted blood, that he felt comfortable that this --

        24     the evidence sample had more blood in it than the

        25     control.

        26            MR. BLASIER:  Objection.  This is not a

        27     question.

        28            A.    That's not what I recall.
 


                                                                   179
         1            THE COURT:  Excuse me.

         2                  It's overruled.  If that's testimony that

         3     this witness has been knowledgeable about in forming

         4     his opinion, I think it's permissible examination.

         5            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Now, you will agree,

         6     Doctor, that what you are seeing for the evidence

         7     samples on these runs --

         8            A.    Um-hum.

         9            Q.    -- that could be something other than

        10     EDTA all together, it could be another compound, true?

        11            A.    Well, it can always -- it's possible.

        12            Q.    True or false?

        13            A.    15 million compounds.

        14            Q.    True is the answer?

        15            A.    It's possible.

        16            Q.    True?

        17            A.    Yes.

        18            Q.    It could be something else?

        19            A.    But unlikely.

        20            Q.    In your opinion.

        21                  Secondly, it could be that this evidence

        22     sample contained trace amounts of EDTA not from a

        23     purple top test tube, but from some other source all

        24     together, true?

        25            A.    I can't think of any other source, but if

        26     you name one I can tell you whether I consider it

        27     possible.

        28            Q.    What about contamination in the
 


                                                                   180
         1     laboratory; that's possible?

         2            A.    With what?  With EDTA?

         3            Q.    Yes?

         4            A.    Yeah, it --

         5            Q.    Okay.

         6            A.    That's what I mean as one possibility.

         7                  I think it's unlikely for a variety of

         8     reasons.

         9            Q.    Well, let me ask you this, Doctor, is it

        10     true that Agent Martz tested his own unpreserved

        11     blood?

        12            A.    Yes.

        13            Q.    Yes.  And he --

        14            A.    That's what I mean -- that's what he

        15     showed me, yes.

        16            Q.    And when he tested his own unpreserved

        17     blood --

        18            A.    Um-hum.

        19            Q.    -- he got a result just like the evidence

        20     sample, didn't he?

        21            A.    Not only just like it, but if you measure

        22     it, it's exactly the same.  You couldn't tell the

        23     difference by shape, form or noise.  That's what

        24     puzzles me about it.  It looks exactly like the

        25     evidence sample.  It doesn't look like any blood that

        26     I've ever seen and that I know of that was normal

        27     blood from a normal person.

        28            Q.    And he tested more than one time, his own
 


                                                                   181
         1     blood, true?

         2            A.    Yes.  I don't know how often.

         3            Q.    Yeah, and he got -- he got results very

         4     much like this evidence sample?

         5            A.    Exactly like it.  If you look at it, you

         6     can't tell the difference.

         7            Q.    And you -- your testimony, Doctor, is

         8     that that is an impossible result, correct?

         9            A.    In my opinion, yes.

        10            Q.    He --

        11            A.    God willing, anything is possible, but,

        12     you know, totally improbable.

        13            Q.    He could not have the amount of EDTA in

        14     his own blood that you say that test shows; isn't that

        15     right?

        16            A.    Not if he hasn't injected himself with

        17     EDTA or somehow or other contaminated it because

        18     that's about -- according to both some recent work and

        19     this, that would be the amount there, you couldn't see

        20     that unless you had a ton of blood and extracted it,

        21     because the amount that's here is -- is several

        22     micrograms.

        23                  The amount that you would find in a

        24     normal person is somewhere in the parts per billion.

        25     This -- whatever it was, had to be parts per billion

        26     because you can't detect it at parts per billion.

        27            Q.    So Agent Martz got the very same kind of

        28     results that he got from the evidence sample out of
 


                                                                   182
         1     his own blood and you say that couldn't possibly

         2     really show EDTA in his own blood, true?

         3            A.    I'm as reasonably certain as I can be,

         4     scientifically, and on the basis of everything that's

         5     been published and presented, that it is virtually

         6     impossible for him, if he has normal blood, to have

         7     EDTA in it, but you can see by this method --

         8            Q.    Right.

         9                  And isn't it true, Doctor, that a very

        10     likely explanation for the test results showing this

        11     level of what would be EDTA in Roger Martz's own blood

        12     is that there was some EDTA left in his instrument

        13     when he tested his own blood, that's what's creating

        14     this ghosting effect; isn't that true, Doctor?

        15            A.    No, it is absolutely not true, because if

        16     you look at the sequence prior to this, that the run

        17     prior to it didn't show if you're running this blank,

        18     after that you might get it.  Not much more because I

        19     said up to 10 percent, and this is actually 15 percent

        20     of what you have here.

        21            Q.    Well, Doctor, let me --

        22            A.    I'm sorry 15.

        23            Q.    In your personal experience, you using

        24     the electro spray equipment?

        25            A.    Um-hum.

        26            Q.    Can't you have contamination that appears

        27     sometimes and doesn't appear other times; isn't that a

        28     common phenomenon with the electro spray equipment?
 


                                                                   183
         1            A.    Only after you had a strong positive you

         2     get a weak positive sometimes in the next injection.

         3     You don't get it somewhere the next day or something.

         4            Q.    Well, let me ask you this, Doctor.  How

         5     many hundreds of times have you used the electro spray

         6     equipment with tandem mass spectrometry?

         7            A.    Did I say I used it tons of times?

         8            Q.    How many times have you used it?

         9            A.    I've used it outside of our facility

        10     maybe half a dozen times.

        11            Q.    Since when?

        12            A.    And -- excuse me.

        13                  And we obtained this instrument and after

        14     it was set up I've gone to maybe 20, 30 runs.

        15            Q.    20 or 30 runs?

        16            A.    Yes, that's about right.  But I also have

        17     studied the literature on it.

        18            Q.    And that's with LCESMSMS, right?

        19            A.    Yes.

        20            Q.    You have that in your lab now?

        21            A.    I have two -- well, I have one LCMSMSMSMS

        22     and one LCMS.

        23            Q.    And you've just gotten those since the

        24     criminal trial?

        25            A.    Oh, yes, relatively recently.

        26            Q.    And you had all these opinions before you

        27     even got those in your lab, true?

        28            A.    Yeah, well, that's the literature,
 


                                                                   184
         1     experience, this is not something new.

         2            Q.    Well, the whole question of this issue of

         3     ghosting during the process is something that people

         4     that operate the machine day in and day out are going

         5     to know a lot about; isn't that true?

         6            A.    What are they going to know a lot about?

         7            Q.    The phenomenon of ghosting that takes

         8     place in this process is something that experienced

         9     operators of the machine are going to know a lot

        10     about, true?

        11            A.    They certainly should, yes.

        12            Q.    And you're not an experienced operator of

        13     the machine, are you?

        14            A.    Well, I'm not, but I know a lot about it,

        15     too.

        16            Q.    Well, you're somebody that's testified in

        17     court a lot; isn't that right, Doctor?

        18            A.    No, not because of that.

        19                  I've done an awful lot of LCM gas

        20     chromatography and ghosting occurs in all molds.  It's

        21     nothing special about this.

        22            Q.    And going back to the graph we have here

        23     with the mountain and the molehill, if Roger Martz is

        24     correct that he was using more blood in the evidence

        25     system than in the control sample, then you cannot

        26     tell this jury that this molehill is blood containing

        27     EDTA from a purple top test tube, can you, Doctor?

        28            A.    Well, I'm telling you he didn't -- he
 


                                                                   185
         1     couldn't have had any idea of how much blood he used

         2     in --

         3            Q.    Just follow -- just answer my question

         4     with my hypothetical.  If he's right --

         5            A.    If you bring it into the question.  Could

         6     you put that in there.

         7            Q.    Sure.

         8                  If Roger Martz is correct that he was

         9     using more blood in the evidence sample than he was in

        10     this control sample, is -- that is more in the

        11     molehill than in the mountain?

        12            A.    Um-hum.

        13            Q.    Then that molehill cannot represent blood

        14     from a purple top test tube, can it?

        15            A.    He can still do that if the EDTA degraded

        16     over the period of time since it was placed wherever

        17     it was.

        18            Q.    But you've done no experiment to

        19     determine how fast EDTA degrades, have you, Doctor?

        20            A.    Not how fast it degrades, but it does

        21     degrade.  It's a well known fact.

        22            Q.    You don't know at what rate it degrades

        23     at?

        24            A.    Well, in strong ultraviolet light like

        25     sunlight, pretty rapidly, but I haven't got any -- how

        26     fast I can tell you that.

        27            Q.    There's no literature in the forensic

        28     field showing how fast EDTA degrades in blood, is
 


                                                                   186
         1     there, Doctor?

         2            A.    It's not in the forensic field.  This is

         3     what is done in the environmental chemistry field,

         4     which really is forensic, but not like this, no.

         5            Q.    Isn't it the case, Dr. Rieders, that

         6     Agent Martz testified that -- excuse me, Agent Martz

         7     tested some other blood containing EDTA that was two

         8     years old, and he still obtained this mountain kind of

         9     result from that two-year old blood, true?

        10            A.    Oh, yeah, sure.

        11            Q.    So we know that it still shows up a

        12     couple years later, right?

        13            A.    If it's frozen in the dark, yes.

        14            Q.    So you're saying maybe environmental

        15     conditions might somehow explain how this mountain

        16     turned out to be a molehill; is that what you're

        17     saying?

        18            A.    No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.

        19                  I'm saying if Roger Martz is correct that

        20     the amount of blood that he used to get that little

        21     molehill down there was less than the amount of blood

        22     that he used, if he's correct in that, where he got

        23     the mountain then that blood, the little molehill

        24     blood, came from an area that was outdoors, dry, wet

        25     when it rained, exposed to the sun, exposed to the

        26     elements, and then it was collected, and it is during

        27     that period that it meets the condition of the

        28     degradation that has been tested in EPA world.
 


                                                                   187
         1            Q.    You're saying it may be another

         2     explanation for how the mountain gets down to the

         3     molehill?

         4            A.    No, I don't think so.  I think my

         5     explanation is much more correct.

         6            Q.    This one you're looking at right here,

         7     these are the socks, Doctor, these socks were

         8     collected the day after the murders, they were in a

         9     laboratory freezer in the serology department at LAPD,

        10     weren't they?

        11            A.    I understand they were not in the

        12     laboratory freezer, but that's beside the point.

        13            Q.    They were.  They weren't out laying

        14     around getting rained on, were they?

        15            A.    No, not the socks, as far as I know.

        16            Q.    Yeah?

        17            A.    Certainly not.

        18            Q.    And, in fact, the results that Roger

        19     Martz got from both the socks and the blood on the

        20     back gate were just about the same, weren't they?

        21            A.    No, if you look at the chromatogram, they

        22     differ.

        23            Q.    Not much, though, right?

        24            A.    Well, we don't know how much blood was

        25     used.

        26            Q.    But the chromatograms don't differ much,

        27     do they, they're pretty similar?

        28            A.    Yes, they are.  They are --
 


                                                                   188
         1            Q.    Right?

         2            A.    -- pretty similar in the noise level,

         3     too.

         4            Q.    And those two items, the blood from the

         5     back gate, blood from the socks, they were subject to

         6     very different environmental conditions, weren't they,

         7     Doctor, yes or no?

         8            A.    I expect, yes.

         9            Q.    Okay.

        10                  So doesn't sound like the environment is

        11     the explanation for how that mountain got into that

        12     molehill, does it, Doctor?

        13            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, argumentative.

        14            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        15            A.    I didn't say that.

        16            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Okay.

        17            A.    It could well be, nevertheless.

        18            Q.    Well, a lot of things could be, right,

        19     doctor?

        20            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, argumentative.

        21            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        22            A.    Well, reasonably could be.

        23            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Now, one of your

        24     complaints about the work done by Roger Martz,

        25     apparently is that he did not specifically quantify

        26     the way you would have done it, the amount of blood

        27     that he's testing; is that right?

        28            A.    It's not a complaint.  What it is, is it
 


                                                                   189
         1     leads me to my conclusions about what was done and

         2     that nobody knows how much blood was used, and

         3     therefore you don't know what the concentration was.

         4            Q.    And because you don't know what the

         5     concentration is, you can't really determine whether

         6     this little molehill really is a mountain or just a

         7     molehill; is that right?

         8            A.    On here it's a molehill.  The amount of

         9     blood it represents, I don't know, and it could be

        10     such a smidgen, that indeed, that's why it's a

        11     molehill.

        12            Q.    Or it could be, as Agent Martz said, more

        13     blood than the control and that means it's not blood

        14     from a purple top tube, true?

        15            A.    Probably.

        16            Q.    Right?

        17            A.    But very unlikely.

        18            Q.    Okay.

        19                  That's -- we'll get to that.

        20                  Isn't it true that since the time of the

        21     criminal trial, that Dr. Kevin Ballard has developed a

        22     specific methodology for testing for EDTA in blood,

        23     and quantifying the amount of EDTA in blood?

        24            A.    He had that before.  I know Ballard.

        25            Q.    Yes.

        26            A.    He presented it since then at the

        27     meeting.

        28            Q.    Yeah.
 


                                                                   190
         1                  And Dr. Ballard is another expert

         2     retained by Mr. Simpson, true?

         3            A.    Yes, he was.

         4            MR. BLASIER:  Your Honor, I'm going to object.

         5            A.    At least as far as I know.

         6            THE COURT:  Just a minute.

         7            MR. BLASIER:  I'm going to object and ask to

         8     approach, please.

         9            THE COURT:  Okay.

        10

        11                         (The following proceedings were

        12                         held at the bench with the

        13                         reporter.)

        14

        15            MR. BLASIER:  Your Honor, I expect Mr. Lambert

        16     is going to be asking questions about testing that

        17     Mr.-- Dr. Ballard may or may not have done.  I have no

        18     knowledge of that.  It would be inappropriate for

        19     Mr. Lambert to make any kind of argument to that

        20     effect, that we were going to do testing, we didn't or

        21     we did testing.  Dr. Ballard is one of our

        22     consultants.  He's not going to testify.  So I would

        23     object to this line of questioning.

        24            MR. LAMBERT:  What I did ask, Your Honor, is if

        25     Dr. Ballard has developed the methodology for doing

        26     these tests different methodology, employed a valid

        27     methodology that he could do the test to make a

        28     specific determination as to whether this blood came
 


                                                                   191
         1     from a purple top test tube or not, that he has the

         2     capacity to do that.

         3                  I will then argue to the jury, as I'm

         4     entitled to do, that they have an expert in their

         5     employ who could do these tests, who they could have

         6     had do the specific test, and he can do this.

         7                  The jury can make whatever inference they

         8     want from that.

         9            MR. PETROCELLI:  Specific instruction on best

        10     evidence available.

        11            THE COURT:  A little bit familiar with best

        12     evidence instruction.

        13            MR. PETROCELLI:  I bet you are.

        14            THE COURT:  Objection overruled.

        15                  You may approach to that extent.  You may

        16     not go beyond.

        17            MR. LAMBERT:  I won't ask him about tests he

        18     did.

        19            THE COURT:  Okay.

        20

        21                         (The following proceedings were

        22                         held in open court in the presence

        23                         of the jury.)

        24

        25            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Before we go back to

        26     Dr. Ballard, let me ask you a couple of clarification

        27     questions, Doctor.

        28                  The only evidence items that you are
 


                                                                   192
         1     aware of that ever got tested for EDTA were the ankle

         2     area of the sock and the back gate, true?

         3            A.    I think there was also some pieces of

         4     clothing of Nicole Brown Simpson tested.

         5            Q.    All right.

         6                  They tested her dress; is that right?

         7            A.    Dress, right.

         8            Q.    They actually found a little bit of EDTA

         9     in the material of the dress?

        10            A.    Yes.  That wasn't surprising.

        11            Q.    'Cause EDTA is a very common chemical

        12     that is used in a lot of different ways in our

        13     society, right?

        14            A.    Yes, it is.

        15            Q.    And aren't there something like 50

        16     million pounds of EDTA manufactured a year?

        17            A.    I don't know.

        18            Q.    Huge amount.  It's in paint, it's in

        19     food, it's in all kinds of things?

        20            A.    That's correct.

        21            Q.    Now, so the only evidence items you know

        22     of are this one from the sock, the one from the back

        23     gate, and her dress; is that right?

        24            A.    Yes, I think that's all.

        25            Q.    And no other area on the sock other than

        26     this center cut-out that Mr. Blasier showed you in his

        27     little graph?

        28            A.    As far as I know, yes.
 


                                                                   193
         1            Q.    Okay.

         2                  Now, let's go back to Dr. Ballard.

         3                  Dr. Ballard was present in court when you

         4     testified at the criminal trial?

         5            A.    Some of the time I believe.

         6            Q.    Present when Roger Martz testified, true?

         7            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, irrelevant.

         8            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         9            A.    I -- I don't recall that.  It may have

        10     been.  I really didn't pay that much attention.

        11            Q.    He was an expert retained by Mr. Simpson

        12     at that time, true?

        13            A.    I -- as far as I know, yes, he was

        14     retained by -- whether Mr. Simpson or one of the

        15     lawyers, I don't know.

        16            Q.    And Dr. Ballard has published his own

        17     methodology for testing for EDTA in blood and

        18     specifically quantifying the amount of EDTA, true?

        19            A.    Well, for testing for it and also

        20     measuring it certainly.

        21            Q.    It's a different method than Roger Martz

        22     used, isn't it?

        23            A.    It's gas chromatography instead of liquid

        24     chromatography.  In gas chromatography you don't use

        25     electro spray.

        26            Q.    He has developed -- synthesized in his

        27     own laboratory, an internal control that aids in

        28     quantifying the levels of the EDTA that he finds in
 


                                                                   194
         1     blood?

         2            A.    Yes.

         3            Q.    All right.

         4            A.    A radioactive carbon label.

         5            Q.    So he now, in his laboratory, is

         6     perfectly capable of making a precise determination

         7     whether this molehill is just a molehill or a

         8     mountain; isn't that right?

         9            A.    If he has the information about how much

        10     blood it came from, yes.  Otherwise he's no better off

        11     than Roger was.

        12            Q.    Well, he can take evidence samples that

        13     still exist from the back gate and the socks and run

        14     the tests himself, can't he, Doctor?

        15            A.    I don't know that.  I see no reason why

        16     not, but I can't tell you that.  You have to ask him.

        17            Q.    Well, he's certainly done tests on other

        18     evidence items that you've seen published, haven't

        19     you?

        20            A.    Not on evidence items.

        21            MR. BLASIER:  Objection.

        22            A.    Whatever I've seen published is

        23     researched.

        24            Q.    Okay.

        25                  But based on that research, you certainly

        26     believe he would be capable of performing such a test,

        27     correct, Doctor?

        28            A.    Yes, I think so.
 


                                                                   195
         1            Q.    All right.

         2                  Well, since he's capable of performing

         3     such a test, and since he also is an expert for

         4     Mr. Simpson, why isn't he here in court instead of you

         5     speculating about these things?

         6            THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.

         7            MR. BLASIER:  Move to strike.

         8            THE COURT:  Stricken.

         9                  Mr. Lambert, you knew you weren't

        10     supposed to go into that.

        11            MR. LAMBERT:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.

        12            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  Let me ask you about

        13     something else then, Doctor.  And we're almost

        14     finished.

        15                  Let me ask you -- before we get to my

        16     last area, let me ask this:  How much have you been

        17     paid by Mr. Simpson so far?

        18            A.    Total?

        19            Q.    Yeah.

        20            A.    For the criminal trial, I really don't

        21     know, I think we got about $5,000 from the bill.  I'm

        22     not sure.  It's done by our CFO.  This one we received

        23     a retainer check, I think it was $10,000.

        24            Q.    Wasn't the criminal trial more like

        25     20,000, Doctor?

        26            A.    I don't think we received that.  I don't

        27     know.  I mean, to tell you the truth, I know it was a

        28     fraction of the total bill that has been settled so
 


                                                                   196
         1     far.

         2            Q.    Okay.

         3                  There's still some owed?

         4            A.    I think the total bill was 46.  I don't

         5     know.  Don't ask me.  I don't do the billing.

         6            Q.    Let me ask you just this one final area

         7     then, Doctor.

         8                  I want you to assume that the blood on

         9     the socks is Q206, we see up here?

        10            A.    I'm sorry, is what?

        11            Q.    I want you to assume that this blood from

        12     the socks, Q206, the evidence sample we're talking

        13     about, right, I want you to assume that that blood

        14     could only have come from being splashed on the socks

        15     while they were being worn by the killer during the

        16     murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, or was later placed on

        17     the socks out of the reference vial of Nicole's blood

        18     removed from her body at autopsy.

        19                  Okay?

        20            A.    I understand.

        21            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, compound, two

        22     different hypotheticals.

        23            MR. LAMBERT:  I'm not done.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  I want you to assume

        25     that fact, that the blood could only have come from

        26     one of two places; it was splashed on the socks while

        27     the killer was wearing them or it was later placed on

        28     the socks out of the reference vial taken at her
 


                                                                   197
         1     autopsy, that that is an EDTA reference vial, okay?

         2            A.    Okay.

         3            Q.    Could only have come from one of those

         4     two places.

         5                  I want you to further assume that

         6     Dr. Robin Cotton --

         7            A.    Let me make a note because I'll --

         8            Q.    Okay.

         9            A.    -- want to keep it straight.

        10            Q.    Go right ahead.

        11

        12                         (Witness writes on piece of paper

        13                         at witness stand.)

        14

        15            A.    That's assumption one.

        16                  Now the next assumption.

        17            Q.    Okay.

        18                  You got that?  The blood only came from

        19     one of those two places?

        20            A.    Yes.

        21            Q.    Next, I want you to further assume that

        22     Dr. Robin Cotton of Cellmark Diagnostics, a forensic

        23     microbiologist and DNA expert, studied the DNA in the

        24     socks and the DNA in the reference vial from the

        25     autopsy and concluded that the blood on the socks

        26     could not have come from the blood in the reference

        27     vial because the DNA in the blood in the reference

        28     vial was substantially more degraded than the DNA in
 


                                                                   198
         1     the blood in the socks.

         2            MR. BLASIER:  I'll object to that.  That

         3     misstates --

         4            A.    There are too many -- there is more than

         5     one question in here.  I won't be able to answer you.

         6            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  I want you to assume

         7     that set of facts, that Dr. Cotton has done that study

         8     and made that conclusion.

         9            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, that misstates her

        10     testimony.

        11            MR. LAMBERT:  It doesn't, Your Honor.

        12            MR. BLASIER:  Irrelevant, hypothetical.

        13            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        14            Q.    (BY MR. LAMBERT)  So --

        15            A.    Let me make sure I understand what you

        16     said.

        17                  You said that it has been testified that

        18     the blood in the tube was more degraded than the blood

        19     on the sock?

        20            Q.    Yes.

        21            A.    Okay.

        22            Q.    You got that?

        23            A.    Yes.  Let me note that down.

        24                  Okay.

        25            Q.    So you -- in making the opinions that you

        26     gave here today, Dr. Rieders, you did not take into

        27     account the conclusions of Dr. Cotton in regard to the

        28     DNA levels in the blood and the reference vial, did
 


                                                                   199
         1     you?

         2            MR. BLASIER:  Objection, misstates her

         3     testimony, it's argumentative.

         4            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         5            A.    Of course not.  Why should I?  It has

         6     nothing to do with it.

         7            MR. LAMBERT:  I have no further questions, Your

         8     Honor.

         9            THE COURT:  Redirect.

        10

        11                      REDIRECT EXAMINATION

        12     BY MR. BLASIER:

        13            Q.    Dr. Rieders, isn't it accurate that the

        14     negative ion mode, which is the charts that you

        15     examined and testified to, is by far the most

        16     sensitive test between positive ion mode and just

        17     straight HPLC?

        18            A.    In most cases, yes.  Not always, but in

        19     most cases.

        20            Q.    Is it also accurate that it was the Los

        21     Angeles District Attorney's office that decided which

        22     two stains to test for EDTA?

        23            A.    That what?

        24            MR. LAMBERT:  Objection.

        25            Q.    It was the Los Angeles District

        26     Attorney's office that decided which stains to test

        27     for EDTA and which to not test.

        28            THE COURT:  Overruled.
 


                                                                   200
         1                  If you knew.

         2            A.    That's what I was given to understand but

         3     I certainly have no contact with them to know that.

         4            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Is it also accurate

         5     that Roger Martz never had testified in the criminal

         6     trial that his results were the results of the

         7     ghosting?

         8            A.    Of ghosting?

         9            Q.    Yes.

        10            A.    No, that -- that he said afterwards.

        11            Q.    Okay.

        12                  And did he also make a statement of

        13     trying to substantiate that experimentally and not

        14     being able to do it?

        15            MR. LAMBERT:  Objection, calls for hearsay.

        16            THE COURT:  You may inquire as to what he did

        17     that would establish that.

        18            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Well, let me ask you

        19     this:  Do you have any personal knowledge that he was

        20     ever able to substantiate that explanation?

        21            MR. LAMBERT:  Objection, calls for speculation.

        22            THE COURT:  Overruled.

        23            A.    No, I have no such knowledge, never said.

        24            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Now, in fact, did

        25     Dr. Ballard -- that Mr. Lambert asked you questions

        26     about, since the criminal trial, did he do a study to

        27     determine whether or not a human being would have

        28     levels of EDTA in their blood of the same amount as
 


                                                                   201
         1     found in these evidence stains?

         2            A.    Yes.  Essentially, yes, he reported that

         3     at the mass spectrometer meeting.

         4            Q.    What -- did his study conclude whether a

         5     person would have naturally occurring EDTA in their

         6     blood at this level?

         7            MR. LAMBERT:  Hearsay, Your Honor.

         8            THE COURT:  Overruled.

         9            A.    He testified that in, I think it was

        10     20 --

        11            THE COURT:  Excuse me.

        12                  This is still -- there's no explanation

        13     as to what he's testifying --

        14            MR. BLASIER:  I'm going -- asking about a

        15     study.

        16            Q.    (BY MR. BLASIER)  Are you aware of a

        17     study that he did?

        18            A.    Yes, he did.

        19            Q.    And one of the questions he was looking

        20     at was to try and find out whether or not a human

        21     being just picked at random would have levels of EDTA

        22     in their blood naturally occurring equivalent to the

        23     levels found in this case?

        24            A.    That's what he put his method to the test

        25     to, on some 20 people I believe.

        26            Q.    And what was the conclusion?

        27            A.    Not a trace found.  That means way below

        28     his detection limit, which is in the parts per
 


                                                                   202
         1     billion, by the way, so that it's exact.  Pretty much

         2     the same that they found in the 50's with their

         3     radioactive label material.

         4            Q.    Now, when Mr. Lambert asked you whether

         5     there could be another compound that had the same

         6     characteristics of this, how many organic compounds

         7     are there that we know of?

         8            A.    I said presently registered about 15

         9     million compounds with the American Chemical Society.

        10            Q.    And did Roger Martz attempt to locate a

        11     compound that might have the same characteristics as

        12     EDTA?

        13            A.    He said yes, he did, he did look through

        14     various data bases for something that's like it.

        15            Q.    And are you aware of any compound other

        16     than EDTA that has the characteristics that were

        17     revealed in Agent Martz's test?

        18            A.    I looked and -- I don't.  And I looked

        19     too.

        20            MR. BLASIER:  That's all I have.

        21            MR. LAMBERT:  I have nothing further.

        22            THE COURT:  You may step down.

        23            MR. LAMBERT:  I'd like to move, if I could,

        24     561 --

        25            THE CLERK:  Wait, wait, wait.

        26            MR. LAMBERT:  Sorry.

        27            THE COURT:  You may step down.

        28            THE CLERK:  Go ahead.
 


                                                                   203
         1            MR. LAMBERT:  561, 566 and 2294.

         2            MR. BLASIER:  I would move in 1208, 1215, 1216,

         3     1218, 1219, 2292 and 2293.

         4            THE COURT:  All received.

        17            THE COURT:  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're

        18     going to be adjourning until January the 6th.

        19                  I want to restate the admonition that I

        20     gave to you earlier.

        21                  That you not allow yourself to be

        22     influenced by anything that you may hear outside of

        23     this courtroom, or see outside of this courtroom with

        24     regard to this case.

        25                  You must only be relying upon the

        26     evidence as you will learn it through the trial

        27     process and the law that the Court will give to you at

        28     the end of the case.
 


                                                                   205
         1                  You must not conduct any research on your

         2     own.

         3                  You must not permit others to address you

         4     about anything connected with this case.

         5                  On occasion, the Court is aware that

         6     there may be people around the courthouse that may

         7     make an effort to display themselves or somehow convey

         8     something to those persons who are involved in this

         9     trial that may possibly include you.  You're not to

        10     permit yourself to be influenced by anything like that

        11     that you may occasionally come across.

        12                  In this case, we are trying specific

        13     aspects of what occurred underlying the circumstances

        14     of this case.

        15                  We have heard at one stage or another

        16     that there was another proceeding ongoing in another

        17     county, Orange County, that has to do not with our

        18     case specifically, but with regard to Mr. Simpson and

        19     the children.  And I am bringing this to your

        20     attention because in the two weeks or so that you will

        21     be away from the court, it is entirely possible that

        22     you will be inadvertently exposed to some accidental

        23     or inadvertent exposure to news casts or broadcasts or

        24     whatever.

        25                  You are instructed that whatever happens

        26     in any other case involving Mr. Simpson and/or the

        27     children has nothing to do with this case.  The issue

        28     involved in that matter has nothing to do with our
 


                                                                   206
         1     case.

         2                  Our case is fact specific and is

         3     dependent only upon the evidence that we receive in

         4     our case, and you must not be influenced by whatever

         5     anybody says, whatever anybody does with regard to any

         6     other matter outside of this trial.

         7                  This is a very important point.

         8                  Everybody understand that?

         9                  (The jury panel nodded affirmatively.)

        10            THE COURT:  Don't allow yourself to be exposed

        11     to any such information.  If you see a headline in the

        12     newspaper or you inadvertently see it on television,

        13     switch it off.

        14                  Do not permit yourself to be influenced

        15     by those things.  Okay.

        16                  And over this long course of the holiday,

        17     I hope that it refreshes you, but at the same time, I

        18     am making every effort to make sure that you not allow

        19     yourself to be subtly or inadvertently or otherwise

        20     influenced by what friends or relatives or others may

        21     say to you during your period of absence in connection

        22     with your service on this case.  Okay.

        23                  It's very important that you -- while

        24     people may know you're on this case, I don't know if

        25     they do or not, but you are instructed that you're not

        26     even to tell them that you are on this case, confirm

        27     it or anything.  You have absolutely no comment with

        28     regard to this case.
 


                                                                   207
         1                  Everybody understand that?

         2                  (The jury panel nodded affirmatively.)

         3            THE COURT:  I appreciate your patience and hard

         4     work and being here every day.  We get late starts

         5     often because we have matters that we have to address

         6     outside of your presence.  These are legal matters

         7     oftentimes that should not ever be a matter of concern

         8     for the jury.  Okay.  You are only concerned with what

         9     you actually get through the trial process.  Whatever

        10     else occurs outside of your presence, that is not

        11     before you in the case.

        12                  Everybody understand that?

        13                  (The jury panel answered affirmatively.)

        14            THE COURT:  Okay.

        15                  I hope to see all 16 of you back

        16     January 6.

        17                  Stay in good health.  Enjoy the holidays.

        18                  And every day bear in mind the admonition

        19     I have given you, okay.

        20                  Thank you very much, and you're excused

        21     until January 6, 8:30.

        22            JURORS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

        23

        24                         (Jurors exit courtroom.)

        25

        26                         (The following proceedings were

        27                         held at the bench with the

        28                         reporter.)
 


                                                                   208
         1

         2            THE COURT:  Mr. Baker, with regards to what you

         3     were concerned about, Julius -- Vicki, my regular

         4     bailiff, informs me that the two deputies who escort

         5     the two elevator jurors are the two bailiffs right

         6     behind you.  And they indicated to her that the

         7     incident that you were concerned with did not happen.

         8            MR. BAKER:  Okay.

         9            THE COURT:  So I've also reinforced --

        10            MR. BAKER:  You have.

        11            THE COURT:  -- their attentiveness to the

        12     potential of such a problem so --

        13            MR. BAKER:  That's --

        14            THE COURT:  I want to reassure you of that.

        15            MR. BAKER:  Thank you.  I appreciate that.

        16            MR. PETROCELLI:  Your Honor, have a happy

        17     holiday.

        18            MR. BAKER:  Have a good holiday.

        19            MR. PETROCELLI:  We'll see you on January 6.

        20                  You too, Gina.

        21            THE COURT REPORTER:  Thank you.

        22

        23                         (The following proceedings were

        24                         held in open court outside the

        25                         presence of the jury.)

        26

        27            THE COURT:  One announcement I'd like to make.

        28                  Ladies and gentlemen in the media, you
 


                                                                   209
         1     are ordered not to bring in any audio or other

         2     broadcast equipment into this courtroom.  You're

         3     not -- you're allowed to be here.  You don't have the

         4     right to broadcast out of this courtroom.

         5                  Everybody understand that?  Okay.  Thank

         6     you.

         7

         8                         (At 4:03 P.M. an adjournment was

         9                         taken until Monday,

        10                         January 6, 1997 at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
DECEMBER 18, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1996
8:59 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. BAKER: I'd ask to address you Your Honor because Mr. Kelly had
indicated to me, they wanted to put Mr. Acosta on, the witness who was
a hold-over; they couldn't get him in here for the plaintiffs' portion
of the trial.

They want to put him on, on Friday. And I asked him to delay that and
put him on sometime when we come back after the Christmas break.

He wouldn't agree to that. I want to address Your Honor on that. We
have witnesses lined up for Friday, and we obviously want to put our
witnesses on. And after we come back, there should be no problem
putting on Mr. Acosta in one of the break times.

MR. PETROCELLI: The issue with regard to Mr. Acosta, Your Honor, you
will recall he was served some time ago, and he left on this
unexpected trip. And he's now back in town.

And he's a 15-minute witness. And I'm just concerned about not having
him back in this courtroom. And we've made contact with his wife; he's
back in town. We wanted to call him tomorrow or Friday, just to get
him in and out. He's -- tomorrow we're not in session, and we were
shooting for Friday. He's a 15-minute witness.

They have two witnesses lined up for Friday. We can get him in and
out. My concern is, if we wait until the new year, after the two-week
break, I don't know whether we're going to see him.

THE COURT: Where does he reside?

MR. PETROCELLI: I think he resides near Long Beach, that area. I'm
guessing.

THE COURT: Well, again, then I think he should be available.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you saw what happened with Mr. Kelly.

THE COURT: I don't want to interrupt the defense case.

MR. PETROCELLI: When are we going to be able to put him on?

THE COURT: You didn't ask him when you were supposed to have him.
We're doing you a favor by allowing you to put him on at a later time.

MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly.

THE COURT: You'll put him on when the defense finishes.

MR. PETROCELLI: When they finish their case?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: When is that going to be?

MR. BAKER: You will know when it occurs.

(Laughter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: How about a little advance notice?

THE COURT: Well, Mr. Baker, you indicated you think you might finish
about the first or second week after we get back.

MR. BAKER: That's correct, yes. I'd like to call Daniel Gonzalez to
the stand.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have no jury.

MR. BAKER: Need some jurors.

MR. LEONARD: Waive jury?

THE COURT: That was the only issue?

MR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

THE CLERK: I want to put something on the record.

Defendants have indicated to me this morning that Defense Exhibit 2250
is the same exhibit as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 228, so they are
withdrawing 2250 and using 228.

(The instrument herein referred to as Defendants' Exhibit 2250 was
withdrawn.)

DANIEL GONZALEZ, the witness on the stand at the time of the
adjournment on Tuesday, December 17, 1996, having been previously duly
sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Morning, Officer Gonzalez.

A. Morning, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JURORS: Morning.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, we were -- when we ended the day yesterday, we
had discussed your being at the Rockingham location.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 116.

(Exhibit No. 116 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. And the fact that you were there about 0520 in the morning; is that
right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And by the way, when you, in fact, filled out the statement form
that is in your handwriting, that was pursuant to a request of whom?

A. Excuse me.

Detectives Ron Phillips and Mark Fuhrman.

Q. And those detectives you were familiar with before you ever went to
both the Bundy and Rockingham addresses on the night of June 13, 1994,
correct?

A. I knew that they were detectives; that is true.

Q. You work West L.A., they work West L.A.?

A. That is true, sir.

Q. Now, you, in arriving there at 0520 in the morning, you say -- you
said yesterday that you saw a Westec vehicle, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you say you only saw -- well, strike that.

When you saw the Westec vehicle, did you see any unmarked police car
in the area?

A. You know, I'm trying to get the specifics. When I arrived, I did
not initially see an unmarked vehicle. There was one eventually parked
on -- well, that diagram doesn't show it.

Q. Where was it parked?

A. Oh, no. Excuse me. It does -- it looks a bit different on the --
that would be the southeast corner on Rockingham and Ashford, there
was a -- one unmarked vehicle there.

Q. Parked here or here?

On the Ashford --

A. On the second place you were pointing, on Ashford Street, right
there. Correct. Yes.

(Mr. Baker indicating to Exhibit 116.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) There were detectives at Rockingham before you got
there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And all four of the detectives at Rockingham, before you got there,
none had gone over the wall?

A. Nobody had gone over the wall.

Q. And you were privy to the conversations about going over the wall,
were you not?

A. Oh, absolutely. Yes, sir.

Q. And you heard the conversations, this concern about, perhaps Mr.
Simpson was inside his house, bleeding or dying. You heard that
conversation?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you heard the conversation that somebody else might be in
there, the subject of a murder, a kidnapping or some other crime,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You heard all that conversation, and then you heard
who tell Fuhrman to go over the wall?

A. That's an interesting point. I don't remember who -- I don't
remember who exactly determined who was going over the wall at that
point.

Q. After Fuhrman would went over the wall --

Did you see Fuhrman go over the wall?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you see him go inside --

How many times did he go over the wall, come in and outside that gate,
before the gate was ultimately opened?

A. I only recall once.

Q. Do you recall him going over the gate and then opening the gate at
that time?

A. Correct.

He jumped over that north gate, and then he unlatched -- I believe it
was the -- I want to say the left, but the west-east gate, I guess.
There's only one gate. I can't remember if it's one or two, actually.
But he went to the left side where there was a motor, and he was able
to unlatch it and open it.

Q. Astin, your partner, was with you all this time?

A. He was at the scene, but whether he was by my side or not, I don't
remember how much he was by my side.

Q. Were there any other --

When you arrived at Rockingham and parked your vehicle over by the
Bronco, you didn't see Fuhrman over there then, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. You then went around by the Ashford side, and that's when you came
in contact with Fuhrman, right?

A. Well, actually, they were in front of the Westec car, and that was
parked almost to a 90-degree angle, actually, almost perpendicular to
the corner there.

And on that -- that southeast corner, this -- we're showing there, he
was parked basically perpendicular in the middle of the street.

That's where the detectives were when I arrived; that's when I first
came in contact with the detectives.

Q. And then you had a conversation with -- with Fuhrman, didn't you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And Fuhrman was the detective who had told you that there was some
evidence on the Bronco, right?

A. He didn't describe it as evidence immediately, but yes.

Q. He was the one who pointed out to you that there was something on
the Bronco, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you were of the view, by the way -- strike that.

You then were interviewed by Detective Ron Phillips sometime after
September of 1994, and gave another statement in addition to the one
in your handwriting, did you not, sir?

A. Geez, I've been interviewed a whole bunch much of times. I'd have
to see if there's a written statement with an interview, with his
name. I'd have to see that.

I mean, he might have interviewed me. I don't know how many formal
interviews I've been to. I recall quite a few.

Q. Well, I want to you look at this typewritten interview again,
undated, and ask you if you recall being interviewed by Ron Phillips.

A. Can I take a moment to just peruse this?

Q. Take your time.

A. Okay.

(Pause for Mr. Gonzalez to review document.)

A. (Continuing.) Okay.

This seems to be some notes from an interview that I -- I had with
Detective Phillips, but I don't recall the interview.

Q. Well, you just told us before you read that document --

What's that number? Do we know?

THE CLERK: Typewritten notes?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

THE CLERK: I believe it's 1810.

THE COURT REPORTER: 1810?

MR. P. BAKER: 1800, but I better check.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told us before you wrote the typewritten
interview, you had other interviews; you had a lot of them?

A. Yes, I guess so. Well over half a dozen, it seems like, to me.

Q. Where are the documents from those formal interviews?

A. Those are in the District Attorney's office. I don't know. They
called me in there a couple -- few times, even once on the phone.

Q. Did they tape-record any of those interviews, to your knowledge?

A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. Did you have any interviews with the plaintiffs' lawyers before you
were called to the witness stand a week -- or you were called to this
courthouse a week and a half ago?

A. On interviews and testimony, no. I think more or less I've had,
with the attorneys themselves, is my appearing here and times, and
everything else, I've been in contact with them.

Q. You've been in contact with them relative to the statements that
you gave, have you not, Officer Gonzalez?

A. Well, somewhat, but not -- not this detailed.

Q. You're not telling this jury that you didn't discuss with Mr.
Medvene the issues that we're talking about right now in this
courtroom, are you?

A. No. I'm just trying to make it clear that I hadn't had any
complete, formal interviews with any attorney that would -- would
result in detailed notes such as this.

Q. But you don't --

What do you mean, a complete, formal interview? You talked about the
very item that we're talking about here; that is, your presence when
Fuhrman goes over the wall. Isn't that true?

A. I don't recall discussing Fuhrman going over the wall with the
attorneys, but I've talked to the attorneys. I talked with your
office, so. . .

Q. You talked with our office about scheduling only?

A. Correct.

Q. You didn't talk about anything of substance with our office?

A. No. I wasn't asked.

Q. No.

And in terms of this interview that you gave Ron Phillips, that was an
interview that you gave Ron Phillips after it came out that additional
blood was discovered in the Bronco on August 26, 1994; isn't that
true, sir?

A. See, where I have a problem with this --

Q. Look, I'm not asking you about your problem; I'm asking you one
specific question; can you answer it?

That interview was given after you knew that the LAPD was being
accused of planting blood in the Bronco, and additional blood was
found on August 26, 1994. True or untrue?

A. Gosh, I can't -- I can't answer that true or untrue. You're
misstating, kind of, what happened.

Let me back up.

You want me to answer?

Q. I'd be --

A. Let me answer the question.

This copy right here, I don't remember when that was taken. I've never
-- never seen that document before in my life. That's the first time I
have seen it.

I don't know when the interview occurred with Ron Phillips. I don't
remember having an interview with -- with me and him taking notes, or
he didn't tape-record or anything, as far as I know. I can't tell you
when that interview occurred. I couldn't tell you if it was before or
after any accusations were ever made.

Q. Let me ask you this --

A. Okay.

Q. You've now read it, taken a little time?

A. Right.

Q. Anything in here untrue?

A. Well, I'd have to take some time to completely -- you want to give
me about three or four minutes here? I'll completely read the whole
thing.

Q. I want you to read it and tell me if anything in that document is
inaccurate.

A. Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the question is compound.

It's a two-and-a-half-page document. We'd suggest any specific
question he can ask the witness, but it's unfair to give him a
three-page document to go through and comment on.

It's a compound question.

THE COURT: Read it.

THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.

(Pause for Mr. Gonzalez to read document.)

THE WITNESS: Can I make a note on this if I find something that needs
to be addressed?

MR. BAKER: I'll give you one that's not marked.

THE WITNESS: Great.

MR. BAKER: And a pen?

THE WITNESS: Thank you very much, sir.

(Pause for Mr. Gonzalez to resume reading document.)

THE WITNESS: Okay. I've read it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right. And have you noted where you believe
there are perhaps errors in this document?

A. Correct. There are approximately one, two, three, four errors.

Q. All right. Now, if Detective Phillips testified that that interview
was done in January of 1995, after the criminal trial started, you
would not dispute that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That is correct.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And certainly, you were aware by January of 1995,
the Los Angeles Police Department had, in fact, been accused of
planting evidence in the Bronco; isn't that true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right.

And you were aware of that when you gave that interview to Detective
Ron Phillips, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right.

Now, let's go down to --

MR. BAKER: Have we got one more of these so that they can have one?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) While he's doing that, let me ask you a preliminary
question.

When you did your handwritten interview, Officer Gonzalez, you wanted
to include everything that you could recall about your experiences the
night of June 13, 1994, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And -- pardon me. That's --

You then put in the document that you hand-wrote, because by the time
you hand-wrote that document, some two or three weeks after the
incident, you were aware that the Simpson case was exceedingly high
profile, true?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. I don't want to mislead you, because I'm talking now about this
document.

A. Right.

Q. Your handwritten document.

A. Right.

Q. And I see you turning pages on 1800, the typewritten document.

A. Okay.

Can you rephrase that, or -- not rephrase it, but just say it one more
time. I want to make sure I answer that correctly.

Q. When you hand-wrote the document --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- that is, your statement of what you did on June 3, 1994, you
were aware that the Simpson case was exceedingly high profile,
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were aware that O.J. Simpson had been arrested and
incarcerated, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were aware that there was -- the district attorney had issued
press conferences relative to his beliefs concerning Mr. Simpson's
guilt or innocence, correct?

A. You mean Garcetti?

Q. That's who I mean.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were aware that it was a daily report in the newspapers,
virtually every day and on every television channel, correct?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And you knew the importance of putting everything in your statement
that you saw or heard on the night of June 13, 1994 that had any
significance whatsoever to the case, true?

A. Correct.

Q. And in your statement, you indicate -- that is the first statement
-- let's call them number 1 and number 2 -- you indicate nothing about
playing with the Akita dog. You would agree with that?

A. I agree with that.

Q. You included and --

MR. BAKER: Put that up on the typed --

MR. P. BAKER: Handwritten?

MR. BAKER: The typed, please.

THE COURT REPORTER: Which exhibit is that?

MR. P. BAKER: It's 1800.

(Exhibit No. 1800 is displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER)

(Reading:)

Gonzalez played with the Akita dog while

it was at the northeast corner of

Dorothy and Bundy. The dog had been

tied up at pole at that location.

Gonzalez noticed that the dog's paws

were soaked in possible blood. The dog

did not appear to be bleeding.

Did you tell Detective Ron Phillips that or words to that effect in
January of 1995, sir?

A. Well, like I said, I don't have an independent recollection of --
of that interview. But it's possible I told him something to that
effect.

I just want to clarify. This looks more like notes than it does my
personal statement.

Q. Would you --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. If the Court please, objection to the
document. The document is a hearsay document that the witness said --
that the witness said that he did not review and never saw. We don't
think it should be shown.

He can certainly ask him questions about it.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this document was identified by Detective
Phillips during his examination, it's my recollection, here in this
courtroom.

And I can certainly bring Detective Phillips back and go over it
again. But I don't think that that's necessary.

MR. BLASIER: It's authenticated.

MR. BAKER: Can you give us the page that is authenticated?

MR. BLASIER: It's October 29, page 193.

THE COURT: Can I see it?

MR. BAKER: We'll have to show it to you on the computer. We don't
bring every volume; we just put the disc in and load it up to the
computer.

THE COURT: I just want to see it.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's in evidence?

MR. FOSTER: Not moved in.

THE COURT: The document been moved in?

MR. FOSTER: Not in evidence.

THE COURT: Let me see it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Just referred to.

MR. GELBLUM: What was the page number?

(Pause for the Court to read document.)

MR. BLASIER: 193.

(A bench conference was held which was not reported.)

THE COURT: Okay. It's a report that was authenticated by that witness.
It's filed as part of the report. The witness is here for examination.

MR. BAKER: And I move that into evidence, Your Honor, Exhibit 1800.

THE COURT: Received as a business record.

(The instrument herein referred to as Officer Gonzalez' handwritten
report was received into evidence as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1800.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Now, Phil, would you please put the top of that document so we can see
it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) This says statement of Daniel H. Gonzalez, number
27592.

That is you, is it not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Interview conducted by Detective 3 Ron Phillips, 12914.

Now, it was an interview conducted by Ron Phillips, and your
statement, correct?

A. That's what the document says, then that's what the document says,
correct. Correct.

Q. And you have no reason to disbelieve that, true?

A. No. I have no reason to disbelieve it.

Q. You then, in your typewritten document, notice that the dog's paws
were soaked in possible blood, correct?

A. Okay.

I want to make it real clear, 'cause I'm listening very carefully to
the words that you use. And we went through this yesterday.

And I'm not trying to be nit-picking, but this is -- obviously, we're
nit-picking about certain facts. And when you use words like "my
document," it kind of goes back to "visualization" yesterday, and I
have a problem with that.

This isn't my document. I didn't write this document. He says the
interview happened. The interview must have happened. I've talked to
him. I've talked to him before; I talked to him at the scene. I've
talked to a lot of people.

This is a document about an interview with me. These are his notes.
These are what he said I said.

Now, I have some dispute with this, that is true; so you want to go
over this, we can go over this. That's not a big deal.

Q. We're going to.

A. Okay.

Q. Did you tell Ron Phillips, in January of 1995, that the dog's paws
were soaked in possible blood? Yes or no?

A. No.

Q. Never said that?

A. That's not -- I did not say possible blood; I said they were soaked
in blood.

Q. Okay.

And did you also tell him that they appeared -- the dog did not appear
to be bleeding?

A. I told him that, also.

Q. And did you play with the dog while it was tied at the northeast
corner of Dorothy and Bundy?

A. No, I did not.

Q. You did not tell him words to that effect?

That's totally flat wrong?

A. I did not use the word "play." If he thinks that I said play, then
he is mistaken. That's true; that is wrong.

Q. Did you tell him that you played, or words to that effect, with the
Akita dog while it was tied up at the northeast corner of Dorothy and
Bundy?

A. No, I didn't. He misunderstood.

Q. So that's just wrong?

A. That is.

Q. Correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay. Fair enough.

Now, you --

MR. BAKER: Put it over to page 2.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You just omitted any reference to the dog whatsoever
in your statement form that you gave a couple weeks after the crimes.
You have not one word about a dog, about blood, about anything
relative to that dog in your statement form, do you?

A. That is true.

Q. Just forgot that when you were trying to put in everything that was
important, two weeks after the crimes had occurred, and you knew about
the importance of the case, correct, just forgot it?

MR. MEDVENE: Question argumentative. Object, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, I didn't -- I might have forgotten to write it. I didn't
forget it didn't happen (sic). There were plenty of people who saw the
dog. I'm not the only one who saw the dog tied with the rope with
blood on his paws.

Q. I didn't ask you if there were plenty of people. I asked, you
forgot to put it in because you didn't think it was important.

A. Well, what I -- whether I thought it was important or not, that
definitely is an argument. But I did not put it in because I -- I
simply forgot. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, let's go to the typewritten report of January '95 at page 2,
paragraph 2, or first full paragraph on page 2.

It says: After Gonzalez arrived at the Rockingham location, he was met
by Detective Fuhrman, who took Gonzalez to a Bronco parked on
Rockingham.

Is that true?

A. That is true.

Q. So the minute you get there, Fuhrman takes -- you meet him, he
takes you to the Bronco that is parked on Rockingham, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. That's 5:20 in the morning, right?

A. Yes, sir. I think we agreed on that time, correct.

Q. Well if you look at your typed -- your handwritten report, you
arrived there at 5:20. So that's just after you arrived, correct?

Right here, second full paragraph. (Indicating.)

A. That's true; right after we arrived.

Q. And he takes you right down to the Bronco, and he pointed out red
stains on the Bronco, right?

A. See, I would never use that term, "red stains." So that's when --
what Detective Phillips -- that's how he interpreted that. But I never
would have used those terms, "red stains."

Q. After you just had the opportunity in court to correct this
document, that is not a paragraph you corrected at all, is it, sir?

A. That is true.

Q. Did or did not Fuhrman take you to the Bronco and point out what
you believe was blood, or did he tell you was blood on the Bronco?

A. He told me it was blood; it looked like blood; and I believed it
was blood.

Q. And he pointed out a stain on the Bronco near the driver's door
handle, right?

A. Right above the door, driver's door handle. And.

Q. And looked like a fingerprint to you?

A. Correct.

MR. BAKER: Put it up.

MR. P. BAKER: 109.

(Exhibit No. 109 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That looked like a fingerprint to you, right?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. And you thought that that was blood, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And that is what, a quarter of an inch?

A. Appears to be a quarter of an inch, correct.

Q. And what about an eighth of an inch high, or width, rather?

A. Okay. I'll agree.

Q. And it's, of course, dark. It's 5:20 in the morning. The sun hasn't
risen?

A. Right.

Q. You conclude, after Fuhrman tells you it's blood, that it's blood?

A. Correct.

Q. You were on the force about how many years at that point in time?

A. I believe it was over four years at that point.

Q. And you thought that that was pretty ominous, huh? Something must
be going on in the house. You agreed with Fuhrman that this was a
dangerous situation, correct, based on that piece -- based on that
piece of evidence?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, goes to state of mind.

THE COURT: Any issue as to probable cause is sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, then you say you saw a stain near the running
board, and you used a flashlight because it was between the door and
the frame of the car, right?

A. I used --

Q. That's what it says, isn't it?

A. Yes, that's what it says.

Q. And, in fact --

MR. BAKER: You want to put up the picture of the interior of the
Bronco?

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order.

THE CLERK: 2276.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of inside of Bronco
vehicle was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2276.)

(Exhibit No. 2276 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you want to -- you want to show us, sir -- just
point to the area on the running board of this vehicle, or of the door
and the frame of the car -- show us the area between the door and the
frame of the car that -- that Fuhrman pointed blood stains out to you.

A. I'm going to approach.

Q. Sure.

A. The area should have been in -- the picture's not showing it --
right along this area right here, right along the door jam.
(Indicating.)

Q. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Now, you want to show a picture, Phil, of the Bronco?

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order.

CLERK: 2277.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of exterior of white
Bronco was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2277.)

MR. BAKER: You want to kind of zoom in on the door.

You want to zoom in on the door?

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You couldn't see anything between -- in the area
that you say was the running board of the vehicle, unless the door was
opened; isn't that true Officer Gonzalez?

A. No. Not true.

MR. BAKER: Let's go back to the other.

(Exhibit No. 2276 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The area you're talking about is an area where I am
pointing to a spot; isn't that true, sir?

A. I -- the area I'm pointing to, I don't recall exactly -- how do I
phrase this?

That's not true. That's that spot that I was looking at, I thought,
was just on the picture.

To tell you the truth, I don't see anything on that running board,
absolutely nothing on that running board. I can only tell you what I
saw that night. And it was between that door jam. But that, to me,
that's a clean running board. I don't see anything. (Indicating to
photograph.)

Q. The bottom side of the door of the Bronco has a rubber molding
around it, doesn't it, kind of a waterproof rubber molding, so when
you wash the vehicle, if you go through a car wash or a puddle or
something, water doesn't come into it? You've seen that?

A. Yes. I'm pretty familiar with the car.

Q. And you would disagree if Dennis Fung said there's no way you could
see any blood on that door sill unless the door was open? You disagree
with that?

A. I disagree.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, calls for
hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In fact, you got in the vehicle that night, didn't
you?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. Is there -- there's no way you could visualize what you put in your
report without opening the door to the vehicle; isn't that true, sir?

A. There's no way to get inside a locked vehicle. And what you're
saying is, I went inside a locked vehicle that we determined to be
evidence and I'm getting offended.

Q. You're getting offended?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Are -- you already determined that to be evidence at 5:20, when
Fuhrman marches you down there and points out that spot, you
determined that to be evidence already; is that right, sir?

A. Sir, we determined that to be evidence after we discovered that
nobody was home and they were supposed to be home.

Q. You didn't answer my question.

My question, sir, is: At 5:20, when you went down there with Fuhrman
and he gratuitously pointed out to you, Officer Gonzalez, this little
bitty piece of blood, and you say you can see blood on the door sill
that nobody else can see with -- with the door closed, that you're
offended that you already determined it was evidence; is that what
you're telling this jury?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor it's argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: The question -- Mr. Baker knows it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You also determined, Officer Gonzalez, that the car
was parked with the rear tire one to two feet from the curb, and the
front tire approximately one to two inches from the curb; is that
true?

A. That's true.

MR. BAKER: Show him that picture.

See if you're offended by this.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection to Mr. Baker's comments. Move to strike them.

THE COURT: Stricken. Jury to disregard it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, is that the Bronco as you saw it?

(Pause for Mr. Gonzalez to review document.)

MR. BAKER: Back it off, Phil, please.

MR. P. BAKER: Next --

THE COURT REPORTER: Next in order?

MR. P. BAKER: 2278.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph depicting parked
white Bronco was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2278.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's a couple feet from the curb, the rear tire?

A. That's a Bronco on the street, and you're going to have to prove to
me that's a picture of the Bronco taken at the scene before I say it
is.

Q. You wouldn't believe it because you wouldn't put in your report one
to two inches in front and one to two feet in the back. You wouldn't
lie in your report, would you, Officer Gonzalez?

A. I wouldn't lie in the report.

MR. BAKER: Show him the view from the front.

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order.

THE CLERK: 2279.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of front view of
white Bronco was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2279.)

(Exhibit No. 2279 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. That looks about an inch or two from the curb, does it?

Do you see the evidence van over there?

Does that prove to you that the vehicle wasn't parked one to two
inches in the front and one to two feet in the back?

A. Hum --

Q. Does it prove that to you, sir?

A. No, it doesn't.

I'm telling you, that thing was parked crooked. It was parked crooked
on that street.

Okay? That's what I saw.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's what you saw?

A. That's what you say.

Q. That's four or five inches, not one to two feet, is it?

A. From the curb. You're talking from the rain gutter or from the curb
itself?

We measured from the curb.

Q. You measured it?

A. No. That's how -- when I look at something, and you determine --
when you estimate how far something is, we determine by north, south,
east, west curbs. But that corner -- and if I approach, right near --

MR. BAKER: Show him the other.

A. (Continuing.) This corner right here is where we start from. I
would say something -- so many feet from the curb. This is where we
start.

So I don't see a problem saying that's a foot from the curb.

I see a problem saying this is a couple inches. Obviously, I'm
mistaken. I did not log any pictures. I have to go off my independent
recollection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That was one of the big issues, wasn't it, about --
that Fuhrman was showing you that the car was parked at this crooked
angle from the curb?

That was a big issue. You put that in your in both your reports, your
handwritten report and your type -- and Phillips' typed report, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That was one of many issues.

And if you want to take all the issues as big, then they're all big.

Q. Now, in addition, you --

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me --

MR. BAKER: What number is that?

THE CLERK: 2280. Next in order.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of white Ford Bronco
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2280.)

(Exhibit No. 2280 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. P. BAKER: We're putting 2036 on the board.

(Exhibit No. 2036 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Instead of a one- to two-feet difference, there's really about
four- to five-inches difference, isn't there, Officer Gonzalez?

A. No, sir.

Q. Well, the tires on that vehicle are about eight inches wide. One of
them's over the concrete apron about three inches, and one is
basically adjacent or an inch away from the concrete apron. You'd
agree with that, wouldn't you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And there's absolutely nothing illegal about the way that vehicle
is parked, is there, sir?

A. I never said the vehicle was parked illegally.

Q. Just answer the question.

There's nothing illegal about the way that vehicle is parked, is
there, sir?

A. No. No, there's nothing illegal about it.

Q. Now, you said in your written report that you were able to see in
that door sill, blood drops, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And so you were able to see in the slip that you say that you could
visualize blood behind this rubber insulation area of the door blood
drops, true?

A. True.

You're making it sound like the -- the insulation meets the door jam
at the very edge, and that is not the case on this door.

Q. So let me see if I got this right.

You're in a slit that is what, a thirty-second of an inch opening at
the bottom of the door jam?

A. I would say one-quarter to one thirty-second.

I'd have to look at the door to give you an exact measurement.

Q. It's at night, and Fuhrman has already taken you down there. And he
shows you these blood drops, right?

A. That's true, sir.

Q. And by the way, is there any code to cover up for other police
officers?

Is there any code of ethics like that, that you guys have?

A. I know what you mean. You want to know --

Q. Yeah.

A. Okay.

Q. Yeah, I really do want to know. Is there or is there not a code to
cover up for each other?

A. You get promoted for burning each other.

Q. Is there a code you adhere to for covering up?

A. I answered the question.

Q. Have you been promoted?

A. Well, no. I've -- what my --

Q. Thank you.

A. -- my rank right now is not really considered a promotion. Sergeant
and above.

Q. Now --

A. You have to work Internal Affairs, because -- before you can even
become a captain. That should explain something to you.

Q. I'm getting a lot of things explained to me.

A. Okay.

Q. Now. You then indicated, sir, in your written statement, that you
were able to visualize blood in the Bronco, correct?

A. Once again, I saw blood in the Bronco. I did not visualize nothing.
I saw.

Q. Well, tell us what blood you saw in the Bronco on the morning of
June 13, 1994.

A. Right now, from my independent recollection, I specifically
remember the bloody thumb print or fingerprint above the door handle.
And I remember two large drops on the center console.

Q. That's it?

A. Right now, from my independent recollection, we're talking about
something that happened a couple years ago, so there's some things I'm
going to remember pretty well and some things I'm not going to
remember so well. Things I --

Q. Now, the door in the Bronco, two drops on the center console. And
have you ever indicated that there was any more blood than that, that
you believe you observed on June 13, 1994?

A. Correct. Yes, I have.

Q. And when there was the big issue of whether or not the L.A. Police
department planted blood in that Bronco subsequent to June 13, 1994,
you told Officer Phillips that there was a smear on the inside of the
driver's door, right?

A. That is possible.

Q. It's not only possible; it's what you said. It's on page 4 put of
his written statement. Page 4.

A. Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: (Complies.)

MR. BAKER: No, Phil, the page 3. I'm sorry; I apologize. Page 3. Yeah.

MR. P. BAKER: Of 1800.

(Exhibit No.1800, page 3 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. You've had an opportunity to review this, you had an opportunity to
make any changes that you wanted in it, right?

A. I just pointed out some mistakes I found very obvious.

Q. So, you told Phillips that there was a smear on the upside of the
driver's door panel, right?

A. That, I believe, I possibly told him.

Q. You didn't have anything like that in your written statement that
was made a couple of weeks after the incident, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Then you said to Phillips that you saw blood on the driver's seat
as well, and you subsequently found out there is no blood on the
driver's seat, right, so now that's a mistake, isn't it?

A. Okay.

Nobody has ever discussed the conclusion of any of the evidence to me
since this case has began, ever.

Q. Can you answer my question?

A. I am answering your question.

Q. Did you tell Ron Phillips that there was blood on the driver's seat
or not?

A. No.

Q. He just put that in there, and you never said it, right?

A. That's not completely true.

MR. MEDVENE: Question argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told Phillips that there was -- you told
Phillips there's a smear on the steering wheel?

A. That's possible.

Q. Well, I didn't ask you if it was possible.

Did you tell him?

It's possible it's raining in here, but it isn't.

A. You're right. And it's possible I had an interview with him and
it's possible I didn't. I don't know. I don't remember this interview.
I can only tell you -- I can only testify what's on here. I can
testify to things that I know I did not tell him. How he read what I
was telling him is a whole different thing. That's up to him.

Q. I see.

So you don't know if you even discussed blood with him and you don't
know if pages 1, 2 and 3 of Exhibit 1800 were totally fabricated by
Ron Phillips?

A. No, I don't know if he had concluded this after maybe several times
I've talked to him or if he had taken my notes and added to them, but
I don't -- this is very detailed. And I would have remembered if he
sat down and wrote all this out.

Q. And if he said you had a detailed conversation -- I thought we
discussed this earlier -- in January of 1995, after the trial started,
and this document, Exhibit 1800, is a result of that interview, you
would not disagree with that?

A. I would not disagree. I would only dispute about the things he put
in here.

Q. Now, in terms of the smear on the steering wheel, did you tell him
that or not, or do you have any recollection of there ever being a
smear on the steering wheel?

A. Right now I have no independent recollection of that whatsoever,
but it's possible I might have told him there was a smear on the
steering wheel.

Q. Did you tell him there was two big drops on the center console?

A. That I vividly remember, I still remember that.

Q. Let me show you a photo that was taken on August 10, 1994 by the
Los Angeles Police Department.

MR. P. BAKER: 1420.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And tell us where the two big drops were?

You don't see them in that photo, do you?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Point out on that, if you can -- take the pointer and point out,
show us where these two big drops were?

A. Well, here's the center console and this -- the top, this -- that's
where they're going to have to be, somewhere around this area.

Q. Well, I thought you just told us, sir, maybe I'm mistaken, but I
thought you just told us that you had a specific recollection of these
two big drops?

A. That is true.

Q. Well, I take it if you have a specific recollection of these two
big drops, you have a specific recollection in your mind's eye, as you
sit here now on the witness stand, of the location of those drops, not
from one end to the other end of the console?

A. Well, you're only talking about what, 7 inches there, 8 inches, I
mean I can't -- I couldn't diagram for you and tell you exactly where
they are at.

You understand -- do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?

Q. Well --

A. They're on the same console, the two drops are on the center
console there on the top of the center console.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let the witness -- let the record reflect that the
witness is pointing to the center console where the door opens.

MR. BAKER: He wouldn't go from one end to the other.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, he pointed to the middle, to the center console.

A. The middle of the center console, right around here. It's not going
to be on the side, not on the back, it's going to be someplace on the
top.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) A Ford Bronco is a large sport utility vehicle,
right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the center console in a Ford Bronco is bigger, for example,
than the center console in almost every other car, isn't it?

A. Well, every other car that's smaller than a Bronco, sure.

Q. It's wider -- it's about a foot wide, isn't it?

A. I would argue that, and I'd possibly win.

Q. I doubt it.

A. I'd lay some money on that.

Q. How much?

This distance between the -- that's an indent, is it not?

A. Sure.

Q. And the material of that area is vinyl, right, plastic?

A. Plastic, correct.

Q. And you saw -- at least you have suggested here that you saw two
large drops, correct?

A. Correct, sir.

Q. And those drops you described as large in your statement that you
gave to Ron Phillips, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, you don't describe them as large in your handwritten
statement, do you?

A. I might have used big. I don't know what I used.

Q. Let me show you.

A. Okay.

Q. Did you use any descriptive phrase whatsoever in describing these
purported blood drops?

(Witness reviews document handed to him by Mr. Baker.)

A. No, I did not.

Q. Didn't say big, didn't say small, didn't say two, either?

A. If it makes you feel better about --

Q. I'm not interested in whether you think I feel better.

A. Okay.

Q. Now, you didn't describe any number, either, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. So six months later, you described two big drops on the center
console in your discussions with Phillips, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you can't tell us as you sit here today whether those drops --

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I don't want to keep interrupting you, but
you've made your point. Move on to the next part, okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You can't tell whether those drops were in the
indented area or not, true or untrue?

A. True.

Q. Now, you told Phillips there's a smear on the dashboard near the
steering wheel?

A. See, that's possible I told him that.

Q. You never mentioned that in your written statement either, did you?

A. I did not.

Q. Now, you said driver floor area; never mentioned that in your
written statement, did you?

A. Well, that I dispute also with Detective Phillips.

Q. Oh, so you didn't tell him about the driver's floor area, right?

A. I think he's misinterpreting what this -- he must have been playing
answer question with me, 'cause there's no way I said there's blood on
the driver -- you couldn't tell if there's blood on the driver floor
area.

Q. Now, I want to --

MR. BAKER: Phil, you can take that down.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I want to go back for a moment to where you were
located when Arnelle Simpson had come north around the house, then
been taken out towards the Rockingham gate and shown the Bronco on
Rockingham, okay?

A. Okay.

Q. Do you have a recollection where you were located when you heard
the officers inquire about the whereabouts of Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Where were you?

A. I can approach?

Q. Please.

(Witness approaches Exhibit 116.)

A. I was -- I would have been in this general area right around here.

Q. Okay.

A. This -- which is like -- shall I describe it for the record or do
you want to describe it?

Q. Go ahead.

A. Which would have been an area just south of Ashford and just south
of the Ashford fence and just west of the house on the -- probably in
the center portion of the grounds.

Q. Were you on the driveway?

A. I could have been on the grass, on the driveway, I --

Q. Close to that pathway that goes around the north side of the house?

A. Correct, in this general area right here, someplace around there is
where I was standing.

Q. As I understand your testimony, sir, your recollection is -- you
may resume your seat.

A. Thank you.

Q. Thank you.

You saw the detectives, don't recall which ones, you recall seeing the
detectives lead Arnelle out of her room and around the north path down
to an area where they could visualize the Bronco, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, this has been asked and answered yesterday.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Foundational.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You heard --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me.

Is there a ruling on the objection?

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You heard what was said from the time that the
detectives and Arnelle got into your view around the pool area, all
the way to the driveway, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, same objection, asked and answered yesterday.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never heard any detective have any concern as to
whether Mr. Simpson was in the house bleeding to death or not, did
you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay, asked and answered
yesterday, speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. You trying to say the detective didn't care if he was there?

THE COURT: No, it was a simple question. Answer the question yes or
no.

A. Geez, one more time. Just -- I'm confused whether you want --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Sure, I'll be --

A. I'm sorry.

Q. I want you to answer the question.

A. All right, I'll answer it yes or no.

Q. You were outside on Ashford when these discussions were taking
place about the concern over a possible crime, that Mr. Simpson could
be in the house dying, bleeding to death, and that was the reason they
went over the wall; you heard that, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I'll strike the entire question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You heard the discussions on Ashford that led to
Fuhrman going over the wall, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never heard one concern about anybody being in
the house when Arnelle Simpson was led from her room, around the north
pathway on the driveway, out to Rockingham, and led back into the
house, did you, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, asked and answered, state of mind.

THE COURT: You may answer that yes or no.

A. No, I didn't hear them ask, I didn't hear them voice any concern at
that point, no.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And in both your written statement and your
typewritten statement from the interview you gave to Phillips, you
said after Arnelle Simpson broke down, they went to the house,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, asked and answered yesterday, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: That's all I have right now, Your Honor.

THE COURT: 10-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case, don't form or express
any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

MR. MEDVENE: Morning, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Morning.

JURORS: Morning.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. A few moments ago you had mentioned blood that you saw with what
appeared to be blood to you on the center console of the Bronco on
June the 13th.

Do you recall that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And did you make, to the best of your recollection, if you've now
refreshed your recollection, reference to seeing blood on the center
console in the handwritten report you prepared shortly after the
incident?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you prepare that report -- can you tell us when you
prepared that report with respect to the incident, a week or two --

A. Yeah. Probably a couple weeks, a couple of weeks after the
incident. And I don't remember the date.

Q. And is it true, sir, that that was before anyone had made any
allegation, to your knowledge, of anyone somehow opening this locked
Bronco and somehow planting blood inside it?

A. True.

MR. MEDVENE: Now, would you put on the TV monitor, please 170.

(Exhibit 170 displayed.)

Q. Can you see the picture from there?

A. Yes, I can.

Q. Do you see anything that appears to be blood on the center console
that you were having reference to in your report that you wrote
shortly after June 13?

You can walk up to it.

A. Okay.

MR. BAKER: What number is this, Steve?

MR. FOSTER: 170.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Let me place a photo in front of you.

A. That would be better, much better.

(Witness reviews photograph.)

A. Well, I definitely see blood on the center console. Item No. 30 is
obvious.

Item 31, I believe I see what it's referring to, but it's very faint.

Q. To the best of your recollection, is that what you had referenced
when you made reference to looking for from outside the vehicle -- did
you have -- use a flashlight?

A. Yes, I did, sir.

Q. And was it already dawn?

A. Well, let me back up.

Actually, it wasn't until the sun had come up that it was obvious that
there was -- there was some blood inside the Bronco.

But before then, I don't recall -- I recall looking in the Bronco with
a flashlight but I don't recall finding blood at that time with just
the flashlight.

Q. Let's step back a minute.

When you get there and Detective Fuhrman brings you over to the Bronco
and you observe what you observed above the door handle, that was
somewhere around 5:20 a.m., correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, your assignment at Rockingham, or one of them, was to help
guard the Bronco; is that correct?

A. Well, when I -- after our arrival at -- after some time there, yes,
sir, that's true.

Q. And is it true that after the sun came up, you again looked in the
Bronco on your own, sometime later?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And approximately what time was that?

A. I have an impound sheet that I was working on at that time. I
believe it was at that time. If I had that impound report that would
-- that would specify a time. But it would have to be when, obviously,
whatever time the sun came up that morning, sometime after that.

Q. And it was light?

A. And it was light.

Q. And it was at that time that you observed what appeared to be blood
on the center console?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Could you put it back up, please.

What number is that, Steve?

MR. FOSTER: 170.

MR. MEDVENE: 170.

(Exhibit 170 displayed.)

Q. Can you see what you observed on that photo?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

A. Not on -- it's easier to see on the picture than it is on this
television screen. It looks kind of blurry.

MR. MEDVENE: You can take it down.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. Now, you made reference also, when you first got there, to the
running board and Mr. Baker asked you certain questions.

I don't have a picture I can show you close up of the driver side of
the running board, but let me put up next in order which I'll
represent to you is the passenger side of the running board, and I'd
ask you to approach it and tell the jury whether -- yeah, whether or
not you can observe a runner there.

THE CLERK: That will be 2281.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of the running board
of the Bronco was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2281.)

MR. MEDVENE: I'm calling it a runner, but --

MR. BAKER: A what?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm calling it a runner. But it's a piece of metal with
the door closed, not hidden or covered up by any stripping or covering
of any kind.

A. I think I could better describe it this reflects pretty much a
mirror image of the other side, and there is a gap in there and
between one thirty-second and I think we decided one quarter of an
inch, that if you shine a flashlight you can see in there, you can see
just a little bit in there.

Q. And did you get down that morning and shine a flashlight in there?

A. Yes, we were on our knees looking.

Q. Again, in the report that you prepared prior to hearing that
anybody was claiming that blood was planted or the door was open, did
you indicate that there was blood on the driver's side door panel?

A. I can simplify this. I just recently heard that we are being
accused of planting blood inside the Bronco, just a few weeks ago. All
of that is going to be before I heard about any evidence planting
inside the Bronco.

Q. Did you put in this report you prepared of your observations, the
report you prepared within several weeks of your observations, that
after the sun came up, in effect, you observed blood smeared on the
driver's side door panel, the inside panel?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: Putting 169 on the board.

(Exhibit 169 displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of vehicle interior
door was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 169.)

Q. I wonder if you could approach that.

MR. MEDVENE: Can you zoom in.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And if you can, where were you standing to observe
the blood?

A. From that side I would have been standing on the passenger side
looking in, or westward, but --

Q. Does that -- I'm sorry, sir.

A. I was going to say I can tell you that -- everything on the top is
the only thing I remember. I didn't even know there was something on
No. 23.

Q. Okay.

So when you say at the top, you waved your arm towards the 21 and 22?

A. Correct. 21 and 22.

Q. Okay.

And the best of your recollection is that's what you observed on June
13, early morning hours, after the sun was up?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, reference was made by counsel to certain language in Detective
Phillips's report. You had told us, as I remember, that -- about the
dog, and you said you don't remember using the word "play."

Do you have any memory of telling him, Detective Phillips, anything
you might have done with the dog?

A. I never moved the dog.

Q. Do you remember telling him you touched the dog or petted the dog,
that he could have interpreted as played with the dog?

A. When you say possibly, the way I told him, I was looking. The dog
-- something was wrong with the dog. I don't know what the heck -- at
the time I didn't know what the heck was wrong with the dog. Obviously
I own a dog, I know when a dog looks distressed. I'm not a dog
psychologist, don't get me wrong. Something was wrong with this dog.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike, no foundation.

THE COURT: Lay person's opinion. Received for that purpose.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) So in discussing your concern about the dog, might
you have told him that you touched or petted the dog?

A. That's the only thing I can think of. I know the word "play" never
-- I think of play as throwing a ball, having a dog chase it. That's
nowhere near what I was doing with the dog.

Q. Okay. And the words "red stain" in the notes, counsel made
reference to something about Detective Fuhrman pointing out red stains
on the Bronco, both near the driver's door handle and near the running
board.

Detective Fuhrman did point those things initially out to you,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. But you said you didn't use the words "red stains."

To the best of your recollection, what did you use?

A. I would have used blood.

Q. Okay.

Now, incidentally, Detective Fuhrman never pointed out to you the
other blood that you described in your report as seeing inside the
vehicle; isn't that correct?

A. Correct. All the blood he pointed out was visible, was only on the
-- excuse me, the driver's door area.

Q. And it was on your own, some period of time later when it became
light, that you looked inside the car and observed what you've told us
about?

A. Correct.

Q. Yesterday, there was some talk of your arrival at Rockingham.

And is it correct, sir, that after you went inside, you returned to
the driveway and were in the driveway area for a while, doing whatever
you were doing; watching the Bronco, whatever you were doing?

A. Okay. I'm confused as to where you're placing me at the time.

Q. Well, confused because my question wasn't very good.

You told us yesterday about entering into the Rockingham property?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you said after -- after a period of time you returned to the
driveway?

A. Correct.

Q. And you don't know -- Strike that.

Prior to sometime later seeing an officer or officers with Ms.
Simpson, you don't know what the detectives were doing and whether
they had entered the rear of the house or not, do you?

MR. BAKER: That's leading, Your Honor.

MR. MEDVENE: We're entitled to lead.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It's possible they may have entered the house. I don't believe so,
at the time, but it's possible.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You don't know one way or another what they were
doing in the rear of the house 'cause you were in the driveway; is
that correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

I have nothing further.

MR. BAKER: You want to put up 170 please, Phil.

(Exhibit 170 displayed.)

MR. BAKER: Now, can you zoom in or make it a little more visible.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. That's a blood smear, that isn't blood drops, correct?

A. Correct. Actually, I -- like I said in the first statement when the
other counsel was talking to me, I can't say I had an independent
recollection of that.

Q. And if some blood drops were smeared, that certainly could be done
with a bloody glove couldn't it?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for conclusion, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You said in your testimony earlier this morning,
that the blood drops were on the top of the console, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. They weren't on the side of the console, they weren't on the back
of the console, correct?

A. I said I don't recall seeing them on the side or the back.

Q. You said they weren't on the side and they weren't on the back;
isn't that what you said, Officer Gonzalez?

A. I said that the blood drops I saw were on the top of the counsel --
of the console.

Q. And you -- to inspect this vehicle, after -- after you were
requested to guard the vehicle, that's when you took your flashlight,
shined the flashlight in, shined it all the way across, and you say
you saw blood spots on the driver's door from the passenger side up by
the window sill, correct?

A. That's not -- That's not correct.

MR. BAKER: You want to put the other photo up that they just had up.

(Exhibit 169 displayed)

THE COURT REPORTER: That number, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you just told Mr. Medvene that -- that you --

THE COURT REPORTER: -- I apologize --

MR. BAKER: You got the number?

MR. P. BAKER: Not yet. I'll find it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You just told Mr. Medvene since we've been back from
the break that you saw blood in the area where No. 21 is, correct,
sir?

A. That is where I previously stated, obviously. I want to get back to
my other statement here. Yes, that is true.

Q. Just asking you what you told Mr. Medvene within the last 15
minutes. You said that you saw blood in the area of No. 21 up by the
door sill; is that not correct, sir?

A. That is true.

Q. And you said that you visualized that from your position on the
passenger side of the vehicle, which would be on the grass there at
Rockingham, correct?

A. That is not true. I didn't visualize anything.

Q. Well, you saw it?

A. Thank you.

Q. I use words that -- never mind.

A. All right.

Q. Now, so you were across the vehicle and looking in from the -- from
the driver's door, from the passenger door, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you obviously have testified here you never got in the vehicle,
so you had to be shining your flashlight and looking in from the
passenger side, all the way across to the driver's side, right?

A. Okay.

This is where we get into specifics again. I never said I used my
flashlight to illuminate the blood.

Q. So you didn't use your flashlight to illuminate any blood; is that
true?

A. True.

Q. Okay. So you --

A. Oh, well, gosh. See, you're leading me on again and you're
confusing me. I did illuminate -- I used my flashlight to see blood
from the outside of the Bronco. The blood inside the Bronco did not
become obvious until the sun came up.

I know we have to play this question and answer game thing.

Q. This is not a game. And quit playing. We're not playing.

A. You're playing with me.

Q. Oh, no.

A. You've been playing with me since we started this whole thing.

Q. You can argue all you want, sir.

But I want you to answer this question and tell this jury, you were on
the passenger side, you saw the blood; is that what you're telling
this jury, on the driver's door?

A. Absolutely. No. 21 and No. 22 is what I saw. Absolutely.

Q. And you have no doubt about that whatsoever, and you wouldn't lie
in this courtroom, right?

A. I would never lie.

Q. Never?

A. Never.

Q. And you, obviously, to see that, had scanned with your eyes, and in
your field of vision, the entire front seat on the passenger side, the
console, as well as the driver's door, it was all in your field of
vision when you made this all important discovery, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative, compound.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, I don't know if I discovered it first, but I did see the
blood there.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you didn't see any blood on the side of the
console at all, did you?

A. On the side of the console, no, I don't remember seeing blood
there.

MR. BAKER: Put that photo up.

(Exhibit 170 displayed.)

A. Right, No. 30, that's the one I was talking about. I don't remember
seeing that there.

Q. You were sure looking for blood after you made this discovery on
the passenger door that you say you made. You were looking for blood.

You didn't see one bit of blood on the console, did you, sir?

A. I don't remember seeing that blood.

Q. You certainly would have seen it if it had been there because you
were certainly looking for blood; isn't that true?

A. That's not true.

I think I missed a lot of things in that Bronco, to tell you the
truth.

Q. So you only remember seeing the blood on the door.

You don't remember seeing blood on the console, correct?

A. I think it's realistic to explain to --

Q. Can you answer my question?

A. I'm answering your question.

Q. Then answer it.

You don't remember seeing blood on the console.

You do remember seeing two separate areas of blood on the door, right?

A. There are some things I remember and some things I don't.

Q. And the reason you don't remember the blood on the console is
because it was subsequently planted in that Bronco after June 14,
1994; isn't that true?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative.

Mr. Baker knows --

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker knows it, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now --

MR. MEDVENE: We'd ask that Mr. Baker's question be stricken from the
record.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were told to guard the Bronco, were you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you didn't guard the Bronco, you let people get on the Bronco,
put coffee cups on the Bronco while you were there at the scene, did
you not, sir?

A. That is completely false.

Q. And so if we've got a picture with a coffee cup on the Bronco, that
picture is an erroneous image, correct?

A. No. But I think you should show it 'cause it can easily be
explained.

Q. Okay. Now, one other thing.

You didn't put in your handwritten statement one word about Fuhrman
finding a glove and showing it to you, did you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, outside the scope.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to reopen this subject.

THE COURT: You may.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You didn't put one single sentence in your
handwritten report about Fuhrman showing you the glove, did you?

A. Correct. I did not put anything in my statement whatsoever about
that glove.

Q. You were there from 5:20 in the morning until 7:30; isn't that
true?

A. That's true.

Q. And then January of 1995, after the criminal trial has started, you
then, in your interview with Phillips, suggest that Fuhrman came up to
you and seemed a little excited, he found a bloody glove, and that
this was now a crime scene.

And you added that in January of 1995, did you not, sir?

A. I don't like your word added 'cause it sounds like I just decided
to put it in there. But that is a fact, that he explained to me that
he had found something.

Q. Well, we discussed a little bit earlier this morning --

A. Sure.

Q. -- that you wanted to put in everything that was important in your
handwritten statement 'cause you knew how important the case was,
correct?

A. True.

Q. And you knew when you did your handwritten statement that if
Fuhrman had ever come up to you at all and talked to you about
discovering a glove, how important it was because you say in January
of '95, that's what turned Rockingham into a crime scene; isn't that
true, sir?

A. At the time I discovered -- I made that statement, the glove wasn't
an issue, the fact it had been found was not even an issue. It had
been found, and it was found there in Rockingham.

Q. The most -- single most important thing, not blood on the door
sill, not blood on the center console --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. I apologize, Mr. Baker. This is obviously an
argumentative question, Your Honor. We move to strike it.

THE COURT: Strike it and ask counsel to rephrase the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The single most important discovery that occurred
between 0520, if it in fact ever occurred, and 7:30 in the morning was
the discovery of a glove on the south side of Mr. Simpson's home on
Rockingham.

You would agree with that, would you not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, question is argumentative, calls for
conclusion.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I would agree with that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And in your statement you didn't put one word about
it, correct?

A. I never saw the glove.

You have to read it again. You'll be surprised.

Q. You know --

A. I'm not making a joke.

Q. You know, I'm not surprised about much of anything anymore.

MR. MEDVENE: We move to strike Mr. Baker's comments.

MR. BAKER: Well, then, strike his little comments about he'd be
surprised.

THE COURT: That's also stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Are you telling this jury, sir, that it was of no
importance, if in fact Fuhrman came up to you and seemed a little
excited and Fuhrman stated he had found a bloody glove and this was
now a crime scene?

A. The fact he told me it was a crime scene is important. He was the
senior over there, why he determined it a crime scene is mildly
interesting to me. If he tells me it's a crime scene, it's a crime
scene.

I don't care what he found. I don't care what he saw. He's the boss, I
take his word for it.

Q. So it's your testimony in this courtroom that Fuhrman was in charge
of the Rockingham crime scene between the time that you got there at
0520 and you left at 0730, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, misstates the record, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: That's what the witness said.

Overruled?

A. No, that's not my statement. My statement is I have -- I was a
subordinate, I was probably the most junior officer there. I think
most of those guys had more time as police officers than I have on
this earth.

Q. Let me just ask you the question:

Is it your testimony that Fuhrman was in charge of the crime scene or
not?

A. It is not my testimony he was in charge of the crime scene.

Q. Who was it charge of the crime scene?

A. It would have to be either Lange or Phillips. I don't know which
one is a more senior officer.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

THE CLERK: For the record, that exhibit number is 169, the one that
they didn't have a number for.

THE COURT REPORTER: Which exhibit number?

THE CLERK: The one they didn't have a number for.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Did Detective Fuhrman, on June 13, mention the glove to you, or did
you make that up?

A. No, I didn't make that up.

Q. Did he tell you on the 13th that he had found the glove?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Was there anything that you were trying to hide or mislead anyone
about by not putting in your report that Detective Fuhrman said he
found the glove?

A. No.

I don't have anything to gain by even -- I don't know. No.

I mean --

Q. Detective Fuhrman, to your knowledge, was at the crime scene with
Detectives Lange, Vannatter and Phillips, was he not?

A. That's true.

Q. To the best of your knowledge, Detective Fuhrman would have told
Detectives Lange, Vannatter and Phillips about the glove; isn't that
true?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. This is leading, without foundation,
calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) As far as you know, others had knowledge that
Detective -- Strike that.

Were you trying to hide from anybody, the fact that Detective Fuhrman
first saw a glove at Rockingham?

A. No, no.

Q. Is there any reason why, other than it might have been of no moment
at the time to put it in your report, why you didn't put it in your
report but you later told Detective Phillips?

A. It's irrelevant, actually. There's even more little stupid things
that happened that's not in the report.

Q. Okay.

But you weren't trying to hide it from anybody?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. And any reason to hide it from anybody?

A. Absolutely not.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Nothing further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Stupid things -- never mind.

Withdrawn.

THE COURT: Your're excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Call Robert Groden.

ROBERT GRODEN, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this Court, shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: And, sir, if you would please state and spell your name for
the record.

THE WITNESS: Robert Groden, G-r-o-d-e-n.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Morning, Mr. Groden.

A. Morning.

Q. How are you presently employed?

A. I'm a writer.

Q. Have you had -- how old are you?

A. 51.

Q. During the course of your life, have you had experience in the
field of photography, and in particular, in the field of the
alteration of photographic images?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Just in general terms right now, let me ask you this: Have you also
had experience in the analysis of photographic images to determine
whether or not they have been altered?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you been engaged by the defense to review a particular
photograph or set of photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. Which photograph is that?

A. It's a photograph that purports to show Mr. O.J. Simpson walking
across the end zone of a football field.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see that?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Can we have -- can we approach on
qualifications?

MR. LEONARD: I'm going to get to that. I want to get to the purpose
for the witness being here.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. I'd like to have the qualifications.

MR. LEONARD: I'm not going to ask for an opinion --

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

THE COURT: Okay. What's the objection?

MR. GELBLUM: The objection is this man's unqualified. This man's not
qualified to render any expert opinions about alteration of
photographs, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: I'm going to establish his qualifications. I just wanted
to demonstrate -- I'm not even asking him for a conclusion.

MR. GELBLUM: It's a Kennedy conspiracy not -- He works repairing photo
processing machines.

MR. LEONARD: I can establish his -- the foundation for his
qualifications, and I will.

THE COURT: Give me an offer of proof.

MR. LEONARD: He worked for years in the area of the alteration of
negatives and photographic images, both still and motion picture.

MR. GELBLUM: Not true.

MR. LEONARD: It is true.

He worked -- he worked in optical effects. He knows exactly how
photographs are altered legitimately and illegitimately. He was a
staff consultant for the Select House Committee on Assassination. He's
reviewed hundreds and thousands -- or hundreds, thousands of
photographs for the purpose of determining both for authenticity and
evidentiary value, both for the Assassination Committee and thereafter
for his own research and writing.

THE COURT: Has he qualified as an expert before?

MR. LEONARD: He has not qualified as an expert other than in the
Senate -- the House Select Committee that he was used as an expert. He
has not testified -- he has not testified in a court of law as far as
I know.

MR. GELBLUM: He testified in his deposition he never qualified as an
expert, in court as an expert.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to excuse you for a
little while. Don't talk about the case, don't form or express any
opinions.

(Pause.)

THE CLERK: For the record, just while the jurors are here, too,
mention was made of Exhibit 2036 in the last series and it should have
been referred to as 2038.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: The record will show that the jurors left the courtroom.

We're conducting a hearing under 402 of the evidence code with regard
to the witness's qualifications.

Go ahead.

402 HEARING

VOIR DIRE DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. First of all, to lay a foundation, what tests were you asked to
accomplish or to undertake for the defense in this case, just in very
general terms?

A. To examine the photographs and to render an opinion on whether I
found any evidence of falsification.

Q. Now, let's go back.

When did you first start your experience in the field of photography,
generally?

A. Basically as a child, as about a 10 or 12-year old.

Q. And have you continued to be actively involved in the field of
photography, generally, since then?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

When was the first time you were employed in any respect in the field
of photography?

A. Around 1969.

Q. What was that employment, sir?

A. I was hired by a motion exhibit picture optical house in New York
City and was hired as an optical technician.

Q. And describe in as much detail as you can what you did, and with
particular emphasis on the creation of alterated (sic) images of any
kind in either motion picture or still photography?

THE COURT: Alterated?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah.

MR. GELBLUM: Altered.

MR. LEONARD: Altered. Excuse me. Altered images. That's like
visualization, I guess.

(Laughter.)

A. In the motion picture optical field, a large percentage of the work
that's done is specifically to alter images, adding titles, doing
split screens, inserting images within another image.

I would say that probably between 60 and 75 percent of all the work
that's done involves that.

Q. Okay.

And how long did -- and in order to do that, just in general terms,
what techniques did you use when you were working in this field?

A. Well, there are various different ways; matte insertion, split
screens, using masking techniques either through film or through
repositions of shutters, changing sizes, correcting irregularities,
things of that nature. Product shots, inserting, say, a can of
furniture spray or something of that nature within a background.

Q. Okay.

And how long did you work in the field?

You described a job you had when you were working in optical effects
in motion pictures.

Did you also work in the field of optical effects in still
photography?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

And for how long a period of time did you do that?

A. Well, as I said, I started in the optical field by 1969, and to a
degree I'm still doing it today.

Q. And with regard to still photography in particular, where was your
first employment where you were involved in the creation of altered
images for purposes of advertising or any other purpose?

A. I was employed by a company called 2 by 2 Slides in New York City.

Q. How long were you employed there?

A. For a few years.

Q. Okay.

And what in particular, what types -- you gave the example of a
product shot with a can inserted.

Just explain that a little bit more, and explain the process that you
would go through with that?

A. Well, the most likely way, the way where it's usually done is you
would have your product shot preshot to the sizing and position that
you would want it to be on one piece of film, you would have a
background on another piece of film.

You would photograph the product shot on to a piece of black-and
white-high contrast film called Kodalith, K-o-d-a-l-i-t-h, you would
then retouch the Kodalith to make sure that you have blacked out
everything that you want to mask out of the image.

You then do a negative of the original Kodalith in what they call
register -- a pin register.

THE COURT REPORTER: P-i-n?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

A. You then take a piece of unexposed film or photographic paper,
however you want to do it, and you photograph the product with the
clear core matte which is black all around and clear in the center.

You then go back and take your background and the negative of the
clear core matte which is called a black core matte. The purpose of a
matte is to eliminate photographing a double image in the same space.

You then project that down or photograph that down, depending on the
technique used, and what you're left with at the end is what's known
as a composite image.

You would have the insert of your product shot against an existing
background.

Q. Now, that's what -- you've just described this process of creating
an altered photographic image.

I take it that's something that's done in the photographic industry,
particularly in advertising, frequently, correct?

A. I would dare say possibly every day.

Q. Okay.

And that's the -- was that the type of work that you did for some
period of time in New York in the position that you were describing?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, by virtue of your experience both in the -- in optical effects
in film and also these optical effects in still photography, did you
become knowledgeable about the various methods to alter photographs,
including the one that you just mentioned?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you familiar with the indicia of those methods to alter
photographs?

In other words, looking at a photograph or a negative to determine
whether or not such alteration has taken place?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, there came a time that you became engaged with the House Select
Committee on Assassination; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Can you explain, first of all, what the Committee was, to the
Court?

A. The House Assassination Committee or the House Committee on
Assassinations, as it was formerly known, was an organization or group
formed by Congress to investigate the work of the Warren Commission.

They were to study the Warren Report, to question witnesses that may
not have been questioned by the Warren Commission, and to determine
the accuracy or fallacy of the Warren Commission report.

Q. Now, among the vast amount of evidence that this committee was
investigating was certain photographic and motion picture evidence; is
that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Tell us, if you will, what role, if any, you had for the Committee
in the analysis of this evidence, the gathering of it, the analysis of
it, and in particular, for purposes of authenticity?

A. I was named as the committee staff photographic consultant. The
work I did included identifying and defining images on film and
photographs that were to be analyzed by the Committee, and in some
cases analyzing them myself.

Q. Okay.

Now, how long did you -- From when to when did you hold that position?

A. The Committee's formal life was 1977 to 1978. I was working for
them and elements of the Committee for about six months prior to the
official forming of the -- of the Committee itself, and their
investigation, and for about another six months after they officially
closed down as well.

Q. For a total of how long?

A. For about three years.

Q. Now, was this -- was this a full-time everyday job?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Describe for the Court, if you will, how often you would consult, and
at least give an estimate of that, if you will?

A. It would vary. There might be times when there would be several
days in a row. There would be times when a week would go by where
there would be nothing, and two weeks would go by. In some cases it
was a couple of hours. Sometimes it was by telephone. Sometimes it was
in person. It involved testimony before the House Committee on the
first day of the public hearings.

It would be impossible to give an exact description of the time
involved because it varied. No two weeks were possibly ever the same.

Q. There was a -- just so the Court has an idea of the type of
materials we're talking about, there were two photographic or motion
picture items that many of us are familiar with, that you had direct
contact with or you analyzed; is that correct, with with regard to the
House Select Committee?

A. Probably a great many more than two.

Q. Well, the one I'm thinking of is a rather famous picture of Lee
Harvey Oswald in the backyard of his -- of his house, purportedly
holding a rifle?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did you analyze that photograph for purposes of authenticity?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

And that was in conjunction with your work on the Committee; is that
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did you -- there was also a motion picture that many of us have
heard about called the Zapruder film.

Are you familiar with that?

A. Yes.

THE REPORTER: Could you spell Zapruder, please.

MR. LEONARD: Z-a-p-r-u-d-e-r.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, the Zapruder film was filmed -- shot by a
bystander just as President Kennedy was shot?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did you have any role in analyzing that piece of film?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Just in general terms, explain that to the Court.

A. The history that relates to that I had worked on the Zapruder film
for some years prior to the creation of the House Committee. It was my
releasing of the film on a TV show called "Good Night America" in 1975
that directly led to the House Committee being formed in the first
place.

When the Committee was formed, I was hired as their staff photographic
consultant, and I worked with the formal photographic panel in
analyzing the Zapruder film and others. And we would have sessions
where we would sit and study individual frames, where we would analyze
motion, reaction time, possible indication of timing of shots, things
of that nature.

Q. You mentioned the photographic panel, were you a -- were you
working in conjunction with the photographic panel?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Okay.

Now, you have continued -- you have written several -- you've written
books about the Kennedy assassination; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Is it fair to say that those -- that in preparing those books and
in researching that, you had to look at, analyze, and examine,
hundreds or thousands of photographs concerning the Kennedy
assassination?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the course of that, did you have to make determinations as
to whether or not photographs were authentic?

A. Yes.

Q. And you've done that for how many years, sir?

A. About 30 years.

Q. Now, you don't have a college education?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Do you have any formal training in photography?

A. No.

Q. Have you been -- have you worked around photography in areas other
than what you've described?

In other words, I've talked about optical effects and I've talked
about both motion picture and still photography.

Have you worked in other fields relating to photography or other
businesses? Let's put it that way.

A. I have. I have worked in areas where -- where I've done work with
computers -- computers relating to photography, yes.

Q. Have you had experience actually repairing various types of
photographic processing machines?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Okay.

And how long did you do that?

A. Maybe 14 years or so.

Q. Okay.

And by virtue of that experience, did you become familiar not only
with the indicia of altered images and photographs and the manner in
which photographs can be altered, but actually some of the machinery
that's used in altering, the actual minutia of the machinery that's
used?

A. Yes. Using -- using the -- the machinery you become familiar with
it and the mechanical processes involved, yes.

Q. And you actually were involved in the servicing of these machines?

A. Servicing and photo processing of the machines, yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, you're not a professional witness?

A. No.

Q. From time to time have you -- have others consulted with you about
the authenticity of photographs or the analysis of photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Was there an occasion when the "National Enquirer" actually contacted
you to authenticate the -- attempt to authenticate a photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. And when was that, sir, the first time?

A. Approximately 14 years ago.

Q. Okay.

Can you describe in general terms what you did, and what the situation
was?

A. The situation was that someone had apparently come to them and
represented a photograph of -- of voodoo -- a voodoo ritual or
something of that nature, and there was an item within the picture
that a photographer claimed was a photograph of a -- of a spirit or
something that he had been able to conjure up and photograph.

And the "Enquirer" wanted me to authenticate it and --

Q. Were you able to?

A. No. As a matter of fact, I discovered that there was a natural
explanation for that problem.

Q. And just in general terms, how were you able to determine that,
sir, for the "National Enquirer"?

A. I examined contact sheet, as I recall, and noticed that the image
that he was talking about extended beyond the edge of the frame
itself, indicating that it was a problem with, or a flaw with the
film, as opposed to an image being photographed.

Q. Did you tell that to the "National Enquirer"?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did they publish the photo anyway?

A. Yes, they did.

Q. Now, were you contacted with regard to the Bruno Magli photo by the
"National Enquirer"?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Did they ask you if you would analyze it for them?

A. That's correct. They did.

Q. Did you?

A. No.

Q. Did they ever call you back after the first time?

A. They called me a second time. They never called back after that.

MR. LEONARD: May I have just one minute, Your Honor.

(Pause.)

MR. LEONARD: I don't have anything else for the purpose of voir dire.

VOIR DIRE CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Mr. Groden, you've had no formal training whatsoever in learning
how to determine the authenticity of photographs, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Never taught a course in photography?

A. Never.

Q. Never published anything about photography?

A. Techniques of photography?

Q. Yeah.

A. No.

Q. Or techniques of photographic alteration?

A. No.

Q. Not a book, not an article, not anything?

A. I mention the technique of photo alteration in a book I wrote.

Q. The book's not about photo alteration?

A. No.

Q. You talk about the Oswald backyard photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. And you don't belong to any professional organizations?

A. No.

Q. And you're not certified by any professional organizations?

A. No.

Q. And you never testified in court or qualified in court as an expert
on photography, correct?

A. No.

Q. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And these photographic processing equipment that you repair, that's
like commercial photos, like one-hour photo kind of places?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. You said that you first gained experience -- your first job of
photography was this optical house in New York?

A. Yes.

Q. That was exclusively with motion pictures?

A. The first job, yes.

Q. Yes.

There's no optical effects with motion pictures involved in the
analysis of the Bruno Magli picture, is there?

A. Only -- only -- the only way it would be connected is the
techniques, some of the techniques might be the same.

Q. We're not talking about a motion picture film here, are we?

A. No.

Q. You did no work with still photography at that first job?

A. No, that's not correct. I did some work with still photography
there, too.

Q. Remember having your deposition taken in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And we're getting a -- do you remember giving a different answer at
that time?

MR. LEONARD: Page and line, please.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 21, line 10 through 22.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) (Reading:) That's --

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) "That," meaning the optical effects of the first
job.

(Reading:) Q. That's done with motion

picture film? A. Yes. Q. Exclusively with motion

picture film? A. Yes. Q. Not done with videotape? A. No. Q. Or still
photography film? A. You might have a still --

specific still photograph, maybe you

might want to animate on but you're not.

A. That's correct.

MR. LEONARD: I move to strike there's no inconsistency.

MR. GELBLUM: You plan to testify about the film?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I answered now just exactly as I did then. There were still items
involved.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) But there's nothing involved in creating a fake
still photograph?

A. I don't believe that's what you asked me.

Q. That's what I'm asking you now, sir?

A. I did not create still images except possibly mattes for separation
or split screens.

Q. And you said that you worked with still photography optical effects
with 2 by 2 Slides; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's over 20 years ago?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And in fact, do you recall testifying about 2 by 2 Slides at your
deposition?

A. Yes.

Q. And page 18, line 24, to page 19, line 18 -- you didn't mention at
your deposition anything about doing optical effects on still
photography at that job, did you?

MR. LEONARD: If he could show him the actual questions and answers.

MR. GELBLUM: I'll be happy to -- I'll read it to him.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you recall testifying at your deposition saying
anything about working with 2 by 2 Slides, optical effects and still
photography?

A. I don't recall that there was a specific question asked in that
area. There may have been.

Q. Let's read it.

Starts with your explaining what you did.

(Reading:)

When I left that field of work, meaning the first job, optical effects
with motion pictures, I went into slide duplication, which I worked
for the -- a company called 2 by 2 Slides and I worked there for a
couple of years.

What training did you get there?

Well, they already know that basically --

I'm asking about training?

Oh, well, the boss there had been working in that field for years and
he taught me some of his techniques.

For duplicating slides?

No, duplicating slides, enlarging, things of that nature.

Well, what else besides duplicating slides and enlarging?

At that job?

Yes.

That was pretty much it, that's what we did.

Do you recall giving that testimony?

A. Sounds familiar.

Q. Nothing about optical effects and still photography, right?

A. Well, the technical term optical effects would not apply there.

Q. I asked you what you did and you gave those answers?

A. Yes, making slide duplicates does involve doing composites in many
cases.

Q. The House Select Committee, that's the next thing Mr. Leonard asked
you about, that was about 18 years ago?

A. Approximately.

Q. And you were not on the expert panel, correct?

A. I was not on the photographic panel.

Q. It was a panel of photographic experts that you were not on?

A. That's correct.

Q. You were "a" consultant, not "the" consultant?

A. That's correct.

Q. You testified for a few days -- I mean -- I'm sorry.

You worked for a few days here and there over a couple years, right?

A. Well, more than just a couple of days. I mean it was over a period
of three years, yes.

Q. And the testimony you talked about was not about altered
photographs, was it, you gave on the first day of the hearings?

A. I don't recall. It went on for many hours. They may have asked
about specific -- they asked questions relating to matters of photo
work that needed to be done. This was at the outset of the hearing.
And I was not allowed to volunteer specific information; I merely
answered their questions.

Q. But you were not -- you did not give any testimony about altered
photographs at that testimony, did you?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Okay.

Now, the Oswald backyard photograph, you say you were the one who
discovered it was fake; is that what you're saying?

A. No.

Q. A bunch of people looked at it and all agreed it was fake?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's a black-and-white photograph?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the picture here that we're talking about today is color?

A. That's correct.

Q. And some of the opinions you intend to give have to do with color,
right?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And the Zapruder film, that's also black-and-white?

A. No.

Q. It's color?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you said you also worked on the Kennedy -- on various photos
relating to the assassination for the last 30 years?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. You've worked on various photos relating to the assassination over
the last 30 years?

A. That's correct.

Q. Other than the House Committee, that's all been on your own time
and for your own purposes, correct?

A. Not all of it. I did some -- some work for submission to the
Rockefeller Commission and the Senate Select Committee on -- on
Government. It was a Church Committee, actually.

Q. And when was that?

A. In the 1970's.

Q. And this "National Enquirer" photo you looked at about 14 years ago
--

A. That's correct.

Q. -- did you mention that?

And what you said is, you looked at -- as soon as you looked at it,
you immediately recognized that it was just a fake -- no, it wasn't a
fake, it was a technical problem with the photograph?

A. I can't say immediately. Upon studying it for a short period of
time, I realized it.

Q. You didn't have to do any complicated analysis to determine whether
it had been altered, correct?

A. No.

Q. You just saw it and what -- it was what you said?

A. Yes.

Q. Previously, it was immediately apparent?

A. It was apparent, yes.

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing further on voir dire.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, just a couple.

VOIR DIRE REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. The analysis of -- of photographic images to determine whether or
not they're altered, tell us what that boils down to, in the most
basic terms?

A. The most basic -- most basic and simplest way to start dealing with
it is observation, what you're capable of seeing and detecting with
your eye, comparing it to experience.

Beyond that, you can use techniques of photograph photogrammetry for
measurement to -- well, you would check to find out if there are --
are obvious cut lines or paste lines, or for digitalization, you'd
worry about whether you could find pixels or things of that nature.

There's an endless variety, I would say.

But on this most basic level, it's a matter of observation. Sometimes
it happens right away; sometimes it takes time. You just simply need
to know in that data base, or whatever, if anything strikes you as
being odd or not visually correct.

Q. And again, throughout your career you have examined thousands of
photographs for purposes of determining whether they're authentic,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And again, you were employed for some number of years actually
creating duplicate and altered negatives, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. You were asked about the panel of photographic experts.

Was there a proficiency test that was done of the -- of the panel of
photographic experts that you participated in?

A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. Was there a -- was there an occasion when the panel of photographic
experts was given some photographs, some of which were altered, some
of which weren't, to determine whether or not they could figure out
which ones were altered and which ones weren't?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Did you participate in that exercise?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And were the results graded by other photographic experts?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

How did you fare in that test, sir?

A. I got 100 percent.

Q. Did anyone else on that photographic panel get 100 percent?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have anything else.

THE COURT: At this point, Mr. Leonard, I was hopeful that the
proceedings will assist the Court and in enlighten the Court about
what this witness's expertise has to do with the --

MR. LEONARD: Oh, okay.

THE COURT: -- examination that you wish to proffer him for, and thus
far, I am at a loss to see what expertise you have reference to with
regards to a particular examination.

MR. LEONARD: What I can do is have him go through in summary fashion
what I expect to elicit from him substantively, if that will be
helpful. You can compare his experience with the --

THE COURT: I'd like -- it would be helpful to have an examination of
this witness as to his experience or knowledge in that particular area
that you are going to be inquiring about in this case.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You have undertaken an analysis of the -- the
particular photographic image of Mr. Simpson with the Bruno Magli
shoes?

A. That is correct.

Q. And explain --

MR. LEONARD: And, Your Honor, we make this Exhibit 1 for purposes of
the hearing.

THE COURT: It's already an exhibit, isn't it?

MR. P. BAKER: It's 1930.

(The instrument herein referred to as photograph of Mr. Simpson
walking was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
1930.)

(Exhibit 1930 displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: Can you pull that back a little bit (indicating to Elmo).

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you -- that's the image in question, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you explain for the Court in summary fashion, what you did to
examine the photograph and the surrounding photographs on the contact
sheet and negative strip for purposes of determining whether or not
you could discern whether this photograph was altered?

A. I examined the photograph itself. I examined the original that --
purports to be an original negative. I examined the surrounding
frames, two contact sheets specifically, the one that this photograph
is contained in and another one. I examined irregularities within the
surrounding area on the negative itself, surrounding this particular
frame, and made determinations dependent upon my observations of those
items.

Q. Now, let's just --

MR. LEONARD: Would you like to see some of the specific exhibits we
prepared, Your Honor, for purposes of illustrating this?

THE COURT: Well, I'm trying to understand what his expertise -- what
the expertise is with regards to this exhibit.

MR. LEONARD: Well, his expertise, Your Honor, he's done this for
years, he's examined photographs, he's created duplicate altered
photographs for purposes of -- professionally, and he's familiar with
the methods that are used to do that.

And we can -- I can illustrate that. If you want me to go through his
testimony, I will, so that he can demonstrate exactly what he's doing.

And that might make it easier for the Court to determine whether or
not -- the question with regard to his expertise.

I don't know how else to do it, Your Honor.

This individual has --

THE COURT: I presume you know what he's going to testify to?

MR. LEONARD: I do.

THE COURT: Then you ought to know what the basis of his expertise is
on that portion of that testimony.

MR. LEONARD: His expertise is that he was in the business of creating
altered images. The technology is -- is basically the same. There's
some very simple techniques that are used. There are also some very
complicated techniques.

THE COURT: Where -- it might be helpful to examine him as to what the
techniques are and what his experience is with regard to his knowledge
of it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you describe for the court the general -- in
general terms the techniques that are used to create altered
photographic images?

First of all, let me ask you about motion picture film --

THE COURT: I'm not interested in motion picture film. I'm interested
in --

MR. LEONARD: I'm laying this foundation because motion picture film --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Describe, just in general terms what a motion
picture film is?

A. Motion picture film is -- most basic level, is a string or
repetitive series of still photographs.

Q. Okay.

And there are techniques used to create optical effects that involve
creating altered images in some of the individual frames -- still
frames; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And those techniques -- you utilized those techniques when you worked
in optical effects; is that correct?

A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Okay.

Are those techniques, at their base, different from the techniques
that are used to dup -- to create altered still photographs?

A. In many cases the techniques are identical.

Q. In some cases they're not?

A. That is correct.

Q. But when it comes to creating a duplicate altered image on a piece
of film, okay, the techniques are basically the same as they would be
for a still photographic alteration; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. All right.

And you worked in that field, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, describe for us in general terms the techniques that are used to
create altered still photographic images?

A. There are several.

I would say the most common would be, as I mentioned before, manual
matte insertion, where you create a matte and insert an image
photographically.

Another technique would be cut and paste, whereby you would physically
cut out an item -- photographic image and place it on top of another
one and rephotograph it.

Or you could use an air brush technique, which is very similar to cut
and paste, but varies in the fact that you're not just placing one on
another but you're retouching it, spraying an additional image to help
disguise the cut mark or a difference in grain pattern, things of that
nature.

Lastly, and relatively new, is digitization, where it's done within
the -- an electronic domain as opposed to a photographic or mechanical
domain. The other techniques that I described are physically altering
something that is a photographic image either onto film or on -- on
photographic paper. The digitalization of an image is done within a
computer, and that varies from the others more than any of the others
do against themselves because you're altering the physical image
electronically and you can regenerate them into a photographic image
after the fact.

Q. Okay.

Now, throughout the course of your career as a photographer, during
the time that you were with the -- working with the Senate House
Select Committee and also during the time you were working in optical
effects or duplicating negatives, and up to the present time,
including your research and analysis and examination of thousands of
photographs relating to the Kennedy assassination, have you become
familiar with all of these techniques, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Do you -- are you -- do you know and can you testify to the jury with
regard to the indicia or the indications of these techniques in a
still photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Have you undertaken a thorough review of the photographic image in
this case and the surrounding images to determine whether or not there
are indicia that the photograph has been altered?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, one of the most basic elements to altering a photograph is the
creation of a duplicate negative; isn't that correct?

Let's put it this way --

A. If I can --

Q. Okay.

A. I'm sorry.

I was going to say a duplicate might be determined as being an exact
copy of the original.

What you would do is do a copy negative or an altered negative that
would -- could conceivably be referred to as a duplicate. It would not
be an original, but it would be -- it would be an altered duplicate.

Q. Let me put it to you this way: If you were going to alter a
photograph such as this one, and you didn't want anybody to find out,
what would you -- what's the basic -- one of the first things you'd
have to do, sir, if you thought they were going to go back and
investigate and look at the original source, that is what purports to
be the original negative?

A. You would have to create a forgery, you'd have to create something
that would purport to be an original negative.

Q. But it would actually be a duplicate or altered negative?

A. That's correct.

Q. Are there some very basic indicia that show you that a photograph
-- that a negative is actually a duplicate negative and not an
original negative?

A. There are several, yes.

Q. Okay.

And can you describe some of those to the Court that you are familiar
with by virtue of your experience in duplicating negatives, creating
altered negatives, and by virtue of all your experience in analyzing
photographs. Just give some of them to the Court.

A. Color balance, sharpness, grain structure, registration --

Q. Let me stop you there.

What do you mean by registration, sir?

A. If you were going to try to insert a photograph into another
position, you'd need to position -- you'd need to know where it goes,
you need to register it, something could fall out of register,
something could create a false line. It's difficult to do it
perfectly. There are usually some indications of -- of fakery that can
be observed.

Q. Now, these indications of fakery, sir, those are factors or
phenomenon that you can -- that you can often readily identify and
that are universal in photography? In other words, they're -- when you
talk about out of register, you're talking about, for instance, a -- a
frame in a line of film that's slightly out of kilter; is that
correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And that's a simple concept, right?

A. Extremely.

Q. You're also talking about, for instance, when you talk about
register, with regard to color, you're talking about if it's -- if
there is an item that's a certain color, that you don't see echoes of
the color where it shouldn't be on the photograph, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And these are all things that you're familiar with by virtue of your
30 years experience as a photographer, as an analyst, as a researcher,
as someone that was involved in optical effects and as one that was
involved in the duplication of negatives, isn't that correct, sir?

A. That is correct.

Q. Is there any doubt in your mind, sir -- I know you're not a
professional witness.

Is there any doubt in your mind that you can sit in that stand and
you're qualified to tell the jury the things you're going to tell
them; is there any doubt?

A. Not the slightest doubt in my mind.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any more questions.

VOIR DIRE RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Mr. Groden, the only time in your entire 51 years anybody has ever
paid you a penny to determine the authenticity of a photograph is 14
years ago with the "National Enquirer" with this phony image of the
voodoo ritual?

A. No.

Q. Isn't that what you said in your deposition, sir?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

What else have you been paid to do?

A. I was asked to pay for -- not asked to pay.

I was asked to determine other work -- tell you what, before I answer
that, will you repeat the question, make sure I'm understanding it the
way you're asking.

Q. Other than this "National Enquirer" 14 years ago, when you looked
at it, you immediately saw a problem, have you ever been paid by
anybody to determine the authenticity of a photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. When?

A. About four or five years ago.

Q. What was that?

A. Someone came to me relating to a -- as I recall, a Korean political
party. Photographs were taken, and the claim was being made by this --
this party that spirits were being conjured up for some kind of
support. And the photographs were being published or were -- it was
part of some kind of a legal situation in Korea, as I understand it,
and they wanted me to determine whether or not the photographs had
been physically altered in any way.

Q. And you looked at that and you saw nothing on the print?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that's all you did?

A. That's all.

Q. You never came to court and never gave testimony as an expert?

A. That is correct.

Q. And that's it, that's the only time you've ever been asked by
anybody, for money, to determine the authenticity of the photograph?

A. To the best of my knowledge.

Q. Do you remember any others?

A. No.

Q. And what you do for a living, sir, is not determine the
authenticity of photographs; you write books and produce videos about
the Kennedy assassination, right?

A. I do that, yes.

Q. That's all you do to make a living -- you also repair photo
machines?

A. Yeah, that's correct.

Q. And that's it, right?

A. No, I do other things as well.

Q. Do you remember being asked at your deposition what you do?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Do you remember being asked at your deposition what you do for a
living?

A. Yes.

Q. Remember what you said?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Page and line?

MR. GELBLUM: Page 14, lines 5 to 12.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did you say this:

(Reading:)

Any other work that you do besides writing books about the Kennedy
assassination, producing videos about the Kennedy assassination and
consulting on films that have footage of the Kennedy assassination?

A. I do repair work on photo processing machines, I do photo enlarging
work, black-and white-photo laboratory work. That's about it.

Is that true?

A. That's what I said, yes.

Q. Okay.

And you're not opining -- you talked about digitization for a while
with Mr. Leonard.

You're are not opining there's any digitization involved here, are
you?

A. I can't say that.

Q. You don't know?

A. I can't say that it wasn't done.

Q. You don't know what technique was used here, right?

A. There's some indications of some techniques being used.

Q. You don't know anything about digitization being used?

A. No.

Q. All right.

And Mr. Leonard keeps saying that you worked in the field of creating
altered photographic images.

When did you do that?

You didn't tell me about that at your deposition.

When did you do that?

A. I don't know that you specifically asked.

Q. I asked you everything that you did.

When did you do that?

A. I did that for all the years that I was involved in motion picture
optical affects and -- and slide work.

Q. Not color stills, right?

A. How do you mean -- I'm sorry?

Q. You say you did at 2 by 2 Slides?

A. Yes.

Q. That was about 20 years ago?

A. Yes.

Q. At your deposition you didn't mention that; you said all you do is
duplicate and enlarge, right?

A. We duplicate slides, but part of the duplication process requires
alteration sometimes.

Q. But you didn't mention that at your deposition, did you?

A. I don't believe you specifically asked me that.

Q. I asked you what you do and you said duplicate, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I don't have anything further.

THE COURT: Okay.

You may argue.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I think that the witness has demonstrated --
look, he's not an academic, not a professional witness, but I believe
the witness has demonstrated that he has sufficient knowledge and
experience in this field, particularly in recognizing a duplicate
altered photographic image, which is what he's doing here, to be able
to testify to this jury.

Mr. Gelblum obviously has the right to cross-examine him on his -- on
the extent of his qualifications, but I would suggest that that goes
to the weight of his testimony as opposed to whether or not he's
actually qualified.

And I think that, again, we have demonstrated by virtue of his
practical experience, by virtue of the experience he's had with the
committee, also on his own -- I mean when I -- I guess what I find a
little disturbing is that this gentleman is -- does -- well, I'm not
trying to predict Your Honor's problem or any kind of a ruling but --

THE COURT: I don't have a problem.

MR. LEONARD: To the extent Your Honor might have a concern that part
of the experience that he has is when he was doing his own research, I
don't know why that shouldn't be taken into account, and so I would
suggest that he has absolute sufficient experience and knowledge in
this field to be able to testify to this jury.

Again, if Mr. Gelblum chooses to cross-examine him on his
qualifications, that would be to the weight.

That's all going to be laid out for the jury.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, the man clearly isn't qualified to do this --
to testify on this score.

Under Evidence Code Section 720(a), he has to show if they were
knowledge, skill, training, education or training to qualify him as an
expert.

He admitted he has no education and no training whatsoever in this
field; none.

All he's done 20 years ago -- if you look -- he worked 14 years ago,
worked for the "National Enquirer," saw some haze five years ago,
looked at something for somebody in Korea, saw fog on the picture.
He's never been paid other than those two times to determine
authenticity.

He's never qualified as an expert because he's not an expert.

His work is in the area of the Kennedy assassination. He knows a lot
about the film footage and the photography, the still photos. That
doesn't -- with regard to -- with respect to the Kennedy
assassination, simply that he sits around his house, looks at photos
and determines whether they're fake, and publishes books saying he
thinks they're fake.

That doesn't qualify him as an expert.

What qualifies him is training, education, experience.

And I submit to you that the indicia of experience that's relevant is
somebody else recognizing he's an expert and using him for that.

He just sits around, literally, and decides whether he thinks a
picture is a fake or not, discusses it with other people in the
assassination research community and they have their quarrels, and
publishes whatever he wants to publish. Doesn't make an expert.

It would be misleading to the jury to allow this man with his feeble
qualifications to get up and talk about this picture being a fake.

THE COURT: I see Mr. Petrocelli coiled at your elbow.

MR. GELBLUM: May I have a moment, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Yes.

(Pause for counsel to converse sotto voce.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Submit, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: Submit.

THE COURT: It would appear to me that this witness has done a little
bit more than what you describe.

He's indicated that he's done work in a field that would involve
alterations or work with photographs, negatives. He states he's age
51, he states he commenced working in the field of photography in
1969.

Whether his experience is such, and his testimony is such that his
testimony will be credible or not will certainly be subjected to your
vigorous cross-examination.

But for the purposes of establishing a basis on which to allow a
witness to testify as an expert does not require formal training, does
not require a degree and does not require prior experience as an
expert witness. It simply requires some degree of knowledge or some
degree of training, formal or otherwise, that would enable him to
testify beyond that which would be allowed as a lay witness.

I think it would be fair to characterize this witness as something
more than a lay witness.

So the Court will allow him to offer that evidence.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

Can we start up at 1:30, Your Honor?

THE COURT: All right.

MR. GELBLUM: Before we leave --

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: The witness apparently has created some additional
material since his deposition that they intend to use. And I don't
think that's appropriate.

MR. LEONARD: It's diagrams.

MR. GELBLUM: It's slides.

MR. LEONARD: Charts.

MR. GELBLUM: They're not charts.

MR. LEONARD: They're diagrams that we were all working with for
purposes of illustration.

MR. GELBLUM: As the man says, he knows how to fake slides.

THE COURT: Excuse me. That's not appropriate.

MR. GELBLUM: Well, Your Honor --.

MR. LEONARD: He's seen it. I've shown it --

MR. GELBLUM: I can't tell from looking at them.

MR. PETROCELLI: I want to remind the Court, they took this position
rigorously with regard to our experts, anything they did after their
deposition, and the Court would not let us use it or rely on it.

MR. LEONARD: These are audio visual aids. There's nothing new
substantively. It's the same photographs.

THE COURT: Are we going to have another 402 motion?

MR. GELBLUM: Can I find out how these slides were created?

THE COURT: Why don't you ask Mr. Leonard whether he can -- he can
inquire of that.

MR. LEONARD: Sure.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You want to do it now?

MR. GELBLUM: Thought you were about to leave.

MR. LEONARD: Why doesn't he talk to him at lunch time?

THE COURT: All right, talk to him with Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: I don't even have to be here.

(At 12 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

ROBERT GRODEN, the witness on the stand at the time of the luncheon
recess, having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified
further as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Groden.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. We left off, we had just very briefly touched upon your experience
with photography and particularly, creation of altered photographic
images.

But before we get into a little more detail about your background, I'd
like to show you a photograph and ask you if that's the photograph
that you focused your analysis on.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 1930.

(Exhibit No. 1930 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

A. Yes, it is.

MR. LEONARD: You can take that off.

(Indicating to Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When did you first become involved in any way in
photography, sir?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Around the age of 10 or 12.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And describe that for us, how did you become
involved in photography?

A. I found the process and the concept of photography, the creativity
of it, extremely interesting, the mechanics. I pursued it initially as
a hobby.

Q. Did you, throughout your childhood and teen years and into your
early adulthood, continue to be involved in photography?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you describe your involvement, at least in general terms, for
us?

A. Taking photographs, black-and-white processing, and printing,
things of that nature.

Q. Now, at some point did you become employed in the photographic
industry?

A. Yes.

Q. And when was that?

A. Around 1969.

Q. And what did you do at -- what was your employment at that time?

A. I was hired and went to work in a photo optics house in New York as
a photo optical technician.

I created film elements through the use of an Oxberry optical printer,
created special effects, inserts, things of that nature.

Q. Okay. Let me stop you right there.

First of all -- by the way, do you have a college degree?

A. No.

Q. Are you a professional witness?

A. No.

Q. Let me stop you right there.

You've used some terminology that I'd like you to explain. You talked
about optical effects and so forth.

Would you, first of all, just explain to us what optical effects are.

A. Optical effects are any one or variety of a number of processes,
whereby one would take an original film and element, and convert it to
another, either positive to negative or negative to positive, doing
dissolves, fades, zooms, inserts of one element into another, adding
titling, things of that nature.

Q. Now, you were involved in that type of work beginning in 1969 in
the motion-picture field; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. After that, did you continue to work to some extent with optical
effects in other areas of photography?

A. Yes. I -- I worked for a slide duplication house, doing special
effects, adding titling, product inserts, things of that nature, in
slide form, which is still form.

Q. Now, the type of special effects that we've been talking about, or
optical effects with regard to both motion-picture film and still
photography.

In their basic elements, they are pretty much the same?

In other words, the mechanisms that are used with regard to the motion
-- motion-picture film and still photography, are they the same in
their basic elements?

A. In most cases, yes.

In the instance where you would be superimposing one image inside the
other, you would use the same technique; except in motion pictures,
you're doing frame after frame, after frame, as opposed to just a
single type.

Q. Why don't, just so it's a little bit clear of the type of thing
you're talking about, why don't you give us an illustration, first of
all, with motion-picture film.

Can you given us an illustration of what you're talking about, the
type of effect?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. There is a vast variety, but as a for-instance, I would say if you
had a TV commercial and you have a background, say a sunset or a -- a
desert or a swimming pool or something of that nature, and you wanted
to insert a product shot, on motion-picture film, you could have it
come in from one side or -- or start very small and get larger. We see
it on TV every day.

It's an involved process. But the main difference between doing it on
film for motion pictures and doing it as a still, is the motion
itself, the movement.

The technique of doing it for a still photograph is basically the
same, but there's no motion involved.

Q. Okay. We're going to -- we're going to get back to some of the
details of these methods that you're talking about. But I want to
continue on a little bit with your background.

Did you continue after your employment in still -- doing duplication
and still photography -- did you continue on doing that type of work
on your own, working for yourself?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Can you describe that, the type of work you did, under what
circumstances, and provide us with some illustration and some of the
clients that you work for?

A. Well, to give an idea, I work -- one of my clients was Glamour
Magazine in New York. If they had four or five individual photographs
of different models wearing a different dress, or something of that
nature, and they wanted to combine them all on a single slide, they'd
send it to me, and I would do an insert effect, whereby I'd photograph
each of the elements separately onto a single piece of film, going
back, repositioning, registering, things of that nature, and creating
a composite, in effect.

Q. So?

A. Another -- another possible thing that we -- say, for a client like
the Quilty Group --

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me, can you spell Quilty?

A. Q-u-i-l-t-y.

If they had a client who had a product and they wanted to show the
product against a particular background for a particular mood, a
forest, or a lake, or something of that nature, what we would do is,
we would create a series of mattes.

Well, let me try to explain that.

The final position of where you want your product to be, whether it's
straight up and down or at an angle, probably on one side of the
screen with maybe some text on the other side, but with a specific
background.

In the background, each of these things is called an element. And each
of these elements has to be positioned and dealt with in its own way.

Q. Now, let me stop you right there. I don't want you to get into a
detailed explanation at this point.

But is what you're saying, that you, when you were working in the
motion-picture field, in the still photography field, creating these,
as you say, composite photographs of --

Basically, what you're saying is, you were creating fake photographs,
correct?

In other words, photographs that were -- would appear to be portraying
something, but actually it was not genuine; is that fair to say?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That is correct.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Of course, these were legitimate fakes, right?
These were for purposes of advertising in the --

A. That's correct. No one would look at a final picture like that and
assume there was a can of hair spray lying in the middle of the air.
It's obvious what it is. It's not meant to deceive anybody.

Q. Okay.

Now, during the time that you were doing this type of work, did you
become familiar with the various methods to accomplish these composite
photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And again, we're going to get back into that in some detail today as
we move on.

At some point, did you become involved as a consultant or analyst for
a governmental committee?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And when was that, sir?

A. That began in 1976.

Q. And what was the committee and what was its function?

A. It was the House Committee on Assassinations and U.S. House of
Representatives.

Q. And what was your --

First of all, what was the committee investigating?

A. There they were investigating the assassinations of president John
F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior.

Q. Now, this wasn't the original Warren Commission?

A. No, this was an organization that was created to investigate the
workings of the Warren Commission and their results.

Q. What role did you have with the committee?

What was your function?

A. My title, staff photographic consultant.

Q. And what did you do?

What were -- in general terms, what were you doing for the committee
as a staff photographic consultant?

A. The duties were several. One was to analyze photographs; one was to
identify issues relating to the photographic images in regard to the
assassination of the president; one was as a consultant for the
photographic panel; as a consultant for the medical panel; answering
questions for the congressmen themselves, if they had specific
questions that related to issues of photography, and as to whether
photographs were genuine or not.

I had input with the actual photo panel, itself.

Q. Okay.

How long were you acting as a consultant for the House Select
Committee on Assassinations?

A. Well, the committee's entire life lasted two years, from the
beginning of 1977, to the end of 1978.

I had actually started working with them before their actual, formal
investigation began, by about six months, and stayed with them for
another six months after that. So I was with them for about three
years.

Q. You say "with them." Was this a full-time job?

Were you, for instance, in Washington every day for three years?

A. No. I was an independent consultant. They called me when they
needed me. I would do things by telephone or in person, depending on
what they actually needed.

Q. In the course of your work as a staff photographic consultant to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, did you have occasion to
review many photographs and motion pictures?

A. Literally thousands.

Q. Okay.

And you were reviewing them, in some cases, to determine what was --
what they depicted, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And in other cases, were you reviewing them to determine their
authenticity?

A. That is correct, as well.

Q. Now, have you maintained an interest in the -- this issue of the
Kennedy assassination?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. Have you published any works on that?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the course -- and you continue to maintain an interest in
that until today?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And in the course of your research and your writing on the Kennedy
assassination through the years, have you had an opportunity to review
and examine hundreds and hundreds and thousands of photographs?

A. I would say thousands, yes.

Q. Again, for what purpose were you reviewing the photographs?

A. In some cases, to determine they're relevance and possible
evidentiary value for the investigation itself; in some cases, to
determine whether they're legitimate or forgeries; in other cases,
just simply to determine part of a time line.

There are varied reasons for each individual photograph.

Q. Now, as a result of your experience as you've described it, your
actual work experience and also your work with the committee, and also
the independent work you have done over the years, have you come to be
knowledgeable about the various methods there are to alter
photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you come to be knowledgeable about the indications or signs in
examining the photograph, as to whether or not it has been altered?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you occasionally consult with entities and individuals with
regard to the authenticity of photographs?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague, "occasionally."

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you -- we had --

MR. LEONARD: Can we put that image back up again, the first
photograph. And this is number 1930.

(Exhibit No. 1930 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When did you first see that photograph?

A. Standing in line at the checkout counter of a grocery store, in the
National Enquirer.

Q. Now, have you, in the past, been consulted by the National Enquirer
to authenticate -- attempt to authenticate a photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

When was the first time that that happened?

A. First time was approximately 14 years ago.

Q. And just describe in general terms what -- what you did and what
you were asked to do.

A. The Enquirer, as they told me, had received a photograph taken by a
photographer at what was purported to be some kind of a voodoo ritual.
The photographer was trying to tell them that an image, a light image
that appeared on the -- on -- on a photograph was a spirit that had
been conjured up. And this was a picture of a -- of some paranormal
entity.

And the Enquirer contacted me and asked me if I would verify its
authenticity. They sent me -- as I recall, it was a contact sheet of
the actual photograph itself and the frame area around it, showing the
sprocket holes on the original film.

I don't know how many frames there were. I don't remember. But it
clearly showed more than the actual frame itself.

And I examined it and I noticed that this entity that they're talking
about was not only in the photographed area, but beyond -- went
beyond, into the photograph area, into the sprocket area, indicating
it was an artifact beyond the photograph image.

I gave them a report on that, stating that, in fact, my -- in my
opinion, it was simply static electricity that had left a visual
imprint on the film.

Q. And did the National Enquirer print that anyway, sir?

A. Yes. Without my explanation.

Q. You were contacted by lawyers -- the lawyers for Mr. Simpson to
examine this photograph, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, prior to that time, had you been contacted by the National
Enquirer to examine this photograph?

A. That's correct. Yes, we did.

Q. Did you examine it for the National Enquirer?

A. No.

Q. Did they -- did the National Enquirer contact you again after their
first contact, asking if you would attempt to authenticate the
photograph?

A. Yes. They called me a second time, and I agreed.

Q. Did they call you back after that?

A. No.

Q. Now, just in general terms, sir, I would like you to describe how a
photograph is -- can be altered.

I want to start off with -- with the basic processes, when they were
begun. And if you can illustrate using a pad how that's done, I'd
appreciate it.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, unless it's tied to this
photograph, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: We'll tie it up.

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

MR. GELBLUM: He'd asked him for general.

MR. LEONARD: I'm starting off with the general.

THE COURT: He's entitled to explain to the jury the process by which
he does it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) If you -- if you can step down to the board. And
what I want to direct your attention to first, okay, is -- if you
could start off with the basic methods that are used in a particular
-- you talked about what a matting method, and you talked about some
other methods.

If you could, illustrate how that's done, with particular emphasis on
the reinsertion of the image onto the original negative.

A. A matte technique would require, depending -- again each -- each
instance is different; it's unique. You would start with an original
photograph, something with a tree and a flower or whatever, and then
you've got a product, can of hair spray, furniture polish, cookies,
doesn't matter. And that's this element here. (Indicating.)

It's photographed as what's known as a product shot. You have a
positioned photograph taken of whatever that insert item is going to
be. And that ends up being the second element.

Now, if you have a blue sky here (indicating), that blue sky is going
to wash out the product shot, so you have to eliminate that area on
the original picture.

And the way you do that is, you photograph your product shot and
create something that is called a black-core matte, the core being the
center area of it. And what you're left with --

By the way, you use -- these are very high contrast black-and-white
film to do this. This is usually something of the nature called
Kodalith. And Kodalith is a piece of high contrast black-and-white
film, which eliminates all the gray scale. It's only black and white,
nothing in between.

Q. The product shot may have individual things that would turn out as
gray. What you would do is, take a brush and you would manually brush
out the area completely, so this is what you've got, a piece of solid
black against clear.

Now, all of this is done in pin register. In other words, take a piece
of glass or some kind of a negative carrier, and you insert two very
fine, exacting pins. You stamp the all elements of the film, so they
all fall into register; that is, they all fall into the same place.

Once you've created your --

Q. Let me stop you right there.

A. Yes.

Q. When you say they fall into register, and all fall into the same
place, can you be a little more specific about that?

A. It's a matter of positioning. If you don't have exact register,
your -- your shot will fall slightly off center, and either you'll end
up with a clear or lighter line on one side, or a black, dense line on
the other.

Everything has to fall exactly into the same place; otherwise, it's
useless and easily detectable.

Q. So, in other words, if -- if in the case of a product shot, you
have -- you have a can that is superimposed over a blue sky -- if it's
not in register, somebody looking at the photograph could see the
effect wouldn't be complete; you could see some space. You could see a
site, the fact that the can was out of kilter with the background, or
something like that. Is that what you're saying?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

A. The next step in this process would be to make what is known as a
clear-core matte.

The way that's done is in a darkroom, where there's no light, or if
you use something called orthochromatic film, which is not red
sensitive, where you can use a safety light, which you would do in
black-and-white processes a lot.

You take this, which again is pin registered, and put on a piece of
unexposed film, which is the same type black-and-white Kodalith, and
you expose it to light, with the black-core mattes falling between the
light source and the new piece of film.

And what you're left with is an exact negative of this, which is
called a clear-core matte.

So everything around that will be black. You have your clear core.

Now, we're up to the last step of the -- of the creation of the
composite right now.

Q. When you say "composite," that's another word for "fake," if you
want to use that term, or altered photograph, right?

A. Absolutely. Correct.

Q. Okay.

A. What you would do is, you would sandwich the pin-registered
original with the black-core matte and project that down onto a final
piece of paper or film, whatever carrier for the image that you want.

Once you have done that, without ever moving this, you go back and you
sandwich the product shot and the clear-core matte together, and you
then project that down in exactly the same spot on the final carrier
for the image, be it film or paper.

And what you're left with then, down at the bottom, is a composite
image of your tree, your flower, your product shot. And you can also
burn in, which is again another technique like this, where you've got,
say, white type. You would project that down from another piece of
Kodalith, and have that fit whatever you want your product copy to be.
And it all falls in and makes a composite image.

This has been done in advertising for many, many decades. It's a
standard way of doing this.

Q. Now, what technique -- what is that technique called that you just
described?

A. Well, it would be photo compositing or matte inserting.

Q. Okay.

And there are there other subtechniques, or additional techniques that
are sometimes used to make the composite photograph?

A. Yes, there are several.

One that's been used, again, for many, many decades is basically a
cut-and-paste situation. You start with your background photograph,
and all you do is, you take your product shot and have an artist very
carefully take an X-acto knife or a very sharp razor blade, something
of that nature, and you cut it out so it physically fits, and you
physically paste it on. That's very simple. That's the way it's done.

You can also insert an area of text, as well.

Q. Now, I've heard the term "air brush," and I usually hear that in
terms of fashion photography, where some rather vain celebrities --
but could you describe that for us?

What is air brushing, and how is that used, if at all, in creating
these alternate photographic -- altered photographic images?

A. Well, if you had two pieces of elements that did not quite
aesthetically match each other, an arm that didn't quite hit or
something of that nature, or a finger with dirty fingernails,
something of that nature, and you wanted to air-brush it out, you
wanted to get rid of it, you take a small, precise spray mechanism,
and you spray over the area that -- that is offending to the vision or
the eye, and eliminate it.

If somebody had a scar, let's say, and they wanted to eliminate the
scar, you would -- what you would do is, match the color background of
the skin or -- however you do it -- either there's a tear in the
jacket or a shirt, and you just air-brush it out. You just simply
cover it up.

The advantage to air-brushing is that it gives you a tapered edge, as
opposed to a very sharply cut one.

Q. What you said, it's -- is it like a small can of -- a really small
can of spray paint? Is that what it is?

A. Yes.

Normally, it would be a jar. They usually use glass jars, which attach
to a little sprayer. It's the reverse of an air compressor; it blows
air, instead of sucking it in.

Q. So it's clear, what does the air brush actually -- is it spraying
fluid? Is it moving fluid that's already there?

A. No, it's spraying, it's adding.

Q. So -- and if you're trying to do a really good job of creating a --
a believable composite, I take it that you -- that you try to, for
instance, make sure the elements are all in register, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you try to make sure that if there isn't anything that's not
quite in register, that you air-brush it so that it becomes -- the
fact that it's out of registration, is masked, right?

A. You can do that or just do it over again.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Now, you can retake the stand at this point.

(The witness complies.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) If you don't do a perfect job, are there often
indicia or indicators of this type of manipulation that are apparent
on the original -- on what -- on the photograph of the negative, are
they -- are there?

A. If it's not done right, yes. It's easily detectable.

Q. Okay.

Let me direct your attention specifically to this air-brushing method.

What would be -- what would you look for, in general terms, to
determine whether there has been any air-brushing-type manipulation to
a photographic image?

A. The image, instead of being continuous grain -- or, for instance if
you look at a hand, it's not just one solid color; they're subtle.
There's changes; there's shadows.

Normally, in an air-brushing situation, you're dealing with a flat
background. If you try to use it in something where there's a great
deal of detail, the detail will simply be there.

If you examine what purports to be an original photograph, using that
technique, what you would detect is a plain background without the
detail, or an irregular, unnatural edge.

Q. And with that regard to the registration or proper positioning of
the various elements in a photograph, what would you look for to
determine whether that exists?

In other words, when you're looking at a photograph and you want to
look for out-of-registration elements, what do look for?

A. Well, you would inspect, again, depending on the method used and
the type of indicator that might be there. You would end up with
examining the edges from where one element would come in contact with
another element. For instance if we were to use a matte insert
technique, if the matte were off slightly from the sizing or were off
-- or the positioning were off, even by a fraction of a millimeter,
you would end up with an odd-colored edge, meaning that didn't belong,
something that would be -- it would look somewhat like a halo,
something of that nature. Either that, or it would be a dark line.

In other words, if matte were too small, as opposed to being too
large, you'd end up with an irregular density.

Q. Now, is there another wholly different type of method used to
utilize to create a composite or alterated -- excuse me -- altered
photographic images, that involves computer technology?

A. Yes. There is --

The technique of digitization has been refined again and again and
again and again, through the last decade or so. And it is totally
different than everything else we've got here.

What we have here are mechanical or photographic or art-type
techniques. In a computer, in what they call the digital domain, what
you're doing is, you are not manipulating a photographic or physical
entity; what you're doing is, you're manipulating elements or picture
elements that are known as pixels within the original picture.

And --

Q. You know, would it be helpful -- sorry to interrupt you -- would it
be helpful if you go down and actually draw what you're talking about
with pixels and so forth?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I object without tying it up. I'd like an
offer of proof --

MR. LEONARD: Sure.

MR. GELBLUM: -- at side bar.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

THE COURT: What's your offer of proof on digitizing?

MR. LEONARD: I want to -- what I want to demonstrate is that, if you
use the state-of-the-art digital equipment and you do the proper
cover-up, if you will, techniques, you -- it's very difficult to
discern.

THE COURT: Is that his opinion that's what was done in this case?

MR. LEONARD: He doesn't know.

No -- look --

MR. GELBLUM: I asked him in his deposition. He didn't mention that.

THE COURT: Wait a minute.

MR. LEONARD: Wait a minute. Okay.

You can combine all of these techniques if you want to. For instance,
if you -- if you digitally manipulate a photograph and you don't see
something, like you -- like you can air-brush it or use some other
technique, the point is, it's extremely difficult to -- to discern
digital manipulation. That's all I'm going to elicit from him. That --
that these techniques can be combined. These --

THE COURT: Let me ask you.

MR. LEONARD: No here --

THE COURT: May I ask you a question --

MR. LEONARD: Yes, of course.

THE COURT: -- please.

What is it exactly that this witness is going to testify to with
regards to --

MR. LEONARD: He is going to say --

THE COURT: -- on 1930?

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Is it 1930.

MR. LEONARD: He's going to say there are several indicators of it,
that the picture has been manipulated. There's a whole list of them.
For instance --

THE COURT: He's not going to be able to testify as to how it was done?

MR. LEONARD: No. And he can --

THE COURT: Then I'll -- excuse me. You know, if you let me talk, we'll
get through this a lot faster.

He is going to say there's something wrong with the picture; is that
right?

MR. LEONARD: Um-hum.

THE COURT: All of those techniques are various techniques that he
knows of, and can alter the picture, but he doesn't know which one
affected it?

MR. LEONARD: He sees indications of air-brushing. He also sees the
fact that the -- that the -- that the -- as he's described here, that
there's some indication that elements are out of register which are an
indicator of matte technique.

THE COURT: Is he going to testify that there are some elements of
digitizing?

MR. LEONARD: No. He's going to say that you can't -- you can't tell
whether it's been digitized, if it's -- it's one point that -- that
it's a very sophisticated technique. All right? And can I -- I'll
explain it to you.

He's going to say it's a very sophisticated technique, and that you
can -- you can rephotograph the digitally created image with, for
instance, with a type of film that has a rather large grain, and it
masks the pixelization. The way you can determine whether a photograph
has been digitally manipulated is because it has a very distinctive --
I'll call it grain structure. It's really pixels.

THE COURT: Is he going to testify that that exists, too?

MR. LEONARD: What?

THE COURT: Is he testifying that that exists in this photograph?

MR. LEONARD: You can't tell whether it exists.

THE COURT: Then I'll sustain the objection as to that aspect.

MR. LEONARD: Can I -- one more. Can I make one more point?

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. LEONARD: One more point.

There's evidence that this -- that the photograph -- that what was
represented to us as being an original negative is a duplicate
negative, if -- that it's out of register. There's a couple different
points.

There's no legitimate reason for what was represented to us in the
original negative to be a duplicate negative. That is, there's very
strong circumstantial evidence that it's been -- it's been tampered
with.

And my point is that, if there -- if there were more than one method
-- for instance, if there was masking, if there was air-brushing, and
underneath all of that, there had been an original digital
manipulation, if it's done right, you wouldn't be able to see the
original digital manipulation.

It's like, we've got a murder case going here with circumstantial
evidence. There's circumstantial evidence that the photograph has been
altered in two of these ways.

And the photograph also went -- went to Paris or London and back on a
Concord.

MR. BAKER: London.

MR. LEONARD: That's pretty unusual. That came out in Scull's
deposition. There's some -- there's a lot -- there's a lot of
circumstances surrounding the photograph that are unusual.

The guy claims he lost his camera and his camera was rebought --

THE COURT: Just stay --

MR. LEONARD: All I'm trying to argue is that there are circumstantial
indicators that this -- beyond the actual looking at the photograph or
where it lines up with the others on the contact sheet, which
indicated -- indicate that it was duplicated, or at least there's a
suspicious break in the chain of custody.

THE COURT: See if I understand your argument.

Your argument is that his testimony is going -- and some other
evidence, or some evidence is going to show that these are duplicate
negatives.

MR. LEONARD: This is a duplicate negative.

THE COURT: And that -- that is an element that you contend is
supportive of an opinion that it's been tampered with?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah. That's a reason, yes.

THE COURT: If you just let me talk, we'd get through this real fast.

And that you'd like to ask him about the digitizing, because that is
one of the methods that can be used to alter it.

But this witness could not establish that, in fact, was the one that
was used, only that it can -- that could have been used, and he would
not be able to know.

MR. LEONARD: No. But it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, as
their expert has admitted, if it's done right, in the proper --

THE COURT: So your main contention is that, if you feel there's
sufficient evidence in which this witness can say that there are
elements to support an argument that it was altered, because there was
a duplicate negative, and that part of the altering could be by
various methods, including digitizing?

MR. LEONARD: Exactly.

THE COURT: But he can't say that is the case here or not?

MR. LEONARD: He can't with regard to the --

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, may I be heard?

THE COURT: No. I think --

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) If you would, step down there.

When we had the time out there, we were talking about digital
manipulation, and you used pixelization and so forth.

First of all, can you just illustrate for us, sort of basic elements
of a digitalized photograph?

A. It's extremely simple.

If these lines weren't so light, it would be perfect to explain it.

But in its most simple form, the entire screen of a digitized picture
contains a series of items known as pixels, or picture elements.

Picture elements are exactly rectangular, be they square or elongated,
into a rectangular form. And each one of those, although they're
considerably smaller than this, represents a single pixel or picture
element.

The total digital picture is made up exclusively of digital elements
known as pixels.

Each one of these is assigned a value in color and density, color
being, of course, the -- it's very obvious what it is; density being
from something known as demin which is very thin or light or clear or
white, to demax, which is dark gray, charcoal black, very dense.

Each of these elements becomes part of the overall picture.

The number of pixels determines the resolution of the overall picture.
A lot of home computers will use 300 to 600, maybe as many as 800 dots
or pixels per inch as its resolution.

Professional machines will go as high as 3,000 per inch or greater, so
you get a far more photographic field to the end result. So for those
of you who may have home computers, if you deal with -- with programs
like Photo Shop or things of that nature, you know that when you look
at the picture, it seems very choppy; they have things called jaggies.

Jaggies is, if you have a diagonal line that interferes and goes
through the middle of a pixel, the computer has to arbitrarily decide
whether it goes to this side or this side of it. And instead of
getting a straight line, you end up with a slightly lightning shape or
jagged line.

In ultra-high resolution situations of 3,000 lines or pixels per inch
or better, you don't get the jaggies for two reasons: Number one,
programs of that nature and sophistication, like computers, have
programs that eliminate the jaggies and tend to smooth them out. The
other situation, which is the obvious one thing I was trying to get
to, is when you have many other things, they become less apparent to
the eye, and you need a microscope to detect them.

Q. Now, if you created a digitally manipulated photograph, and you
wanted to hide that fact for whatever reason, is there a method you've
just told us that it can -- it's -- you can discern these distinctive
geometric pixel-like -- or pixels, rather, by -- under a microscope,
correct?

A. In most cases, yes.

Q. If you were going to digitally manipulate a photograph, and you
wanted to hide that fact so that someone looking at the -- what
purports to be the original negative, after the fact, can't tell that
you digitally manipulated it, what could you do?

A. There are various steps you could do, one of which would be to
throw it slightly out of focus, so that the edges would blur. There
would no longer be sharp edges on the pixels.

Of course, if you'd use the maximum resolution, you could get it in
the first place.

Q. Well, by that, you mean you'd use that, what you describe as high
tech, 3,000 pixels-per-inch-type machinery?

A. That's correct.

And then you'd throw it slightly out of focus, or you would use what's
known as a dithering effect.

A dithering effect is part of a program that is included in things
like Photo Shop, where they tend to average out edges or elements of
each pixel, so it would disappear or be much less apparent.

Another way of dealing with it would be to create a high-resolution
print and then rephotograph it on a piece of film, like 400 ASA film,
or something that's very grainy, and if the grain is larger than the
pixels, they'll disappear, they'll be covered up.

Q. Just -- just go over that -- that point again. Let me make sure I
understand.

You would create a high-resolution digital print using the more
sophisticated machinery, so that you would have 3,000 pixels per inch,
let's say.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered. No reason to go over it
again.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And then at that point, you would then take
another photograph of that digitally created image; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you would take the photograph with a -- what you said was a
grainy film.

What do you mean by that?

A. Grain is an element of photographic film. The slower the film --
and this is a general rule -- the slower the film, 50 ASA, 32 ASA, 75,
100. Slower films have finer grain, much finer grain. What you're left
with is -- let me demonstrate.

This arbitrary shape here is a piece of photographic grain, let's say.
What you've got on film is a carrier, which is an acetate type of
situation, variety of plastic of sorts. And what you've got is a
coating on what's known as the emulsion side. And the emulsion side of
the film has just a whole bunch like this.

Now, the slower the film, the finer the grain. In other words, it's
less apparent. If you look at an 8 by 10 or 11 by 14 blow-up of a
fine-grain print, it's very hard to see the grain.

But if you use a fast film, as you would -- say a sporting event, and
you need to freeze the action, you need to be able to use a higher
shutter speed, you use a faster film.

Well, the down side of the faster film is, it has much larger grain.
And when you blow it up, it appears very grainy. It's as if you're
looking through a screen or a mask.

Q. Well, explain the relationship between the -- the larger grain and
the pixels and to the extent, if any, that -- that might mask the
underlying pixels.

A. Well, the nature of the grain itself, outside of being larger, also
has a granular element to it. And if you are -- if you're showing a
granular element over an already slightly blurred pixel area, it will
mask it completely; you won't be able to detect it or see it.

Another situation is, if you were to print it nonphotographically, say
in a magazine, using lithographing dots, the lithographing dots would
be larger than the pixels, and they would totally mask it, as well.

MR. LEONARD: Now, you can retake your seat.

(Witness complies.)

MR. LEONARD: Is this a good time to break?

THE COURT: We started at a quarter to.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, when you're looking for occasions that a
photograph is actually a composite or altered photograph, and you
suspect that it's possible that the photograph could be digitally
altered, how do you do that?

Is it sometimes extremely difficult to discern?

A. Sometimes it's very, very difficult to discern.

The things that you would look for, the type of indicators would be,
the picture would be perhaps slightly out of focus, less clear than
others within a series, for instance.

Or if digital manipulation is done and one particular picture is
returned purporting to be an original as part of the series, you'd
look for a lack of color balance, or just an overall feel that it's
different than all the rest.

If you have nothing to compare it to, you look in other areas.

Q. What do you mean by color balance?

A. There is a tinting that becomes apparent when -- I guess we've all
seen it. I've seen it way too many times -- when you get your films
back from the lab, they're either all a little bit too blue or too
yellow or too pink, or something of that nature.

But, almost invariably, that color shift off of a normal neutral tone
will be consistent throughout a row or series of rows, depending if
they were all processed at the same time.

If a particular image has been reinserted after being manipulated from
another source, there is no guarantee that that balance or that shift
from what's called neutral, neutral density, ND, there could very well
be a discernible color shift for the questioned photograph.

Q. And again, that's because it was processed at a different time; is
that right?

A. No. It could -- the final result would have been processed at the
same time, but there would have been elements in the creation that
created a shift in another direction that would override the general
shift of the roll as it's processed.

Q. Now, if you are creating a composite photograph, and you want to
make sure that -- or attempt to make sure that you mask it -- in other
words, you don't want anybody to find out that it's actually a
composite; you wanted people to believe it's an original photograph or
negative -- what is a -- what's a very basic thing that you have to
do, keeping in mind that you're assuming that somebody's going to go
back and look at the original negative, and not just the print?

A. You'd have to substitute something for the original negative. You'd
have to hide, destroy, get rid of the original negative, so that it
wouldn't be seen, and substitute something that would convince most
people or everybody that it is the original, in fact.

Q. And so you'd have to actually create a duplicate negative; is that
right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Leading. He didn't say that.

A. I wouldn't say it, anyway.

It wouldn't be a duplicate negative; it would be a copy negative that
would be altered. It would not be a straight duplicate. Duplicate,
using the dictionary term, means a straight copy. It would be a later
generation, creation, and not actually a duplicate, per se. It would
appear to be an original, but it would not be.

Q. Okay.

Now, one more area of general testimony before we get into the subject
photograph.

How do you -- can you explain -- if you need to use the board, you can
do that -- how -- what's the process by which you create this copy
negative?

Again, assuming that you have a composite and that you want to fool
people, you want people to think that it's the -- actually the
original negative?

A. There are a number of ways of doing this.

Again, this is hypothetical, because you'd have your choice. There
would be a small menu of ways of dealing with it.

One thing you could do is, you could create the phony image that you
want. Theoretically, I'd want it to be at the end of a roll, either
the beginning end or the far end, one way or the other, so you don't
have to match it within other elements.

And --

Q. Well, when you say "match it within other elements," why don't you
illustrate what you're talking about on the board?

A. Okay.

(Witness draws on board.)

MR. LEONARD: You can using a fresh -- (indicating to drawing paper).

THE WITNESS: Okay.

A. Standard rolls of film used to come in 20-exposure rolls and
36-exposure rolls.

We go on vacation, we buy film. We ask how many exposures. We want 24.
Gives you less pictures, but it's the least expensive way to buy the
film and less expensive to process. If you have a limited number of
pictures you want to take of an accident, somebody hits your car, you
get a smaller roll, maybe 12 exposures, something small.

That's not relevant for after this, but I thought I'd mention that.

On 35-millimeter film, the film comes in a canister, and the film is
fed out of a light-safe-type of squeezing or sponge mechanism, and
stretches out this way. (Indicating.) It's got something called a
tongue at the end, and that's basically what you've got.

You have what invariably ends up being wasted leader at the beginning,
which is light struck. That area which was outside of this in the
first place is light by light. As you load it becomes useless it's
called light striking. That's the technical term.

When you load it into a camera, that light-struck area usually gets
stretched, so it goes over what is known as the frame aperture, and
gets picked up by the pick-up reel on the far side of the camera.

You then close the back of the camera, advance it by using the cocking
mechanism runoff and exposure, do it again. Usually, about the third
time, you've cleared all of the light-struck area. What you're left
with is the first actual frame of exposure.

Now, the easiest way to deal with a fake photograph, if you're going
to use this particular type of technique, is to make it either the
first or the last one. The reason that being is, if you're trying to
match it to the next item, all you have to do is match it to one
instead of two.

If it were to fall in the middle, between two other elements, you've
got to match it to two of -- you've got to get it to register, to fit.
It's got to fall in from exactly the right spot.

Q. When you say match an element, can you explain that a little bit
more?

Are you talking about lining up with the other negatives or the other
frame?

Is that what you're talking about?

A. There are various elements: Exposure, density, color balance, and
most basically, position. More than anything else, position.

If you were to use, say, two separate cameras to insert a digital
frame, as opposed to the rest of it, which might be photographic
frames, arbitrarily, to get it to fit, you've got to get it to fall in
exactly the right spot on the film.

Between the frames, there is a spacing. On high quality cameras, that
spacing should be either absolutely or very close to uniform in every
single frame. On cheaper cameras, it may not advance quite as far. It
might advance a little bit too far, and you won't get an even frame in
between. What you'd want is, it to fall in as close to normal to where
it should normally fit as if it were a legitimate frame.

Q. You indicated space -- spacing -- sort of vertical spacing. I'll
call it vertical spacing for purposes of this diagram.

There's also -- and that would be the spaces in between the two
negatives or two frames?

A. That's correct. This would be the spacing in between.

Q. There is also spacing or positioning of the frame with -- or the
image with relation to the outer edge of the film, correct?

A. That is correct. The position away from the actual edge of the film
itself, along the upper and lower edges of the film, are what is
called sprocket holes. Those sprocket holes are the device by which
the sprocket advance of the camera advances the film and pulls the
next frame up and gets it to fall into the right position.

And it's -- there are, on a standard roll, standard camera,
35-millimeter camera, eight of these sprocket holes for every frame.

In motion-picture film, with half-frame film, it's four sprockets per
frame.

Q. So if you are going to try to create a false original negative, you
would want to make sure that you have, for instance, the -- the false
frame lined up exactly with the -- with the first of the real frames;
is that right?

A. You'd have to -- you'd have to at least try; otherwise, it would be
very easily detectable.

Q. Now, you mentioned that you would -- there would be other things
that would have to be in the register. I think you said color,
exposure, things like that?

A. There are other -- there are other elements that you would need to
match. Color balance, we've discussed.

Density is another issue, too. If you are trying to match your created
frame, for want of a better term, to legitimate frames, you'd want the
exposure to at least appear about the same as all those around the
original, especially with an automatic exposure camera. Otherwise, the
question is raised, why are the other frames off. You'd -- yours would
be either too light or too dark. If yours is normal, those around it
might be too light or too dark.

Q. Okay.

You can retain your seat -- retake your seat, please.

(The witness complies.)

Q. Now, have you examined various materials in this case relating to
the questioned photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

What materials have you reviewed?

A. I've reviewed two contact sheets, one containing the questioned
frame, one that does not. I have looked at an 8-by-10 frame of the
questioned frame, a print of the questioned frame. A print, an 8-by-10
print of the lower half, or approximately half of that questioned
frame, and also two other frames from the two contact sheets or
negative strips in question that purport to show Mr. Simpson.

Q. Did you travel to Buffalo, New York to examine your -- what was
purported to be the original negative of this photograph?

A. Yes, I did.

THE COURT: All right. Now would be a good time.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When we took the break, we were talking about when
you traveled to Buffalo to examine what was represented to you to be
the original negative of the subject photograph.

Did you examine the original negative of it?

A. I examined what purports to be the original negative.

Q. Okay.

And did -- by the way, you also had an opportunity to read Harry
Scull's, the photographer's deposition; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Mr. Scull represented in his deposition that that -- that the
negative had never been duplicated, that the negative that you
ultimately were shown was the original negative, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

And when you were in Buffalo, did you also examine some other items,
other than the original -- what was purported to be the original
negative of this particular photograph?

A. Yes.

I viewed what purported to be the Scull negatives of three separate
rolls of film and three contact sheets made from those negatives, one
each, and a series of individual 8-by-10 photographs, very similar to
what was supplied to me, that being a full-size 8-by-10 of what I'm
calling frame 11, meaning sheet one or roll one, frame one.

Q. And the 1-1 is the photograph that purports to show Mr. Simpson
walking across the football field?

A. Yes.

Q. That frame 1-1?

A. That's what I'm calling 1-1.

Also, a lower portion of the body showing the feet in that photograph,
as well. And as I recall, for two other individual frames, also
showing Mr. Simpson, one by himself holding a microphone, and one with
a football player.

Q. Now, as a result of your examination and analysis of these items,
have you come to any conclusion with regard to the authenticity of the
subject photograph?

A. Now or then?

Q. Now.

A. Now? Yes I have.

Q. What is the conclusion?

A. My conclusion is that there is a high likelihood of forgery.

Q. Now, tell us first in general terms what you base that opinion on.

A. On initial observation, noticing problems, discrepancy between what
appears actually on the negative itself and the surrounding area,
comparisons of that negative to the others on the roll, and the other
roll, measurements, positioning, color balance and endless -- I can't
say endless -- a number of problems with it.

Q. Okay. Now, have you, for purposes of illustration before the jury
here, have you prepared some slides that demonstrate some of these
problems that you've identified?

A. Yes, I have.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Let's put up the -- first of all, let's illustrate
the contact sheet that contains frame 1-1.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1832.

(The instrument herein referred to as Contact sheet of negatives which
contains photograph of O.J. Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1832.)

MR. LEONARD: Can you pull back -- first of all, pull back to get a
full view of the contact sheet.

Q. Now, what does that represent that's illustrated on the Elmo, sir?

A. This appears to be roll number one of the -- of the two that were
supplied to me.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Can you focus that a little bit better.

Now, you can take that down (indicating to Elmo screen).

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, first of all, where was -- where is 1.1, the
image of Mr. Simpson? Where is that located on the contact sheet?

A. As we view it here, in the extreme lower left.

Q. Okay.

A. This would be exposure 1, exposure 2, exposure 3, and so forth.

Q. Is that the first frame in the roll?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Now, you can take that down, put up the next slide,
please.

MR. P. BAKER: This is going to be a set of slides marked next in
order.

This will be slide number one.

THE CLERK: 2282.

MR. P. BAKER: 2282?

(The instrument herein referred to as A series of slides was marked
for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2282.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Before we go on to the next image, you had
indicated earlier when we were talking, in theory, that if you were
going to alter a photograph and then attempt to hide the fact that you
altered it, and create a copy negative, you would want to insert it
either at the first -- as the first or last frame; is that correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Argumentative. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That is what I testified to, yes. If I -- if I were to do this, and
I were going to make it as easy as possible, myself, I would use
either the first or the last one.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: The next image up, please.

If you could, pull back a little bit, please.

Now, what is in the exhibit number, please?

MR. P. BAKER: Number 1 of 2282.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) What does that illustrate?

A. This illustrates frame 1-1 and frame 1-2. That 1-1 and 1-2, the
first two frames exposed on -- on that roll of film.

Q. Now, is there anything of significance that is indicated on that
slide that you -- with regard to your opinion?

A. Specifically in this -- in this case, there's two things that stand
out. Number 1 frame, 1-1, is as we view it here, which is at the
bottom, is slightly too far to the right.

Q. Okay. It's difficult to see.

Did you create another slide that illustrates that?

A. Yes. It should be the next one.

MR. P. BAKER: Slide 2 of 2282.

A. (Continuing.) The difference is the degree of the black line
between the edge, the sharp edge of the -- of the paper and the edge
of the frames themselves.

Q. Well, using the pointer, can you actually point that out to the
jury, please.

A. Yes.

The edge of -- the right-hand edge of frame 1-1 comes right up against
the paper as a very, very thin line.

The one for the next frame over is out of alignment; it's too far over
to the left.

Actually, the one for 1-2 is where it's supposed to be. It is in the
same positioning as all of the other frames on the contact sheet. The
only one that falls too far to the right is frame 1-1.

Q. Now, why is that significant?

A. We were discussing before the -- the idea and the concept of
registration or positioning.

On a high quality camera, such as a Canon, Minolta, Nikkon, Pentax,
any of those like it, you have what is known as the frame aperture.
The frame aperture is what delineates the border. It creates the
border of the individual frame, and it is fixed; it never changes.

You have film guides top and bottom that hold the film in line and
parallel to the -- to the -- to the frame aperture itself. And you
have a back pressure plate that keeps the film flat.

When you make the exposure, a shutter allows light to come in and
strike the film. The thing that keeps it from spreading out and going
into where the next frame would be is this frame aperture.

All cameras have frame apertures. The thing is that it doesn't move;
the position never changes; it is fixed.

Q. Now, the difference between 1-1, which is slightly to the right,
and 1-2 is minimal, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. But is that nonetheless significant?

A. It's extremely significant.

You wouldn't expect to find any change, in fact. Nowhere else on
either of the first two contact sheets do you find a single instance
of this happening, except in this one spot.

Q. And again, relating back to what you were -- what you had told us
in general terms about creating a copy negative, assuming that this is
a composite negative, what does that tell you?

A. Well, it would tell me that in all probability, frame 1-1 did not
get onto this film using the same camera as all of the other pictures.

All of the other pictures fall exactly where you would expect them to,
in exactly the correct position and spacing. The alignment is --
alignment is the same, side to side, exactly where you would expect it
to be.

This particular one falls just too far to the right.

In fact, to clarify it, just to be absolutely correct, we're looking
at the film sideways. Theoretically, we should be looking at it
horizontally, which means that the --

THE WITNESS: The other way. That's it.

Frame 1-1 is actually too close to the bottom of the film. The frame
numbering is at the top; the identification, the type of film, et
cetera, et cetera, the film speed, which is G400, indicating 400 grain
film or speed film.

You can see -- in fact, it's easier to see it this way, (indicating)
too, that you have the frame itself coming directly to the piece of
paper, and then this greater spacing, this black line here.

Now, this works, when you do it from the outside of the frame or from
the inside. And it doesn't from -- it does it from either end, either
the bottom end or the top end.

Q. All right. Now, can we -- can you take that back.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next slide, please.

MR. P. BAKER: Next slide is No. 3 of 2282.

(Frame No. 3 of Exhibit No. 2282 is displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, you can -- okay.

Now, what does this slide illustrate?

A. This -- this particular slide shows what I observed on the contact
sheet.

There is a secondary edge here. (Indicating.)

What I mean by that is, the bottom of the frame line itself is, of
course, where it turns from light to dark or black.

The edge, the normal edge of the paper itself -- I'm sorry -- of the
film itself, is where it goes from this lighter dark area here, to
total darkness or black.

Q. For now, you've indicated there seems to be a horizontal line close
to the actual bottom line of the frame.

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay. And?

A. There appears also to be a slight shift of the gray values above
and below, that changes exactly at the point where that second edge
occurs.

Q. Now, can you explain the significance of that with regard to
whether or not this is a copy negative?

A. If this represents -- you see here how it's extremely dark here?

Now, with a negative, the more light you get, the darker it gets when
you print a negative. In other words, there is --

THE WITNESS: Is it possible to sharpen that just a little bit, please.

Thank you. That's -- oops.

MR. LEONARD: Come on, Phil.

MR. P. BAKER: Here we go.

THE WITNESS: There you go.

A. (Continuing.) This area here has the least amount of light held
back. It's striking, so it burns it in; it becomes darker.

This area between this horizontal line, as we view it here, and that
darker area, has a gray value that appears to be slightly lighter than
the area above it, indicating that this might be, in fact, a false
edge or some kind of an add-on by relating to that type of phenomenon.

Q. Now, how does that indicate, if it does, that this may be a
duplicate or a copy negative?

A. There is no natural situation in photography that would give you
that false edge by itself. Where the film ends it should just end. We
should not see anything of that nature. It does not occur naturally.

Q. And keeping in mind the process that you've described of creating a
copy negative, how can that false edge be explained?

A. If you were going to create a counterfeit of some kind of a
fabricated negative, you would need a way of registering it, you'd
need it to fall into a specific place.

If you were going to deal with that sort of a situation, it might
leave you with a false edge.

In other words, if you were to photograph it against something else,
you would end up with a false edge, which would look something like
that.

(Indicating.)

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next slide, please.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 4 of 2282.

(No. 4 of Exhibit No. 2282 displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: You're going to have to focus.

MR. P. BAKER: I'll try to zoom in.

MR. LEONARD: We want to zoom in on the black line.

There you go.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, what does this illustrate?

A. One of the strange things that I noticed when this print was
supplied to me is that it showed, fortunately, the area around the
edge of the print itself, of the frame itself on the sides, although
not on the top or bottom -- it did on the bottom but not on the top.

What is odd is there is what appears to be some kind of a line running
between the edge of the frame itself and the sprocket hole area. There
is no natural phenomenon to allow for it. This -- the film itself was
not created with a line already on there.

The odd thing about it is that it kicks back light, and kicking back
light, it reflects light back into the paper itself and tends to make
it glow a bit. So that where you've got the perforations on the film,
it ignites, visually, the line in that area. Where you don't have the
light gathering effect of a sprocket hole, it turns to operate black
then, and when you have another sprocket hole, it comes on then. This
could be the indication of a false edge.

In other words, if you were going to create a composite and
mechanically photograph another negative in register against another
piece of film, and the light kicked back from the sprocket holes, it
would give you exactly that type of effect.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next one, please.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 5 of 2282.

(No. 5 of Exhibit No. 2282 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay.

Now, explain this slide.

A. This is one of the most curious things that I found on there, and
the issue is this: The frame 1-1 is slightly longer than the adjacent
frames, that is, if you measure it with a compass with a fixed
position, you'll find that the compass actually spans the exact width,
or height, actually, because the way we're looking at it now, this
way, edge to edge, precisely. But against the one in question, the
compass falls within the boarders. It's very slight, but it is there.

Q. So that the -- the frame 1-1 is slightly longer than frame 1-2; is
that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Now, how is that significant in your opinion?

A. Well, as I said before, the frame aperture determines the size and
the border of the actual image. If indeed it's legitimate, and if it
comes from the same camera, it should be absolutely identical. It
should never change from frame to frame.

Unfortunately, the negative itself has been cut apart. Everything
beyond the first five images is on a second -- second, third, fourth,
and what have you, strip of five each. The first two have been cut
away from numbers 3, 4 and 5, so the only two we can accurately
determine to measure between the two are frame 1-1 and frame 1-2.

Since we don't know how this would have been created, we don't know
for a fact that the rest of them are actually accurate within --
within the sizing.

However, the frame sizing is smaller on every other frame except frame
1-1, in any case.

MR. LEONARD: Now, can we see the next.

MR. P. BAKER: This is No. 6 of 2282.

MR. LEONARD: And I think we --

THE WITNESS: Phil, can we -- Mr. Baker, can we possibly please use the
backlit large one on this one, please.

MR. LEONARD: Use the print.

MR. P. BAKER: 1931.

(Exhibit No. 1931 is displayed.)

A. This one is very difficult to see. It's a lot easier to see backlit
as you actually look at the print itself.

What this refers to is the -- can we blow that up a bit. Can we get in
closer just right about in here. (Indicating to photo.)

MR. LEONARD: Hold it flat and get it in closer, please.

MR. BAKER: Say please.

MR. LEONARD: Please.

MR. P. BAKER: It's okay.

A. It really doesn't show up very well here.

But examining the print, the original print that was sent to me, I
discovered that there was an entity along here that gives what appears
to be -- appears to be sort of an elongated S shape that appears to be
retouching, physical retouching, using perhaps a brush or something of
that nature.

It's virtually impossible to see here, but if you can examine it on
the actual photograph there it shows up very, very well. The problem
is it's very, very dark, and very difficult to see in this nature, but
the positioning is right along in here.

Q. Now, you've --

THE COURT: Why don't you indicate that for the record. I can't see
what he was marking.

MR. P. BAKER: 1931.

MR. LEONARD: It's 1931.

Can I approach?

THE COURT: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) If you can, sir, circle the area you're
describing.

A. I kind of hate to do that on the original print. Is there anyway of
avoiding doing that?

THE COURT: Verbally describe it then. He was just pointing up there.

MR. P. BAKER: I've got a laser copy.

MR. LEONARD: We can do it on that. You have a print, right?

MR. P. BAKER: Here we go.

THE WITNESS: Would it --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Why don't use the print.

A. Would it be possible to show the jury.

MR. LEONARD: Can he demonstrate to the jury?

THE COURT: Why don't you mark it first.

MR. LEONARD: Mark it first, yeah.

THE COURT: You want to mark a copy?

MR. LEONARD: I think it shows up better on the print.

THE COURT: Well, mark it on the copy so you won't mark the original.

MR. BAKER: Don't we have another original?

MR. LEONARD: I think we have another.

THE COURT: You numbered a copy.

MR. LEONARD: May he demonstrate to the jury, Your Honor?

MR. P. BAKER: That would be 2283.

MR. LEONARD: The copy, 2283.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

(The instrument herein referred to as copy of plaintiffs' exhibit 1932
marked by Mr. Groden was marked for identification as Defendant's
Exhibit No. 2283.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) I suggest you hold up both the copy and the print,
if you could, and walk slowly in front of the jury and demonstrate --

A. Okay.

Q. You can make your explanation there, and then with the Court's
permission, then you can walk down slowly and show the jurors.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

A. This is --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) I would suggest that you stand back and give a
general explanation.

A. Okay.

Q. And then as you walk along you can point out what you're
indicating?

A. Okay.

Where I've indicated in red here is the approximate location on the
original print of where there is what looks like almost a worm, that
is like little lines that appear to be retouching lines that are
diagonal, and it's dark against dark, it's very difficult to see.

Backlighting it, in other words, using the backlit stand, it shows up
much clearer, but -- may I just hand it and they can pass it?

MR. LEONARD: I suggest, sir --

THE WITNESS: It's this darker area in here.

(Witness approaches juror.)

THE COURT: Okay. Don't hold any intimate conversations with the
jurors. Just hand it to them.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You can just pass it along and let the jurors look
at it.

(Photograph and copy with marking and distributed among the jurors.)

A. Of all the things I found on that film, this is the most difficult
to see on that type of viewing situation.

MR. GELBLUM: May I approach the jurors so I can see it myself?

THE COURT: Would you hand that to the jurors in the front.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next slide, please.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 7 of 2282.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. P. BAKER: No. 7 of 2282, another slide.

(No. 7 of Exhibit No. 2282 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you explain this, please, and the
significance?

A. Yes.

There's a sharp delineation through the leg that comes down, goes
straight across horizontally at a point in the leg. This is the right
leg. The tonal value below that is lighter than it is above that.
There's a point where that changes, and what appears to be possible
retouching marks at exactly the point where the tone changes in the
leg, it appears sharper than other things that are within the leg
itself.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next, please.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 8 of 2282.

(No. 8 of Exhibit 2282 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) What significance does this -- what does this
demonstrate, this slide, sir?

A. The bottom of the shoe on the right foot appears to be reflecting
light, indicating a sole pattern. Based on the positioning of that
shoe over the line, it's my opinion that should be reflecting white
instead of red, as the angle at which the light would travel in a
straight line between the camera lens and the shoe should be
reflecting, as it would with a mirror coming this way, if it it's
reflecting anything legitimately at all, it should be reflecting off
of white below the tip of the sole. But whoever did this had it
reflect as red instead of white. And the angle seems wrong.

Q. You talked about earlier the registration of elements in a
composite or altered photograph.

In your opinion, is this an example of a malregistration, if you will?

A. Yes.

I believe the next slide would show that. I'm not sure.

MR. LEONARD: Let's go to the next slide.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 9 of 2282.

(No. 9 of Exhibit No. 2282 is displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: If you could, what I'd like to you do, Mr. Baker, is to
focus in on the right shoe.

That's the left shoe.

MR. P. BAKER: I know that. It's a negative. It's backwards.

MR. LEONARD: Oh, okay.

MR. P. BAKER: That's as far as it goes.

MR. LEONARD: It's okay.

A. Although it's easier to see in the actual photographs themselves,
could we try to focus it a little bit more, please?

Thank you. Good.

The edge of the shoe comes to this point, the red reflection, for want
of a better term, extends beyond the edge of the shoe. In other words,
we should see no red image beyond where the black ends.

If someone had used that matte insert process to reflect down and
insert the sole pattern at the bottom of the shoe, it should fall in
register where it belongs on the sole of the shoe. In fact, it extends
beyond the edge of the shoe itself.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) By the way, as you look at that photograph, do you
see any indication whatsoever of any moisture or the ground being wet
at all?

A. No, none.

As a matter of fact, one of the first things I looked for was that
kind of indication when I was at Buffalo.

The bottom of the -- the bottom of the shoe, the sides of the shoe,
you would expect that it would have observed some moisture and appear
as darker spots.

There is no indication whatsoever, there's no glistening or reflecting
of light, of stadium lights or sunlight or anything else, into the
camera itself at any point, indicating that the shoe is dry.

Q. And the surrounding ground?

A. The surrounding ground, too, there's no indication of any puddling,
gathering of water splashing. One might assume as the heel hit the
ground it might cause water to splash up if it were wet.

Q. Okay.

Now, just one other --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, move to strike as speculation. There's no
indication that there was anything about the weather conditions or the
field conditions at the time.

MR. LEONARD: We'll prove that up, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, just on one other observation with regard to
that photograph, does the heel appear to be flat on the ground, the
heel of that shoe?

A. The heel itself appears to be virtually horizontal, yes, flat
against the ground with no indication of any spacing above this area
at all.

Q. Okay.

Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Can we see the next.

MR. P. BAKER: This is number 10.

(No. 10 of Exhibit No. 2282 is displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: First of all, let's try to focus it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay. Now, did -- we're not going to use this, I
can see that it's not really acceptable, but before we move to the two
different -- the two prints to actually illustrate this, just tell us
-- you can turn it around now. Tell us what you're trying to
illustrate with this slide?

A. Every slide, every frame on both contact sheets has a slightly cyan
tint, that is slightly blue to blue-green. Cyan is a specific color
that's a blue to blue-green type of tint.

Every single frame on both of the two contact sheets shows that,
except the frame in question, which is frame 1-1, which has an overall
magenta or pinkish tint to it. Is the only one that doesn't fit
visually.

Q. Okay.

Let me see if I can find the original prints.

MR. P. BAKER: First one 1930, the second one 1921.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Show you --

MR. LEONARD: 1930 and 1921?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes, sir.

(The instrument herein referred to as photograph of defendant holding
microphone was marked for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No.
1921.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, once again, due to the technical problem
here, we're going to have to have you try to illustrate this to the
jury by showing you photographs.

And if you would just stand up, and first of all show the jury where
the best place on the two photographs is to illustrate this point.

MR. GELBLUM: May I see the photographs first, Your Honor?

MR. LEONARD: Sure.

(Mr. Gelblum reviews photographs.)

A. The two prints in question show a reflective value. Frame 1-1 shows
a magenta or pinkish tint, to the point where just inspecting this
photograph I thought it was a pink shirt instead of a white shirt.

In the shadow areas, in other words, where the -- where the white
becomes darker, or what you'd expect it to be in a neutral situation,
gray, it becomes extremely magenta or pinkish in tone. That's on this
one and only this one.

(Indicating to exhibit No. 1930 photograph showing full view of Mr.
Simpson walking.)

On all the other pictures that show Mr. Simpson or other football
players, when you get to that darker area, it turns sort of greenish
or -- or cyan-ish, so they don't match each other between the existing
frame.

(Indicating to Exhibit No. 1921 photograph showing upper torso of Mr.
Simpson with microphone.)

Did you want me to pass these?

Q. Yes, please.

Again, if you could illustrate where on the photograph they can best
observe this phenomenon?

A. Yes. Around the area of the collar or where the -- where the jacket
tends to cast shadows against the -- against the shirt, anyplace where
it gets dark, where it falls into shadow, the overall tint is cyan on
every picture except frame 1-1 where it's magenta.

(Witness indicates to frame 1-1.)

MR. GELBLUM: Are these new exhibits numbers or is this --

MR. P. BAKER: First one is 1930, second one is 1921.

THE COURT REPORTER: 1-1 is 1930 and --

MR. P. BAKER: And the second one is 1921.

THE COURT: How much longer will you be?

MR. LEONARD: I'll be done by 4.

(Photographs are passed among jurors.)

MR. LEONARD: Can we have the final slide, please.

MR. P. BAKER: Number 11 of 2282.

(No. 11 of Exhibit No. 2282 is displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: Would you pull back, please.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Before we move on to this, what is the
significance in the difference in hue the magenta with all the other
frames and the cyan -- excuse me -- the cyan with all the other frames
and the magenta with the questioned frame, what is the significance of
that, sir?

A. Well, when viewed as the contact sheet itself, in fact, we see that
overall neutral to cyan tint on every frame except 1-1, which makes
1-1 visually not fit, the balance is off, and the -- and the problem
that I described before with trying to exactly match a color balance
during a recreation would, in fact, be indicated possibly by this, as
well as a slightly out of focus attitude of that particular frame.

Q. Could you explain the final slide, please?

(No. 12 of Exhibit No. 2282 is displayed.)

A. This slide represents that the adjacent frames to the -- to the
frames that show Mr. Simpson are extremely overexposed. There is a --

Q. Well, let's stop -- let me stop you right there.

What do you mean by overexposed?

A. The normal exposure, normal skin tone reflective values of the red,
green, whatever, this is a normal reflective green, which is what we
expect to see, and what we do in fact see in every other negative that
appears in number 1 and number 2.

But the ones surrounding -- the ones near Mr. Simpson are extremely
overexposed, and they're the only ones that are overexposed,
indicating that perhaps someone had tried at some point to balance
frames of him to the mean roll and perhaps did not bother to make any
kind of a correction around the ones close to him. It's conjecture,
but there is a problem with that, because the exposures are so dead-on
for all the rest.

Q. Now --

MR. LEONARD: You can take that down.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, based on -- strike that.

Now, the factors that you have discussed and you have illustrated
through the slides that you demonstrated to the jury, are those the
factors that you relied on in reaching your conclusion that there is a
high probability that the frame in question was altered?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any other questions at this point.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to excuse you until
Friday at 9 o'clock.

Let me remind you not to talk about this case, not to say anything
about this case to anyone, not to permit anybody to talk to you about
this case, not to form or express any opinions about this case, and
above all, do not conduct any personal research on any of the subject
matters covered in this trial from the very beginning to the present
time, till the end of the trial, and I say this particularly because
the kind of testimony we received today sometimes lends itself to
curiosity on the part of individuals, and one may tend to want to go
look at photographs and books and things about it. Okay. Do not
conduct your own research on this material.

The evidence on which you must make your decision must come only from
the trial process, that is from the witness stand and through the
evidence that we receive into this trial as evidence only.

Everybody understand that?

(The jury panel answered affirmatively.)

THE COURT: Don't go doing any research, don't go comparing any photos,
don't do any of that stuff, all right.

(The jury panel answered affirmatively.)

THE COURT: And we're going to be dark tomorrow and we will resume at 9
o'clock, Monday.

Have a nice day.

MR. BAKER: Friday.

THE COURT: I'm sorry, Friday. Thank you. Friday.

Meanwhile, we'll wait till the jurors clear and we'll hear the motion.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury:)

THE COURT: The Court at this time reverses the plaintiffs' motion to
preclude testimony of Dr. Fredric Rieders regarding presence of EDTA
in the evidence samples.

I read the moving papers, the opposition and the -- I guess this is a
responsive pleading by the moving party.

Either side have anything else they wish to add?

MR. LAMBERT: I'll submit on the motion, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: I simply add to our papers, I think it's outrageous they
would make this motion on December 9.

THE COURT: Besides your outrage, do you have anything you want to add
with regard to the merits?

MR. BLASIER: There's no testimony offered by any expert in the case to
the effect this is new technology, that this is not acceptable
technology. All the experts that testified in the criminal case and by
deposition say this is an accepted method.

Submit on that.

THE COURT: Okay.

The Court having read the transcripts that have been submitted
together with the moving and opposing papers, notes that the
plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Terry D. Lee is, as well as the other
documentation submitted, tend to support the position that the -- the
testing procedure and the experiment itself in terms of science is a
valid and accepted science and a valid and accepted technique.

So I think from the standpoint of the Kelly Frye requirements, the
objection of plaintiff is not well taken.

With regards to the remainder of plaintiffs' objection with respect to
whether or not the testing done by the FBI agent --

MR. BAKER: Martz, Your Honor.

THE COURT: -- Martz, may or may not support one conclusion or the
other, I think each expert has their opinion with regards to what it
is capable of or what it does or does not establish. I think that goes
to the weight of the evidence.

So the motion to preclude is denied.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: One thing further.

Can I see counsel at side bar.

THE CLERK: Off the record.

THE COURT: Off the record.

THE CLERK: Off the record side bar.

THE BAILIFF: We have a brief side bar. Please take a seat in the
courtroom if you are going to remain.

Thank you.

(A bench conference was held which was not reported.)

(At 4:05 P.M. an adjournment was taken until Friday, December 21, 1996
at 9:00 A.M.)

DECEMBER 17, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1996
8:50 AM

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: There are three declarations regarding service. First one
is as to Brasini.

MR. P. BAKER: In terms of Brasini, Judge, we called the number
provided to us; we sent a process server out to his occupation or his
workplace in Chula Vista for approximately six hours, informed Mr.
Brasini -- that he was there. He wouldn't come out and accept service.

I called him, asked to leave a message for Mr. Brasini, that I was an
attorney trying to serve him with a subpoena. He wouldn't accept
service. And we've tried, now, for over 20 hours to serve this
gentleman; he's avoiding service.

We would request to read his trial testimony in.

THE COURT: Okay. That's not a deposition, but trial testimony?

MR. P. BAKER: Trial testimony from the criminal trial.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Submit.

THE COURT: You're conceding?

MR. PETROCELLI: We don't concede anything, Your Honor; we submit to
your good judgment.

THE COURT: Normally, there are some issues, but if you're just
submitting, then we'll go along.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Declaration with regards to --

MR. P. BAKER: There's --

THE COURT: -- Ramirez and Ball.

MR. P. BAKER: Ramirez and Ball are both in Indonesia. We're only going
to call Edward Ramirez because Ramirez and Ball are duplicative.

THE COURT: These are police officers?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Same.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: Michael Norris, who currently resides in Kansas, we
would request to read in his criminal trial testimony.

MR. PETROCELLI: Same thing.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: We have some exhibits to move in, for the record for --

MR. BAKER: 1239, 1240, 1241, 1403, 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407, and 1411.

THE COURT: There being no objection, they're received.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1239 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1240 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1241 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1403 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1404 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1405 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1406 was received
in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1407 for
identification, was received in evidence by reference by reference to
Criminal Case No. BA097211.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1411 for
identification, was received in evidence by reference to Criminal Case
No. BA097211.)

THE CLERK: 1407 and 1411 were received by reference.

THE COURT: Okay.

Bring in the jury, please.

MR. PETROCELLI: Before you do so, may I briefly be heard on the
side-bar conference we had concerning Henry Lee's opinion testimony on
the subject of the shoe prints?

THE COURT: All right.

MR. PETROCELLI: I reviewed the trial testimony taken by video
deposition, and at page 167, Dr. Lee testifies that he saw one other
imprint besides the Bruno Magli shoe prints, which he was able to
identify as a shoe print that is set forth in Criminal Exhibit Number
1337-A.

However, on cross-examination, at page 320, Dr. Lee testifies that he
is unable to say whether that particular imprint was identified --
excuse me -- was put on the scene after the murders or not.

In other words, Dr. Lee was unable to testify that this one particular
imprint that he said was a shoe print was actually placed on the scene
the night of the murders, as opposed to some subsequent time. So the
only shoe prints that Dr. Lee was able to identify as having
originated at the time of the murders were the Bruno Magli shoe
prints.

MR. BLASIER: Obviously, Dr. Lee wasn't allowed on the scene until the
25th of June. He saw this imprint evidence, which he testified was
consistent with the shoe print. A phenol test was done on it; it was
tested positive for blood. That's the best we can do.

THE COURT: You may frame the question appropriately within the
parameters of Dr. Lee's qualifications of that evidence. And you may
not state it categorically as a determination.

All right. Bring the jury in.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Morning, Your Honor.

THE CLERK: You are still under are oath.

Would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Michael Baden.

Thank you.

MICHAEL BADEN, the witness on the stand at the time of adjournment on
Monday, December 16, 1996, having been previously duly sworn, was
examined and testified further as follows:

MR. MEDVENE: Morning, Your Honor.

Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JURORS: Morning.

MR. MEDVENE: Morning, Dr. Baden.

THE WITNESS: Good morning, Mr. Medvene.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. With reference to the sock or socks, Dr. Baden, that you referred
to yesterday as having looked at, is it correct, sir, that you did not
examine the socks?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you did not touch them?

A. That's correct.

Q. You did not pick them up?

A. That's correct.

Q. You did not hold them up to the light?

A. That's correct.

Q. You didn't perform any sort of microscopic examination on them?

A. That's correct.

Q. You did not turn them inside out?

A. That's correct.

Q. The lighting in the room was not very bright; isn't that true?

A. Little brighter than the lighting here.

Q. But not very bright for purposes of examination?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you wrote on that day, you were doing an analysis, or you were
reviewing, or an inventory of certain items of evidence?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you wrote, "Two dark socks. No analysis yet." Is that correct?

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. And would you agree, sir, that it's certainly possible when you saw
the socks, because of the conditions, that you just overlooked or
missed any blood that might have been on them?

A. Yes, in general, that would be fair.

Q. Thank you, sir.

Would it be correct, sir -- I notice you have some -- and it's fine
that you do -- I notice you have some things in front of you. What are
they?

A. I just have the report of the -- my visit to the laboratory that
you're referring to, and two autopsy reports, in case some questions
come up, I can answer them more quickly.

Q. That's fine.

Is it fair to say, Dr. Baden, that from your review of the autopsy
reports, the tissue, the material that you examined at the coroner's
office, that's all consistent with one assailant having committed both
of the murders?

A. Could you just repeat that question.

Q. Sure. Yes, sir.

Is it fair that, based on your review as a doctor, your profession --

A. Yes.

Q. -- of the autopsy photos, the tissues, the other material you
examined at the coroner's office, that those things that I've just
referred to, were all consistent with one assailant having committed
both murders?

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I'm going to object. The question is -- is
vague and improper to ask him to consider just some things and not
consider --

THE COURT: I can't hear you.

MR. BLASIER: He's asking him to consider just some things and not
everything that went into his opinion. And it's irrelevant unless he's
allowed to consider everything that went into his opinion.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may ask the witness to consider each item, piece by piece.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is my statement a fair one?

A. Yeah, I understand what you're asking.

On the basis that you listed, yes.

Q. And are you aware, sir, of the testimony that it is anticipated Dr.
Lee will offer at this trial, that other than the bloody Bruno Magli
shoe prints that were at the scene of the murder, there was only one
other shoe print he could identify on the walkway; and he was not able
to say whether or not that shoe print was placed there some date after
the murders. Are you aware of that?

A. No.

Q. Now --

A. I'm not aware of that.

Q. Now, assuming that Dr. Lee's testimony would be that, other than
the bloody Bruno Magli shoe prints, the one pair of size 12 bloody
Bruno Magli shoe prints, he observed one shoe print on the walkway,
but did not know when that print was placed there; and he observed
that on June 25, is it correct, sir, that the facts available to you
are consistent with one assailant having committed the murders?

Yes or no, sir?

A. I can't answer that yes or no.

Q. All right, sir.

A. May I ask you something?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Just to clarify. Two things. Do I take into consideration Dr. Lee's
prior testimony?

Q. Just his testimony at this trial.

A. Just what you're representing --

Q. Yes, sir.

A. -- in testimony. And do I take into consideration what Dr. Lee and
I discussed --

Q. No, sir.

A. -- at the walkway when I was there at the time we identified that
shoe print?

Q. No, sir. Because if Dr. Lee has anything to say, he'll tell this
jury in testimony that's going to be read or shown to this jury.

So putting aside your discussions with Dr. Lee, which I'm sure if
relevant, he'll tell this jury, and making the one assumption that I
just told you about Dr. Lee's testimony, he only observed one pair of
bloody Bruno Magli shoe prints on his examination; and he saw one
other shoe print; and didn't know when it got there.

Is it your testimony, sir, that, based on the facts that you know of
as a medical doctor, as someone testifying here, that the facts are
consistent with one assailant having committed the murders?

Yes or no, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Improper hypothetical. Does not conform to the
facts.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes or no, sir?

A. If I accept just precisely what you say, that further would be
consistent with one person.

Q. Thank you, sir.

Now, is it also true, sir, that it would be your testimony that all of
the knife wounds inflicted in this double murder are consistent with
having been delivered by one knife?

Yes or no, sir?

A. Yes, could be.

Q. Isn't it true, sir, from your experience, in face-to-face struggles
between a motivated killer with a knife and a defenseless victim, that
the victim could have the kind of injuries Nicole Brown and Ronald
Goldman sustained, and there would be no wounds on the assailant?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Two victims here. Hypothetical based on a
single witness.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Isn't that true, sir?

THE COURT: Sustained. There's two victims mentioned Mr. Blasier.

MR. BLASIER: He said victim, but no two names.

THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer the question.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that true, sir?

Yes or no, sir?

A. If I remember the question properly, yes; that is, the perpetrator
need not have injuries, need not suffer injuries.

Q. And while the perpetrator, as you said, in a struggle such as was
sustained by Ms. Brown and Mr. Goldman need not suffer injuries, isn't
it, true, sir, that if the assailant had his left arm around one of
the victims in the course of attempting to slash that victim's throat,
in your experience, it is certainly possible that the victim could
have attempted to scratch and pull away the assailant's arm from her
throat?

You would agree that that's certainly a possibility, would you not,
sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And certainly, the answer would be the same if the assailant,
instead of having his left arm around Ms. Brown's throat, had his arm
around Mr. Goldman's throat, your answer would be the same; that it
would certainly be possible for the victim to attempt to remove the
assailant's hand and scratch the hand in the process; isn't that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you saw Mr. Simpson and examined his left hand on June 17 of
1994; is that correct, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were -- and Dr. Huizenga was with you?

A. Yes.

Q. Dr. Lee?

A. Yes, and Dr. Faerstein, a psychiatrist.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. May I have a spelling for Dr.
Faerstein, please.

MR. PETROCELLI: F-a-e-r-s-t-e-i-n.

THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And, Dr. Baden, you were aware at the time of the
examination, that Dr. Huizenga, on the 15th, had observed three cuts,
one of which had an A and B portion, and seven abrasions on Mr.
Simpson's left hand, are you not?

Dr. Huizenga told you that?

A. At some point, I knew that, but I'm not sure that I knew that at
the time that I came there.

At some point later, we discussed the findings. But I don't -- I
didn't discuss it before I made my examination.

Q. But you were with Dr. Huizenga that day?

A. That morning, yes.

Q. Now, is it accurate, sir, that after examining Mr. Simpson, he told
you he received certain of those marks on his hands while he was still
in Los Angeles on June the 12th, preparing for his trip to Chicago?

A. Yes.

Q. And he told you, did he not, sir, that he wasn't quite sure how he
cut himself?

A. Yes.

Q. That he noticed he had been bleeding?

A. Yes. Or had some blood on his hand, yes.

Q. That he doesn't know how it came about in his house?

A. Yes.

Q. And it happened, he thought, somewhere in his home on Rockingham
before he left for Chicago; is that correct, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you, sir.

A. Yes.

Q. Is it correct, sir -- Is it correct, sir, that it was your opinion
that the injuries on Mr. Simpson's hand could have been the result of
a struggle between Mr. Simpson and another human being?

Yes or no, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I'm going to object. "Could have been" is
vague.

(Court reviews real-time computer screen.)

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It's not my opinion, but it could have happened that way, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, in discussing fingernail marks yesterday,
doctor, you said, did you not, that one of the reasons you did not
believe certain -- a certain mark or marks you were shown were not
fingernail gouge marks, was because none of the fingernails had the
skin of the assailant under them; is that correct?

A. No. I -- that wasn't the reason I don't think it's gouge marks.

Q. You were asked sir, can you tell us why, in your opinion, that
couldn't be a fingernail gouge mark. And in part, didn't you say, sir,
none of them had skin on them?

Didn't you say that, sir?

MR. BLASIER: I'm going to object. If he's reading part of an answer,
he should read the whole answer.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Didn't you say that, Sir; none of them had skin on
them?

A. I'd have to see that in context, if I might, because that's not the
reason.

Q. Excuse me, sir?

A. That's not the reason that I don't think they're fingernail marks.

However, if there were skin under them, of course, that would be a
different situation.

Q. Sir, my question was: Do you now recall, in answer to a question,
whether, in your opinion, certain marks could be fingernail marks?

You said in part, none of them had skin on them.

Do you remember using those words?

A. I don't see what you mean, "in part." I said in part or --

Q. As part of your answer, you said none of them had skin on them?

A. That might be an aspect to it, but that's not the reason that I
don't think they're fingernail marks. Because to get --

Q. Excuse me sir?

A. -- them --

Q. I've asked you if you said those words. And you remember saying
them or you don't.

A. -- I --

Q. Just yes or no, sir.

A. -- I remember saying those words, but not in quite the context that
you're indicating.

Q. Is it true, sir, that if a victim, during the course of being
attacked, scratches their assailant, you would not expect to find the
skin of the assailant under the victim's fingernails?

That is an accurate statement?

A. I think that's true. It happens occasionally, but that's very
unusual to happen that way, in my experience.

Q. Now, I'm going to put on the screen, Dr. Baden, certain of the
marks on Mr. Simpson's hands. And this one is, I believe, 715, what we
call number 2.

(Exhibit 715-2 displayed on

the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And that's the -- now I'm going to --

Now, those marks that you see on top of Mr. -- those marks are on the
top of Mr. Simpson's hand; is that correct?

A. On the back of the hand, these marks here? (Indicating.)

Q. Yes, sir.

A. On the back of the hand, yes.

Q. And you see several?

A. Yes.

Q. And those could be fingernail marks, could they not?

They're curved; they're gouged; and they're certainly consistent, you
would say, with fingernail marks. Is that true, sir? Yes or no?

A. They're very nonspecific. Could be anything, including fingernail
marks.

Q. They could be fingernail marks?

A. It's within the possibility. I wouldn't call them fingernail marks.
Could be.

Q. Okay.

Now, did Mr. Simpson tell you how he received those marks?

A. Not specifically. I didn't ask him about those marks.

Q. Thank you.

Your answer is, he did not; is that correct?

A. We did not specifically discuss those marks (indicating to Elmo
screen).

Q. And you did not specifically ask him, did you?

A. That's correct.

Q. Thank you.

A. I asked him about other things.

Q. I didn't ask you if you asked him about other things.

You didn't ask him about these marks that could be fingernail marks;
you didn't ask him about those?

A. I don't think they're fingernail marks.

Q. Sir?

A. I didn't specifically.

Q. You've done this a lot of times, and I want you to answer my
question, if you would. Your counsel will ask you his questions.

Dr. Baden, let's go in steps again.

You said they could be fingernail marks?

A. No. You asked me if it's possible it's fingernail marks.

Yes, it's a tenth of one percent possibility that they're fingernail
marks.

I didn't ask him about them.

Q. You didn't ask him how he got them?

A. Not specifically.

MR. BLASIER: Can you put on 2165. (Indicating to Mr. Foster.)

(Exhibit 2165 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Dr. Baden, you said yesterday, by the way, did you not, in your
testimony, nothing about one-half of one percent; but you said
yesterday in reference to these very marks, that they could be
fingernail marks, did you not, sir?

Isn't that what you told the jury, yesterday?

A. These marks here?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. They could be anything. They could be anything.

I did not think then or now that they were fingernail marks, but they
could be anything.

Q. Okay, sir.

Now, you say they were curved?

A. You said they were curved. I don't really see them being curved.

Q. You see some skin gouged out?

A. They're abrasions. Like, I have one on my finger here, just a
little crust. I can't tell what caused it.

Q. Okay, sir.

MR. BLASIER: We'll put up 715, number 13.

(Exhibit 715, number 13 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, those, you would say, those were curved,
wouldn't you, Dr. Baden?

A. No, not curved. They're lacerations of the skin.

Q. They're consistent with somebody having their fingernail and
causing that mark, aren't they, sir?

A. I don't think so, no, no. No.

Q. You see some white tissue in the center of the photo, white tissue,
white skin?

A. This skin here?

Q. Yeah.

A. And this is a little -- this is tissue, and here's tissue
(indicating to photo). I think this looks more like a paper cut kind
of thing.

Q. It wouldn't be a knife wound, would it, because that would cut it
clean and be a different pattern?

A. No, I think that sharp -- this is a sharp wound. (Indicating to
Elmo screen.)

One of the possibilities is a knife wound or some kind of a more
jagged knife, not a sharp, very sharp knife. I think it's something --
it's something that cuts the skin.

Q. Now, did you -- strike that.

You didn't ask Mr. Simpson where he got those wounds, did you?

A. I did. I did ask him.

Q. Is that the one he told you he got in Chicago, or he didn't know
where he got it?

A. No, no. When I asked him about the cut wounds that -- the wounds
that broke the skin, this, this, and the others, the other two I
think, he indicated to me he didn't know where he had gotten them, but
he had gotten blood on his hand after rummaging through his car,
looking for the cell phone and while at his house. He noticed blood,
but he didn't quite know how that happened.

Q. Ah --

A. Because he often cut himself. And he does have a lot of scars on
him.

Q. You're not an advocate --

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Now, Mr. Simpson got these wounds, he told you, at his house the
night of the murders, and -- somehow, rummaging in his car, with his
car phone.

Now, Dr. Baden, did you ask him to look at his car phone to see if
there were any rough edges, points sticking out, sharp objects that
could have cut his hand in those two places?

Yes or no, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: Over --

THE WITNESS: I didn't quite --

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no, sir?

A. I didn't say he cut it on the car phone.

Q. Sir --

A. I did not say he that he told me he -- didn't tell me he cut it on
the car phone.

Q. Sir --

A. Pardon. He cut himself, and I'm stating -- please.

MR. BLASIER: May he --

THE COURT: Let him answer, Mr. Medvene.

A. (Continuing.) -- that he told me he had -- he saw blood on his
hands, and he had somehow cut himself while in the house and rummaging
around.

He didn't tell me that these were those cuts. I misstated that. He
said somehow he cut himself; he didn't know where. He saw blood. He
had rummaged for his car phone, and that there was -- it was dark. The
light was out. And he thought he might have cut himself there or
someplace else.

I don't know which -- there were four different cuts, these two and
two others (indicating). He didn't specify to me which -- what
occurred at the time. I'm saying something happened, according to what
he told me.

Q. So that I have it correctly -- and I apologize --

A. I'm sorry.

Q. That's okay.

So -- So that I have it correctly, he was -- I don't want to misstate
this.

Are you saying he was rummaging around in his house in the dark in --
with the car phone?

A. No. What I recollect in my discussion with him on that day, he said
he was rummaging around in the car in the dark. He went out to the car
to get -- he was looking for his car phone, and he was rummaging
around. He then was in the house. And at some point, he noticed blood
on his left hand --

Q. Oh, came --

A. -- and he doesn't know what happened when.

Q. All right, sir.

Just somehow started bleeding; that's the best --

A. He noted -- He noted blood on his hand.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'm going to move to another area, if I might.

Would you agree, Dr. Baden, that there's no question that a motivated
killer could have inflicted the injuries that Ms. Brown sustained
very, very quickly?

Those knife wounds could have been very rapid; would you agree with
that?

MR. BLASIER: Vague as to "very, very quickly."

THE COURT: Well, in conjunction with the motions that Mr. Medvene
made, I don't think it's ambiguous.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you agree with that, sir? Yes or no?

A. I can't answer. You have too many things in the question.

Q. My question is, you're aware of the stab wounds Ms. Brown received,
are you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And my question is, could somebody, intent on killing Ms. Brown,
have inflicted those wounds very quickly, sir? Yes or no?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates the evidence. There's more than stab
wounds on Nicole Brown Simpson.

THE COURT: I think he indicated more than stab wounds.

Overruled.

THE COURT: Yes or no, sir?

A. The problem I have is "motivated and intent on." Those are
different issues. I can't read motivation and intent on.

Any killer -- any killer could have rapidly inflicted the cut wounds,
stab wounds and the bump on the head, quickly. Yes, it could happen
very quickly. But I can't tell if they're motivated or not.

Q. Let's talk about that a little bit.

As a man with your 30 years or so experience, would you say that the
killer was motivated to kill?

In looking at the wounds that show he virtually slaughtered Ms. Brown
by severing the major vessels of her neck, would that appear to you
that he was motivated to kill her, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, objection.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Or that it was an accident?

MR. BLASIER: Argumentative. No foundation. This person can't tell
what's inside his mind.

THE COURT: Overruled.

I think this witness can answer the question. You're trying to
ascertain what is motivation and accidental.

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you?

A. Mr. Medvene, I don't think this was accidental. A killer killed
Mrs. Simpson and --

Q. He was motivated to kill her, wasn't he, sir?

A. I don't know what you mean by that, as all killers are motivated to
kill their victims; and they're all terrible. And dying -- being
murdered is terrible, whether it's ten wounds or one wound. It's
terrible.

Q. Dr. Baden, this killer -- this killer --

A. Yes.

Q. -- virtually slaughtered Ms. Brown by severing the major vessels in
her neck, did he not?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no?

A. I don't know what you mean by "slaughtered."

Q. When you slaughter an animal, sir -- are you familiar with
slaughtering an animal?

MR. BLASIER: Objection; argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Are you a familiar with how an animal is
slaughtered?

Yes or no?

A. You're using how cows are slaughtered by cutting the neck? I guess
that -- that --

Q. That's what --

A. -- Mrs. Simpson died of a cut wound to the neck that cut through
the major arteries of the neck.

Q. Like somebody slaughters an animal; isn't that true?

A. I've never seen anybody slaughter an animal.

Q. You know how it's done?

A. I've heard.

Q. That's how it was done here; isn't that true, sir?

Yes or no?

A. Slaughtering an animal is intentionally cutting through the
arteries of the neck.

I don't know if this was an -- if the murderer intentionally cut the
arteries in the neck.

This seems like a lot of stab wounds, a lot of cuts on the person,
which happened to cut the carotid arteries, yes.

Q. Did -- was there, sir, a large neck wound that Ms. Brown suffered
that went around to the spine? Was that --

A. That went down to the spine, yes. About an inch or so. An inch or
two.

Q. And at the same time, she suffered the slashing of her carotid
arteries; isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. No question the person meant to kill her by slashing her throat, is
there, Dr. Baden?

Are you saying maybe just giving her a warning?

A. No, I'm not saying. "Slaughter" is not a medical or pathological
term; may be a legal term, may be a public term.

Whoever killed Ms. Brown, killed her by cutting through her neck and
cutting her carotid arteries.

I don't -- "slaughter" is not a term that I've ever used.

Q. And she would have lost consciousness from the carotid artery cut
within ten seconds or so; is that not true?

A. Yes, I believe so. Once the carotid arteries are cut, she still
could be conscious for five, ten seconds, and then lose consciousness.

Q. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

Let's talk about Mr. Goldman.

Is it true, sir, that the assailant, with a large knife, could inflict
a number of stab wounds on Mr. Goldman's body very rapidly, with very
rapid thrusts of his knife, into Mr. Goldman?

You would agree with that, would you not?

A. Yes.

Q. The issue you raise, as I understand it in your testimony, is not
that the wounds could be inflicted very quickly, in a matter of
seconds; but the issue you raise is how long does it take for the
blood to pour out, so that Mr. Goldman became incapacitated,
unconscious, and die. Is that a fair statement?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Mischaracterizes his testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that a fair statement, sir? Yes or no?

A. It's partially fair. It's partially fair. There's another aspect to
it: The fact that there was no bleeding from the chest, the two chest
wounds, and the aortic wound.

Q. All right. We're going to talk about that.

You told this jury yesterday about the wounds to the left jugular
vein. Do you remember that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you told us about where you thought that blood went. Remember?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was your testimony, as I understand it, that the blood from
the left jugular vein flowed all the way to Mr. Goldman's shoes, and
that's what -- took whatever time you say it took him to be
unconscious and then die; is that correct, sir?

A. The time it took him till he collapsed to the ground; that is, he
was upright for a few minutes, then he collapsed to the ground. And
then I can't tell the time from the clothing.

Q. Okay.

Is it true, sir, the left jugular vein is -- could you point it out to
the jury, point it out?

A. It's right next to the carotid artery that we feel a pulse out in
the neck (Witness indicates to his own neck). That is, on both sides
of the neck, there's an artery that we take a pulse.

On the outside of that artery, closer to the skin is the jugular vein.
We can't feel the jugular vein because it doesn't have a pulse, but
it's right there. It's about half an inch under the skin.

Q. On the left side?

A. Both sides. The one I related to was on the left side.

Q. 'Cause that's where she [sic] was cut?

A. He was cut, yes, sir.

Q. Now, is it accurate, sir, that in your words, there was
surprisingly little blood found on Mr. Goldman's shirt?

Is that and accurate statement, sir?

A. There was blood on Mr. --

Q. Surprisingly little amount; is that correct, sir?

A. My opinion is, there was blood on the shirt. I don't -- perhaps you
can refresh my memory.

Q. Wasn't there a surprisingly little amount of blood, in your
opinion, on the shirt, sir?

A. As I sit here, my best recollection, there was blood on the shirt.
I wouldn't characterize it now as surprisingly little. It was blood.

Q. Wasn't there, in your opinion, about three ounces of blood?

A. Oh, oh, um, it might be. I mean, the amount of blood -- a small
amount of blood can cause stains, yes. A few ounces of blood could all
-- could be all that's on the shirt, yes.

I don't think that's surprisingly little, because it all doesn't get
absorbed.

Q. Well --

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Blasier, 41359.

MR. BLASIER: 59?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry. 41360.

I'd like -- I'm going to read from the middle of the answer which
talks about the shirt --

MR. BLASIER: No, I'm going to ask --

MR. MEDVENE: -- At lines 14 through 20.

MR. BLASIER: I'm going to ask that the question and the answer be
read.

MR. MEDVENE: Well, I just purport to read everything that has to do
with the shirt, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Read it. Mr. Blasier, you can read the whole thing when it
becomes your turn.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'll read you the portion about the shirt, Dr.
Baden.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the amount of -- I'm reading at line 14.

"And the amount of blood on the shirt, seen on the shirt, doesn't
account -- it's a very, you know, three ounces of blood, at most, and
on the shirt fabric. And that's all accountable on the left side of
the neck. "God bless you, Ms. Clark. "From the left side of the neck,
that -- and surprisingly little blood on the shirt. "

Did you give that answer on a previous issue?

A. It sounds right

MR. MEDVENE: We're putting 440 on the screen.

(The instrument herein referred to as photograph depicting Ron
Goldman's shirt was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 440.)

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 440 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

A. I can't tell if -- if this shirt -- if the shirt is toward the
normal position, and not inside out, then this would be the left side.
(Indicating.)

Q. That is the side with hardly any blood?

A. Oh, no. That's blood here. (Indicating.)

Q. That's blood?

A. Yeah.

Q. But it's not as much blood as on the other side?

A. That's correct. This is --

Q. And --

A. -- this is after the body's moved and it's taken off.

Q. Sir, just asking you --

A. Yeah.

But at this point, when this photograph is taken, there's more blood
on the right side than the left side.

Q. And there appears to be, you said, surprisingly little blood on the
shirt.

If the blood is coming from the left side, the left jugular vein,
there certainly is no soaking of the shirt on the left side; isn't
that correct, Dr. Baden?

Yes or no, sir?

A. You asked too many things in the question.

Q. My question, sir, is --

A. I mean, you have about three things in there.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Compound.

THE COURT: It's not just -- excuse me.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: That wasn't compound. He just said if the blood came from
the jugular vein on the left side, is that a lot of blood or not a lot
of blood.

A. It's not a lot of blood on the left side.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Thank you.

A. But consistent with the blood, bleeding down from the left jugular
vein.

Q. And there's no soaking of blood on the left side, is there?

A. Well, this is -- there's soaking of some blood in there, but it's
not soaking as on the right side. But this soaking occurs after he's
collapsed and he's on the ground.

Q. All right, sir. So we're talking -- you've talked to us about
gravity and what happens with gravity. And you talked to us about the
oozing from the vein.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And if the blood was coming from the left jugular cut and traveling
down the shirt on its way to the shoes, for whatever reason, you don't
see it on that photo; isn't that correct, sir?

Yes or no?

A. They're not inconsistent.

Q. All right, sir.

A. Blood can come down and not get -- for two or three minutes and not
get onto the shirt very much.

And then when I lay down on the ground, it sits there for ten hours on
the ground.

Q. So the blood --

Is it your theory --

A. It's not immediate absorption of blood.

Q. Is it your theory that you're going to tell this jury, with
reasonable medical certainty, that this blood you're talking about
that oozed out slowly from the left jugular vein, somehow made its way
across the shirt, basically, without being absorbed, and then made its
way wherever it went?

A. To the jeans.

Q. Yeah.

A. Certainly, because the shirt isn't the skin, it -- it goes down.
And when I say "slowly," we're talking about a few minutes. It goes
down from the jugular vein, on the skin, down to the pants, and -- or
where the belt is. And it doesn't necessarily soak into the shirt,
except in portions where the shirt is against the skin. And it's only
a couple minutes' exposure, few minutes' exposure.

Q. So we have it on the right side but not the left side. It wouldn't
necessarily soak into the shirt on the left side, but it would soak
into the -- somehow, some blood from in here came on the right side?

(Indicating to photo)

A. The right side soaking is while he's laying on his right side for
ten hours, before the body is removed. And then while he's transported
down to the -- to the L.A. mortuary, until the -- the clothing is
removed.

So most of this soaking, 95 percent of the soaking, occurs after he
collapses.

Q. But we have no soaking on the left side that we can --

A. Well, there is -- there's a lot of blood. If you or I had this much
blood on our shirt right now, we'd be concerned about it.

Q. Well, let's talk about that.

You made some reference to the abdomen.

That shirt, you're aware, was pulled up on Mr. Goldman's body, and his
abdomen was exposed between where the shirt was pulled up and his belt
line; is that correct, sir?

A. At the time the first photograph was taken, yes.

Q. Well, as he lay dead?

A. As he was found.

Q. Yeah.

Now, is it true, sir, that you have previously testified that you did
not see on the skin, a trail of blood along the upper edge of the left
side of the body going down to the belt line; isn't that true, sir?

A. I never testified, but that's my best recollection in the
photographs.

Q. Okay.

So, we have whatever blood we have or don't have on the left side.
Then we don't have any trail from where the shirt stops and the pants
begin. And then we have a certain amount of blood in the pants. Is
that correct, sir?

A. Yes.

And as I recall, there was some blood from the left flank wound that
went horizontally down.

Q. We're going to talk about the flank.

THE WITNESS: There was a little bit of blood there.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) So, some?

A. If I may, I'm talking from the first photographs.

I don't know if anybody looked before they took the first photograph,
because there were a lot of things going on before the photographs
were taken.

Q. Dr. Baden, if you don't know now that -- I'm trying to get the
basis for your opinion --

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So whatever happened or didn't happen, we're working with what you
know, to give your opinion. And where we are so far is, we have
whatever blood we saw or didn't see on the left side of the shirt. We
then do not have a continuous trail --

A. Yes.

Q. -- of blood to the belt line, and then we have the pants?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now -- and incidentally, there was no notation made anywhere of
blood or any particular amount of blood on the abdomen; isn't that
correct?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Notation by who?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

Q. From your review of the photos, you and Dr. Wolfe, there was no
notation made in those notes of any blood found caked on Mr. Goldman's
abdomen, as contrasted with his buttocks, for example; isn't that
true?

A. I don't know what you mean by "buttocks." It's whatever the report
is. But we have the photographs as the best evidence.

Q. When you say you don't know what I mean by -- by buttocks, isn't it
true, sir, that in an examination that you made of the evidence --

A. Which day is that?

Q. -- on 2/19, February 19, '95, at the Albany Medical Center --

A. Oh, I'm sorry. That's --

Q. -- that there is a notation, dried blood staining, both buttocks?

A. I'd have to review that. But that was at Albany Medical Center,
yes, when they sent us the material.

(Witness reviews document)

A. (Continuing.) Oh, this is referring to the -- to the blue jeans,
not to the skin.

Okay. I'm sorry; I misunderstood.

Yes, that there was -- there was dried blood on the buttock areas of
Mr. Goldman's blue jeans, yes.

Q. But no reference to any dried blood on the skin area, abdomen area,
between where the shirt is pulled up and the belt line; is that
correct?

A. What I'm referring to there is when we examined the clothing --

Q. I understand, sir.

A. -- not the skin.

We didn't have the skin to examine.

Q. Just trying to make the point, if you saw blood from pictures or
clothing.

A. Okay.

Q. You made notes, correct?

A. No, I didn't see the skin. When we examined evidence, we made
notes. So. . .

Q. You saw --

A. What those notes are, descriptions of the clothing, as we're
including the -- the clothing, not of the photographs. The photographs
are permanent documentation by themselves. But that's just the jeans
that we're talking about. We handled it and looked at it.

Q. Is it also true, in terms of blood, we know we have about three
ounces on the shirt. You told us, is it true, that in the neck area,
there's no swelling or discoloration internally that would demonstrate
any massive bleeding in the neck or chest?

A. Yeah. There was a little bit of hemorrhage in -- from the soft
tissues around the jugular vein, but no accumulation of blood in that
area; yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

Now, we then go down to the pants, if we can.

MR. MEDVENE: And could you put the picture up, please.

What number is that?

THE CLERK: It's going to be next in --

MR. FOSTER: Next in order, 2268.

MR. MEDVENE: Next in order, 2268, I believe.

THE CLERK: (Nods affirmatively.)

(The instrument herein referred to as photographdepictingn Ron
Goldman's pants and a ruler was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2268.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, would it be -- first, in terms of the thigh
wound, Mr. Goldman suffered a wound to the thigh; is that correct?

A. Left thigh, yes, sir.

Q. And the thigh wound was in a vascular area; isn't that true, sir?

A. Not an exceptionally vascular area. There are blood vessels in
every part of the body. It would have been around where I'm pointing,
a few inches below the pocket of the jeans.

Q. I didn't ask you if it was exceptionally vascular. Like, when we
cut our finger, it bleeds?

A. Yes. It's vascular.

Q. It's vascular. What does "vascular" mean?

A. There are blood vessels there.

Q. And if it's cut, it's going to bleed?

A. Yes.

Q. And it's going to bleed even without striking a major blood vessel;
isn't that true?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. Is it true, in terms of figuring out where the blood came from,
that the blood on the left pant leg appears soaked, in contrast to
whatever blood we saw on the left side of the shirt?

Isn't that a correct statement, sir?

A. It is heavier in the pant, in the jeans than in the shirt, yes,
sir.

Q. Now, sir, you're suggesting to us that blood from the jugular vein
--

MR. MEDVENE: Would you throw that shirt picture up again.

(Exhibit No. 440 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) That blood from the jugular vein is going to go
down -- is going to go the left side of the shirt and leave that
amount of blood.

MR. MEDVENE: Now throw up the pants. And -- I'm sorry.

(Exhibit 440 and 2268 are displayed on the Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And leave off that amount of blood, (indicating to
photo) and then somehow when it makes its way to the pants; it's going
to soak in that fashion. This same blood. Is that what you're telling
us? Yes or no.

A. Yes.

Q. So -- excuse me?

A. Because the bleeding -- the fabric and tightness of the garment
against the skin.

Q. Well, did you do -- you didn't do any analysis of the -- you have
anything in your records that you did an analysis of a garment and the
absorption ability of that shirt, did you?

A. I didn't do any analysis --

Q. All right, sir.

A. -- of that shirt's absorption.

Q. Now, what you're telling us is, there was this trail of blood from
the left jugular vein, not soaking the shirt, somehow making its way
over the skin, where we also don't have any blood --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates --

Q. (Continuing.) -- And then getting to the pants, the same jugular
vein blood, and soaking the pants.

Is that your testimony? Yes or no, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Compound, misstates the evidence.

THE COURT: Restate it.

There's been no testimony about blood being on the stomach or not
being on the stomach.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You've told us previously, sir -- remember when we
asked that there was no trail of blood -- strike that.

When Mr. Goldman was found, you observed the pictures with the shirt
pulled up, showing a portion of his abdomen prior to his -- his pants,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you told us a few minutes ago that there was no trail of blood
observed on the portion of his abdomen that was exposed between his
shirt and his belt buckle, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, let's go back to the question.

Are you telling us, then, that this blood came from the left jugular
vein, did not soak the shirt, did not leave any blood caked on the
portion of the abdomen that was exposed, and then soaked the left side
of his thigh?

Is that your testimony?

A. Yes.

THE COURT: Let's take a ten-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case. Don't form or express
any opinions.

(Recess.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Baden, we talked a little bit about your
testimony at another time under oath. We talked about surprisingly
little blood on the shirt.

Do you remember that earlier today?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Is it true, sir, that you told this jury, under oath, yesterday, in
contrast to that testimony, there was a great deal of blood present on
the shirt?

Did you tell this jury that yesterday, sir? Yes or no?

A. I don't recall. I may have.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 152 of yesterday's transcript.

MR. BLASIER: What line?

MR. GELBLUM: 16.

MR. FOSTER: 16 and 17.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you give that testimony yesterday, sir?

A. I said there's a great deal of blood present on the shirt and on
the jeans.

And I think that, as you point out, it was much more in the jeans than
on the shirt.

Q. Sir, you don't recall yesterday, you said there was a great deal of
blood present on the shirt; is that correct.

A. And on the jeans. Not fair to take the sentence in half. Take them
both together.

There was a great deal of blood; I agree with you. I hadn't reviewed
the shirt; that there's more on the jeans than on the shirt.

Q. Well, as a matter of fact, sir, with respect to the jeans, you had
previously said under oath, there was only a few ounces on the jeans;
isn't that correct, sir?

Isn't that what you said before?

A. I would --

Q. Yes or no, sir?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Didn't you say, sir, there was a few ounces of blood that are
adherent --

MR. BLASIER: Could we have a page and line, please.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes. 41364.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Didn't you say, with reference to the left leg,
sir, that there were a few ounces of blood adherent to the leg?

Maybe a half a quart, half a liter could be accounted for on the
clothing and on the shoes, at a maximum?

A. That sounds right.

Q. So, a few ounces on the shirt and a few ounces on the jeans; is
that correct, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That's not what it says.

THE COURT: It's a question.

Overruled.

Q. Isn't that correct?

A. Half a quart would be about 16 ounces. So that I would be referring
to in the clothing and all that, perhaps that much could be on the
clothing.

Q. Okay.

A. And a few ounces on the shirt and a few ounces on the -- on the
pants.

Q. Of that amount, a few ounces on the shirt and a few ounces on the
pants; is that correct, sir?

You don't mean "and" you mean "of that amount."

A. "Of that amount," yes, sir.

Q. So it's true also, sir, is it not, that there was little blood on
the ground when the body was removed?

Wasn't much blood in the area; isn't that true, sir?

A. I didn't see much blood as far as the photographs were concerned.
But the ground soaks up blood, so I can't --

Q. Sir, I didn't ask you if it did or didn't soak up blood.

I'm asking you, from what you knew -- because we're going to track the
amount of blood there is, sir -- from what you knew, there was not
much blood on the ground when the body was removed, and not much blood
in the area. Haven't you previously said that under oath, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection compound.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no?

MR. BLASIER: Compound.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Can I see the testimony, please.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I read you, sir, from page 41359 --

MR. BLASIER: Line?

MR. MEDVENE: I read you from -- this is in the middle of the answer,
but it's the part that has to do the blood on the ground.

THE WITNESS: Might I see it, or --

MR. MEDVENE: Sure.

MR. BLASIER: What line, Mr. Medvene?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry. Lines 1 through 6. And lines 3 through 6 deal
with the blood on the ground.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. BLASIER: Again, I would object just reading part of an answer.

THE COURT: You can read the rest of it on your redirect.

(Witness reviews transcript.)

THE WITNESS: I can't get to where the question is.

Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Baden, did you say at a previous time, under
oath, with respect to blood on the ground:

"So if he were alive and the heart were pumping, maybe over a quart of
blood would have to seep out in the position that he's in, which we
don't see any blood in the soil, and there's no -- when the body is
removed, there's not much blood in that area to start with."

Did you make that statement under oath on a previous occasion?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That's not inconsistent with anything.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Sir, I'm going to -- going to -- strike that.

In terms of this trail of blood, is it true, sir, that if one were
standing, and the blood -- instead of -- the blood on the pant leg,
instead of going from the thigh, was coming from the jugular vein, you
would expect that blood to soak into the top of the pants, isn't that
true, and leave blood in the pants?

A. It would stain and get into the pants, yes, sir.

Q. All right.

And certainly, if it was flowing down and the material were absorbent,
there would be as much soaking at the belt area of the pants as there
was lower down; isn't that true?

A. That varies. It varies on many factors.

The soaking of blood into the clothing in this fashion involves a lot
of different factors.

Q. All right.

I'm sorry to do this, but would you put on 1986, please.

(Exhibit 1986 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, in this trail that you've told us about
that's going from the left jugular vein, we discussed already what
blood there was or wasn't on the shirt; we discussed the lack of blood
on the abdomen, getting down to the pants. And isn't it true, sir,
that before the staining starts in the areas shown on the picture,
there's little, if any, blood on the upper portion of the pant leg,
where you would expect blood naturally to flow, if it was flowing, and
Mr. Goldman was standing up for five, ten, whatever amount of minutes?

Isn't that true, sir? There's little or no blood shown at the top of
the pants around the belt; yes or no?

A. There's little blood. There's a little blood, but not much blood.

Q. And you have no explanation, sir, why there would be all this
soaking above in the area of the thigh wound, and little or no blood
up at the top of the belt line, if the blood was flowing down from the
left jugular vein, somehow not on the abdomen and somehow not on the
upper portion of the blue jeans, do you?

A. I do have an explanation. May I give it to you?

Q. Do you contend, sir --

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, may he finish his answer?

THE COURT: That was an answer.

THE WITNESS: May I continue?

I -- My explanation is that when blood --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'm going to ask you a question, sir. Your counsel
will be able to ask you whatever, and maybe you'll get this
explanation this way, sir.

A. Okay. I wasn't sure if you were waiting for my explanation or not.

Q. Is it your contention, sir, that Mr. Goldman was standing five,
ten, fifteen, twenty minutes, while this assailant was attacking him
with a knife, and the blood was dripping down from the left jugular
vein, somehow didn't stain very much, or soak into his shirt on the
right, skipped over his abdomen, skipped over the first portion of his
jeans?

THE COURT: Which side are you interposing the wound to, Mr. Medvene?

MR. MEDVENE: The left side.

A. No, I'm not saying that at all. I didn't say he stood up at any
point for two, three, five, ten, fifteen minutes.

Q. Stood up?

A. I said he stayed up for two or three minutes, yes, while the blood
came down and stained some areas and didn't stain other areas, yes

Q. I understand.

So he's up now two or three minutes and he collapses from loss of
blood and--

A. He collapses from loss of blood and whatever else goes on when the
jugular vein is cut. There are other things that happen.

Q. I understand.

We'll talk about the two or three minutes we now have him on the
ground in a few minutes.

But, what I want to ask is, your explanation is this blood somehow by
gravity kind of jumped over these areas that you talked about, jumped
over -- kind of jumped over the shirt sort of, jumped over the
abdomen, jumped over this first part, and kind of landed here, this
slow oozing blood from the vein that's oozing out, is that it, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Just yes or no, sir, is that what you're saying?

A. That's not what I said, Mr. Medvene.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Sorry.

Q. All right.

Now, you've now told us under oath he's standing maybe two or three
minutes before he's on the ground.

Did you tell, in this TV program you went on a month ago, Mr. Rivera
and the national TV audience, at that time we had him up at least five
or ten minutes, did you tell whoever you were telling on TV that?

Yes or no, just yes or no, sir, did you say that on TV?

A. I didn't say what you said I said.

Q. Did you say, sir, what I'm saying is that in order for the blood to
flow from the neck down to the shoe, bleeding from the jugular vein,
would have taken at least five or ten minutes, he was standing for
that period of time?

I could play it for you, sir.

Did you say that?

A. You can play it.

Q. Did you say it, yes or no, sir, just tell me yes or no?

A. I'd have to get it in the context.

Q. Whatever context it is?

A. My opinion -- you're asking my opinion?

Q. No, no, no, sir. You're a pro. I'm asking you, did you say it on
national television on November 11 on the Rivera show? That's what I'm
asking you. Did you or didn't you?

A. I don't answer it that way. What I should have said, would have
been -- could have been, could have been standing five or ten minutes.

Q. Sir, I didn't ask you what you should have said, what you could
have said.

I know we're now two or three minutes?

A. No, no, he's alive when he collapses.

Q. Did you say that, or do you want us to play it?

A. You do what you want. I don't --

Q. Okay.

A. I don't recall specifically what --

MR. MEDVENE: With the Court's -- do I have permission to play that
segment?

THE COURT: Only that segment.

MR. MEDVENE: Only that segment.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have it?

MR. FOSTER: Yes.

THE COURT: Would you watch this, Mr. Baden.

(Tape playing at 35:24.)

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: Only that segment.

MR. MEDVENE: Hold it. We're only going to play that segment.

THE COURT: What are you doing?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Just that one, Dr. Baden --

MR. MEDVENE: No, no, no.

THE COURT: Excuse me. You're not going to play anything if you don't
have this thing cued up.

MR. MEDVENE: Here it is, sir. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

(Tape playing at 21:36:06.)

MR. MEDVENE: Can you back it up so we can --

(Tape playing at 34:65:27.)

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

A. Could you go back? I didn't understand the part before it --

(Tape continues playing.)

MR. MEDVENE: What I'm saying is -- sorry, Your Honor.

(Tape played again.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I would object to the previous without -- I'd
like to see the transcript so I can make an objection if there's one
there.

THE COURT: Show him the transcript.

(Mr. Medvene hands transcript to Mr. Blasier.)

THE COURT: Henceforth you're not playing anything unless you have it
cued up.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: I'd object to anything other than what they already
played.

THE COURT: Play that portion so that it's comprehendible.

THE WITNESS: Might I see it, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No.

MR. GELBLUM: They talk over each other so much, very fine tuning.

A. I'll agree I said what I said.

(Pause for tape to be cued up.)

MR. BLASIER: I would ask to approach if they're going to play any more
of this tape. After reading the transcript --

(Pause for tape to be cued up.)

MR. BLASIER: May I have a ruling on my objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(Tape played at 35:11.)

(Tape concludes playing.)

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, does that refresh you that he was -- that you
said he was standing for that period, contrary to what you told this
jury under oath a couple minutes ago, that we have him down in two
minutes or three minutes on the ground? Does that refresh you, sir;
yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you.

In discussing -- would you agree, sir, that all of the bleeding that
we've gone through and described, does not account for the amount of
bleeding necessary for Mr. Goldman to -- to collapse?

A. No, I don't agree with that.

Q. We have from the -- oh, and by the way, sir, you've told us that
the amount of blood in the clothing and in the shoe is approximately
half a quart or half a liter, maximum; is that correct, sir? So that's
-- the shirt, the pants, the shoe, we're talking about half a quart.
That's how many ounces?

A. That's about 16 ounces.

Q. Okay.

And would you agree with Dr. Spitz that we need, in terms of sudden
blood loss, about roughly a quart or liter and a half to two liters,
two quarts; isn't that true?

A. Blood -- some blood loss to what?

Q. Some blood loss to cause incapacitation, unconsciousness.

A. And death.

Q. And death, yes, sir.

A. That's reasonable, yes.

Q. So we have half a quart, and we need another -- another quart and a
half. We don't have it on the clothing, we don't have it on the
abdomen, we don't have it on the ground, so --

A. That's not true. Nobody measured the ground. A lot of it would have
been in the ground.

Q. Excuse me, sir.

You told us there wasn't much on the ground -- strike that.

A. I didn't see any on the ground. Obviously, it has to be on the
ground.

Q. Excuse me, sir.

If the bleeding was internal, Dr. Baden, if it was internal and inside
Mr. Goldman's body, it wouldn't have to be in the ground, would it;
yes or no?

A. If there was no external bleeding it wouldn't have to be in the
ground, but not everything you bleed from gets soaked up in clothing.

Q. Sir, you told us before that as far as you knew, there was not
much, if any, blood on the ground?

A. I couldn't see any, that's correct.

Q. All right.

A. There had to be blood there. He was laying in blood.

Q. Sir, you looked at the pictures, and there was not much blood on
the ground; isn't that true?

A. In the photographs, that's correct.

Q. But that's all you saw, the photographs? You saw the photographs of
the scene?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that's what you were working with in your diagnosis,
photographs of the autopsy and what you saw at the scene around his
body; isn't that true?

A. And lots of other things. I mean I work with many things. But we
can never reconstruct, in any murder how much blood is lost to the
outside.

Q. I want to find the other quart and a half.

Now, Dr. Baden, yesterday, you talked about the aorta, and isn't it
true that if the aorta is almost transected, that you would have
massive internal bleeding from an artery? Is that true, sir?

A. If the heart is beating, yes.

Q. And the aorta we're here dealing with was almost transected; isn't
that true?

A. It's not described though as a half an inch in the front and a half
inch in the back.

Q. It wasn't almost transected, is that -- was it or wasn't it?

A. That is not what is described --

Q. Sir --

A. -- in the autopsy.

Q. Sir --

A. It's not described that way in the autopsy.

Q. We're trying, all of us, to get the facts here.

Now you're telling me it's not in the autopsy. I'm asking you --

A. It was not transected, no, it was not almost transected, but it had
a big stab wound front and back.

Q. Thank you, sir. It's not almost transected. Thank you, sir.

When you examined this body -- you examined the body, didn't you, Dr.
Baden?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you examine the aorta?

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene --

MR. MEDVENE: Yes?

THE COURT: Please don't crowd the jury.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You examined the aorta?

A. I examined the tissues that were removed and put into the formalin
jar, yes.

Q. You did.

You say in your report, in your hand, that the aorta was almost
transected.

A. Can I see that, please.

Q. You just told us you never said it. I want to know if you said it?

A. I don't recall saying that.

MR. BLASIER: Can I see it, please.

(Mr. Blasier reviews document.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Baden, I'm showing you some papers that are
marked at the top "Defense 001004," and it continues.

Are these your notes, sir?

A. Can I see?

(Witness reviews document.)

A. Yes, this page is my handwriting.

Q. Is the second page your handwriting?

A. No, it's not.

Q. Who handwriting is that?

A. I don't know. Possibly Dr. Wolfe.

Q. And Dr. Wolfe was -- are those your initials up at the top of the
page?

A. That's -- I didn't write it, but it's my initials, yes.

Dr. Lakshmanan, Dr. Wolfe, myself, and Dr. Ziegler of the coroner's
office.

Q. And these notes were written at the time you examined, among other
things, the aorta?

A. Yes, when I examined the tissues.

Q. And do I read accurately, "Aorta with laceration and hemorrhage in
surrounding soft" -- what's that word, sir?

A. Tissue.

Q. -- "soft tissue (almost transection)"?

A. That's correct.

Q. Be a fair statement, sir, that that's what you observed when you
observed the aorta; yes or no, sir?

A. That's fair, yes.

Q. So when you told us a minute ago that there was no transection, it
wasn't almost transected, that was incorrect, yes or no?

A. No, that's --

Q. All right, sir.

A. That's not incorrect. It was not transected. It was not almost
transected.

Q. No, no, sir. I used the word almost transected.

A. I'd have to describe what almost transected means. Can I say what
almost transected is? That's from that little piece of tissue we saw
up there --

Q. At any rate --

A. -- doesn't make any difference to what we're talking about.

Q. At any rate, when you observed the aorta, it had lacerations, which
means what?

A. There was stab wounds, cuts, through the aorta.

Q. Did you measure them?

A. I believe there were -- no, I adopted Dr. Golden's measurements of
half an inch each because there's a shrinkage factor.

Q. Excuse me, sir.

My question was did you measure.

Dr. Spitz measured them as 5/8ths of an inch.

A. He didn't measure them. He measured the picture, he measured the
photograph. I didn't measure the photograph.

That's a distortion. A half an inch, it doesn't make any difference,
the aorta will bleed very heavily from a half an inch laceration or
whether it's transected. They all bleed very rapidly if a person is
alive and the heart is beating effectively.

Q. So you would agree that that -- if there was the kind of stab wound
to the aorta that was described, let's put aside when in the struggle
it occurred, it's a very serious wound that would bleed very, very
profusely?

A. Absolutely, absolutely, no matter what it -- you know, yes.

Q. And you would agree, sir, that that wound would incapacitate one in
a matter of seconds?

A. No.

Q. If the blood was pouring out, the blood pressure would immediately
drop if -- if the heart was pumping at the time?

A. No, no. Bleed profusely, but it self-seals as it's bleeding
partially.

Q. Did you -- didn't you say, sir -- strike that.

Did you tell us when we were talking about transected and almost
transected, it really doesn't matter because the blood is gushing out?

A. No -- yes -- no -- that -- whether it's partially transected or
transected or a stab wound front and back, it's going to be a great
deal of bleeding in any of those three circumstances in a healthy --
in an otherwise healthy person.

Q. In an otherwise healthy person, if it's almost transected or
transected, we're going to have relatively the same amount of blood
pouring out, if we have an otherwise healthy person?

A. The two, half inch stab wounds were almost transected, whatever
that means, would pour out a great deal of blood, yes.

Q. And didn't you say, sir, again, on the Rivera show, on November 11,
that if it were cut through, if it was transected, it would be very
quick, very quick, you wouldn't be able to stand within seconds?

Didn't you say that, sir; yes or no? Just yes or no?

A. I think that sounds right.

Q. All right. Thank you, sir.

A. Depending on where the stab wound goes is the problem.

Q. Now, in terms of -- in terms of the blood, you saw, did you not,
from looking at the section of the aorta, that the tissue was
saturated with blood?

A. Infiltrated with blood, yes.

Q. Is that a different word than saturated?

A. Yes.

Q. Infiltrated with blood. And the infiltration with blood, didn't
that mean that there was still blood pressure in the victim, the
homogeneity of the blood surrounding the fatty tissue, isn't that what
that means; yes or no, sir?

A. Not necessarily. Could be a reflection of that, it could be seepage
of blood through the --

Q. But it could be a reflection, the homogeneity could be a reflection
of the blood pressure?

A. -- that there was still blood flowing out of those --

Q. Yes, sir.

A. -- the stab wounds, yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, in the autopsy report itself, sir, that report describes a wound
starting at the skin on the left flank and passing through that skin
into the subcutaneous tissue, went through the retroperitoneal tissue
which was bleeding or bloody; isn't that true?

A. Which had blood in it, yes, in the tissue.

Q. And the pathway was through a muscle that's in the back, not the
abdomen, but in the --

A. Back, yes.

Q. In the back, in the left flank. So there's no question that the
stab wound didn't come through the abdomen or the belly button, but it
went through the left flank, through the muscle, and cut the aorta,
correct, sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, there's no indication in the autopsy report of a stab wound to
the abdomen, isn't that correct, sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. The abdomen is encased in what you told us about yesterday, this
sack, remember, you brought up from lunch, that plastic --

A. It's lined by -- the abdominal cavity is lined by the thin
peritoneal membrane.

Q. Yes.

A. Like a piece of cellophane.

Q. And the aorta is in -- when it bled out, it was described as
bleeding out into the retroperitoneal, that there was what, a
retroperitoneal hemorrhage; is that correct, sir?

A. It didn't say he bled out. It said there was hemorrhage in the
retroperitoneal soft tissues.

Q. All right, sir.

And when you looked at --

A. Which is what we saw on the -- on the photograph of the aorta.

Q. Yes. It showed a bloody --

A. Hemorrhage into the blood -- into the retroperitoneal fat of the
soft tissue.

Q. And I think you pointed out yesterday, there was some hemorrhaging
or some blood that found its way even to the kidneys?

A. No, to the adrenal gland, not to the kidney.

Q. To the adrenal glands?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the autopsy report, there was no injury that was noted to
the adrenal glands; isn't that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So that the adrenal glands are in the retroperitoneal space,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the adrenal glands are approximately 6, 7 inches from where the
aorta was almost transected; isn't that correct?

A. About 3 inches.

Q. Not more than 3 inches?

A. Three and a half inches.

Q. And that meant, reasonably, that blood that poured out and was
observed in that picture made its way to the area of the -- the
adrenal glands?

A. The blood didn't pour out. There was some blood that made its way
to the adrenal gland, infiltrated the fatty tissue to the adrenal
gland, not to the kidney, though, there's nothing described in the
kidney.

Q. Now, sir, isn't it true that -- an aneurysm means what, a bursting?

A. An aneurysm is a dilatation or -- of a blood vessel.

Q. Well, let's get a word --

A. Dilatation.

Q. Let's get a word that I understand.

Does it mean it broke?

A. You and I would understand, in the old days, when we had tubes in
the tires, an aneurysm is like a little ballooning out of that tube.

Q. But if someone dies from an aneurysm --

A. It ruptures.

Q. -- of the aorta, it means, in my language, it ruptured and blood
comes out?

A. If that aneurysm, that sac, the saccular dilatation ruptures, as
does happen as we get older, in the aorta, then it means the person
could bleed from pouring out of blood from that ruptured aneurysm,
yes, of the aorta.

Q. And that blood remains in the retroperitoneal space; isn't that
correct, sir?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. All right.

And the reason it remains in the retroperitoneal space is because it's
-- it's confined there in this soft tissue in the -- in the
retroperitoneal area, correct, sir?

A. Because the peritoneum blocks it off and there's no communication
normally through the peritoneum, so the blood stays behind it and it
doesn't get into the peritoneal cavity.

Q. And it stays in a retroperitoneal space?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, if -- so we know now from a ruptured aneurysm of the aorta,
the blood rushes from the aorta and remains in a retroperitoneal space
because the peritoneum is protected by that thin membrane, right?

MR. BLASIER: I'm going to object. There's no testimony there was an
aneurysm.

THE COURT: Sustained.

And let's move it on.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, in -- in this case, sir, there being no wound
to the abdomen, isn't it true that the only -- and the abdomen being
in the peritoneum, that one explanation for the fact that there's a
hundred or 200 cc's of blood in the abdominal cavity is that the tip
of the knife that sliced the aorta went through the retroperitoneal
area and nicked the membrane of the peritoneum?

A. It went through the membrane communicating with the abdominal
cavity, that is my opinion, that it caused the bleeding.

Q. It caused some leakage of blood from the retroperitoneum?

A. No, no, not from the retroperitoneum. From the aorta.

See, as in your diagram, it made a -- the stab wound that comes out
the front goes right into the peritoneal cavity, and there's a direct
communication between the aorta and the peritoneum, and that caused
the 100 cc, 3 ounces, of bleeding into that cavity.

Q. There's only -- when we say direct communication, to be more
precise, you've told us that on a ruptured aneurysm of the aorta, the
blood will stay inside the retroperitoneal cavity and not go into the
peritoneum?

A. Usually because the peritoneum isn't ruptured, but sometimes it can
go.

Q. It's only if the peritoneum is ruptured by possibly a tip of a
knife. In this situation, where some blood could ooze from the
retroperitoneum from the aorta into the peritoneum; isn't that
correct?

A. Directly from the -- yes, directly from the aorta into the
peritoneal cavity.

Q. All right, sir.

A. As I diagram on that diagram you have.

Q. Now, did you speak -- strike that.

You told us, several times on your direct, that you spoke to Dr.
Golden; is that correct?

A. It's true. I did speak to Dr. Golden, yes.

Q. And did you ask Dr. Golden whether or not it was true that there
was massive bleeding in the retroperitoneal area that resulted from
the almost transection of the aorta? Did you ask him that question?

A. I asked him two questions.

Q. No, no, no, no, sir. I asked --

A. I asked two, after discussing matters with Dr. Golden --

Q. Excuse me --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Would you listen to the question and answer the question instead of
arguing with the lawyer.

MR. BAKER: I object to the Court's statement.

THE COURT: Well, objection is overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you ask him that question, sir?

A. Can you repeat the question, please, so I understand the question.

Did I ask him what?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, may the recorder read back the
question.

THE COURT: Read it.

(Reporter reads the record as follows:)

Q. And did you ask Dr. Golden whether or not it was true that there
was massive bleeding in the retroperitoneal area that resulted from
the almost transection of the aorta?

Did you ask him that question?

THE WITNESS: You have three things.

THE COURT: Could you just answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: No, to the whole question.

THE COURT: Ask another question.

THE WITNES: Yes, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir. I'm about done.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You told us earlier today that whatever the first
wound or second wound, that Mr. Goldman slumped to the ground, I think
you said after -- is it two or three minutes?

A. Yeah, I think two or three minutes, or could have been five or ten
minutes but --

Q. Well, could have?

A. I mean I don't think there -- I think it was pretty quick.

Q. Pretty quick?

A. That is within minutes.

Q. And it's your theory, then, that it could have been two minutes,
that after the two minutes, that the assailant then, seeing him still
breathing after maybe two minutes, goes over and inflicts wounds to
the lungs, the aorta, the abdomen and the neck?

Is that your theory, sir; yes or no?

A. My --

Q. No, no. Is that your theory?

A. I don't know he saw him breathing.

You're asking me questions that have six different things in them. If
you can ask me one at a time, I can answer them.

I don't know if he saw him breathing.

Q. All right, sir.

Let's check it.

Did you say, sir, at a previous occasion under oath, 41384:

(Reading:)

I think it was dark and the perpetrator wasn't sure that Mr. Goldman
was dead. That's why five minutes later or ten minutes later,
additional stab wounds were made, because Mr. Goldman, while he was
bleeding from the neck, would have collapsed to the ground after a few
minutes, would have been breathing, and then additional wounds were
made on the body while I believe he was lying on the ground, which
included the lungs, the aorta, the abdomen and also the neck could
have been cut.

Did --

A. I'll agree with that, yes.

Q. All right.

So now we've moved our time to two minutes we have him breathing?

A. No, could you -- okay, I agree with just what you read, just what
you read, I agree with a few minutes, whatever that is.

Q. Okay.

So you've told us two, three, five, ten, but whatever it is, I think
the latest you told us earlier today was two or three?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) All right.

So he's on the ground, and then the assailant sees him breathing and
finishes him off?

A. The assailant -- he's on the ground, and additional stab wounds are
inflicted upon him when he's on the ground, yes.

Q. Okay.

And those wounds, as far as you know, could well have been inflicted
the moment, even on your theory, the moment after he fell to the
ground; yes or no?

Yes or no, sir?

A. Yes, if I could explain it, but I -- okay.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much.

BY MR. BLASIER: Go ahead and explain it.

THE COURT: Five minutes recess, ladies and gentlemen, or make it ten.

Bring them back in 10 minutes.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, you may proceed.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we move in as 603 the one page of
the notes that we questioned Mr. Baden about, 2268, and 440.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 603.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 2268.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 440.)

THE COURT: Okay. Proceed.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Dr. Baden, you recall yesterday when at the beginning of the
cross-examination, Mr. Medvene asked you questions about whether you
were trying to mislead the jury about your opinion with respect to one
or more perpetrators?

A. I think so, yes.

Q. And he was suggesting that you had testified to the jury that you
thought, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, there was more
than one perpetrator?

A. Yes, I remember.

Q. Reading from page 145 of yesterday's transcript, do you recall this
question and giving the following answer with respect to that opinion.

(Reading:) Q. What is your opinion?

A. My opinion is that it's -- based on all the evidence and all the
circumstances that it's more likely that there were more than one
perpetrator.

A. Yes, that was -- I recall, and that is my opinion. More likely
being -- more likely than not.

Q. Now, Mr. Medvene asked you a bunch of questions about whether
certain things were possible.

How do you interpret that term, possible, in terms of whether it's
something likely or not?

A. Possible means any circumstance which something could happen. It
could be less than one-hundredth of one percent. Is it possible
there's a dog out the door there. It's possible, I don't think so, but
it's within the realm of possibility.

Q. In terms of an expert testifying to various opinions, does that
standard really have much meaning at all?

A. I think it doesn't have any meaning as far as giving opinion to
agree with the possibility except that the jury or the judge
understands that that kind of an opinion has a lot less weight in my
-- in my -- in my opinion, has much less weight, in my opinion, than
opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, 95 percent, or
more likely than not being 51 percent.

Q. And how about when you're asked the question whether something is
consistent with something else, what does that mean?

A. It depends on the circumstances. But consistent with something,
consistent with could be consistent one percent or could be consistent
50 or 60 percent.

Q. So would you agree that we're asked questions about whether
something is possible or whether something is consistent with
something else that you're not being asked any kind of question about
your quantitative assessment of whether that happened or not?

A. That's correct. It's not an opinion of whether it happened that
way, but whether there's any chance that it might have happened that
way.

Q. Now, Mr. Medvene asked you some questions yesterday about your
background.

Did we talk about your entire background when I asked you questions?

A. No, you didn't go much into my background.

Q. We left a lot of that out, didn't we?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you went from the New York City Medical Examiner's Office to
the New York State Police in 1985, '86?

A. '85, '86, yes.

Q. And Mr. Medvene asked you some questions about whether you were
fired.

You weren't fired, were you?

A. No, I was never fired.

Q. In the late 70's did you have a dispute with Mayor Ed Koch of the
City of New York?

A. Yes.

Q. And describe that dispute.

A. I was -- when I was chief medical examiner in the City of New York
which is that I had been working in the office since 1960, deputy
chief medical examiner since 1966, and in 1978 I was appointed chief
medical examiner. And I had a dispute with one of the five district
attorneys we work with and with the Mayor as to the independence of
the medical examiner's office.

Q. What was the -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.

A. And that led to my being demoted to being back to deputy chief
medical examiner.

Q. What was the dispute about?

A. The dispute was about the independence of the medical examiner's
office, specifically listed a complaint from one district attorney in
New York City which has five counties; Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island
-- each county has a district attorney and there's one medical
examiner for five counties, and one of the five district attorneys
felt I wasn't a team player and I wasn't cooperative in giving
evidence to help in the prosecution of cases.

Q. They wanted you to testify in a couple of cases to something you
didn't agree with; isn't that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you refused, didn't you?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, you were also asked about your billing in this case.

Your understanding is that Mr. Simpson has no funds at this point?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You can ask him about his billing.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry?

THE COURT: You can ask him about his billing.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay.

Mr. Medvene asked you a question about changing your billing in a
high-profile case.

You work on high-profile cases all the time, don't you?

A. Not uncommonly, yes.

Q. And it's -- incidentally, when was the last time that the Los
Angeles District Attorney's office asked you to consult with them on a
case?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, materiality, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Past month.

Q. They contacted you yesterday?

A. Sent some stuff yesterday, yes, some autopsy report.

Q. Now, why don't you tell the folks on the jury, we didn't cover it
yesterday, some of your teaching positions.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I have -- I have various appointments to teach in medical schools,
law schools and criminal justice schools on a part-time basis, aspects
of forensic medicine, forensic pathology, and forensic science, which
include, presently, visiting professor of pathology at Albert Einstein
School of Medicine, adjunct professor of laboratory medicine in
pathology at Albany Medical Center, and I teach some terms as visiting
professor at John Jay School of Criminal Justice and New York Law
School in New York.

And I hold various other teaching positions, all of which are
part-time, for medical students, law students and the police in
training.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Have you won many awards that we never even talked
about yesterday?

A. I've received many awards, yes.

Q. Now, you were asked some questions about the Geraldo show on
November 11.

At what point was your appearance scheduled for the Geraldo show; how
long before that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. About a week or two before I appeared.

Q. And who scheduled it for you?

A. It was scheduled through HBO, Home Box Office television program.

Q. And what was supposedly the reason for the appearance?

A. The reason for the appearance was to talk about and publicize a
special program on autopsy that HBO had just completed.

Q. And that program features you, primarily?

A. I was the consultant.

This is a third in the series, every year there's a new one, and it
has to do with how you use forensic science and investigation of
injuries and death, and yes, I'm featured in it.

Q. Incidentally, in any of those three specialties, will any of Dr.
Spitz's cases be featured?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, you were asked questions yesterday
about -- with respect to your opinion about more than one perpetrator,
and you were asked questions about shoe prints at the crime scene,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's talk about your basis for saying that it's more likely than
not that there was more than one perpetrator.

What information do you have about shoe prints that goes into that
opinion?

A. The information I have is there's evidence of more than one type of
shoe print at the Bundy crime scene, and on the envelope in which the
eyeglasses were found at the crime scene, and also on the jeans that
Mr. Goldman was wearing, and other shoe prints in the walkway leading
up to the gate, outside the gate.

Q. The shoe print that Mr. Medvene was asking you about Dr. Lee's
testimony, tell us about that shoe print; when did you observe -- did
you observe that personally?

A. Yes.

Q. And when was that?

A. About the first week of the -- after the -- in the week following
our examination of Mr. Simpson on June 17, just before he was
arrested, just before he was taken into custody or arrested, Dr. Lee
and I and the other doctors examined Mr. Simpson, and the following
week we went to the various scenes, the Bundy scene in particular, and
examined the walk and the area for evidence.

And in one of those first reviews, when we went to the scene, there
was evidence of -- remnants of bloody shoe prints, and Dr. Lee and I
looked at them together, and he did blood tests. He has a little kit
to do tests, presumptive blood tests. And there was one print there
that didn't match the other prints.

Q. And it tested positive for blood?

A. And that tested positive for blood, yes, tested positive in a
presumptive test for blood.

Q. Let me show you Exhibit 717.

And you mentioned shoe prints in the walkway area in front of Bundy.

(Exhibit 717 displayed.)

Q. Now, can you see -- actually, let me show you 2214 first. And I
apologize for this picture.

(Exhibit 2214 displayed.)

Q. Dr. Baden, do you see the --

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Is that consistent with the Bruno Magli shoe print?

A. It's a shoe print.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Consistent with a shoe print?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, lack of foundation Your Honor.

THE COURT: As to shoe print, overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that one of the shoe prints you were talking
about when you just answered my prior questions?

A. Yeah. This isn't one that I looked at with Dr. Lee, this is one I
took into account in answering your previous question.

Q. And let's look at 717.

MR. PETROCELLI: What was that exhibit?

MR. BLASIER: 2214.

Back on out.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Then this one --

MR. MEDVENE: What exhibit is this?

MR. BLASIER: 714 I believe.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, is this another indication of a shoe
print.

THE COURT: What did you call this? What did you call this.

MR. P. BAKER: It's 717. It's also marked as 2257 I believe.

THE COURT: I'm sorry. Go ahead.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is this one of the ones you observed as well on
the pictures?

A. In the picture, yes.

MR. BLASIER: Let's back that out so we can see where that is.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And that appears to be a number of feet out toward
the Bundy walkway, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And describe what you observed about those shoe prints that go into
your opinion about the number of perpetrators?

A. The two shoe prints are in clotted blood. That is, the shoe print
was made after the blood had congealed, so that after bleeding had
occurred from Mrs. Simpson, and it indicated that there was movement
in and walking around within a few minutes of Mrs. Simpson's collapse.

Q. Well, you say within a few minutes, what -- can we estimate that to
any degree of particularity?

A. Yeah. It would -- the blood remains pretty liquid, like water, for
a few minutes and if you stepped into blood one or two or three
minutes after it was shed, the blood would just -- it's like stepping
into water, it would not leave a permanent impression.

So in order for this permanent impression to remain there, the blood
would have had to have clotted sufficiently to maintain its shape
without liquefying, you know, disappearing, and that would take at
least three to four to five minutes of clotting.

Q. That would be after the blood had a chance to get down this far in
the walkway, correct?

A. As it was traveling down and after, yes.

Q. And that would take some time as well?

A. Yes.

THE COURT REPORTER: One more time, that current exhibit?

MR. P. BAKER: 2257.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Incidentally, when you examined or looked at the
socks; you were prevented from actually examining them, weren't you?

A. I was not permitted to pick them up or to examine them in any way
other than to view and inventory the evidence that was there; I'd say
about 59 pieces of evidence.

Q. And it was Detective Vannatter that refused to let you even touch
anything, correct?

A. He was the one who told me that I couldn't -- we couldn't examine,
touch anything or photograph anything.

Q. Now, do you recall this morning, during cross-examination, Mr.
Medvene asked you a couple of questions where he used a hypothetical
where he had his arm around his neck; do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. If either of the victims in this case had a perpetrator's arm
around their neck as Mr. Medvene demonstrated, what would happen if
the perpetrator tried to cut the neck with the right hand?

A. Well, so long as an arm, or any object, was present on the neck,
that would interfere with the ability to cut the neck.

Q. Cut the arm first, wouldn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, with respect to the fingernail -- the absence of skin under a
person's fingernails that may have scraped the perpetrator, is it your
opinion that you usually don't find skin?

A. That's correct.

Q. You can find blood, can't you?

A. That's more frequent than skin.

Q. And what's another mechanism by -- when somebody is scraped with a
fingernail, what do you expect to see on the skin?

A. A scratch, a scratch mark.

Q. And what happens to the person's skin, is it transferred to the
fingernail or does it stay on the person that's being scratched?

A. It can stay -- usually stays on the victim being scratched. It's
like being scratched by a cat or some other animal. The skin is pushed
aside.

Q. Is that -- is that what's called an evulsion?

A. It would be called an evulsion. It's a very minor evulsion. An
evulsion would be a tearing of the skin. This would be a very minor
tearing of the skin, yes.

Q. Now, you were asked about blood on Mr. Goldman's clothing.

Let's talk about his shirt first.

Well, let's talk about the ground first.

Is it your understanding that Mr. Goldman's body was allowed to lie on
the ground for 10 hours before anybody collected it?

A. Yes, at least that.

Q. What happens to blood in dirt?

A. It would be absorbed and it would not be possible to distinguish
blood from dirt after a period of time. Certainly, the majority of
whatever blood gets into dirt would be absorbed or made unrecognizable
--

Q. Now --

A. -- over a 10-hour period of time.

Q. Now, is it true that if there was internal bleeding, however,
especially with no wound to the abdomen, had there been massive
internal bleeding, that would be apparent to the autopsy surgeon?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And incidentally, is one of the reasons why a medical examiner
should go to the scene as early as possible, is to evaluate some of
these other evidentiary issues about rates of bleeding and that sort
of thing?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, with respect to Mr. Goldman's shirt and his jeans, tell me, in
your opinion, what's the difference between his shirt and his jeans
with respect to when you would expect to find blood soaked into one
versus the other?

A. The amount of blood that soaks into clothing varies on how tight
the clothing is on the body, varies on the fabrics, some fabrics are
more absorbent than others, and also varies on the position of the
individual, invariably, during the struggle or -- when somebody's
being injured, it's unusual for the person to stand in the anatomic
position at attention. The person is making all kinds of motions to
get out of harm's way or to defend oneself.

So that bleeding is not a direct linear line from the top to the
bottom. It may vary depending on looseness of clothing, fabric, and on
the position, whether the person's leaning forward, leaning backwards.
And there's no predictable pattern for any kind of bleeding in that
regard except that blood has to follow the law of gravity, that it
goes downward.

Q. Now, is the fact that there is no straight line from Mr. Goldman's
neck wounds straight down his shirt, indicative of him struggling
after that neck wound, moving around a lot?

A. It would be supportive of that, yes.

Q. Now, you were asked some questions about the jeans.

Do you recall being shown one picture of Mr. Goldman lying on a table?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You actually have examined the jeans themselves, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me show you next in order.

THE CLERK: 2269.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of Ronald Goldman's
jeans was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2269.)

(Exhibit 2269 displayed.)

Q. Does this appear to be a pair of Mr. Goldman's jeans?

A. Yes, that -- I think it's too close.

MR. BLASIER: Can you back out a little.

THE WITNESS: Back up a little.

A. Yes.

Q. Let's move to this area up here.

Does this appear to be blood at the very top of Mr. Goldman's jeans?

A. Yeah. That is the top side of the jeans. There is blood in the
fabric going above the belt line.

Q. And?

A. In the front.

Q. And?

A. On the side.

Q. Where is the thigh wound with respect to Mr. Goldman's jeans?

A. I think it's about four or five inches below the pocket, as
described in the jeans, to my best recollection.

MR. BLASIER: Can you back out a little, Phil.

MR. P. BAKER: Sure.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So we're talking about well below the area where
the blood starts on Mr. Goldman's jeans?

A. Yes, it would be below the screen.

Q. Now, would you expect the person wearing jeans, if they were
struggling, would you expect the jeans to move around a lot like a
shirt might?

A. Surely, it could, especially if there's no belt tightening. As I
recall, there was no belt, so the pants would move in unpredictable
ways during a struggle.

Q. Would you expect them, however, to absorb more blood because
they're tighter on the skin and closer to the skin?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, let me show you next in order.

THE CLERK: 2270.

MR. BLASIER: 2270.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of Ronald Goldman's
shoes was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2270.)

Q. Is this a picture of Mr. Goldman's shoes?

A. Yes.

Q. And this is blood that is saturating his left shoe, correct?

A. Could that be focused a little bit better. I can't --

Yes. There's blood soaking the left shoe.

Q. Now, how far, approximately, would it be from the thigh wound down
to the shoe?

A. Possibly around two feet. Or --

Q. And is it your opinion that Mr. Goldman would have to be upright
for his shoe to get saturated in that way, whether it's from the neck
wounds or the thigh wound?

A. Yes. Whether it's the thigh wound or the neck wound, the flow of
blood is going to be downward by gravity, so it would indicate an
upright position.

Q. Now, you were asked about whether there was evidence of an
accumulation of blood around the jugular vein cut.

Would you expect to find an accumulation of blood around that area?

A. No. The -- There was a little bit of blood on the cut but there's
no space for the jugular vein to accumulate. It's like cutting one
wrist, if the blood flows right out onto the skin and doesn't pool
anyplace in the body.

Q. Now, your testimony with respect to -- let me show you another
picture.

MR. BLASIER: Could we mark next in order.

MR. P. BAKER: 22 --

THE CLERK: 71.

MR. BLASIER: 2271.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Does this appear to be another picture of Mr.
Goldman's jeans, the back side of them.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of the back side of
Ronald Goldman's jeans was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 2271.)

A. May I?

(Witness approaches TV screen.)

A. Yeah, this is the label on the right buttock area, so this is the
back side of the jeans.

Q. So the left side would be at the bottom of the picture?

A. Yeah, this is the left side facing 6 o'clock.

Q. And this picture seems to indicate a continuous stain from the top
to the bottom.

Is that consistent with your observation of the actual jeans?

A. Yes, going from the very belt line.

Q. Now, again, would you expect that to be an absolute straight line
or could there be some breaks in that because of bunching of the
jeans?

A. Yes, there could very well be breaks. I don't see a break here but
there could be breaks.

Q. Now, the wound to the -- the jugular vein, are there things that
happen once that wound is inflicted, other than just bleeding?

A. Yes.

Q. Describe what would go on with the body, what could go on in
addition to that wound bleeding?

A. When the wound is transected, as happened here, that is complete
separation of the top part and bottom part of the jugular vein, the
top part continues to bleed as the blood is continued to be pumped up
into the head through the aorta and the carotid arteries, which are
intact, the bottom part doesn't have blood in it so it sucks air into
the heart, and that's another reason that that occurs when the
internal jugular vein is cut. So that also happens.

It's hard to interpret it from this autopsy because the autopsy was
done some 36 hours later and there's no mention as to air in the
heart.

Q. Now, when you testified to your opinion about an approximate span
of time between the infliction of the neck wound and the wound to the
aorta, were you talking about specifically the time that Mr. Goldman
would be upright as opposed to being lying down, or are you talking
about the combined period of time?

A. I'm talking about the amount of time it took for the heart to stop
pumping effectively, the heart to stop, failing as a pump.

So that would include the time he's standing up and the time he
collapses until the heart beats so feebly that when the aorta is cut
and when the lungs are cut, not much blood is pumped out.

And these are both areas that if any of us in this room were stabbed
in those areas, we would pump out one or two quarts of blood very
quickly.

Q. Now, Mr. Medvene asked you questions about the wound to the aorta
and bleeding into the retroperitoneal space, and he also described a
tip of a knife going into the peritoneum.

What was the size of the wound that went into the peritoneum in this
case?

A. A half an inch.

Q. And is that considerably larger than a tip of a knife?

A. It would have been the front portion of the knife that went through
the aorta, and it would be more than just a tip, yes.

Q. Now, you were asked some questions about an aneurysm.

There was no aneurysm in this case, was there?

A. No, there was no aneurysm.

Q. Now, can people that are -- that are wounded in the back, with the
aorta being severed or cut without the peritoneal space -- peritoneal
sack being cut, what would happen there?

A. If a person, and this happens on our streets, is stabbed in the
back, and the aorta is cut in the back and not in the front, then the
bleeding -- and there's no other injury to cause impairment, then the
bleeding would be into the retroperitoneal space, as occurs when
somebody has a ruptured aneurysm that Mr. Medvene referred to, and in
those circumstances, as the blood infiltrates the retroperitoneal
space, the space behind the aorta, it builds up pressure, and what's
called a pseudoaneurysm, false aneurysm, because the blood clots
around the aorta, it's got tissue pressure. These tissues are harder
to infiltrate than a space like the peritoneum or the thoracic cavity,
and these people usually live long enough to get to a hospital, be
operated upon and oftentimes survive.

So a stab wound in the -- that does produce hemorrhage in the
retroperitoneal space, is not nearly as harmful as one that goes into
the peritoneal cavity because once a stab wound goes into the
peritoneal cavity, as I tried to illustrate with the plastic bag
yesterday, there's a big space there with no counter pressure that
just fills up with a great deal of blood, and those people who have
bleeding from the front of the aorta into the peritoneal cavity have a
much poorer prognosis, they don't do as well. They often don't live to
get to a hospital.

If it's only in the retroperitoneal space, many of these people are
operated upon and are salvaged.

Q. Now, the 100 to 200 cc's of blood that Dr. Golden found in the
abdominal cavity, this is a relatively small amount, is it not?

A. Yes, as is the blood in the right chest cavity is also a small
amount.

Q. And incidentally, it's routine in an autopsy to record those kinds
of things?

A. Absolutely, yes.

Q. And just so the record is clear, describe again what your opinion
is with respect to the state of Mr. Goldman at the time the aorta
wound was inflicted?

A. My opinion when the aorta wound was inflicted is the same as my
opinion when the two lung wounds were inflicted, the heart was not
beating effectively, the heart was failing as a pump, so it wasn't
pumping blood effectively through the body or through any of the blood
vessels, and that's why very little bleeding occurred.

Q. And that would take a certain period of time that you've estimated
after the neck wounds would have been inflicted for his body to have
bled out enough to lower his blood pressure and produce that small
volume of blood?

A. Yes. In order for the stab wounds to the aorta and to the lungs to
bleed very little would have required, that's where I get into these
numbers, a good -- a good 10 minutes from that point, he's on the
ground a good 10 minutes before, so that the heart can no longer pump.

Now, that's modified -- that's also modified by the amount of air
that's being sucked into the air (sic), because as the air gets sucked
into the heart from the lower portion, it causes an airlock so blood
can pump.

And people with transected internal jugular veins have the additional
problem of the blood not being able to pass through the heart because
of the air, and this causes the heart to beat ineffectively as a pump,
and within five or ten minutes the -- the stabbing into the aorta or
the lungs will not produce much bleeding.

Q. Now, Mr. Medvene asked you a number of hypothetical questions.

Do you have anyway of knowing whether the perpetrator or perpetrators
saw Mr. Goldman breathing or not?

A. I have no way of knowing that.

Q. Now, what is your opinion with respect to whether he was stabbed in
the aorta and in the chest after he had already collapsed on the
ground some period of time after the neck wound?

A. Yeah. My opinion is that when he's stabbed in the right chest area
and the left thigh, the heart is not able to pump blood effectively.
That would take at least five or ten minutes, you know, from the time
of the cut -- wound, and that's where I get confused on numbers, and
the stab wounds to the right -- right chest stab wound to -- the right
chest would have been first, from the position of the body. The stab
wound on the left chest would be the last one, from the position of
the body as seen at the scene, but prior to that there would be stab
wounds on the right side.

During all this time -- During all this time Mr. Goldman is not
conscious, he doesn't feel this, he's not conscious during all this
time.

Q. Now, is part of your opinion that you've talked about, deal with --
with the Bruno Magli set of shoe prints that make it appear that
somebody went out and came back a second time.

A. Well, during that time, there -- there are shoe prints in different
areas, and part of that is the ones you showed me where there was
motion, whoever was there, whether it's one person or two persons,
there was motion going on and the -- the congealed or partially
clotted blood was stepped into.

Q. But as to the Bruno Magli shoe prints in the back walkway, you take
into account Mr. Bodziak's testimony with respect to possibly the
perpetrator going out and coming back and going out a second time?

A. I also considered that, yes.

Q. Now, you were asked questions about the adrenal glands having some
hemorrhage.

What does the autopsy report say about that in terms of how much
hemorrhage?

A. Is says in the description in the adrenal gland that -- that there
is -- there is a small amount of hemorrhage around the adrenal -- of
the left adrenal gland, due to the retroperitoneal hemorrhage caused
by the stab wound. So in the course of that stab wound track which was
illustrated in that diagram, there is hemorrhage around that stab
wound's track, partially passive hemorrhage, and there might have been
a small amount of blood pressure at that time, and that hemorrhage got
into the -- to the adrenal gland area.

Q. Now, had the wound to the aorta been inflicted early on as Dr.
Spitz testified, would you expect to see a small amount of hemorrhage
or a large amount?

A. Well, I expect a large amount. And also, I expect the kidney in
that area to be encased in blood because the kidney is right there in
the retroperitoneal space, and there's no mention in the autopsy
report of any hemorrhage around the kidney.

Q. Now, you were asked questions about your conversation with Dr.
Goldman -- Dr. Golden, excuse me.

Did you have a conversation with Dr. Golden after you heard Dr.
Spitz's testimony or read his testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you discuss with Dr. Golden the issue of whether there was
massive bleeding in the retroperitoneal space?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he tell you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. My understanding in talking to Dr. Golden, and I specifically asked
him whether there was any additional information he had that was not
included in the autopsy report -- his autopsy report about the
hemorrhage in the retroperitoneal space, and he reassured me that he
sticks by what he says in the autopsy report and what he testified to
at prior -- prior testimony that he gave.

Q. And is it accurate that he told you that he did not observe massive
amounts of blood in the retroperitoneal space?

A. He told me that he did not see massive bleeding in the
retroperitoneal space or if he did, he would have put it in his
autopsy report.

Q. Now, Dr. Baden, is it accurate to say, or fair to say, that you're
somewhat reluctant to criticize Dr. Spitz; he's a friend of yours?

A. I don't have --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) There is absolutely no basis in the evidence from
the autopsy and from any of the observations here that support Dr.
Spitz's conclusion with -- there is absolutely no support whatsoever
for Dr. Spitz's opinion that the wound to the aorta was one of the
earlier wounds and that there was massive bleeding in the
retroperitoneal space?

MR. MEDVENE: Calls for conclusion, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: That's his job. He makes conclusions.

A. In my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, I don't
find any evidence for massive bleeding in the retroperitoneal space
and I disagree with Dr. Spitz's opinion to that point.

Q. And if I asked you the same question with respect to all of the
marks on Mr. Simpson's hand being caused by fingernail gouges, would
you agree that that simply is not supported by the evidence?

A. My opinion is that they're not finger scratch gouges but there's a
little more evidence that I would agree with Dr. Spitz is that I can't
tell. The little scratches on the back of the hand that were crusted
could be from anything. So it's not my opinion they're finger scratch
marks, but there's some basis that another person could think they
are.

I don't think there's a good basis that there's massive
retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. MEDVENE: Recross.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. You're not a shoe print expert, are you, Dr. Baden?

A. I am not, sir.

Q. And you performed, yourself, no analysis of what imprints of any
kind were at the Bundy scene to determine the origin of those
imprints; is that correct, sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. And if -- And if Dr. Lee said that as far as the Bundy walkway was
concerned, other than the Bruno Magli footprints that had been
previously identified by Agent Bodziak, the only other imprint on the
walkway that he could say with scientific certainty was a shoe print,
was one particular shoe print, you wouldn't disagree with that, would
you?

A. No, not --

Q. And if Dr. Lee said as far as that one particular shoe print, the
only other one that he saw on the Bundy walkway, other than the bloody
Bruno Magli size 12, if he said he did not know if that imprint was
put on the scene after the murder, you would have no basis to disagree
with that, would you, sir?

A. I would not disagree with that. There's no -- we can't tell the
time any shoe print is put down.

Q. Thank you.

And if Dr. Lee were to testify that he is not able to identify with
any degree of scientific certainty, as a shoe print, any imprints that
are on an envelope that you referred to, or on jeans you referred to,
you would not quarrel with that, would you, sir?

A. I would not quarrel with Dr. Lee's opinion.

Q. All right.

So, basically, then, if we assumed that the testimony is there's one
set of bloody Bruno Magli size 12 shoe prints at the crime scene, and
one other shoe print that nobody knows when it got there, are you
telling us that with some degree of reasonable medical certainty --
you're claiming that based on that there were two assailants?

A. No. I would not make an opinion based on that.

Q. Now, when counsel -- and with respect to that one particular shoe
print, the only one Dr. Lee said even though he didn't know when it
was there, that he identified as a shoe print, other than the bloody
Bruno Magli shoe prints, with respect to that one shoe print that was
some distance in the walkway, do -- did you perform any examination to
figure how that one shoe print could appear somewhere halfway in the
walkway and nowhere else?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. So --

THE COURT: Okay. We're going to resume at 1:30.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case, don't form or express
any opinions. You're excused.

THE BAILIFF: Could I have it quiet in the courtroom, please.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE BAILIFF: Please take a seat in the audience.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll remind you, counsel, you've had ample
cross-examination. The Court is not going to go through the same
testimony the second time.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

(At 12:04 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)

1:40 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you will note that one of your number
is no longer with you. You're not to speculate as to the reason why.

I wish to remind you that it is very important for you to follow the
instructions that I have given to you, and I give to you periodically
about not talking about this case with anyone, not communicating
anything about -- anything about this case, not even the fact that
you're on this case.

People may know you're on this case, but your duty is not to initiate
any communications about anything like that.

You're also not to form or express any opinions about this case until
this case is completed. You're not to do any investigating on your
own. You're not to permit yourself to be addressed about this case by
anyone other than myself or the lawyers in the course of the trial, or
by the witnesses as they testify.

Everybody understand those instructions?

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

You may proceed.

MICHAEL BADEN, the witness on the stand at the time of the luncheon
recess, having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified
further as follows:

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Baden.

A. Good afternoon, Mr. Medvene.

Q. Just a few more questions for you.

You were asked on redirect about the question of blood under
fingernails.

I want to ask you, sir, isn't it true that it is uncommon to find an
assailant's blood under the victim's fingernails?

A. Yes.

Q. There was some discussion on redirect about the shirt and the fact
there wasn't much blood on the left side of the shirt. And you had
talked about the absorbency of a shirt, and that might account for the
possible lack of soaking on the left side.

You know what kind of shirt it was, sir?

A. That's not what I said.

Q. All right.

Do you know what kind of shirt it was Mr. Goldman was wearing?

A. I did at one time. I don't recall.

It was --

Q. Yes, sir. Was it a cotton shirt?

A. I forget what it was. I'd have to review my notes on that.

MR. MEDVENE: Put on the board next in order.

THE CLERK: 2272.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph depicting shirt label
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2272.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I ask you to look at 2272, and ask if that's Mr.
Goldman's shirt and if that is a cotton?

A. Cotton; yes, sir.

Q. And cotton, to your knowledge, would be an absorbent material?

A. It would be absorbent, yes.

Q. You also said with respect to the shirt, and discussing relative
lack of blood on the left side, something about the assailant twisting
the shirt. Is it your testimony that the --

A. I didn't say that.

Q. Is it your testimony that the assailant was holding Mr. Goldman's
shirt so that the left side was moved away from his left jugular vein
for five or ten minutes?

A. No, I didn't say that. And I would have no knowledge of that.

And I would doubt that.

Q. All right.

Is it true, sir, that you have previously testified, under oath, that
you did not see any blood in the soil, and there was no blood when the
body was removed, and not much blood in that area, to start with?

Did you previously say that under oath, sir?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Outside of the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you say that?

A. That would be my observation; I did not see any blood --

Q. Thank you, sir.

A. -- in the soil or on the photographs.

Q. Thank you, sir.

And last question, sir: You have stated that, from whatever wounds he
received, Mr. Goldman would be on the ground in two to three minutes,
but might have stayed alive, before receiving the other wounds, for
seven or eight minutes.

Are you contending, sir, as you stated on the Rivera show, that the
assailant could have inflicted a wound and stopped and talked, or
maybe there was another perpetrator with a gun?

Are you suggesting that that's what happened during this seven or
eight minutes that Mr. Goldman was on the ground, before he was, you
say, stabbed in the abdomen and the aorta?

A. What I was trying to convey was that --

Q. Is that what you're saying, sir?

A. What I'm trying to say, that many things could have happened in
between the two. I'm not saying it happened that way at all.

Q. So that's one of the things?

A. But if I may answer your question --

In the context of the show, which I regret I have to have been
involved in, from trying to explain my thoughts without having to
review the record, I was trying to explain that we can only tell, as
medical examiners, the minimum time, just like in a boxing match, that
injuries are inflicted; and we don't know what happens in between.

Q. Right.

A. So the reason I'm was very confusing -- have been very confusing,
is, between the cut and neck and the -- and the final stab wound,
there's at least five or ten minutes.

How long he stood during that time, I can't say.

Q. Well, you had --

A. I -- I can say only as I've said it before.

Q. Dr. Baden, so we stay focused, and I'm done --

A. I'm sorry.

Q. -- you had him down on the ground in two to three --

A. Two to three minutes. I've given various numbers. I don't know how
long he stood up. Two to five minutes, he'd be down on the ground.

Q. So many numbers you've given us.

A. I'm sorry. It's all in the same grouping.

Q. I'm asking you, Dr. Baden, are you suggesting to this jury --

A. Yeah.

Q. -- as you did on the Rivera show, that maybe the assailant didn't
immediately, after two minutes, inflict the remaining blows, but he
stopped and talked?

Yes or no, sir?

A. That he stopped, did something else.

Q. Sir, you said stopped and talked.

Are you suggesting --

A. That was an example.

Q. All right.

A. I don't mean that literally; I mean that figuratively stopped,
walked to the car, came back, stopped, did something in between.

Q. Sir, you're very verbal. You didn't say stopped and did something.

A. I'm not very verbal.

Q. You said stopped and talked.

A. I may have said that as an example.

Q. All right.

A. Not -- not to mean that that's what happened.

Q. All right.

Sir, are you suggesting to the jury, as you did on the show, maybe
there was another perpetrator with a gun?

Are you telling the jury that that's what you believe happened?

Yes or no, sir?

A. No, I'm not saying what I believe.

Q. Sir, did you say that?

A. I said that as an example of what could have happened.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, sir.

I have nothing else.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Dr. Baden, the Geraldo show, the purpose of that was to promote the
HBO special?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you got on there, you found that Chris Darden was also on
the show?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: I don't have any inclination to allow any examination about
anybody else on the show, Mr. Blasier.

MR. BLASIER: I think I'm entitled to let him explain.

THE COURT: I'm not going to let you. You can ask about what he said;
that's it.

MR. BLASIER: All right.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, had you reviewed all your materials
before you appeared on Geraldo?

A. No, I hadn't.

Q. And were you -- was it your understanding that you were even going
to be asked about the Simpson case?

A. I was hoping I wouldn't be asked about it. I was just going to talk
about the -- I was hoping only to talk about the HBO program, which
was kind of a foolish thought in my mind.

Q. And the ten-minute period that you referred to on Geraldo, did you
intend that to mean that's how long Mr. Goldman was standing up, or
the period -- time period be a neck -- wound in the aorta?

A. That's what I said, but I didn't intend it that way. And I don't
agree with that.

That -- that's the time period, the five- to ten-minute is the time
period between the cut wound to the neck and the stab wound to the
belly. How -- and I misspoke. Because how long he was standing, I
can't quite tell. I think it was a few minutes. It had to be enough
time for the blood to go down to the shoe and during that time -- for
some time, he was standing. And I can't be more specific than that.

Q. Would you agree that no medical examiner could be so precise to say
all this happened, for example, in a minute and 15 seconds precisely?

MR. MEDVENE: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BLASIER: No further questions.

A. I would agree with that.

MR. BLASIER: No further questions.

MR. MEDVENE: No questions.

THE COURT: Your're excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, can we move in 2267, 2270 --

THE CLERK: Wait.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry. 2269, 70 and 71.

THE CLERK: 2269, 70 and 71?

MR. BLASIER: Correct.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2269 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2270 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2271 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

MR. MEDVENE: We move in -- I believe it's 22 -- 2272, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2272 was
received in evidence.)

THE COURT: I'm just trying to get my courtroom policed a little bit. I
want to get rid of all those cups and things, if you don't mind.

(Referring to cups on witness stand.)

MR. LEONARD: I'll get it.

THE COURT: No, you won't.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, we're going to read in the criminal trial
testimony of William Blasini, William Blasini, Jr.

(The testimony of William Blasini, given in Criminal Case No.
BA097211, was read into the record, with Mr. Philip Baker reading the
testimony of Mr. Blasini, and Mr. Leonard reading the questions, as
follows:)

MR. LEONARD: Beginning at page 43972, line 9:

Q. Mr. Blasini, what is your occupation?

THE COURT: Excuse me. I think you better identify the witness so the
jurors will know who it is.

MR. LEONARD: This is Mr. William Blasini, who was called as a defense
witness at the criminal trial.

THE COURT: Spell that.

MR. LEONARD: B.

MR. P. BAKER: B-l-a-s-i-n-i.

MR. LEONARD: Sorry.

(Reading:)

Q. Mr. Blasini, what is your occupation, sir?

A. I work for Pick Your Part, the world's largest self-service
automobile recycling center.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, either use the microphone or speak louder.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

Thank you, Mr. Blasini.

And it's called Pick Your Part?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right.

And how long have you been so employed?

A. About three and a half years.

Q. And what is your present job title with Pick Your Part.

A. I'm general manager of vehicle purchasing.

Q. And as such, tell us briefly what you do as a general manager of
Pick Your Part.

A. Basically, I go to auctions, police auctions, impounds, and we buy
cars.

Q. And you've been doing this for how long?

A. At Pick Your Part, for three and a half years.

Q. Have you been in this industry for -- before that time?

A. I was a wholesaler. I was wholesaling vehicles before this.

Q. All right.

So you've been around automobiles for some time; is that correct?

A. Fifteen years, to be correct.

Q. All right, sir.

I'd like, sir, to direct your attention back to the date -- I believe
June 21 of 1994.

Did you have an occasion on or about that date, in the afternoon, to
be at Viertel's garage, here in downtown Los Angeles?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury under what
circumstances you were at Viertel's on that date, that Tuesday, June
21.

A. Well, every Tuesday, we go there and we bid on cars -- they have
four locations -- and the last location is at Temple, the main garage;
that's where we wind up. And when I walked -- when we finished bidding
on the cars, I was walking in to do the paperwork, when I just
happened to see the Bronco inside the garage.

Q. All right. So would you say you were accompanied by someone else at
that point?

A. I was accompanied by Bob Jones, Andrew Adlen, myself, and Sam
Adlen, I think. I'm not sure about Sam, if he was there that day.

Q. Let's take them one at a time.

We've heard the name Bob Jones before. By whom is Bob Jones employed?

A. Viertel's.

Q. You knew him prior to the date of June 21?

A. Yes.

Q. And you mentioned a Mr. Aden -- excuse me -- Adlen. What is Mr.
Adlen's first name?

A. Andrew.

Q. And who is Mr. Andrew Adlen?

A. He's a competitor. He also bids on the cars, as well.

THE COURT: How do you spell Adlen? Do you know?

BY MR. COCHRAN: A-d-l-e-n, I believe, Your Honor, Andrew Adlen.

And you mentioned another Adlen, I believe.

A. It's his uncle. I assume it's his uncle.

Q. So you were there in the company of the two Adlens and yourself and
Bob Jones; is that correct?

A. I'm not correct on the second Adlen, but the first one was there,
yes.

Q. You're sure about the first one?

A. Yes.

Q. You were describing that you were at Viertel's, and this jury heard
something about Viertel's and the layout there.

Can you describe for us where you were once you got there on that
particular afternoon?

A. Well, there's two entrances, two main entrances, one from the
street and one from the back of the yard. And that's where we come
from, from the back of the yard.

Once we're done bidding on the vehicles, we come through the back of
the garage, and right there, as you walk in the area where they keep
the restricted vehicles. And as you continue past that area, you go
down to the offices.

Q. All right. And did you -- you were in this -- walking in this area;
is that right?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And while in this area -- first, before we get to that, tell us
what time -- what time of day was it on June 21?

A. It was about 2:30, 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

Q. And at some point after 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon on June
21, did you see a white Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And who were you with when you first saw the Bronco?

A. I was with Andrew Adlen and Bob Jones.

Q. Did you have some conversation at all with Mr. Jones about that
Bronco?

A. The minute I saw the Bronco, I was amazed at -- yes, I did.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 43979, line 10.

(Reading:)

I think I had just asked you a question about whether or not you had a
conversation with Bob Jones about this particular Bronco, and you
indicated yes; is that correct? A. Yes, sir.

And what was the --

MR. P. BAKER: Oops. Sorry.

Q. And what was the -- when you talked to Mr. Jones, can you tell us
the general subject matter of what you talked to him about the Bronco,
without telling us what you said and what he said?

A. Basically, why was the vehicle there.

Q. All right.

And did you get some response from him?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, based upon that brief conversation you had with Bob Jones, did
you have occasion to, at any point that afternoon, go over to or get
inside of this particular -- particular vehicle, the Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you did
in that regard, if anything.

A. As far as walking up to the Bronco and exactly what I did?

Q. Yes. Tell us what you did.

A. I opened the door to the Bronco.

Q. Let me stop you there.

Was the Bronco locked at that point?

A. No, it wasn't, sir.

Q. So you just walked over and opened the door?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Which door did you open of the Bronco?

A. The passenger's door.

Q. On the passenger side of the vehicle?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you've seen pictures of that Bronco, and you've seen the
Bronco itself; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, when you open the door to the Bronco, the passenger door, what
happened next?

A. I looked in the vehicle.

Q. All right.

Now, was there any particular reason why you wanted to go and look
inside this Bronco?

A. Well, I guess there was a couple of reasons. It was -- it was a big
story. Just the facts of looking at the Bronco, O.J. Simpson being
involved in it, it was a big story. I was curious.

Q. All right. You were curious at that point?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Had you read or seen any stories on television regarding the Bronco
being there?

A. Some stories.

Q. Were you expecting to see it at Viertel's?

A. Not at all.

Q. All right.

So you saw it, and then you had heard things about it, and you went
over to it; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, when you went over to the Bronco and opened the door, tell the
ladies and gentlemen what you next did after that.

A. I looked inside the Bronco. I looked at the seats, the floor. I
looked at the dashboard. I basically looked all over the vehicle.

Q. All right.

And why did you look all over the vehicle?

A. Well, Andrew and I were talking that it was said that there was a
lot of -- lot of blood in the vehicle.

Q. Who -- who said there was a lot of blood in the vehicle?

A. Well, it was said in the papers.

Q. All right.

You had read or heard that?

A. I heard that, yes.

Q. And were you looking to see if there was a lot of blood in that
vehicle?

A. Well, that was the first thing I looked for, yes.

Q. And will you describe for us how you --

Did you get inside the vehicle at some point?

A. Yes, I did, sir.

Q. Describe for the jury again how you got inside the vehicle and
where you were when you were inside the vehicle.

A. Well, once I looked in the vehicle, I sat in the passenger seat; I
continued to look around the vehicle. I looked between the seats and I
looked to the back of the vehicle.

Q. So when you got inside the vehicle and sat in the passenger seat
and looked all around the vehicle, did you see any blood?

A. No, sir I didn't.

Q. Were you looking specifically for blood?

A. At first, yes, we were.

Q. Now, you said "we." When you got into the passenger side of the
vehicle and sat in the passenger seat, what did Mr. Adlen do, if
anything, that you saw?

A. He opened up the driver's door.

Q. Did you see him at any point put any part of his body into the
Bronco vehicle?

A. Yes. Half of his body came into the vehicle.

Q. Can you describe for the jury again how he did that, that movement.

A. The vehicle sits up high because it's a truck. And he basically
opened the door and leaned over the seat and looked in the vehicle.

Q. At the time he made that movement of looking inside the vehicle and
looking inside, were you already inside the vehicle?

A. I was already inside the vehicle, yes.

Q. And you were seated in the passenger compartment, just as though
you're seated in the witness seat there?

A. Correct, sir.

Q. All right.

Take your time and describe for the jury what you did from that
particular vantage point inside the driver's compartment of that
Bronco on June 21, 1994.

A. Well, I basically, at first, looked for blood. And I looked all
over the vehicle. I looked for fingerprint dust.

Q. Do you recall seeing any fingerprint dust?

A. Not inside the vehicle, no.

Q. All right.

Tell us what else -- what happened after that.

A. I saw some dust on the window sill, so I put my fingers on the
window sill to see if there was any dust on them.

Q. So you're holding your fingers up. And I want you to describe for
this jury how you did this.

What did you do with regard to your fingers on the window sill, and
which window sill was it?

A. It was the same side I was sitting in, the passenger side. I put my
fingers up on the window sill like this. (Indicating.)

Q. So did you leave fingerprints there, as far as you could tell?

A. Smudges. But I looked at my hands.

Q. And you did that while you were inside the vehicle; is that
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. After you did this, what happened next, if you recall?

MR. LEONARD: There's colloquy at this point. Mr. Cochran made a
motion, Your Honor, as though with all ten of his fingers extended out
in front of him, as though he touched the windshield.

THE COURT: Palms forward.

Q. Palms forward; is that correct?

A. Fingers, not palms on the window, but fingers.

Q. Okay.

Fingers forward?

A. Correct.

Q. All right. Thank you.

Now, what happened after you did this, you made this movement with
your fingers forward?

A. I looked at Andrew, and can't remember word for word, but basically
what we said, we didn't find any blood.

At that point, I happened to look down on the ground, and I noticed
that the floorboard on the driver's side, the carpet itself, was cut
out.

Q. You didn't see any carpets on the driver compartment; is that
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, tell the jury, how long did you stay, approximately, in this
-- inside the vehicle, looking for blood and putting your fingers
first in the windows -- window of the driver's compartment. How long
did you stay in this position?

A. I felt like it was for five minutes, but I really couldn't tell
you. It was probably a couple of minutes.

Q. All right.

Did you look -- now, let's look and see. Let's try and determine where
you looked.

Did you look on the dash?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you look in the dash at that point?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. Did you have occasion to look at the console?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you have occasion to look on the driver's side door?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you have occasion to look at the steering wheel?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you look -- could you describe for -- Could you describe for us
-- earlier, you got in and you looked to your rear. Did you look
toward the rear of the vehicle, also?

A. Yes, I did.

MR. LEONARD: I think this is Plaintiffs' exhibit 172, Your Honor, is
it?

MR. P. BAKER: This is criminal 172 which is Civil 211.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

You saw this during the lunch break today, did you, this 172?

A. Yes.

Q. Indicating the chart.

With the Court's permission, can you step down for a minute.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, he's going to point where the witness did,
with your permission.

(Mr. P. Baker approaches the board.)

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

Q. This is a mock-up of this particular vehicle and photographs around
it.

I want to ask you -- specifically, let's start with this, this -- this
area over here, which purports to be the middle photograph.

On the left-hand side of this particular exhibit it has photo card 22
and 23 thereon.

Do you recall looking at that area of the driver's-side door of the
Bronco?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you recall at the locations of 22 or 23, seeing any blood at all
at these -- those labels when you looked at the Bronco on that date of
June 21, 1994?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. I want you to look down at No. 34.

Do you recall looking in that general area, also?

A. I remember looking in the area, but I don't remember seeing that
mark. I mean, I don't remember looking at -- that's past the door, so
I really don't think I looked that far into it.

Q. All right. 22, 23, you're sure you looked at that?

A. I looked at this, because I walked around the vehicle, when I came
to the driver's side, and the door was open.

Q. Now, you described for the jury, I believe, that part of the carpet
was out at the time you saw it; is that correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Cut out.

MR. LEONARD: Was cut out. Excuse me. At the time you saw it?

(Reading:)

A. Yes.

Q. Where was that?

Would that be in the area of the driver's area?

A. It was in the section right here. (Indicating.)

Q. He's indicating in the center, Your Honor, the area of the carpet
in the -- near where there would be No. 33 there.

Q. Area 33 there?

A. Correct. Right there.

Q. Now, at some point, you described for us that you looked at item --
you looked at the steering column; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You see the photograph on the top there, left.

Did you at any point look at the area of the steering column?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And at any time on that date of June 21, did you see any -- what
appeared to be blood on the steering column?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Now, did you in any way touch the steering column that day?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And describe that for the jury.

At what point did you touch the steering column?

A. If I remember correctly -- it's been a year and three months when I
walked into the vehicle -- I grabbed the steering wheel to pull myself
inside. And I sat down in the vehicle, and I held the steering wheel
for a short period of time.

Q. And so we have this sequentially correct, let me back up for a
moment, if I might.

You had been in the driver's compartment; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you told us you stayed in there for what appeared to be five
minutes, it may have been less; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you told us about your observations from that location, right?

A. Yes.

Q. At that point, did you have occasion to get out of the driver's
compartment of the vehicle?

A. Out of the driver's --

Q. Strike that.

Out of the passenger compartment of the vehicle?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. All right.

When you did that, where did you go, if anyplace?

A. I walked around the vehicle, but I stopped at the window on the
side which you don't have on here. And again, I looked for fingerprint
dust, and I put my fingers again on the glass.

Q. Now, so that we're clear and the jury has a picture of where you
put your fingers, this was on the right side of the vehicle or the
rear of the vehicle?

A. The right side of the vehicle, the glass in the back, which is the
biggest glass that shows.

MR. LEONARD: Over to 43993.

(Reading:)

After you made this movement, referring to the placing the fingers on
the glass, where did you next go, if anyplace, sir?

A. I went around the vehicle and I went to the driver's side. The door
was open. And I looked on the ground. I looked at the rug, and at that
point, Andrew and I decided that -- that probably where all the blood
was, was on the rug, because it was cut out and it wasn't there.

Q. You didn't see any rug at that point, right?

A. Excuse me?

Q. You didn't see any carpet or rug there at that point; is that
right?

A. No, sir.

Q. So didn't you then have occasion to get inside the vehicle? What
did you do?

A. I got inside the vehicle. Again, I looked over at the console to my
right, and I looked back. And then at that point, I got out of the
vehicle, and we left.

Q. How long did you --

Did you actually get in and sit down inside the driver compartment on
the left side?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Is that a yes?

A. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

Q. Okay.

How long did you remain in the driver's compartment on the left side,
sir?

A. About half the time that I was in the front and on the driver's
side on the passenger side, so about two minutes.

Q. Okay.

A. Minute and a half.

Q. While in there, did you do something and touch the steering wheel?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you have occasion to examine the steering wheel to see if you
saw any red spots on it?

A. Well, I looked at the steering wheel. But as you can see, the
steering wheel is black, so I couldn't tell you if there was anything
on there. But I didn't look at it and -- but I didn't see any blood.

Q. You didn't see any blood?

A. No, sir.

Q. Okay. All right.

Now, I want to specifically address your attention to the console.

On the upper photographs on the far right, there is a photographic
card number 30 and 31, and to the left of those are 30, and appear to
be some kind of red smudges.

As you sat in the vehicle on the right side, the passenger side, did
you have occasion to look down at that console depicted there in that
photograph?

A. I looked at the console twice; once I was in the vehicle and before
I entered the vehicle.

Q. At any time, were -- any point where you sat in that vehicle or
before you got in that vehicle, did you ever see any red or blood
spots at the items 30 and 31 inside the Bronco at that date?

A. No, sir.

Q. You looked specifically for it; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. LEONARD: Down to line 24, 43996.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

Q. Did you see any red spots when you looked at the console in that
particular area of the photograph there, 303 and 306, sir?

A. I would have to look at -- 303 is there, and 306 is this one?

Q. Yes, the one right next to it.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you see a blood spot there?

A. No, sir.

Q. You did not?

A. No, sir.

Q. You looked there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And this is as you were actually looking for blood; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, with regard to the dash, there's a photograph here in the
upper left-hand corner, number 24.

Do you remember whether or not you saw any spots at all on the dash
area of that vehicle, any red spots?

A. No, sir; no, I don't.

MR. LEONARD: Over to 43998, line 13.

Q. Now, Mr. Blasini, during the time that you were inside that
vehicle, either on the right side or the left side, the passenger side
or the driver side, did you ever see any red spots resembling blood
inside that vehicle at all?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. And when you left that vehicle and you had left, at least you had
on two occasions placed your fingerprints in the window of that
vehicle; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. LEONARD: 43999, line 1.

You can retain your seat there.

MR. P. BAKER: (Resumes seat on the witness stand.)

(Reading:)

Q. Now, Mr. Blasini, you've come here pursuant to subpoena; is that
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you've come here to testify because you've been subpoenaed; is
that correct?

A. Correct sir.

Q. You did not volunteer to come forward, did you?

A. Not at all, sir.

Q. Is Mr. Adlen still employed in this same work -- line of work?

A. Yes, he is, sir, as far as I know.

MR. LEONARD: Over to 44 -- 44000, line 21.

(Reading:)

Q. Now, with regard to that vehicle, you have described for the jury
where that vehicle was located, I guess, in T2 on 1254 you described
the vehicle was not locked; is that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Before you got inside that vehicle on June 21, did you have to sign
any kind of log or anything of that nature?

A. No, sir.

Q. Was anybody guarding that vehicle at that time?

A. No, sir.

Q. You just walked up and got inside the vehicle?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Both you and Adlen?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And while you were inside this vehicle for however long it was,
five minutes, seven minutes, or whatever, was Bob Jones over there
watching you while you were in the vehicle?

A. Bob Jones walked over with us and then -- and then walked away to
his office while we were looking at the vehicle.

Q. So you were in there by yourself, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And after you finished looking in the vehicle and making your
observations, where did you go then, if you recall?

A. Once we were done, I proceeded to pick up the paperwork from the
vehicles that we had purchased, and I left.

Q. And you were there in the normal course of your business to buy
some actual vehicles from Viertel's; is that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, in your work --

MR. LEONARD: We're going over to 44002, line 10.

(Reading:)

Now, in your work in purchasing vehicles over the last 15 years, have
you had occasion to see blood in a vehicle before?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. How often?

A. Well, Pick Your Part purchases like 8,000 vehicles a month, so I do
come across a lot of vehicles, and a lot of these vehicles are wrecked
vehicles that were in accidents, so on, and you get to see a lot of
blood.

Q. You have done that in the past and seen that yourself?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. Now, with regard to the security, if any, around this particular
vehicle, can you describe for us, to the ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, whether or not there were any barriers or anything around this
particular Bronco, as you went in and got inside of it on that date.
Can you describe that for us?

A. Yes, they do have. It's, like, the chain links that you see at the
Banks that form the lines; that's what they use to block it off.

Q. And where was that in relation to the Bronco?

A. It was on the outside of the Bronco, all the way around the
restricted area.

Q. All right.

And when you went inside, how did you get past there?

A. I think from -- I can't remember exactly, but I think there's an
opening on either side that you can walk right through or you can just
step right over it.

Q. And that's how you just walked right in; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And there's nobody to stop you, right?

A. No, sir.

Q. In fact, Bob Jones was with you and walked away, right?

A. Correct, sir.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you very much for coming today, sir.

MR. LEONARD: I have one other area. Over on page 44022, line 12:

(Reading:)

BY MS. CLARK: I have a third photograph I would ask be marked C, Your
Honor, with the numbers 31 and 30, showing it to the witness now.

Does this appear to be the console area of the Bronco, sir?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And do you see areas where there are red smudges on that side on
the passenger side of that console?

A. I sure do.

Q. You see it by the numbers there?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time you were in the Bronco on June 21, where -- there
were no numbers marking any spot; is that correct?

A. No -- correct.

MR. LEONARD: Over to page 44024, line 16, referring to the passenger
console.

(Reading:)

Q. You specifically looked at that part of the console; is that right?

MR. GELBLUM: What page are you on?

MR. LEONARD: 44024.

(Reading:)

A. When I first entered the vehicle, before I sat in the vehicle, I
put my elbows on the seat to look inside, and I directly looked at the
console, straight at the console. That's what I looked at.

Q. You specifically looked at the console?

A. Well, the Bronco sits a little higher than a regular car does. So
when you enter the car, the seat's higher. So when you -- when you
look in, you automatically see the console; you see the top of the
seat almost parallel with the console.

Q. And then did you put your elbows down on the passenger seat and
stare at the console? Is that what you --

A. I can't remember if I put my elbows or put my hands, but I know
that I looked in first, before I entered the vehicle.

Q. Okay.

And you looked specifically at the area shown in 30?

A. I looked straight ahead, right.

Q. Did you look at the area shown in 31?

A. No, I didn't, not at that point.

Q. Now, you're telling this jury that you did not see the red stain
depicted in 31; is that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You're not telling the jury it wasn't there?

A. Correct.

Q. You did not see the red stain mark in 30; is that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You're not telling the jury it wasn't there?

A. I didn't see it.

Q. You're not telling the jury it wasn't there?

Can you answer the question I asked you, sir?

A. Anything is possible, but I didn't see the marking.

Q. You didn't see it; that's what you're telling us, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You cannot tell us it wasn't there?

A. It wasn't there when I looked.

Q. You are telling us, then, is, it wasn't there?

A. I looked. I didn't see the mark.

Q. Now, if I told you that the photograph -- that the photograph was
taken on June the 14th, a week prior to your getting into the Bronco,
sir, would that change your opinion any?

A. No, it wouldn't.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have anything else.

(Mr. Gelblum now reads the questions, with Mr. P. Baker continuing to
read the answers.)

MR. GELBLUM starting at 43978, line 11.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Just lines 1 to 3.

(Reading:)

The vehicle was housed in where in T2?

A. It was in the rear of the building.

MR. GELBLUM: 44006, line 19.

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry?

MR. GELBLUM: 44006, line 19.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

Q. Now, you said you were looking for print dust?

A. Yes.

Q. Why were you looking for print dust?

A. Because it was known that there was print -- that the vehicle was
printed. There was blood in the vehicle. And that's basically what we
heard, and we just took it for granted.

Vehicles that are in restricted areas usually have print dust on them.

Q. And you saw print dust on the exterior of the car, did you not?

A. I didn't.

Q. You didn't?

You didn't see any print dust on the outside of the vehicle; is that
right? Is that right?

A. Right, correct.

Q. Now, the vehicle was inside the building of T2, correct?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. It was not out in the sun?

A. No, it wasn't.

Q. When you got into that car, were you carrying a flashlight?

A. No.

MR. GELBLUM: Over to 44008, line 19.

(Reading:)

Q. Now, you did not get down and inspect the driver's door panel with
a flashlight, did you?

A. No.

MR. GELBLUM: Down to the next page, line 1.

(Reading:)

Q. And you did not, when you got into the passenger side of the
vehicle, bend down to inspect the console closely, did you?

A. Not underneath, no.

Q. When you were sitting in the passenger side of the car, your leg
was parallel with the console; isn't that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you were looking at the steering wheel, sir, what effort
did you make to inspect it carefully for blood?

A. I didn't.

MR. GELBLUM: 44010, line 8.

(Reading:)

Q. Now, you told us you were looking for print dust in the Bronco; is
that right?

A. Yes.

Q. I take it that means you have seen print dust before?

A. Correct.

Q. You indicated, in fact, you had seen it before in the restricted
area of Viertel's, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the area that the Bronco was parked in was a restricted area,
was it not?

A. Correct.

MR. GELBLUM: It's Civil Exhibit 1749. This is Criminal Exhibit 528 A.
Now, this photograph -- I'm sorry. 44011, line 20.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Reading:)

Q. This photograph taken on June the 14, was shown to Mr. Meraz during
his testimony.

Do you see the exterior of the driver's door?

A. I sure do.

Q. Do you see anything around the door jam?

A. I sure do.

Q. What does that look like to you?

A. Looks like print dust to me.

Q. Are you telling us, sir, you did not see that on June the 21st?

A. I did not see it.

Q. Doesn't mean it wasn't there, did it, sir?

A. Correct.

MR. GELBLUM: 44020, line 5.

Exhibit 637, please, Steve.

(Exhibit No. 637 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. GELBLUM: You ready?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

Q. The exterior portion where the driver's door handle is, did you
look specifically into this area where the number 23 is?

A. No.

Q. So that we're clear, you are not telling this jury that there was
no blood in that area which is marked with a number 23, correct?

A. No, I'm not. I'm not saying that.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 44023, line 1.

(Reading:)

Q. Now, are you telling us when you sat on the passenger seat, sir,
your leg would have been right up against the area marked by 30; isn't
that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the area marked by 31, which appears to be to the rear of the
console area, would have been blocked by your side; isn't that
correct?

A. If I was sitting on the seat, yes, correct.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: 44025, line 16. Exhibit 639.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor --

MR. GELBLUM: 44025, line 16.

MR. LEONARD: It's already been read, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: Oh I'm sorry. You're right; you read that.

44027, line 1. Exhibit 640.

(Exhibit No. 640 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Showing you another photograph now that's been, I think, previously
shown, now it's got numbers in it, 303, 306. Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. Appears to be the console?

A. Yes.

Q. Bottom right-hand corner has the date September 1, 1994, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Do you see red stains in the area of 303, 306, 304, 305 in this?

A. I sure do.

Q. And you're telling this jury you did not see any of those red
stains when you were in the Bronco on June the 21st; is that correct?

A. I didn't see 303 and I didn't see 306.

Q. And you cannot tell the jury that 303, 304, and 305 were not there?

A. Correct.

Q. You didn't see them?

A. I didn't see them, correct.

Q. But they could have been there?

A. Yes, they could have been.

MR. GELBLUM: 44029, line 6.

You can take that off.

(Referring to Elmo screen.)

(Reading:)

Q. Now, Mr. Blasini, when you opened the car door, no interior light
came on in that Bronco, did it?

A. Not that I can remember.

Q. I'm looking at glasses that you're wearing today. Are those
prescription?

A. No, they're not.

Q. Did you wear those glasses back on June 21, 1994?

A. No. I had regular sunglasses, dark sunglasses.

Q. You wore those while you were inside the Bronco?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Where did you take them off?

A. When I entered the building.

Q. And you're wearing tinted glasses today in court, aren't you?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Why is that?

A. I had radial keratotomy about seven years ago, and I get a glare
from light, certain lights, fluorescent lights, sunlight, so I wear
the tinted glasses.

Q. And that happened seven years ago, sir?

A. About seven years ago, yes.

Q. Isn't it true, sir, that the area of the T2 where the Bronco was
parked, has fluorescent lights?

A. I think so, yes, but they're never on.

Q. You're testifying to this jury they were not on -- on June the 21,
1994?

A. A lot of times during the daytime, they don't have the lights on.

Q. Are you telling the jury they were not on, on June the 21st, 1994?

A. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't remember.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you. That's all.

MR. LEONARD: Over to --

MR. GELBLUM: I'd like to move in -- oh, you want to finish? Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: Yeah.

44028, line 2.

(Reading:)

Q. And would it change your testimony any as to 303 and 306, the red
stains on that area of the console, if I told you that photograph was
taken on September 1, 1994, after you were in the Bronco?

A. It wouldn't change my testimony.

MR. LEONARD: Over to 44032, down at line 25.

(Reading:)

Q. You didn't see any blood inside that Bronco, did you?

A. No, sir.

Q. In fact Mrs. Clark didn't ask you about number 299 there on B, by
the window sill.

Can you see that where you are?

A. No, I can't.

Q. On June 21, 1994, this area, number 299 on that photograph here,
did you see any red substance on that date in that area?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Anything Ms. Clark asked in any way change your mind about you had
not seen any blood on that date?

A. No, nothing changes my mind.

Q. You've come here and told us the truth here today?

A. I did, sir.

Q. Pursuant to subpoena?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you, sir.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing.

I'd like to move in Exhibits 637, 639, 640, and 1749.

MR. LEONARD: Is this a good time for a break? Is it time for a break?

THE COURT: You have any objection to that?

MR. LEONARD: No. I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Okay; it's received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 637 was

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 639 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 640 was

THE COURT: You want a break?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah.

THE COURT: Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

BEGIN SECTION 4*****

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, we'd like -- at this point we have a
stipulation from the plaintiffs as to the authenticity of photograph
number 1420 which is of the passenger side of the Bronco. We'd like to
publish that to the jury. This is a photograph that was displayed
during Detective Mulldorfer's testimony, of the passenger side of the
Bronco, console, taken on August 10, 1994, with the Court's
permission.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: 1420, August 10, 1994. We would like to move it in.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1420.)

(Exhibit 1420 displayed on the Elmo.)

MR. BLASIER: Defense calls Gilbert Aguilar.

GILBERT AGUILAR, called as a witness on behalf of the Defendant, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: Sir, would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Gilbert Aguilar, G-i-l-b-e-r-t A-g-u-i-l-a-r.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Aguilar, by whom are you employed?

A. I am employed by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Q. In what capacity?

A. I'm a forensic print specialist assigned to the Scientific
Investigations Division in the latent print section.

Q. Can you describe briefly for the jury what a latent fingerprint is?

A. Well, a latent fingerprint is the reproduction of the friction skin
left on an object, which when you touch it, it's usually invisible and
must be made visible using fingerprint powders, using chemicals, or
you could use a laser.

When I talk about friction skin, I'm talking about the skin found on
your fingers, the palms of your hands. You also have friction skin on
your toes and the soles of your feet. It's different than the other
skin on your body, where it has these ridges that flow across them.

The unique thing about these ridges is they don't just flow from one
end to the other, what they do is they'll flow and they will stop. At
the point where they stop we call those ending ridges. Another thing
these ridges will do is they will flow and they will divide into two
ridges. At the point where they divide we call those bifurcations,
because -- everybody has these ridge endings and bifurcations
throughout their entire friction skin, but what makes a print unique,
a fingerprint unique, is where they are in relationship to each other.

Q. When you use the term "unique," are you talking about the ability
of latent fingerprints to, under some circumstances, uniquely identify
a single person?

A. Correct. That no two people in the world will have the same
fingerprints or palm prints.

Q. And how long have you been an expert in forensic fingerprints?

A. Been with the police department working fingerprints for over 19
years now.

Q. And approximately how many latent print comparisons have you done
during your career?

A. Oh, in the hundreds of thousands.

Q. And have you testified as an expert many times?

A. Yes, over 600 times.

Q. Now, you were -- at some point you were assigned to examine
fingerprints that were collected at 875 South Bundy after the Simpson
homicide, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Could we show a board here.

THE COURT REPORTER: Do we have a number on that?

MR. P. BAKER: That exhibit number is 4 --

MR. FOSTER: 409 (sic).

MR. P. BAKER: 409 (sic).

(Exhibit 408 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Aguilar, can you see this large board from
where you're sitting?

A. Most of it.

Q. To orient yourself, this appears to be an overhead view of the
crime scene at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. You recognize this as being the front door area?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, is it correct that there were 17 latent fingerprints found in
the area of 875 South Bundy by the specialist who took those latent
prints?

A. Yes.

Q. And at this time I would put 1303 -- actually, let me show you 1303
first.

THE CLERK: For the record, this last Exhibit was 408.

(Exhibit 1303 displayed.)

Q. Why don't you tell me what 1303 is, or tell the jury.

A. 1303 is a two-page document. It's a homicide investigation report.
Wherever a homicide has occurred, and we respond to that homicide and
recover latent prints, we'll document where the prints were recovered
on this, and hand it over to the investigator.

Q. Now -- and this includes all 17 latent prints from the Bundy scene?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you receive the latent fingerprints that have been
obtained, you compare them to known individuals to see whether or not
they match up?

A. Yes.

Q. Are there other ways that you can compare to determine whether you
can identify the person who left the fingerprint?

A. Yes.

Q. Describe what those other methods are?

A. Well, the other method would be through the fingerprint computer
which is called AFIS, the Automatic Fingerprint Identification System,
and we're able to run somebody's fingerprints through the system to
find out whose prints they are if the person has a record or has
applied and had their prints on file, it should match it up.

And one thing about the AFIS system, it only -- you can only run
fingers; in fact, just the first joint of the finger. The computer
cannot read the second or third joint of the finger or palm or
footprints.

Q. Now, in this case were you asked to compare the 17 latent
fingerprints that were found at the Bundy scene with various known
individuals?

A. Yes.

Q. And did that include any of the police officers that might have
been at the scene at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it include any members of or acquaintances of Nicole Brown
Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell me about how many people you used for comparison
purposes?

A. All together, must be around 60, or over 60 individuals.

Q. And included among those individuals, Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it accurate that Mr. Simpson's -- that none of these 17
latent fingerprints were identified as coming from Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, I'd like to go through just 1 through 17, and could you tell
us -- you may want to use the pointer, if you could, where each one of
these 17 prints was located and what you were able to determine about
each one?

A. Okay.

We are able to use the original lifts.

Q. Sure, if you like, use the original lifts.

Before you do that, let me ask you a question.

What's another difference between an identifiable latent fingerprint
and an unidentifiable latent fingerprint?

A. An identifiable latent fingerprint means there's enough in the
print to positively identify, if you had somebody's prints, if you had
their inked fingers or inked palms.

A non-identified print or unidentifiable print means the latent print
itself lacks sufficient characteristics to positively identify that
print to an individual.

Q. Is it accurate that among the 17 prints that you're going to tell
us about there are some of both kinds?

A. Yes.

Q. And there are some that you have been able to identify as being
associated with a particular individual, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Could we start with No. 1, and perhaps if you like, you can step down
and indicate on the board where each one came from and what you were
able to tell about it.

(Witness approaches Exhibit 408.)

A. Okay.

No. 1, the latent print was recovered from the inside front door
frame. That would be the same -- the door frame as in where I'm
indicating up here.

(Indicating to Exhibit 408.)

Q. That's correct.

And what were you able to tell about that latent fingerprint?

A. That latent print was the left thumb print of Nicole Simpson or
Nicole Brown.

Q. How about print No. 2?

A. Print No. 2 was recovered from the door itself, the side of the
door near the handle.

Q. And what were you able to conclude about that one?

A. That the print is identifiable, but it has not been identified to
anybody.

Q. So it's been compared to everybody that you mentioned, as well as
the search of the AFIS system?

A. No, it's -- this is a palm print, so it was not run through the
AFIS system.

Q. It was compared to all the 60 or so people you indicated?

A. That's correct.

Q. Including Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. It does not match any of those people?

A. Right.

Q. There's enough information there to identify -- uniquely identify
the source of that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

How about No. 3?

A. No. 3 was located at the same location where print No. 2 was, from
inside the front door near the doorknob. There was also a palm print
and that print was -- also has not been identified.

Q. Is it identifiable?

A. Yes.

Q. How about number -- up to 4?

A. No. 4.

No. 4 came from the same location of where print No. 1 was from, the
door frame, and it's a palm print so it wasn't able to be run through
the system. And also, that print was not -- it has not been identified
and it is an identifiable print.

Q. No. 5?

A. No. 5.

No. 5 came from a hand rail outside of the residence, was near the
front door location, so it's about right in this area where there's a
hand rail.

Q. Okay.

A. That print is a palm print and that print is non-identifiable,
which means we'll never know whose it is.

Q. That's because there's not enough detail?

A. That's correct.

Q. What's the next one?

A. No. 6 came from -- from a hand rail from the outside of the
location near the front entrance.

(Indicating to Exhibit 407.)

A. There's a hand rail near the front entrance of the location.

This print is a finger, and this print was identified to one of the
photographers that is employed by the police department out there, Mr.
Goodwin.

Q. Okay.

And the next one?

A. No. 7 came from a post, a top of a gate post that is between -- I
believe the gate post is about right in this location or it was near a
gate, the small gate. I believe it's right over here.

(Indicating.)

Q. That's a gate in the area of the walkway going toward the back?

A. Right. It's a small gate. It was on top of the post. This print was
also non-identifiable which means we'll never find out who this print
belongs to.

(Indicating to Exhibit 408.)

Q. Next one?

A. No. 8 was from a hand rail. Right at the stairs, stairs coming
down, there was a hand rail.

(Indicating.)

A. That print is a palm print and it's identifiable, but the print has
not been identified.

Q. Now, when you say some of those will never be identified, can you
say whether or not Mr. Simpson could be eliminated?

A. No.

Q. Okay. You can't.

Basically, there's just not enough information to tell anything about
them?

A. That's correct.

Q. How about the next one?

A. The next one was also from the hand rail, from a rail near the
front of the house.

This print is also a print that is non-identifiable.

Q. Next one?

A. The next one was from the -- outside the gated entrance to the
front of the house, the gate right here. That print was recovered from
there. And this print was -- in fact, there's two fingers on it, the
left index and left middle finger of Detective Ron Phillips with the
Los Angeles Police Department.

Q. Now, exactly where was that one, on the gate, did you say?

A. Yes, it was. It was a gate. There's a latch on the gate. It was
just above the latch.

(Indicating to Exhibit 408.)

Q. Okay.

And then after --

A. The next one was recovered from inside the house; it was the
outside of the bathroom door between the living room and the kitchen.
There's a -- I believe it was a small bathroom.

Q. There's not a lot of detail.

A. There was a small bathroom right around this location, between the
living room and the kitchen, and it was on the south side of the door.

And this print is identifiable. In fact, it was identified to a Faye
Resnick.

Q. And the next one?

A. The next one was off of a package of Marlboro Lights that was found
in the master bedroom on the back of the toilet.

This print was identified to Nicole Brown.

Q. And the next one?

A. The next one was -- or the next five were off of vehicles.

Q. So you described all of the latent prints that were obtained from
the Bundy scene, correct?

A. Right.

Q. And what's the total number of those?

A. 12.

Q. Okay.

And of those 12, to summarize, how many of those were identifiable but
you couldn't identify the source?

A. Four.

Q. Now, when you say the other -- the other, I guess, five prints were
from vehicles, you're talking about vehicles that were at 875 South
Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Why don't you tell us about each of those five, what you were able
to determine, what vehicle they came from?

A. Yes. Three of them came off of a white Ferrari; got a print off of
the hood, a print off the driver side -- the outside of the window,
another one off of the Ferrari, off the driver side on the front door.

They were -- all three prints were all identifiable and all three have
not been identified.

Q. Now, that Ferrari, is it accurate that that was inside the garage
at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. And how about the remaining two?

A. Yes. The other two were recovered from a Jeep Cherokee, black in
color, both prints recovered from the outside passenger side, rear
fender. Both are palm prints, both are identifiable, and both of them
have not been identified.

Q. So what would be, of the 17 prints, the total number that were
identifiable, but Mr. Simpson has been eliminated from, and you've not
been able to identify the source?

A. Nine.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. BAKER: Bob.

MR. BLASIER: Oops, sorry.

(Mr. Baker and Mr. Blasier converse sotto voce.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Aguilar, was there ever any attempt to check
the -- either the back gate or the front knob on the front gate for
prints?

A. The back gate, yes. The knob, I don't remember. I'm sure it was,
but knobs are very hard to get prints off of.

Q. And were there any identifiable prints on the back gate?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Aguilar?

A. Good afternoon.

Q. You have some familiarity with this crime scene layout that you
were just testifying to?

A. Yes.

Q. And you're familiar with the fact that these two yellow forms here
represent the bodies as they were found on the early morning of June
13?

A. Yes.

Q. And that these little markings here, the red and pink and blue, are
footprints, they were bloody footprints found early that morning?

(Indicating to Exhibit 408.)

A. I didn't know that.

Q. Let me represent to you that they are.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) As I understand it, Mr. Aguilar, as you went through
-- as you went through the fingerprint chart, the 17 prints we just
spoke of, numbers 1 through 4 were either lifted from the front door
or the front door frame; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's this area back in here that I'm circling right now; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

(Indicating to Exhibit 408.)

Q. Okay.

Then there were another five that you spoke of which would have been
prints 13 through 17, that were lifted off two vehicles; is that
correct also?

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact, 13, 14 and 15, you indicated were off a Ferrari which
was inside a garage here; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And 16 and 17 were from the Jeep Cherokee parked in the driveway over
here?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in fact, the two prints lifted off the Jeep Cherokee, did you
make any sort of notation where they were lifted from off the Jeep
Cherokee?

A. Yes.

Q. Where was that from?

A. They were recovered from the outside passenger side of the vehicle
on the rear fender.

Q. On the rear fender?

A. Yes.

Q. Not on the door or inside the car?

A. No prints were recovered from inside the car.

Q. Okay.

And with regard to prints No. 11 and 12, I believe you indicated,
first of all, that print No. 11 was found somewhere well inside the
house.

In fact, I think it was on a bathroom door, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was well into the interior of the house, between the
living room and dining room, or somewhere like that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was actually identified to one of Nicole's friends whose
prints you've been provided with, had you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And with regard to No. 12 that was off of a pack of cigarettes, it
was actually in the upstairs bathroom; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

So if I understand it, after we talk about 1 through 4, 11 and 12, and
13 through 17, those are all prints that were found basically in the
interior of the house or that rear bumper of that Jeep Cherokee; is
that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that leaves just six prints that were identifiable that were
lifted on the outside; is that correct?

Strike that.

Three that were identifiable?

A. That were lifted from the outside?

Q. Yeah, there were only six lifted from the outside?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And of the three of those prints, one was attributed to a Detective
Phillips, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And one of those was attributed to a photographer, a Mr. Goodwin?

A. Yes.

Q. And by the way, it was print No. 10 that was attributed to
Detective Phillips, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was print No. 6 that was attributed to Mr. Goodwin, the
photographer?

A. Yes.

Q. And that left only one identifiable print that was lifted from the
outside of that premise; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was print No. 8?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that was actually lifted off, I believe you indicated, a right
hand rail somewhere back there; is that correct?

(Indicating.)

A. It was the rail away from the house.

Q. Was that in this area here?

A. Right.

Q. Correct me if I am wrong, if you wear a glove, it's pretty
difficult to leave a fingerprint, is it not?

A. It's impossible.

Q. Okay.

A. Unless the glove had a hole in it.

Q. Okay.

So that's the only identifiable fingerprint that was found outside the
house that was not matched to someone is No. 8 that was on the right
hand of the -- or the outside of the house; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that left three other unidentifiable prints, or numbers 5, 7
and 9?

A. Yes.

Q. And I believe you indicated that you had Mr. Simpson's fingerprints
for an exemplar to match against these various prints?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to tell us with any certainty that prints 5, 7 and 9
were not Mr. Simpson's?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. 5, 7 and 9, you can't tell they were anybody else's either, can
you?

A. We'll never be able to know whose they are.

Q. And there wasn't a single fingerprint observed at the Bundy scene
that had any blood on it; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

MR. LEONARD: Call. Oops.

MR. BLASIER: Excused.

MR. LEONARD: Call Michael Gladden.

MR. BLASIER: I would move in 1303, please.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as

recognized?

A. Yes.

Q. And who was that?

A. O.J. Simpson.

Q. How did you have -- Explain how you saw him, where you were, and
what you observed, sir.

A. Well, we had just dropped our stuff off, and I was talking to
somebody I knew inside the place, and when I came out -- out of the
building, I went to talk to Mike Norris, and he was sitting in his
van, so we were standing -- I was standing on the driver side of his
van when the limousine pulled up right almost where I was standing,
and then we were just standing there looking at the limo.

Q. Did you see someone get out of the limousine?

A. Yes.

Q. And who was that?

A. O.J. Simpson.

Q. Did you recognize him at that point?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

What did you observe about Mr. Simpson at that point, in particular,
directing your attention to his demeanor, the way he acted?

A. He just got out of the limo, and -- the limo driver opened the door
for him and he got out, just kind of walked slowly to the back of the
van -- I mean the back of the limo.

Q. Did Mr. Norris say something to him?

A. Yeah, he said something like, hey, Juice, or something.

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

MR. LEONARD: Just to explain his observations.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) I'm sorry. What did he say?

A. He said, hey, Juice. Something to that effect.

Q. And did Mr. Simpson respond?

A. He said, hi, how you doing, or something like that.

Q. Did you -- were you able to observe Mr. Simpson during this
exchange with Mr. Norris?

A. Yes.

Q. And describe for the jury how he acted, what his demeanor was when
he responded to Mr. Norris?

A. Just really nothing out of the ordinary, just said hi.

Q. Okay.

A. Then he walked to the back of the limo.

Q. Now, at some point, did you approach Mr. Simpson?

A. Well, after I was talking to Mike for a while, I walked over to my
van which was parked behind the limo, and I got in the van, called in,
told them we were done, and then he told us we could come in, and so
we were like kind of blocked in, so I was sitting there for a few
minutes, and I asked -- kind of like asked him, hey, Juice, could I
get an autograph, and he said, yeah, just let me get my luggage
situated.

Q. Where -- During the period that you went back and sat in your van,
were you able to observe Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you watching him?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Were you able to see his hands?

A. Not from where I was in the van.

Q. Okay.

At some point, did you -- did you observe Mr. Simpson's hands?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Did you see any cuts or band-aids or any bleeding on Mr. Simpson's
hands?

A. No.

Q. When you approached Mr. Simpson and asked him for an autograph, did
he give it to you right away?

A. Well, he said, let me get my luggage situated, like I said. And
then the limo driver came over with the car and they were carting --
and they were putting the stuff on the cart. It looked like they were
about done, so then I kind of walked over to the side of them. Then he
like -- kind of turned to his left and looked at me like, oh, I'm
sorry, and he reached for the thing and I handed it to him.

Q. Now, when you say the thing --

A. The little --

Q. -- what are you talking about?

A. A little post-it pad, like about 3 by 5.

Q. That was a pad full of post-it notes?

A. Yes.

Q. And you handed it to Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And he signed it?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Did you see Mr. Simpson hold the post-it pad and sign it?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he -- Which hand did he hold it with?

A. With the left, but he held it like down, and then he like signed it
like this, like kind of bending over.

Q. Okay.

And let me show you what's been marked as 1178.

(The instrument herein described as a copy of an autograph was marked
for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1178.)

(Mr. Petrocelli reviews exhibit.)

Q. I show you what is marked for this trial as 1178 and was originally
marked as 1243 in the criminal trial.

And can you tell me what that is, sir?

A. That's a copy of the autograph.

Q. Okay.

Can you read that please, sir?

A. "O.J. Simpson, peace to ya."

Q. Now, can you tell us what Mr. Simpson was wearing when you saw him?

A. Kind of like a jean outfit. Kind of like a jean -- long sleeve jean
shirt, jeans, and kind of like some leather looking boots.

Q. Did you, at any time during the time that you observed Mr. Simpson
and the time that you interacted with him, did you notice him, --
observe -- did you observe him acting unusual in any way, sir.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. You're a sports fan?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were a fan of Mr. Simpson at the time, right?

A. Not necessarily.

Q. You refer to him as Juice, right?

A. When I asked for the autograph, yes.

Q. Yeah, and you knew that that was a nickname for him, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you only saw -- you were only close to him for a few seconds,
long enough to get this autograph, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you didn't really get a close look at his hands as he was
signing the autograph?

A. No.

Q. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it's also correct, sir, that you don't know whether or not the
back of his hand was cut, correct?

A. Right.

Q. And you don't know whether or not his left finger was cut, right?

A. Right.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. P. BAKER: Defense calls Thomas Tallarino.

THOMAS TALLARINO, called as a witness on behalf of the Defendants',
was duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do, yes.

THE CLERK: Sir, would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Thomas Tallarino, T-h-o-m-a-s T-a-l-l-a-r-i-n-o.

DIRECT EXAMINATON BY MR. P. BAKER:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Tallarino.

A. Hi.

Q. How are you?

A. Good.

Q. Taking you back to June 12, 1994, what were you doing for a living
at about that time?

A. I was working for Jersey Films as a production assistant.

Q. Do you recall on the night of June 12, 1994, doing anything
athletic?

A. Yeah, I was rollerblading.

Q. Who were you rollerblading with?

A. A friend of mine.

Q. And what did -- What time did you start rollerblading?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Where did you live on the night of June 12, 1994?

A. On Mayfield between Westgate and Bundy.

Q. Okay.

How close is that to Dorothy and Bundy?

A. It's a couple blocks.

Q. Okay.

Where did you first start when you went rollerblading?

A. From my house.

Q. Okay.

In which direction did you go?

A. I don't remember. I think I went down Mayfield.

Q. And what was your destination that day.

A. There's a school.

Q. Is that the school located on San Vicente and Bundy?

A. Yes, and Gretna Green Way, San Vicente.

Q. And what were you going to do at the school that day?

A. We had hockey sticks and we were going to hit the ball back and
forth a little. Roller hockey.

Q. Roller hockey.

Is that the school that has the short basketball hoops?

A. I think so.

Q. So that people like my size can dunk the ball?

A. Yeah.

(Laughter.)

Q. How long did you play roller hockey?

A. I don't remember how long.

Q. What time of the evening did you leave the school, if you recall?

A. I don't remember. I just know that when I got home, it was a few
minutes before 9:00

Q. So you left in the 8:30, 8:45 range; is that right?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yeah. Probably took me 10, 15 minutes to get home.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) What route did you take from the school to get
back to your apartment?

A. I went down Gretna Green Way, took a left on Montana.

Q. Okay.

A. Took a right on Bundy.

Q. All right

A. And went down the sidewalk on Bundy, on the west side of the
street.

Q. Okay.

And where was your friend in relation to you when you were
rollerblading?

A. Well, we started together but he was going a lot faster than me.

Q. He was in front of you?

A. Yeah.

Q. Was he a better rollerblader than you were?

A. No.

Q. When he came around the corner at Bundy and Dorothy, did you notice
anything suspicious?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I need to approach at this point.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

MR. PETROCELLI: Under Section 352, in People versus Kaurish, I'm going
to object because the defense is offering this guy purportedly to
testify that he saw some people near Nicole's condominium around --
shortly before 9 o'clock p.m., and they have absolutely no evidence
whatsoever to link these persons who were viewed, supposedly, by this
witness to the perpetrator of this crime, they have no evidence
linking these persons to anything that's relevant to this case.

So I don't -- I don't understand how his observations are at all
relevant.

And the defense concedes that Nicole Brown Simpson was alive until
sometime -- until after 10 o'clock p.m., in any event.

And this guy's observations were way before 9 o'clock p.m. because he
was home by 9 o'clock.

MR. P. BAKER: We already addressed this point when we came over to
sidebar during opening statements, when we discussed this situation
about Tallarino in front of the jury.

He will testify that he sees a person with slicked back hair crouching
in the bushes in front of her house at approximately 9 o'clock in the
evening.

Detective Ball and Detective Ramirez interviewed him on July 7, 1994,
about his recollections -- didn't ask him any more questions.

In April, Thomas Lange took him out to identify that location, 875
South Bundy. He said it was 875 South Bundy. They never heard from him
again -- never heard from Detective Lange again.

This goes directly to what he observed in front of 875 South Bundy on
the night in question. It's the exact same issue we discussed at
sidebar during his opening statement.

MR. PETROCELLI: Forgive me, but he hasn't explained the relevance of
this testimony.

He said that this guy made some observations, that he was interviewed
twice by the police, and he still hasn't answered the question how
these observations in any way, shape, or form, relate to this case.

MR. P. BAKER: He's the only eyewitness of suspicious activity outside
875 Bundy on the night they were killed. It's directly relevant.

There was a rush to judgment. It shows there was a judgment -- rush to
identify O.J. Simpson, but they never followed up any leads.

THE COURT: That's the basis for your offering it, it's irrelevant.

MR. P. BAKER: It's relevant to show there was suspicious activity out
in front of 875 South Bundy at 9 o'clock, within an hour to two hours
of when she's killed.

MR. PETROCELLI: Under People versus Kaurish, they have to link any
other alleged perpetrator to the facts of this case. They have no such
evidence.

MR. P. BAKER: People versus Kaurish does not say that.

MR. PETROCELLI: It does.

MR. P. BAKER: It does not say that and you know it.

THE COURT: I'll permit you to offer this evidence of a suspicious
character. If you're going to argue rush to judgment based on that, I
will not allow it.

MR. P. BAKER: I'm going to take it for five minutes, what he observed
and how he was interviewed twice.

MR. PETROCELLI: They're really trying to use this witness on the rush
to judgment point, Your Honor. That's really what he's said.

MR. P. BAKER: No, I have not.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

THE COURT: I'm talking to Mr. Baker, Sr. now.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

THE COURT: I'm only offering this only for the purpose of showing that
there is a suspicious character at around that time. I will not permit
it for a rush to judgment argument.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Mr. Tallarino, you were roller blading on the
west side of Bundy, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you notice any suspicious activity out in front of 875 South
Bundy?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object on leading grounds, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) What did you observe in front of 875 South Bundy?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object on leading on that question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) What did you observe in front of 875 South Bundy
as you roller bladed down Bundy towards Dorothy?

A. Well, as I approached the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, as I was
coming around that bend, I was looking up front for my friend because
he was ahead of me and looking down at the ground because I was on the
sidewalk, and it was dark, and as I looked, you know, down the horizon
a little bit, I thought I saw him like off the sidewalk on the grass
and I thought that he fell and I'm like, you know, did my friend fall.
And as I got down to that, you know, to that spot, I looked, and it
wasn't him.

Q. Can you describe the person you saw that you just mentioned?

A. No, not really.

Q. Was he white, was he black, was he Hispanic, do you know?

A. No.

Q. Can you describe the hair that that person had?

A. He had straight hair.

Q. Slicked-back hair?

MR. PETROCELLI: Object on leading grounds.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Can you describe the hair in a little more
detail?

A. It was straight, it looked like dark straight hair, which was the
signal that it wasn't my friend because he has dark curly hair.

Q. The person was not African-American, was he?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object on leading grounds again.

THE COURT: Sustained.

A. I don't know.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) The person certainly wasn't O.J. Simpson, was it?

MR. PETROCELLI: Again, same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You -- then you continued on home?

A. My friend was waiting for me on the corner. As I looked away from
that person, I realized it wasn't him, I kept going, and he was
standing there and when I got there, the first thing I asked him was I
thought you fell, and then we just went home.

Q. You were interviewed by the police on July 7, 1994, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was an interview conducted in front of Detective Ball and
Detective Ramirez?

A. I don't remember their names.

Q. How long was that interview?

A. Approximately 45 minutes.

Q. And in that interview were you truthful and accurate?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm going to show you what's marked as 1420.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can I see that?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

1422.

(The instrument herein referred to as notes dated 7/7/94 was marked
for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No. 1422.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, there's no foundation, it's not this
witness's statement, no evidence that he's ever seen it. It's an
officer's document.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You've seen this --

MR. PETROCELLI: I would object to him showing the witness.

THE COURT: You may show the witness but you may not receive it into
evidence.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You've seen this document before, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you agree with everything that's contained in that document?

MR. PETROCELLI: Object to that question, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: Document speaks for itself.

A. I can't read this. It's not very legible.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Let me help you.

Do you agree with the first paragraph that reads, "Sunday night,
approximately" --

MR. PETROCELLI: I object to this, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: He can't do this.

THE COURT: You may refresh his recollection but you're not going to
read that to the jury under the guise --

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Do you recall telling Detective Ball and
Detective Ramirez that the person you observed was white or a
lightly-complected Hispanic?

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't remember the conversation that I had with those officers.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Well, you'd agree as of July 7, 1994 your
recollection is better of your observations of June 12, 1994 than it
is now, true?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Can you repeat the question.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You will agree that your recollection on July 7,
1994 is better relating to the night of June 12, 1994 than it is now,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you have no reason to disagree with the description of the
individual as white or a lightly-complected Hispanic, do you?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object. First of all, it's leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) As of July 7, 1994, you had no reason to mislead
Detective Ball and Detective Ramirez, did you?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: Irrelevant.

A. No. I had no reason to mislead anyone.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Did you ever hear from Detective Ball or
Detective Ramirez again?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) When you observed the individual in front of 875
South Bundy, what was his position?

MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: He didn't say --

THE COURT: You can establish exactly where he was.

MR. PETROCELLI: He said he was at Dorothy, Your Honor.

And the person you observed in front of 875 South Bundy --

Q. Okay.

And you're pointing to each end of the photograph, right?

A. I don't recall that.

Q. -- Officer Ramirez and Ball.

Didn't you say that you first saw this person crouching between the
two main gates?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Show me the two main gates.

A. I just pointed them out.

Q. Well, point them out again.

You mean the gates on either side?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your understanding that both those gates belong to 875
South Bundy?

A. No.

Q. And where was the person crouching between the two main gates?

A. Right here.

(Indicating)

Q. You're pointing to the center of the photograph.

Okay.

Your testimony is that in the middle of the photograph, between those
gates, that that is 875 South Bundy? Is that your testimony, sir?

A. No, that's where the person was crouching.

Q. So you don't know if the person was in front of 875 South Bundy or
not, correct?

A. No, it's not correct.

Q. You do know that. Is that what you're saying?

A. Yes.

Q. You know for a fact that the person was crouching in front of 875
South Bundy, is that your testimony; yes or no?

A. Well, he was crouched in front of the wall.

Q. What wall?

A. The wall that's behind those trees.

Q. Okay.

At the time when you observed that person crouched in front of the
wall -- behind the wall, where --

A. In front of the wall.

Q. Okay.

Where in front of the wall, on the grass, on the lawn?

A. On the grass.

Q. You want to point to where on the grass.

A. I just did.

Q. You want to do it again.

MR. P. BAKER: This is asked and answered, Judge.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Can you back it up a little bit?

(Witness indicated.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Okay.

How many feet from the sidewalk was the person located?

A. I don't know, two feet.

Q. Two feet into the lawn from the sidewalk?

A. Several feet.

Q. Several feet?

A. Um-hum.

Q. In front of that tree?

A. Um-hum.

Q. In front of the tree, between the tree and the sidewalk?

A. Yes.

Q. And the person was just standing there, is that what you're saying?

MR. P. BAKER: Misstates --

A. No, he was crouching.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Crouching there, doing nothing, right?

A. I don't know what he was doing.

Q. Okay.

Now, when Mr. Baker first asked you about your observations of this
person, you said that you saw this person as you were approaching the
corner of Bundy and Dorothy, correct; you recall that testimony?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Can you repeat the question.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Yeah.

You testified previously that you were at Bundy and Dorothy when you
saw this person, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. And Dorothy is past 875 South Bundy, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you could not have seen this person if you looked at the corner
of Dorothy and Bundy, correct? Is that correct?

A. Well, my friend was at the corner of Dorothy.

Q. No, answer my question, sir, we'll go a lot quicker, if you're
stopped at the corner of Dorothy and Bundy and looking, you would not
have seen that person, correct?

A. If I was standing at the corner?

Q. Yeah, Dorothy and Bundy.

A. Correct.

Q. And when you were first interviewed by the LA Police officers, you
told them actually that you saw this person near Darlington and Bundy,
didn't you?

A. I don't recall.

Q. You deny that?

A. I don't remember having that conversation.

Q. Okay.

You don't recall at all, is that what you're saying, having that
conversation with Officer Ramirez and Ball on July 7, 1994 at 11:15?
Is that what you're saying?

A. I remember talking to those guys.

Q. Did you tell them anything about seeing this person as you were
approaching Darlington, yes or no?

A. I don't remember saying anything about Darlington.

Q. Now, let's just get the sequence here.

You first contacted an organization called We Tip on July 17, 1994
about this so-called observation, correct?

A. No.

Q. And you did not -- who's the first person you ever contacted?

A. I never contacted anyone. They contacted me.

Q. The police officers contacted you --

A. Yes.

Q. -- correct?

And do you know how they knew how to get in touch with you?

A. Well, no, I don't.

Q. At some point you -- did you not, on June 17, report your
observation to somebody?

A. No. An employee, a company worker called me and said that the
police received a tip that Danny DeVito's driver witnessed something
on that night and she said that I needed to go in and talk to them.

Q. Were you Danny DeVito's driver?

A. I work for Jersey Films, and yes, I drove him at times.

Q. And how -- that person knew what you had observed?

A. No.

Q. But in any event, you were informed that you should contact the
police?

A. Yes.

Q. And at some point before you contacted them, they contacted you,
right?

A. No, that's the first -- that's the first moment that I realized
that I -- someone knew that I saw something.

Q. And who did you contact in law enforcement?

A. I don't remember. I think I called those detectives.

Q. Okay.

And at some point they met with you, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Around July 7, 1994, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then two weeks later, you met with a defense investigator hired
by Mr. Simpson by the name of Bill Pavelic, right, on July 20, 1994?

A. I never met with him.

Q. He interviewed you?

A. Yeah, he called me. I don't remember -- I don't know if it was that
quickly after I talked to the police.

Q. You spoke to him over the telephone?

A. Yes.

Q. And then -- you testified you spoke to Detective Tom Lange sometime
thereafter, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, you were a pretty good roller blader, correct?

A. At the time I was still fairly new.

Q. And roller blading is like roller skating except there's blades,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you had previously gone north on Bundy and you were on your way
back to your apartment on Mayfield where your girlfriend was waiting
to go out to dinner, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were coming south on Bundy on your way home, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were traveling kind of fast on your roller blades, correct?

Answer that yes or no, please.

A. No.

MR. P. BAKER: Vague.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And at no time in your roller blading down
Bundy did you stop for any second in front of 875 South Bundy,
correct?

A. I didn't stop until I reached Dorothy.

Q. You did not stop until you reached Dorothy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And at Dorothy was the first time you stopped, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you already testified that at Dorothy you can't see -- you
could not have made these observations you just testified about?

A. Yes.

Q. You were traveling quite quickly, you were you not?

A. Actually I was going pretty slow.

Q. In fact, isn't it true that just two weeks later while you were
roller blading right up the street, on Bundy and San Vicente, you
rammed into a car, did you not?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, irrelevant.

A. No, a car hit me.

Q. Excuse me?

A. The car hit me.

Q. You were roller blading, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you're roller blading west on San Vicente, correct?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: What's the relevance on this?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You rammed into a car two weeks after this
purported observation, did you not?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, irrelevant, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Does this go to his competency as a roller blader?

MR. PETROCELLI: This goes to how fast this guy was zooming down Bundy.

THE COURT: Sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You were going pretty fast down Bundy, weren't
you?

MR. P. BAKER: Asked and answered.

A. No, I was going pretty slow.

Q. And you had no ability to observe anything in front of 875 South
Bundy, correct?

A. No.

Q. And in fact, you told Officers Ball and Ramirez that you didn't
have -- you didn't know what time it was when you made these
observations, correct?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, misstates the testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You did not know what time it was when they
asked you when these observations were made, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you weren't looking at a watch as you were roller blading by,
were you?

A. No, I wasn't.

Q. And you got home before 9 o'clock, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So you don't have any idea what was going on at 875 South Bundy at
any time after ten to 9:00, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And you did not get even a good enough look at this person, who was
purportedly crouching, to be able to identify him, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So if he were in this courtroom right now, you couldn't pick him
out, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. P. BAKER:

Q. Was the person crouching in the bushes O.J. Simpson?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: You know, I think your objection, I sustained it.

MR. PETROCELLI: You did.

A. I don't know.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) The person had slicked-back hair, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: That's been asked and answered.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) The report that Mr. Petrocelli showed you, or
discussed with you earlier, with Ball and Ramirez, has no mention of
Darlington, does it?

A. This report?

Q. Yes.

A. Well, whoever wrote this, it's -- I can't tell their handwriting, I
don't -- I don't know if there's a mention of Darlington, I never read
this.

Q. And when you told Officer Ball and Officer Ramirez your
observations of June 12, 1994, you were telling the truth, were you
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you told me last night you were sure that person wasn't
O.J. Simpson you observed in the bushes, you were telling the truth,
were you not?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object, Your Honor, it's leading, it's
his witness, it misstates the evidence. He said he couldn't identify
the person, he doesn't know if it was O.J. Simpson or not.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection as to form.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Mr. Tallarino, I spoke with you last night, did I
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And I asked you are you sure that the person in the bushes was not
O.J. Simpson. Do you recall me asking you that?

A. No, I don't recall that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Do you recall telling me the person you observed
in the bushes had slicked-back hair, when we discussed it last night,
Mr. Tallarino?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object. He's leading his own witness. He
put this witness on; not me.

THE COURT: I'll permit it.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Do you recall telling me that last night, Mr.
Tallarino?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: I have nothing further.

MR. PETROCELLI: What exhibit is this?

THE CLERK: Next in order.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recognize the area depicted in that
area?

MR. P. BAKER: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) That's -- isn't that the front of 875 South
Bundy, where those officers or those two men are standing?

A. I said I don't recognize it.

Q. And if you -- would you agree that if you were going down that
sidewalk, you couldn't see anybody in any area in front of any wall,
true?

MR. P. BAKER: Objection, argumentative. That photograph doesn't depict
the residence.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that true?

THE COURT: Excuse me.

I sustainED the objection. The witness says he can't recognize the
scene.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, take a look at this document.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which is the typewritten version of the handwritten
notes that you showed him.

MR. P. BAKER: Can I see it?

(Mr. P. Baker reviews document.)

MR. P. BAKER: I object to this. No foundation. He cannot authenticate
the handwriting. It doesn't accurately depict the handwritten --

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain it. You can't authenticate it.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me ask you this question: Without
describing to the jury what these are, are these your notes at all?

A. This is my diagram, yes.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. PETROCELLI: He said this is his diagram, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: So I'd like to put this on the Elmo. Mark it as next
exhibit in order.

THE CLERK: 2274.

(The instrument herein described as a diagram drawn by Mr. Tallarino
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2274.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) That's a diagram you made with the officers,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, put it on the Elmo, Steve.

(Exhibit 2274 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you were diagramming where you saw the

correct, on that diagram there?

MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. P. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Tallarino --

MR. P. BAKER: Put that back up.

Sorry, Steve. I'm getting bossy now that I'm standing up.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You have Darlington running all the way through
Bundy, don't you, on this diagram, do you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And Darlington doesn't run through Bundy, does it?

A. No.

Q. And the residence you showed Detective Lange in April of 1995 is
875 South Bundy, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: Object, Your Honor, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: Particularly in view of this diagram.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, that street was Dorothy. I just mistook it at the time.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) And the curve you depict at the top of this
document is the curve marked right here?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: I've got nothing further.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI

Q. And in the typewritten version, sir, does Darlington not appear?

MR. P. BAKER: There's no foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You told the officers about Darlington; that's
why you wrote it on the diagram, correct?

MR. P. BAKER: No foundation, asked and answered.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Correct, sir?

A. I thought it was Dorothy at the time.

Q. But regardless of what you thought, you told the officers about
Darlington, correct?

A. Darlington, Dorothy, you know, they sound alike.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that supposed to be funny?

A. No.

They sound alike.

Q. Just answer my question. You told the officers about Darlington?

A. I made a mistake at the time. I meant Dorothy.

Q. Did you tell them about Darlington, yes or no?

A. I don't recall.

Q. You wrote Darlington, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And Darlington appears in this document?

A. Yes.

Q. Right around the corner from Darlington, correct?

Q. You're familiar with these streets, aren't you?

A. I just moved into the neighborhood at the time.

Q. By the way, when you spoke to Tom Lange, didn't you tell Mr. --
your lawyer was present, a man named Levine, right.

MR. P. BAKER: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't believe he was there. I don't recall, I don't think he was
there.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Didn't you talk to Tom Lange about the
possibility of your -- you and he writing a screen play together?

MR. P. BAKER: Outside the scope.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did you?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I did not. I don't write screen plays.

Q. Didn't you talk to him about whether they might want to write a
book or a screen play or something?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. I don't have anything further from him, Your
Honor.

door-knocked, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What did you put on the report in terms of what was
heard?

A. Okay. Would you like me to list them?

Q. No. Just tell me the only ones that -- that have times on them.

There's only two on there, as I recall that have times that there was
anything unusual heard; isn't that correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. It's hearsay.

THE COURT: It's a business record. I've received it as a business
record. The witness may be examined as to what those entries say.

A. I'm sorry; I'm having a hard time trying to figure out when I'm
supposed to answer a question and not answer.

MR. BAKER: I can understand that. Believe me; I'm having a hard time
myself.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What time did you put on the report that barking
dogs were heard?

A. Okay.

On the report, I do list that there were dogs heard barking. And on
some of the addresses that I listed, there are times, and on some of
them, there are not times.

Q. All right.

And when there are times listed, what times did you put on the report?

A. Okay.

859 South Bundy --

Q. Just the times would be fine.

A. Okay.

Well, I have one person who said they heard a dog barking at
approximately 12:15 in the morning, at 00:15 hours -- or 00:15.

I have one listing at -- I have to list the address just to point of
reference. I can't read the time that I put on here. It looks like
0000 hours, which would make it midnight.

Q. Okay.

A. But I'm not sure.

And then at another address, I have they heard barking since 2300
hours, which would be 11 p.m.

Q. Okay.

Now, after you knocked on doors, did you also play with the Akita dog
at the corner of Dorothy and Bundy?

A. I think you have to define "play." I'm not quite sure what you mean
by "play."

Q. Did you pet the dog?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you make observations that the dog had blood on it?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you make observations as to the dog had blood on its paws?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you make observations that the blood was moist?

A. I would be speculating if I said that was true.

Q. Did you touch the blood and find out whether it was moist?

A. Oh, absolutely not. That's not true.

Q. And after you left Bundy, you went out on another call, and then
were called to Rockingham, were you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And when you were at Rockingham, you got there at about 5:20 in the
morning, didn't you?

A. You must be referring to some report I turned in. I don't have a
recollection exactly what time. I could -- can tell you it was before
daylight.

Q. And you were in a black and white, were you not?

A. Yes, I was, sir.

Q. You and your partner, Officer Astin?

A. Yes, Officer Rich Astin.

Q. Where did you park your black and white?

A. When we first arrived?

Q. Yeah.

A. When we first arrived, we were parked on Rockingham, which is the
north-south street at the bottom of that picture that you're showing.
And we were basically parked next to a white Bronco.

Q. You were there while there were four detectives also there,
correct?

A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You were called to the scene as a black-and-white to back up four
detectives that were there; and you were called to that scene at about
05:20 in the morning; isn't that correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Using the word "backup" assumes facts not in
evidence. It's also leading.

MR. BAKER: I intend to be leading this witness.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Okay.

I also have a problem with the term "backup." That can mean a number
of different things. To me, it means something much more serious than
I think you're trying to imply.

Q. You were told on your car radio to go to 360 North Rockingham
before 5:20 in the morning, were you not, sir?

A. No, sir; that is not true.

Q. You just happened to wander by and there were four detectives
there?

A. No.

I can explain if you'd like to hear how I got up there. I can explain
it to you. It's very simple.

Q. Were you told to go to that location?

(Exhibit board No. 1174 is displayed.)

A. Yes, I was told to go to that location.

Q. And in terms of being told to go to that location, you remained
outside, originally, outside the perimeter of 360 North Rockingham,
did you not?

A. Originally, upon our arrival, yes, we did.

Q. And you filed a report, in your own handwriting, within a couple of
weeks after this event occurred, did you not?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you were standing at the Rockingham gate at approximately 5:30,
6 o'clock, somewhere in there, when you saw Arnelle Simpson, a black
female, come around the north end of the pool with detectives; isn't
that true, sir?

A. Okay. Once again, you have a big question in front of me. I'm
trying to figure out what you're trying to say.

Q. I'm trying to ask you whether or not you observed a black female in
the company of Fuhrman and Phillips, walk on the north side -- around
the north side of the pool in they're company.

Did you see that?

A. Yes, I saw that.

What I have problem with is, you keep referring to locations that I
was at, that I was not at. And like I said, I can -- I can explain it
if you wanted me to explain.

Q. All right. I first want to get into the issue of the fact that you
saw and you were later -- were you later able to identify the black
female on the morning of June 13, 1994 as Arnelle Simpson?

A. Well yes, I was. I spoke to her that morning.

Q. And when she came around in the company of the detectives, you were
also able to hear what was being said between the detectives and
Arnelle Simpson, were you not?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. And you were able to hear the detectives discuss whether she knew
where her father was; isn't that true?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you were also able to hear her respond that, in fact, she
didn't know where her father was, and must be gone, because the
Bronco's gone, correct?

A. Correct. I believe she might have even made a statement to me
regarding such.

Q. Then the officers walked her out and showed her the one Bronco over
by where your car was parked over on Rockingham, didn't they? The
detectives, rather?

A. Once again, I have a problem with location.

At that point, my black-and-white was not at that location where the
Bronco was.

Q. All right. You moved it by then?

A. We had moved it by then. We moved it several times when we were
there.

Q. In any event --

A. Okay.

Q. -- you heard her being asked about the whereabouts of her father,
O.J. Simpson, did you not?

A. Yes, sir; that is correct.

Q. You also heard her, or watched her being led over to the area where
Rockingham and the Bronco was, correct?

A. Yes. I'm trying -- I want to apologize for the brief moment of
silence. I'm trying to remember if she was being led.

And, yes, you are correct; she was being led to that location.

Q. And after she was, the detectives -- and this included Fuhrman and
Phillips, didn't it?

A. If you read through my report again, which I haven't done too much
in great detail, I don't believe I exactly recall which detectives
were there. I might be mistaken, but right now, I don't have a
recollection which detectives were actually interviewing her.

Q. The detectives came with her around the north side of the house,
though, did they not?

A. Correct. Whichever detectives had previously stated they were the
ones talking to her, those are the ones I saw.

Q. They came around the pool area and around the north area of the
house, and were asking her the whereabouts of her father, and then
came around the driveway?

A. That is correct, yes.

Q. And you were able to visualize this, and not only visualize it, you
were able to hear what was being said among those people, were you
not?

A. "Visualize" as -- you mean see?

Q. See them.

A. Okay.

Q. And hear them?

A. I saw them; I heard them. Very simple.

Q. All right. all right.

And after they pointed out the vehicle on Rockingham, they were
walking back towards the front of Mr. Simpson's residence, and you
heard Ron Phillips tell Arnelle Simpson that her stepmother had been
killed, isn't that true? And you watched her break into tears?

A. I watched her break into tears. I don't remember which detective
told her. So if you say it's Ron Phillips, and you're saying that's
been stipulated and that's true, then that must be true.

I can only tell you I saw a detective talking to her. It appeared to
me he explained that there -- that her stepmother had been killed, and
she burst into tears.

Q. And this was not anywhere inside the house; this was out on the
driveway, wasn't it?

A. Correct.

Q. And then they went into the front door of the house, didn't they,
the detectives and Arnelle Simpson?

A. I'd have to look at my report to remember that. I don't know right
now. I don't remember which door they went into.

They did go back in the house; I know that's a fact, at some time.

Q. You say back in the house?

A. Or back -- excuse me -- into the house the first time, I believe.

Q. They had -- you had never seen them in the house when you first
observed them come around the north side and come out the pathway;
isn't that correct?

A. That's correct. I saw her emerge from her -- I guess you call it a
bungalow in the back.

Q. So you never saw --

MR. BAKER: Can we get the other --

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. What number is this one?

MR. BAKER: It is -- hold on one second, Gina.

MR. LEONARD: Want the other diagram.

MR. BAKER: Yeah, the diagramatic --

MR. P. BAKER: It's 1174.

(Exhibit 116 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did -- when you arrived there at approximately
5:20, there were already two unmarked police cars there, correct?

A. Possibly. I don't know. That's not what I saw when I arrived. I
just saw Westec there when I arrived.

Q. All right.

Well, you obviously observed the detectives subsequently, correct?

A. Right. There were four detectives there. I only remember seeing one
police car or one unmarked car.

Q. Okay.

And -- and you observed the detectives walk Arnelle out of her room,
around the north side of the property, and onto the driveway?

A. That is correct.

Q. And they did not go from Arnelle's room, up the stairs and into the
back of Mr. Simpson's house, did they?

A. That's what I believe I saw. I don't believe I saw them walk
through the house. They had emerged from the pool area and walked
around.

Q. And you were clear -- clear in your report -- and you gave -- by
the way, you gave two reports, did you not?

A. Kind of, I guess. I don't know what you're referring to.

Q. You have a statement form that's in your handwriting?

A. Correct.

Q. And then you subsequently gave another report to Detective
Phillips, did you not?

A. Is that the impound report you're talking about?

Q. No, sir, it is not.

A. Okay.

Q. Let me show it to you.

A. Please.

Q. And see if this refreshes your recollection.

A. Okay.

Q. Now, this two-page handwritten report is all in your handwriting,
is it not?

A. Correct. That is my handwriting.

Q. And that was your recollection a couple of weeks post-incident;
that is, you wrote that within a couple of weeks of June 13, 1994,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you then -- well, strike that.

Why didn't you date it?

A. I should have dated this.

Q. I agree.

Why didn't you?

A. I don't know. I would -- I would imagine there would have been a
date someplace on this. You're correct.

Q. There's -- there is a space for the date, is there not?

A. Well, this was -- this statement form is usually used for suspects,
when we're interviewing them, and we want to take statements.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

A. Okay.

Q. There is a space for the date and the time of the interview, is
there not?

A. Correct.

Although this wasn't an interview, but that is correct.

Q. And there was nothing that precluded you from dating the form,
true?

A. No.

Q. Now, in that particular statement, you document your observations
relative to the detectives relating to Arnelle Simpson. Number one,
the inquiry concerning the whereabouts of her father; and number 2,
the issue of telling her that her stepmother had been in a homicide,
correct?

Those are your words?

A. That's what I believe I saw, yes.

Q. And -- and you certainly visualized Arnelle break down in front of
you, didn't you?

A. Yes, she was definitely crying.

Q. And with that, the police officers detectives, whatever, took her
into the front of the house?

A. If you can hold on just a moment.

Q. Sure.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, you've got around six minutes. You did this
twice. I don't want to hear this again.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

You're asking me if I saw him enter the front of house.

On this report, all I had stated is that they entered the house, like
I said before, what, five, ten minutes ago, I don't remember which
door they entered in. So they could have entered at any door. I just
know they went inside the house.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You did not see them go back around the house, did
you, sir?

A. They may have gone back around.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand that question correctly.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You didn't see them go back around the house?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Mr. Baker. The witness was answering the
question.

THE COURT: Not very well.

THE WITNESS: Okay. I'll try harder.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You didn't visualize with your own eyes and go
anywhere into the house; isn't that correct, sir?

You didn't see him walk around the driveway in front of the house over
to the north side and walk around after Nicole's -- after -- strike
that -- after Arnelle broke down in tears, did you?

A. I see.

I would be speculating saying "notice." If I put down they entered the
house, then -- I wouldn't say they entered the house; I would say they
walked back to the pool area and never saw them.

As you saw, it's pretty detailed. I'm not going to say they walked
through the front of the house. They may have walked through the front
of house. You ask them.

Maybe she said they did. I personally don't know. I just said they
entered the house. If they got in through the back, that's -- they
could have entered either door.

For me to say they only entered through the front door, only through
the back door, now I'd only be -- I'd be speculating.

They obviously went inside the house. I may have seen them go back --
to the back.

I don't have a visualization.

Those are your words.

Q. Got ya.

A. Thank you very much.

Q. So your total recollection is, after she broke down, you don't have
a recollection, except them entering the house, correct?

A. In how -- if I put in that report they entered that house, I
watched them enter the house.

Q. And you --

A. And they -- location. They entered either through the front door or
the back door. I don't know which one now. If they entered someplace
weird like a window, I would obviously remember that. I'm not trying
to be sarcastic.

Q. They didn't fly up through the garage?

A. Correct. I don't know which door they entered into.

Q. Where were you when you visualized this?

A. Okay.

Q. Where were you standing when you saw it?

A. Can you define "visualize"? I'm really -- I'm not trying to make a
joke of this, but I saw this, and I'm really having a hard time with
that.

Q. Fine; let's use your word.

A. Thank you.

Q. Mine's not working.

A. I'm having a hard time with that one.

Q. In --

A. You want to know where I was when I saw this?

Q. Just --

A. I'm sorry.

Q. We're going to start all over.

A. All right.

Q. I know.

Now, Arnelle had come down the driveway and they had pointed out the
Bronco?

A. Okay. Not really like that.

Q. She was in it, the driveway. You testified a few moments ago she
was in the driveway; they pointed the Bronco out and she said, yes,
that's my father's Bronco, or words to that effect, right?

A. But the way you're pointing through the gate, it's as if they
exited the gate onto that driveway on Rockingham.

They never exited the gate. They simply walked to the gate, which at
the time you could see through, and they pointed, there's the Bronco,
and said something to the effect, well, yeah, she didn't know what the
heck it was doing there, but it was there.

I'm sorry.

(A bench conference was held, which was not reported.)

THE COURT: Okay, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to adjourn till
tomorrow, 8:30.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions. Do not
make any communications about this case, even like you're on this
case, to anybody, even if they know.

All right. Everybody understand that? No communications about this
case to anybody. Don't let them talk to you.

Okay. See you tomorrow, 8:30.

THE COURT: Stay seated.

(Jurors exit the courtroom.)

THE COURT: Okay. Officer, you are ordered back tomorrow, 8:30.

THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: You are ordered not to discuss anything connected with this
case, with anyone, until you come back tomorrow.

Thanks a lot.

THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir.

The reports.

MR. BAKER: I'll get them.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, December 18,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Call Herb MacDonell.

HERBERT LEON MacDONELL, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants,
was duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do, yes.

THE CLERK: Please, state and spell both your first and your last names
for the record.

THE WITNESS: Herbert Leon MacDonell. Last name M-a-c-D-o-n-e-l-l.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Sir, where do you reside?

A. Corning, New York.

Q. What is your occupation, sir?

A. I'm a forensic scientist, specifically a criminalist, involved in
examining physical evidence, evaluating it, and hopefully, the
reconstruction of prior events.

Q. And your position at the laboratory is what, sir?

A. I'm director of a small forensic laboratory, a consulting
laboratory, which is available to both prosecution and defense in
criminal cases, for the plaintiff and defense in civil cases.

Q. And you direct that laboratory, do you not, sir?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And do you have --

Well, tell us about your undergraduate degree.

A. I went to Alfred University, which is also in upstate New York. I
received my bachelor of arts degree, with a major in chemistry, and a
minor in mathematics. And I have a BA degree.

Q. And do you have any graduate degrees, sir?

A. Yes. I have a master of science, with a major in analytical
chemistry and a minor in physics from the University of Rhode Island.

Q. And do you have any other formal education beyond the bachelor's
degree and the master's degree in science?

A. Yes, I do.

I've attended many seminars and programs of up to, in one case, ten
months in duration, and under the Attorney General, State of Rhode
Island, in a course known as criminalistics.

I've attended many analytical chemistry symposiums and courses dealing
with forensic science in particular, and analytical chemistry
generally. These have been at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and other universities.

And I've also attended many police programs under the New York State
-- it's called the Municipal Police Training Council. It's been a
while since I took that course; I think it was 1964.

I've also taken the same thing at the University of Pennsylvania State
Police and other police-oriented programs, as well as forensic
science.

Q. And have you taught, Mr. McDonell?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Tell us -- please relate to us what teaching experience you have
had, what -- what institutions and what courses you taught.

A. I began teaching, other than graduate assistant work, at Alfred. I
began teaching in Milton, Wisconsin as a professor of chemistry and
head of the chemistry department for three years, between 1951 and
'54. Then did two more years of graduate study at Rhode Island, where
I was an assistant in the analytical chemistry department.

I began teaching at Corning Community College in 1960, offering
courses in police science. I taught there till 1992, with a five-year
sabbatical between about 1972 and '77.

I also taught at Elmira College, a four-year institution in upstate
New York, where I taught a total of ten different courses in forensic
science. And that was between 1972 and 1983.

I've since conducted an institute specializing in the direction metric
interpretation, or the study of appearance of blood, to determine the
possible causes that produce these blood-stain appearances. These are
one-week institutes.

I have running now, 46 of them: One in Australia, one in Sweden, and
the other 44 within the continental United States.

Q. And can you relate to us what industrial experience you've had?

A. I was employed by the DuPont Company, as a research analytical
chemist in Philadelphia, to one year following graduate school at
Rhode Island. And I then went to Corning, New York, and worked in the
analytical department. I was there for 15 years, developing methods of
analysis for glass and other materials.

Q. Tell us what experience you've had in the field of scientific crime
investigation, please.

A. While I was in graduate school, I was employed by the Attorney
General as a forensic scientist for the two years there.

I began consulting after the learning experience and work experience I
had in the crime lab, quite a bit, off and on, up to 1958, when I
began doing it quite extensively.

I had done a lot of writing, and I guess I was becoming somewhat
known, so people called me. And from 1970 on, when I had the
laboratory constructed which is the lower level of a large structure
-- the upper level is all living facilities -- so we either have a
laboratory in the lower level and live in the laboratory, or the
laboratory's in our home, whichever way -- whichever floor you're on.

So I began doing a lot of consulting then, and have ever since
consulted, so far, I think, 13 foreign countries and all 50 states and
the District of Columbia.

Q. Do you belong to any professional societies?

A. Yes, quite a few.

Q. Please tell us the major ones.

A. I'm a member of the American Academy of Forensic Science. I have
been, since 1964, a fellow in that organization, over 32 years now.

I belong to the British and Canadian Societies of Forensic Science,
and to many specific organizations within the general field of
forensic science, dealing with criminalistics: Fingerprint
identification, firearms identification, and many teaching
associations in that field.

Q. Have you ever written or authored any technical articles on
forensic science, sir?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Tell us about how many.

A. I know I've written well over 100 articles that have been published
dealing with forensic science.

I have written about five books on blood-stain pattern interpretation,
and many chapters in other people's books where they were the editor,
in Canada and the United States, on blood-stain pattern
interpretation.

Q. Have you ever lectured on the subject of forensic science before
any professionally recognized organizations?

A. Yes, many times.

Q. How many?

A. I've documented over 600 that I know of, and I'm sure I missed a
few.

Q. All right.

Are you certified by any recognized forensic organization, Mr.
McDonell?

A. Yes. I'm certified -- and still am -- by the International
Association for Identification as a Senior Crime Scene Analyst.

Q. Tell us what experience you've had with human blood evidence.

A. I began working with human blood during my master's thesis at the
University of Rhode Island, where I developed a new method, actually,
for typing blood, using what is called today, immunoelectrophoresis.
At this time, that word had not yet be coined. It was used by the
French for six years after I published my thesis, or had it written.
It was never actually published.

The subject of blood stains has always interested me from the
standpoint of physics to determine from the static aftermath of an
event that caused blood shed, what are the possibilities that could
have caused that blood-stain pattern.

And I became interested very much, in 1966, when I had a case with a
lot of blood and I couldn't understand it. And I since researched the
literature and found many other people over the years, going way back,
had the same experience: They recognized there was something there
they did not understand, so they conducted research.

And that is precisely what I did. I was not original in it; it is not
something that I did. I had cases to go back to, 1514 in England,
showing blood-stain patterns being recognized for their significance.

Simply stated, to make it very simple, I did research for the
government under the Department of Justice on a project known as
flight characteristics and stain patterns of human blood in the years
1969 to '71, published a report that was in print by the
Superintendent of Documents for over 12 years, distributed worldwide.
And then as a result of that, was asked to begin teaching the subject,
and that is what I have done, outlining the institutes. I have been
working with it, literally, since 1954.

Q. And who attends these institutes that you put on for blood stains?

A. Basically, they're crime-scene technicians; they're people that
would go to a scene, investigate, and try to understand what had
occurred.

They would be homicide investigators. I'm getting quite a few forensic
pathologists. These people come from all over the world. I'm getting
attorneys, and we've had veterinarians. We've had a wide variety of
people, including forensic odontologists or bite mark people to better
understand what this blood means or what it could mean.

Q. And in your experience, have you ever had the opportunity, and
actually presented expert testimony on the subject of human
blood-stain evidence interpretation?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. How many times have you testified on human blood-stain evidence
interpretation?

A. Just on blood stain, I don't honestly know. I would estimate
certainly, 175 times. I know it's been in over -- in over 35 states
and two foreign countries.

Q. When were you first retained in the O.J. Simpson matter?

A. Well, I was first contacted in August of 1964. I was not --

Q. '94?

A. '94.

(Laughter.)

A. (Continuing.) 1994. That was through a phone call that I received.

I was not actually retained, as such, until, of course, I received a
retainer some couple of months later, I think.

Q. And you were offered to the District Attorney and the Los Angeles
D.A.'s office to assist in the investigation of this case?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. It's preliminary.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your services were offered to investigate this crime
to Los Angeles Police Department, as well as the L.A. District
Attorney's office, by and through Mr. Simpson; isn't that correct?

A. Well, by "you," you mean --

THE COURT: Well, that I'll sustain.

Resume your examination.

Q. You're --

A. I'm not sure I understand the question. I was made available?

THE COURT: The question is not pending, Doctor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were made available to the L.A. --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Objection sustained. And that question is not pending.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is this a copy of your C.V.?

A. Yes, it is.

MR. BAKER: Next number.

THE CLERK: 2266.

(The instrument herein referred to as Curriculum Vitae of Herbert Leon
MacDonell was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2266.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of --

You testified in the criminal trial, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You have reviewed various photographs of the crime scene, have you
not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have done interpretations relative to blood-stain and
blood-pattern evidence from this?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

May we approach the bench, Your Honor?

THE COURT: All right.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, this witness -- this witness's
deposition was not taken pursuant to a stipulation between the
parties, that his testimony would be frozen as the testimony he gave
in the criminal trial. At the criminal trial, he testified about
something he saw on the inside of the sock.

Mr. Baker appears to be leading him up, now, to blood-stain
interpretation at the crime scene, and it wasn't the testimony at the
criminal trial. He was frozen. We weren't allowed to take his
deposition. And our understanding is, his testimony is to be limited.
That's what it was with all the other witnesses.

MR. BAKER: First of all, they were totally allowed to take anybody's
deposition they wanted to. That was never stipulated.

THE COURT: Can I have the stipulation?

MR. BAKER: Second -- second of all, Your Honor they put on -- they put
on Spitz to testify as to the time of the crime of a minute and 15
seconds. I have to be able to rebut that testimony, that both crimes
took a minute and 15 seconds and that can be done in those small
measures through the interpretation of blood stains. And I have to
have leeway after they put on their evidence to rebut that evidence.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, there's nothing --

THE COURT: Excuse me. I want to see the stipulation.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's at the -- Your Honor, I will represent that it
recites, and it's in the court file, that the parties stipulate that
if they designate a particular person to be frozen, then that person's
testimony at trial cannot go beyond anything given at the criminal
trial, in return for the other side not taking that person's
deposition.

And that's all set out in the stipulation.

And, for example, they asserted that against us in regard to Bruce
Weir, we were not allowed to expand his testimony pursuant to that
stipulation.

Mr. MacDonell is one of the enumerating deponents on the list of the
defense witnesses whose testimony is frozen.

It would take me ten to 15 minutes for me to get it for you. I have to
go back to the hotel across the street and get it. He's clearly on the
list. That is clearly what's been said; there's never been a dispute
about that.

MR. MEDVENE: This is really out of blue, Your Honor, totally, because
everything up to now was going to be limited to his area.

MR. BAKER: All I can say, Your Honor, is that when they put on
testimony, we have to be able to rebut that testimony. And all of the
experts that we're calling are the experts that were called in the
criminal trial. So I've got to be able to -- where Spitz was not --
did not testify in the criminal trial -- I've got to be able to rebut
his testimony.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, Dr. Spitz's testimony was taken. He
offered the opinion. He offered it at trial. And they cross-examined
him on that on the length of time his deposition was offered. They
cannot do this. This is not what the agreement was.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'd like to go get the stipulation.

THE COURT: All right. I'll sustain the objection pending production of
the stipulation. If you don't show me the stipulation, I'll set it
aside.

MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, he did testify on coagulation times during the
trial, so I want to go into coagulation.

MR. MEDVENE: Wait. Wait. What do you mean, coagulation times?

MR. BAKER: Basically, how long it takes blood to coagulate.

THE COURT: If he testified to that at trial, he may testify to that.

MR. MEDVENE: I'd like to see the page you're talking about.

No. Excuse me.

Look, I'm trying to play by the same rules that they're supposed to
play by. If there's coagulation testimony, just show me what it is.
I'm not arguing about it.

THE COURT: Show him the coagulation testimony.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, from the time that you were retained in this
case, did you conduct various experiments relative to some physical
evidence that you had been presented with in this case, sir?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And relative to the -

- let's talk about the socks for a moment. Did you examine the socks
in this case?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you find blood on the socks in this case?

A. Yes, I found stains which gave a chemical test -- a presumptive
test for blood, which was done in my presence.

I understand other reports were more specific.

Q. Now, when you examined the socks for blood, sir, where did that
occur?

A. That was in a private laboratory in Los Angeles. And the name of
the laboratory was Technical Associates, Incorporated. That, as I
understand it, is a private laboratory that we were allowed to visit,
and it was operated by Mark Scott Taylor.

Q. Okay.

Now, did you have -- when you examined both socks --

And these are the socks that were purportedly recovered from Mr.
Simpson's bedroom on June 13, 1994. That was your understanding, was
it not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, did you have
any problem visualizing the blood on the socks, on either of the
socks?

A. We didn't visualize it. I say "we." Doctor Henry Lee and I were
together during this examination.

It was visible. To me, visualization is doing something -- enhancing
either chemically or physically by filter photography or something, to
show greater contrast.

This was not necessary with high-intensity illumination. You could see
that there was visibly a stain on the sock.

Q. And then, as a criminalist, did you pick up the socks and -- and
examine them with your naked eye to determine if there was blood,
before you did any testing on the socks whatsoever?

A. Of course, yes.

Q. And could you then visualize, with your naked eye, the blood on the
socks, or at least the stains on the socks that later turned out to be
blood?

A. Yes.

But we didn't pick it up to do it. They were lying flat, and the light
was put on them -- it, and it was easier to examine them that way than
to physically pick them up.

Q. And did you -- did you do -- well, strike that.

Tell us how big the stain -- the original stain was on the sock, in
the area that was cut out, at the time you examined the socks.

A. The stain was of a -- it was almost one by one and a half inches.
It was very close to that. And the center portion had been cut out in
something like a -- a box, with a little square on the top removed. It
was a rectangle with a square portion cut out; so it was not a
circular cut. It wasn't an angular cut, but it almost looks like two
cuts had been made, one smaller and one larger, which commuted to make
one larger hole.

Q. Now, basically, before you ever were able to examine these items of
physical evidence, the LAPD had taken and cut out portions of the
sock; isn't that correct, sir?

A. Well, somebody cut it out.

Q. Okay.

A. I believe it was LAPD.

Q. All right.

MR. BAKER: And, Phil, can you put that on the Elmo.

THE REPORTER: That's exhibit what, sir?

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1239.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of socks found in Mr.
Simpson's bedroom, was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 1239.)

(Defendants' Exhibit 1239 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is that the area that was cut out of the -- of the
socks before you visualized them?

A. Yes. The very center area where the arrow is pointing now, it looks
like a vertical rectangle, is sort of a shoe box, with another portion
cut out to the left, which, depending on whether the fabric is lying
down or not, can look more angular in a straight-line configuration
than it does in that photograph.

Q. All right.

And approximately how big is the area that had been removed?

A. As I recall, it was nearly an inch in length. It was quite long.
But again, the overall stain is an inch and a half; and it took the
larger portion of that stain. So I would have to proportion it to --
proportion it out. If I remember, it's a good size, three-quarters to
an inch in length.

Q. Were you ever able to examine the material that was removed from
the sock?

A. No.

Q. And you had to restrict your examination to the periphery of the
area that had been removed?

A. Well, yes.

But we -- I examined the whole sock, not just the periphery. But I
could see the periphery of the stain, yeah.

Q. And what did you determine when you examined the sock?

A. Well, the surface that we're looking at, through which a hole has
been cut, that is the outside surface of the left side of the
stocking, as you would look down on it. Regardless of whether it was
on the right foot or the left foot, it would be on your left side, as
the toes would be over here, to the lower left of this photograph.
(Indicating.) And that particular area that had been cut out had this
stained area around it, which, on visual observation, you could see
that it was a stain.

Using illumination to intensify the contrast, and a microscope, I
started, as I believe, as I frequently do, using a pocket microscope,
which allows me to examine at 20 magnification, items such as this, to
have some idea of what I might look for using more sophisticated
microscopy, mainly a stereobinocular microscope, which has two
eyepieces. And you can look down and get a stereomicroscopic or 3-D
effect, if you will, then I examined it with a stereomicroscope and
was able to see the stain much better.

Q. And the side that would be the left side, this side, (indicating)
would be side -- this would be side one?

A. Yeah. This would be what we're looking at, we had called side one,
to show that it's the outside as the sock would be worn, and you're
looking inside to side 3. Side 3 would be the inside of the other half
of the sock if you went through like I demonstrated before.

If you went through my coat, I'd have side one, and then inside, you'd
have side two. And then side 3 would also be the inside, and then side
4, again, would be the outside. So there are four surfaces. Whether
it's a coat sleeve or a sock lying down, you can see side one and side
3.

Q. Now --

A. Or "surface," I think, is a better word.

Q. How did you make a determination as to how that blood was applied
to that sock, from your analysis, looking at it through a microscope?

A. Well, more or less, by elimination, I determined how it didn't get
there.

Many times, there's more than one mechanism that will cause a
staining. But understanding the staining procedure, we can eliminate
those kinds of stains that would produce other results. For example,
blood did not drip onto this area; it did not splash or spatter onto
it.

It was transferred by one of two mechanisms which are very closely
associated: One would be simply touching or compressing it; and
another would be a lateral motion at the same time, which is called a
swiping action, as differentiated from wiping, where you wipe
something up and the stain is already there, like on a countertop, if
you wipe it up. But if you have blood, for example, on your finger,
and you touch something with or without a lateral motion, it is called
transfer.

If there is a lateral motion, you may see some feathering out as it
moves along and leaves the surface.

And these edges were quite crisp. And while it could have been a
swiping-type action, it is also consistent with a -- just straight
compression. And that could have resulted by either coming in contact
with something that had blood on it or blood simply being added to the
surface with something like a pipette or medicine dropper, or just
gently putting it on so it didn't drop any distance, or it would have
caused satellite spatters, I've seen other spots around it.

So this is just a transfer pattern, either by something like a finger
that's very, very bloody, touching in a perfect oval, which is not
logical but possible, or a drop of blood, a single drop of blood that
is added and "teased around," more or less moved, to create a stain to
soak into the fabric.

MR. BAKER: Now, Phil would you put up that next photo.

Yeah.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1240.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photomicrograph pertaining to
socks found in Mr. Simpson's bedroom was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 1240.)

(Defendants' Exhibit 1240 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is what we've -- just shown is this a -- 1240, this
is a blow-up of the microscopic photography that you did in your
examination of that sock?

A. Yes. This is called a photomicrograph, as opposed to
microphotography. It is a photomicrograph taken using a compound
microscope.

And the area shown here (indicating) is the stain surface 1 around the
area that's cut out. And the blue circle, which was added earlier, is
to show the highlight of the blood stains on the fabric.

The easiest way to comprehend this photograph is to think of corduroy
pants, something with a very heavy weave. If you were to take, for
example, white paint and smear across your pants, wiping your hands,
you'd see the ribs very clearly. There would be parallel white lines.
These are the high points in the weave of the fabric (indicating).
These are individual threads comprised of individual fibers, which are
woven together to make the thread, which is woven together to make the
fabric. So the circled area shows that the stain is on the top, the
protruding portion. The highlight and the clear spots are down in the
valley. So again, if you have a weave which is something like this
(indicating) and it's pushed across with blood or any other stain
material, you will see the surface of the weave; you will not see the
valleys.

If there's a large volume of blood that's put on, it will soak
indiscriminately within the entire fabric, and all of this area down
here would be just as red as the surface.

If it is spattered from an impact, it indiscriminately go in between,
as well as on the surface. And this is certainly not a spatter; it's
just all in the surface. So this is a transfer pattern.

Q. If, in fact, a spatter would occur when -- for example, we've seen
pictures of the crime scene, and there was a large volume of blood
around the body of Nicole Brown Simpson -- if someone had stepped into
that and caused the spatter of that blood, it would not produce this
pattern; is that correct?

A. That's correct. You wouldn't produce one-by-one-and-a-half-inch
stain by spatter; it would be a huge splash.

Q. And splash would not encompass a concentrated area
one-by-one-and-a-half inches such as was apparently in this sock,
because that's the area that's been removed; is that correct?

A. Well, the smaller area, I'm sure, is more concentrated, as were the
areas right towards the center more concentrated.

This is taken off a little away from the main stain (indicating), but
still very clearly stained heavily, to show that it did not soak
through completely. And this could not be a stain produced by
spattering or any other mechanism like that. It is on the surface
only.

Q. So, in other words, if there was blood on a weapon, for example,
and it was cast off, or cast away, you would not get this type of
pattern?

A. No, not at all.

Q. And the only way that you could get it is if there was pressure
applied to the material by the material coming in contact with
something that contained blood, or somebody actually putting a drop of
blood on it and compressing it?

A. Yes.

When you said "casting off," it could not be. But if the weapon --
bloody weapon actually struck and grazed across the surface, then you
would produce this effect. But you would not produce the heavier
concentration in the center, 'cause there isn't that much volume. So
this is not from even brushing by a swiping action of a weapon.

Q. Okay.

Now, did you examine side two, as it were, of the fabric?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you find on side two?

A. Well, the inside of the surface that was just shown had blood
coming through it. And of course, it came through in the heavy
concentration area in the center, but not on the area that was just
shown. That surface was all confined to the very top of the weave, and
so there just wasn't enough blood volume to go through. Very little
actually went through.

Q. All right.

Did you examine side three of the sock in the area where the sock had
been cut?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you find any material that looked like blood in that area?

A. Yes; I found many little areas of red which had been a fluid and
dried, and actually was surrounding, in some cases, the fibers. So it
was wet when it went through from side one, soaking through side two,
and then touching side three. Or surface three.

Q. Now, did -- obviously, if someone's foot is in the sock, side three
should not have received any blood; is that correct?

A. That's correct; it couldn't have. It wouldn't go through the foot.

Q. And the -- describe what you visualized -- all right.

Can you -- is this a photomicrograph of what you visualized on side
three?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And tell the jury what -- what the area in the circle is.

A. Well, I'd rather start out here.

This is the area of the circle which has a red center to it.
(Indicating.)

These are threads that are woven together by individual fibers
(indicating), and there's one here on the left (indicating). And many
of them show up quite clearly as individual fibers of a fabric. They
are woven together to create a thread.

This is woven together, as you see here (indicating). There are
actually four different threads coming across, all comprised of
numerous fibers.

In the center, there is a bridging fiber from one part of the thread
to another that is encased -- that is, the fiber is encased in a red
stain, a little red ball that has welled or caused the fluid to
encompass the fiber. And it is dried in that round ball configuration.

It is extremely tiny. I don't think this could be isolated. We're
looking at an incredible magnification. And we photographed it to show
that it was there. If it were isolated, it could possibly give a
presumptive test for blood. Some presumptive tests on that surface
were done, but I don't know if it was this one or some other one,
because you can't see what you're doing macroscopically or without
magnification. When you're trying to find something like this with the
naked eye, it's impossible.

MR. P. BAKER: That is 1241.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photomicrograph pertaining to
socks found in Mr. Simpson's bedroom was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 1241.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, sir, in terms of this -- this red ball that we
see up there, (indicating) how -- how does fluid, if it's dripping
through or is compressed through, what -- what form is it going to
take?

Is it something going to be spherical, lateral?

A. It's going to tend to form ball, a spheroid, technically.

In air, a drop of rain or blood or milk or any other liquid is not
tear-drop shaped, despite some textbooks which have come out recently.
One, in particular which makes that erroneous claim. This is not true.

A drop in the air immediately, although it's forming in something like
a teardrop off the orifice, whether it's a tap in your bathroom or
kitchen or it is a medicine dropper, it does not come out as a
teardrop; it comes out as a round ball.

Physically, there are forces within liquids which tend to pull them
together. The molecules do not want to spread out. These are called
van der Waals' forces. And they pull together so that immediately,
when a drop leaves a medicine dropper, it is within microseconds, a
round ball.

This phenomenon has been photographed by Professor Edginton at MIT 50
years ago. And it's very common knowledge in physics that -- the lay
people look at the television weather screen showing teardrops. We're
programmed to think that teardrops like -- like teardrops, but they
don't. Raindrops, I mean, do not look like teardrops; they are round.

And I even have a photograph in my pocket of a drop of blood which I
didn't realize was there until last night, but it's round. I could
show that, if you like.

Q. Okay.

And this -- where you photographed these, you found more than one of
these red spheroids?

A. Yes. It's trying to be round; it's trying to form a round ball, but
it's encompassing a fiber. And as such, the fiber, of course, is
wetted along its length, and so it's kind of pulling apart, because it
wants to join the fiber; but yet, it's pulling together because it
doesn't want to leave itself.

A speck like that is fighting with itself to retain a perfectly round
configuration, although it is still wetting and trying to soak out
along the fiber.

Q. How many of these did you find?

Did you find multiple red balls, if you will, in -- in side three of
the sock?

A. I would say that I found at least a dozen.

It's difficult, when you're looking at this magnification, to move a
material around under a microscope and scan back and forth. And while
I could have seen the same one twice and counted it twice, I may have
missed three others.

So I would say that I saw a dozen that were different, but I saw
several. But this one was the one that showed the clearest, because it
was easiest to get the lighting in the photograph.

Q. Now, would --

MR. P. BAKER: That was 1241 on the Elmo.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1239.

(Exhibit 1239 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The area where you found these red balls was
directly under the area that was removed?

A. Yes; it was in this area right in the central portion, which would
be the area underneath the greatest soaking through it. It had to soak
through, of course, but it would be the area that's apparently cut
out, where the concentration on surface one penetrated through to
surface two, the inside, and then stained surface three.

Q. And these red balls were on the exterior -- that is the surface of
side three -- were they not, sir?

A. That's correct. The one you're looking at right through here.

Q. Wasn't red balls in the area other than the area underneath where
there was -- the stain had been cut out of the sock?

A. No, we did not -- I did not see any in any area in the side.

But again, you're looking at an extremely high magnification, and it
would be like trying to look at the United States from an airplane and
cover the entire United States.

I went around in here quite some distance, but I didn't certainly take
the toe areas and other areas that were not even near this area. But
anyplace I looked, I did not find them, except in the area -- surface
three, directly under surface one and two.

Q. And is -- is that -- the stains, the red stains that you've just
shown us -- is that consistent with somebody compressing and putting
blood on side one of the sock and pushing it into the sock?

A. Yes; it is like with a medicine dropper or something like that.

Q. And with a swipe pattern on a sock, if there is anything in the
sock, you would not anticipate having anything go through to side
three, I assume; correct?

A. When you say "something in the sock" --

Q. Yeah, like an ankle.

A. Foot?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yeah. If there's anything in this sock when side one is stained, it
certainly would not go through and stain side three, no. Not to any
extent.

Q. Okay.

Now, the drying time of -- the drying time of -- of the blood on this
sock, in your opinion, would take approximately how long?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. May we approach?

MR. PETROCELLI: Same problem, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, this was in order -- this particular
evidence was offered at the criminal trial; that is, any test he did,
it was kept out because of no preliminary showing of comparable
circumstances of tests.

In other words, the witness said he was not able to duplicate the kind
of fabric on the test; he did it -- he was not able to duplicate the
amount of blood put on the fabric; he was not able to duplicate the
temperature and humidity. And it was kept out previously because of
the lack of any showing that the drying time he measured had anything
to do with how the -- Mr. Simpson's sock would dry because of his
inability to use the same sock or with the same amount of blood.

So we think there should be some preliminary showing by Mr. Baker that
that is sufficient to allow this witness to testify to drying time.

MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, I think under the Culpepper case, we're
entitled to show that, first of all, I'll certainly voir dire his
amount of expertise in drying time and what experiment he's done. But
relative to his experience, we'll lay a foundation. And -- but that
was testified to in the -- in the criminal trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: The answer was stricken in the criminal trial. He just
showed it to me.

THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

MR. BAKER: You're not going to let me voir dire him on that issue?

THE COURT: What are you going to ask?

MR. BAKER: Let me ask -- I'm going to ask him about his experiment and
what he has done, and what he has done relative to drying times. I
mean, this -- we are entitled to rebut, I think, Bodziak. We're
entitled to rebut Werner Spitz. And this is all testimony that this
jury should hear relative to rebut their testimony concerning the --
the --

Can you not whisper so loud, so I can --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER: -- so we are entitled to put on our evidence relative to
rebutting that testimony. And we're certainly entitled, in my view, to
put on testimony relative to this drying time. This guy is probably
the foremost expert on drying times, done more experiments on blood
than anybody in the world.

THE COURT: I think he can testify as to how long blood takes to dry,
but that's about it. I don't think he can testify about this
particular material.

MR. BAKER: Well, all right.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Sir, approximately how many experiments have you
conducted in your career with human blood?

A. I couldn't estimate. Tens of thousands probably, but it's difficult
to say. I've done many of them and repeated them time and time again,
or directly supervised them in the institute and each student does
hundreds.

Q. And throughout your career have you gained knowledge as to what you
believe the drying time of blood is?

A. Yeah, that's one -- it used to be one of our classic experiments,
but it took so long we finally replaced it. It took longer than the
laboratory time.

Q. Now, how long does it take blood to coagulate?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Assuming you mean coagulation as a clotting procedure?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yes, as a clotting mechanism.

A. Clotting mechanism in normal people runs 3 to 6 minutes, an average
of about 4-1/2 minutes, before it actually thickens and becomes
noticeably more viscous.

Q. And relative to the drying time of blood on fabric surfaces, have
you done any experiments in that regard?

A. Yes, I have; many.

Q. And have you done any experiments of blood on fabric surfaces
relative to this case?

A. Yes. Specifically for this case I did an experiment, but I had done
others of a similar nature, but not on a material of this same plastic
weave material as the sock in this question -- or in this case. I had
a question as to how rapidly blood would dry on it. I had done other
fabrics, but they were the same material, but thicker weave, such as
material for a blouse or a skirt or something as opposed to a thin
sock.

Q. So based upon your experience, would blood dry quicker on a thicker
material such as a blouse as contrasted to a sock?

A. Well, it would dry much slower --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It would dry much slower because the blood that can soak into a
thicker fabric is greater. The area on a thin fabric would contain
much less blood; therefore, it would evaporate and dry quicker.

Q. The material that you used in your drying experiments was thicker
than the material of the sock, and therefore should have taken longer
to dry; is that correct?

A. That's correct. I've also done it on a material very similar to the
sock.

Q. And the material very similar to the sock, what was the drying time
that your experiments produced?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, in the material that was virtually identical
to the sock, even if it was thicker, what was the drying time that
your experiments produced?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, vague, ambiguous, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I've done experiments on similar synthetic materials, in the case
of Delaware, involving a quilt which was obviously much thicker. And
when not on a person with body heat, these materials would dry in 15
to 20 minutes, sometimes 2 or 3 hours if they were thicker. But a
thinner material on a body would dry much, much faster; 5 or 10
minutes if it's thin enough.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right.

And this material is relatively thin, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in terms of blood pattern evidence on -- on the sock, can you
produce, or could you have produced the red balls that you saw on side
3 by turning the sock inside out?

A. Well, if it was wet -- if the sock was stained on the outside with
a sufficient volume to wet the surface but not soak through, and
thereby produce them by the mechanism going from side 2 to side 3, if
you could some way stain the outside with sufficient blood and then
turn the sock inside out so that the outside, we're looking at surface
1, came in contact with the outside of surface 4, it could stain
surface 4 and then theoretically soak back into surface 3.

Q. And there was no stains in surface 4?

A. No.

Q. So taking the sock inside out is not going to produce what you saw
on side 3; is that correct, sir?

A. No, it couldn't.

Q. And what is going to be produced on side 3, that is the red balls
that are on side 3, are produced without any object inside the sock
between side 2 and 3, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That's correct, it couldn't go from 2 to 3 with something in
between.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And they had to get the blood in side 3 -- have some
sort of compression of the blood on side 3 -- strike that -- on side 1
to have the blood soak through to side 3, correct?

A. Well, I don't know if it would take compression in the sense of
pushing in, but if they were in contact, and if there's sufficient
blood on side 1, it could -- just by its own weight and gravity, if
lying on side 3, directly over it at the time, it could produce this,
but a little compression would certainly create it more quickly.

Q. All right.

Now, in terms of other experiments that you performed in this case,
did you also perform an experiment relative to the gloves?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what type of gloves did you use?

A. I used gloves that were supplied to me, they were sent by Peter
Neufeld, and it was my understanding they were identical to the gloves
in this case.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, move to strike his understanding, Your Honor.
Conclusion, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The gloves that you used, were they Aris Isotoner
gloves?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. And did you attempt to determine whether or not Aris Isotoner
gloves would shrink when subjected to human blood?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was your understanding of the shrinkage that -- strike
that.

The gloves came from Mr. Rubin, did they not, an executive of Aris
Isotoner?

A. That was what I had been informed.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, move to strike what he was informed, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Just a minute.

Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Can you, in terms of your experimentation, tell us
what you did with these gloves to see if there could be any shrinkage
from the gloves being exposed to blood?

A. I had two gloves of course, a right and a left glove. And it was my
understanding that they shrank or could have shrunk as a result of
being exposed to moisture, specifically blood, a wet material, and
then drying out again. Therefore, I used blood in my experiment. I had
the two gloves separated. I had one on of course, the left one on the
left hand, the right one on the right hand, but not at the same time.
I put a latex glove, for example, on my right hand, and had the Aris
extra large glove on my left hand. I had blood drawn, a known volume.

Q. Okay.

Well, let's --

A. And I put my hand over a large glass funnel, which in turn emptied
into a graduated cylinder so I could measure the volume that I
recovered as I poured the blood onto and into the glove, and dumped
the entire amount, which was approximately 2 milliliters, could be
centimeters if you prefer, and I smeared it around. I think this is a
picture showing me smearing the blood around this funnel underneath,
and this was, in my opinion, a very reasonable and logical way to see
how much blood I could force into the glove.

I gave it a fair test. I smeared it around with the latex glove, and I
did as much as I could for about 30 seconds or so, just smearing it
until it was -- I thought it was -- it might begin to clot, so I just
stopped, and it all drained, went into the funnel, and then I sat the
glove down and timed the drying time.

Then I repeated it with the other glove, done almost immediately
because I still had a needle in my arm, so I wanted to continue right
along.

And then I did the other glove by switching -- putting on the latex
glove.

The reason for the latex glove was so I would have a clean hand to put
in the other glove. It wasn't to protect me from my own blood, from
any biohazard standpoint at least.

I then did it again.

That tag shows extra large. I left it on.

And did the same thing again by wetting the glove, as I felt was as
fair and reasonable as I could do.

I wanted to see the results. I wasn't trying to just pour it on and
run it off.

So again, I did the same thing.

I put one in a constant humidity chamber and let them dry and then I
timed the drying time.

Before I had started either of these experiments -- I had seen
diagrams made previously showing measurements with all kinds of lines
and figures which seemed to me to be confusing, and if not confusing
to me, I thought it might be confusing to a jury.

So I tried to do something relatively simple. I put the gloves on a
copy machine. I calibrated the copy machine that's the constant
humidity chamber that's potassium chloride slurry underneath, and this
is the system that is used by ASTB, American Standard Testing Bureau,
for calibrating hydrometers. I didn't use a dry hydrometer. I used the
system that calibrates hydrometers.

Anyway, I copied this on a copy machine that -- I put a transparent
ruler, both 90 degrees to each other, previously calibrated to see if
there was any elongation or compression of the copy machine itself.

I was delighted to find out my copy machine is quite accurate.

I copied it in this manner, just by laying the glove down prior to the
experiment. Then, after the experiment, after the gloves were
completely dry, I put them down again, both the right and the left, up
and down, every way I could, and I did -- I made absolutely no effort
to spread it out, I didn't do that before, I didn't do it afterwards.
I put it on, closed the cover, copied it on a transparency so then I
could put the transparency of the after on the regular copy, the
photocopy of the before. And I wanted to see how much it shrunk.

And that's as simple as I could make the experiment.

I could not detect any measurable shrinkage on -- on either glove.
That was the bottom line.

And I have those transparency things. I think they're quite, as I said
before, jury friendly, they're quite understandable.

MR. P. BAKER: 1406 was on the screen, and Dr. MacDonell's reference,
1403 to 1405.

THE CLERK: 1403 to --

MR. P. BAKER: 1403, 1404, 1405.

On the board is 1407, on this television.

(The instrument herein referred to as photo depicting a man working
with glove was marked for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No.
1403.)

(The instrument herein referred to as photo depicting a man pouring
red liquid on glove was marked for identification as Defendant's
Exhibit No. 1404.)

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of glove in chamber was
marked for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No. 1405.)

(The instrument herein referred to as photocopy of glove was marked
for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No. 1406.)

(The instrument herein referred to as transparency overlay was marked
for identification as Defendant's Exhibit No. 1407 by reference to
case no. BA097211.)

(1407 is displayed.)

A. The red toner was used so you could clearly see the difference from
the region of the black. I had them all black and all red, but --

MR. BAKER: Phil, you want to put the photo of the glove underneath it.

MR. P. BAKER: 1406.

MR. P. BAKER: 1407.

A. Move them laterally just a little so you can see the tip.
Laterally, sideways.

Well, all right.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Here we go.

A. They're basically congruent, but of course they were done different
days, they're not absolutely congruent.

If you look at the lower left, there's a little bit that sticks down
there, a little tiny portion right here on the black one. If you move
the red one over just a little bit to this position -- bring it over
and down a little. No, bring it over to the left, please.

Yeah, now you can see those two. There you go.

And if you come up here (indicating to Elmo), up here is the same,
this is a 10-inch glove, a 10 percent shrinkage would be 1 inch
shorter, 15 percent would be an inch and a half, and so on.

50 percent would be down to here.

But I could not say there was any measurable shrinkage.

MR. BAKER: Let's put on the 10 percent overlay showing 10 percent
shrinkage. That's --

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1411.

(The instrument herein described as transparency overlay was marked
for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1411 by reference to
case no. BA097211.)

A. The 90 percent means that this was copied at 90 percent of the
original size, and that would indicate a 10 percent shrinkage,
literally.

If it could be moved over in some way so you can compare the lengths
of one side or the other. Move the red one to the right slightly,
please. A little more. Get it over where you can see it. Keep this
line at the bottom -- could you -- the red one.

Yeah, now, there's 10 percent shrinkage.

Of course, 5 percent shrinkage would be here and so on. I could not
say that there was any measurable shrinkage.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1411.

A. This was the other figure mentioned, 10 to 15 percent shrinkage.
And 85 percent, of course, would indicate a 15 percent shrinkage.

Could you bring the bottom of those -- both of them up so we can see
the -- yup, there you see they're the same, and that's the extent of
shrinkage, if indeed it were a 15 percent shrinkage.

Q. How long did it take for you to be certain that those gloves were
in fact absolutely dry?

A. I used a ASTM method for paint drying. I modified it because this
was blood drying. I've used it before in our previous blood drying
experiments. And these were dry within four hours. The method is quite
simple. I wouldn't -- won't explain it. It's a method used by the
paint industry and I used to work as a paint chemist so I'm familiar
with the method.

Q. Did you also run a freezing experiment on this glove?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did that freezing and thawing produce any shrinkage at all?

A. No. I understood they were freeze -- thoroughly freezing, and taken
out, measured, examined, and put back, and so on. I cycled both gloves
a total of eight times, for different periods of time, to determine if
there was any measurable shrinkage.

I did the same thing with overlays, and again, I found absolutely no
shrinkage, no variations, no increase. As far as I could tell, the
freezing had absolutely no affect.

Q. Now, in -- In terms of your experiments, did you push the blood
into the leather and try to get it in as much as you could?

A. Yes. As I said, I was -- being fair, I felt I had to try to work it
in. I was, for want of a better term, trying to duplicate some kind of
compression that would be consistent with people engaged in some
conflict. I was not just dabbing my fingers lightly, I was really
trying to see if I could impregnate the blood into the glove, and I
tried. I couldn't -- I only lost about 1.9 to 2 milliliters on the
entire glove. I recovered all but that much, so it only took about 2
milliliters, that's only 40 drops. That's not a lot of blood, but it
was covered, it was glistening.

Q. Now, in terms of the experiments that you did in terms of drying
time, did you attempt to replicate the temperature and the humidity as
it existed on the night of June 12, 1994?

A. Yes, as closely as I could in the laboratory. I have the figures
here that I used. I believe they were something like 20.5 Centigrade,
around 67 degrees Fahrenheit.

Q. And did you attempt to -- well, strike that.

Was there a dew point that came into play on the night of June 12,
1994?

In other words --

A. There was a question about dew, and therefore the dew point became
a factor, yes.

Q. Okay.

But in terms of the temperature, on the night of June 12, 1994, it was
6 degrees above the dew point, was it not?

A. Yes. From the weather information I reviewed, the dew point, which
is the temperature at which condensation begins -- for example, this
glass or ceramic material here, if we were to add ice water into the
water, if the room temperature is 20 degrees centigrade and there's no
condensation on here because the water's the same temperature, but if
I were to add ice and keep cooling this down, at a certain point,
especially with a metal pitcher, you would see the beginning of
condensation, it would look frosty. That temperature would be the dew
point. That means that if the temperature in the room dropped to that
temperature, everything in the room would begin to have condensation.

And the dew point has to be reached for the relative humidity, the
moisture in the air, to begin to condense. And unless you can get the
ambient or the room temperature down to the same temperature of the
ice water here, you won't have any dew forming. It's that simple. It
doesn't condense.

Q. And on the night of June 12, 1994, dew wouldn't form as a result of
the temperature and dew point, correct?

A. That is correct. It never got within 6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Q. Okay.

MR. BAKER: I just want to be heard on that other issue.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, 10-minute recess. Don't talk about
the case, don't form or express any opinion.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were Held in open court, in the Presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay, go ahead.

MR. BAKER: The only other area that I wanted to offer was the area of
the blood spatter evidence on the walkway, Your Honor. And as this
Court is aware, Werner Spitz testified that in 1 minute and 15 seconds
both of these murders occurred. There's blood spatter evidence on the
walkway indicating directionality that indicates, indeed, that the
assailant was in the area of the walkway some four feet away from
where the body of Nicole Brown Simpson was found, and that there is
blood spatter evidence going to the north, there's blood spatter
evidence going to the south, there is blood spatter evidence going to
the east.

And I think that is rebuttal to both Mr. Bodziak and rebuttal with
regard to Werner Spitz. And we would -- We would offer -- and make
that offer of proof that he will testify that there has been -- there
was something that was emitting blood that was four feet away from the
body of Nicole Brown Simpson, and the blood was being --
directionality of that blood was going in a westerly direction.

There's other blood pattern evidence indicating that there was blood
being spattered that is at least 18 inches away from Nicole Brown
Simpson in a southeasterly direction, and three feet away in a
southeasterly direction, indicating that this took some period of
time, with the assailant at a location three to four feet east of
where the body was ultimately found, and directly goes to the issue of
Werner Spitz's demonstration before this jury of what happened, and
where it happened on the stairs, that he did, and it's rebuttal to
that testimony.

MR. MEDVENE: There's a stipulation that the Court has been furnished,
signed by Mr. Baker, that specifically states that Mr. Simpson agrees
that, as we had agreed in the prior paragraph, that none of the
following experts will give opinion at the trial of this action, that
said expert did not give in his testimony at the criminal trial, and
it specifically lists Mr. MacDonell.

It says the parties are entitled -- in paragraph 3 -- to rely on the
stipulation in determining to forebear from taking a deposition.

Dr. Spitz's deposition was taken, the opinions he expressed here were
expressed, and he was -- he was cross-examined by Mr. Blasier fully
about these things. At no time after that did the defense seek to
offer Mr. MacDonell for deposition and say his testimony was going to
be any broader, or they sought to exclude him from the stipulation.
They left him included in the stipulation.

We relied on what they did and we didn't take his deposition. They
can't, at this last moment, put him on purportedly for some new and
different testimony.

THE COURT: Okay.

The Court's heard the -- read the stipulation. It was submitted to the
Court and adopted by the Court on August 23.

Objection sustained.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: That's all I have, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Morning, sir.

A. Good morning.

Q. Would you like me to call you Mr. MacDonell or Professor?

A. Call me Herb if you want to. My friends do.

Q. Okay, Herb.

(Laughter)

Q. You testified you were the director of a laboratory of forensic
science; is that correct?

A. Yeah, independent laboratory, correct.

Q. And that laboratory is located?

A. Corning, New York.

Q. In your house?

A. Yes. Or I live in my laboratory. Either way.

Q. And do you have any full-time scientists that work with you there?

A. Yes. I have one, Paul Kisch, who works with me full-time.

And others come in part-time as needed, and other people come in to
use the facilities, which I make available.

Q. My question was do you have any full-time, and your answer is Mr.
Kisch?

A. Yes, one.

Q. Are there any licensing requirements for your laboratory, sir?

A. Not that I'm aware of, no.

Q. Is your laboratory certified by any agency, sir?

A. No.

Q. Now, you make your living in large part testifying; is that
correct?

A. No, that's not correct at all. I've only testified, I think, once
this year before this. I testify rarely, but I do a lot of
experimentation and examination of evidence. That's the bulk of my
income.

Q. Sir, have you previously, in testifying under oath in response to a
question, said whether you were entitled to be -- strike that.

In response to a question, you once told the reporter that you
probably were entitled to be included in the Guiness Book of World
Records because you testified in more courts, on more subjects, than
any other human being. You said I think that is still true. But I
don't think I'll do it. It's -- it's just an interesting comment I
made after something about the Guiness Book of World Records was
quoted to me and I think I made that remark.

Was that a truthful remark, sir?

A. That sounds like something I would have said, yes. I've testified
in a variety of --

Q. I asked you if that was a truthful remark, and you said it was,
sir?

A. I said I believe it is.

Q. Thank you, sir.

Now, in testifying possibly in more courts, on more subjects than any
other human being, could you list for us all the subjects that you've
testified as an expert on; just the subjects?

A. Well, generally, by discipline I've testified in forensic science
and specifically criminalistics, which includes photography, physics,
and chemistry. If you want to list those separately, which is what I
think I did when I made that remark --

Q. Let me ask you about that.

You said photography --

MR. BAKER: I'd like him to finish his answer. He's asking to list the
subjects and he cut him off.

THE COURT: Did you finish your answer, sir?

A. Yes. And also such things as photography and microscopy which are
tools of forensic science. And in the area of blood alcohol and
breathalyzer, I was certified as an expert in that area and testified
many times on DWI cases in New York State.

I've testified, in one instance, in the case of psychiatry where no
one else understood the phenomenon and later it was confirmed by other
witnesses.

So I have testified in a variety of courtrooms, from county court and
civil court and town court and justice court, up to the Supreme Court
in Canada, and the Court of Appeals in Quebec. And I think since only
two people have ever testified in the supreme court in Canada as a
witness before an appellate decision was made, that limits my remark
to two people, and I don't know who the other one was.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Among your areas of expertise, you told us, is
photography, and you hold yourself out as somebody that is an expert
in taking pictures, particularly when precision is needed; is that
correct?

A. I'm experienced and I think -- I've taught forensic photography
many semesters. I know the subject quite well.

Q. Is it true, sir, that you -- that the photograph you put up here
for the jury to see, you did not take?

A. I'm not sure if Dr. Lee took it or I took it. I really don't know.
We both took some. I think that's one he took, but I don't know.

Q. Did you previously testify in this case, sir, that you didn't take
the photographs, that Dr. Lee took them?

A. If I did, then Dr. Lee took it. I'm sure the record is better than
my memory.

Q. And you didn't take them, did you, sir?

A. Not that particular one.

I took others.

Q. You didn't take any photographs as an expert -- world renowned
expert, that you could show this jury to support your opinion, is that
true, sir, yes or no?

A. No, I didn't take any of the pictures you saw -- that one that you
saw. I think I took the second one.

Q. Sir, my question to you is, is it true you took no pictures of any
kind that you showed this jury and said that's the basis for my
opinion; is that true? Yes or no, sir?

A. Those pictures. That is true. I didn't take those.

Q. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

Now, you talked about, in your qualifications, the typing of blood and
that sort of thing.

A. No, I didn't mention typing of blood.

Q. Mentioned some work that you had done with a French --

A. Oh, all right. I developed a method that can be used --

Q. Yes?

A. -- for typing of blood.

Q. What I want to ask you, sir, is this: You've told this jury about
something you saw, some speck, some dot on wall 3, and implied it was
blood.

Is it true, sir, you never tested whatever you saw to see if it was
blood? Yes or no, sir, is that true?

A. It's true that it could not be tested.

Q. Thank you, sir.

You did not test it for blood?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Nor did anyone to your knowledge; is that correct, sir?

A. To --

Q. To the best of your knowledge?

A. To the best of my knowledge, it was tested when it was swabbed.

Q. Sir, I'm asking you if what you claimed you saw on Wall 3, that you
talked to this jury about, is it true you certainly did not test it
for blood?

A. It was swabbed by Dr. Lee.

Q. Dr. Lee did not test it for blood, did he, sir?

A. He did a presumptive test with a positive result, yes, he tested
it.

Q. Sir, you know the difference between a presumptive test and a test
that confirms it's blood, as a world renowned expert, don't you, sir?

A. Of course. I know whether it's renowned or not.

Q. My question, sir, is whatever you claim you saw, this speck, it was
not tested to see if it was blood; is that correct? Yes or no, please,
sir?

A. It couldn't --

Q. Please, sir.

A. Yes, it was not tested, if you want a double negative.

Q. Thank you.

I don't want to be cute, sir.

My point is it was not tested and proven to be blood, whatever it was
you saw; is that a correct statement?

A. That is correct.

Q. Thank you, sir.

Now, on April 2, when Dr. Lee and you did the examination, or whatever
you did, of the sock, that was the first time you saw the sock; is
that correct, sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. You're opening something in front of you. I wonder if you can close
that, sir, and when you -- close your book if you don't mind. Then
when you have a need to open it, just ask and we'll let you open it.

What I want to do --

A. I was checking the date.

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute, Your Honor. I object. He is entitled to use
his notes to refresh his recollection. He can't be ordered to close a
book by cross-examining counsel.

THE COURT: Leave it closed, Doctor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And if there comes a time, Mr. MacDonell, when you
want to look at it, tell us and we'll let you look at it.

A. I was checking the date. I wanted -- you gave me a date. I wanted
to check if it was correct.

Q. It's okay, sir. I want to see what you remember. If you want to
look at your notes, then we'll look at those together.

Is that okay?

A. Fair enough.

Q. Okay.

Now, April 2 was your first and only examination of the sock; is that
correct?

A. That sounds like the right date. I have it in my book. If you have
my records then you know it's correct. I'll agree it's the right time.
Seems like the right date.

Q. And it was the one time is what I'm trying to establish?

A. Yes, only one, correct.

Q. Now, the socks were referred to, so we're talking the same
language, as 13-A and B or 42-A and B; is that correct?

A. Yes. I remember 42-A and B.

Q. And prior to your examination you had read and were familiar with
Mr. Gary Sims's notes from the Department of Justice; is that correct?

A. I was, yes, at that time.

Q. Right.

And you were familiar with the fact that on sock A, the one you've
testified about, Mr. Simpson's blood was found at the toe of the sock
and at the top of the sock; you were aware of that when you conducted
your exam, correct?

A. I believe I was. I have not reviewed it. I think so, yes.

Q. And you were also aware while you testified about the sock we're
going to call A -- let's call it 42-A.

Is that okay?

A. Yeah.

Q. You're also aware that on 42-B, there was Ms. Nicole Brown's blood
found around the ankle area; is that correct?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. All right.

Now, you made no determination at the time of your examination that
any of Mr. Simpson's blood found at the toe of that same sock soaked
through and created any little red balls on side 3, did you?

A. Of the other sock, you're talking about?

Q. I'm talking about the same sock you tested. You tested what we're
going to call 42-A.

Is that okay?

A. Is that the one that had his blood in the toe.

Q. Yes, sir?

A. I misunderstood that.

No, I did not.

Q. Okay.

And you conducted no test to determine that any of Mr. Simpson's blood
at the top of that sock soaked through and created any of these little
red balls you say you found on side 3, isn't that true?

A. Well, the word "tested" I'm concerned about. Testing means you're
doing something. Examination means you're merely examining.

So I did no testing of that type, no.

Q. You have no evidence of any kind -- strike that.

You have no scientific basis to say that any of Mr. Simpson's blood
that was found at the toe and the heel made its way through to side 3;
isn't that correct?

MR. BAKER: That misstates the evidence.

A. If it was wet it supposedly could have transferred blood. If it was
dry it couldn't have. That's as scientific as I can get.

If it was dry, it's impossible. If it was wet, it is theoretically
possible.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Mr. MacDonell, Mr. Simpson's blood was tested --
strike that.

Blood identified as Mr. Simpson's, you've told us it was your
understanding, was found at the toe and the top portion of the 42-A
sock.

Is it correct, sir, that you have no scientific evidence to indicate
that that blood created any little balls on side 3; isn't that
correct?

A. If it did, it would have to be wet. That's the only answer I can
give you.

Q. Sir, I'm asking you not if it did or not.

But you found no little red balls on side 3 in the toe area where Mr.
Simpson's blood was found; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you found none of these little red balls up on the top of the
sock where Mr. Simpson's blood was found; is that correct?

A. That is correct, to the best of my memory.

Q. And then certainly, sir, it's true, is it not, that Mr. Simpson's
blood being on the toe and the top of his sock when it was found June
13 at the foot of his bed, got there by Mr. Simpson putting a bloody
hand or a hand that dropped some blood on the toe and the heel; isn't
that correct?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to that entire question, Your Honor.
There are presumptions, that's argumentative, and it assumes facts not
in evidence. To the contrary --

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Isn't Mr. Simpson's blood being found on the sock
-- at the top of the sock consistent with his touching the sock when
he took it off, sir?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this is outside the scope. If they are going to
open that up, I think we're entitled to go into other areas.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Counsel asked him about the examination of his socks.

THE COURT: That's all he asked him about. He didn't ask about Mr.
Simpson taking socks off.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you've also told us, sir, that Ms. Brown's
blood -- strike that.

Ms. Brown's blood, to your knowledge, when you performed your
examination, was found on the ankle area of what we'll call 42-B, the
second sock; is that correct?

A. I believe it was, yes, purported to be.

Q. And you found no evidence that any of Ms. Brown's blood that was
reportedly found on the ankle area of the second sock created any of
these little red balls on side 3, did you?

END SECTION O1216-2A BEGIN SECTION O1216-2B

A. It couldn't have. Per my recollection, the spots were too small to
have sufficient volume to soak through.

Q. Sir, my question is, do you -- and you're an experienced witness --
Guiness Book of Records.

My question is --

A. Thank you.

Q. Did you see any of the little red balls that you claim could have
been made when no ankle was in the foot on the second sock, of Ms.
Brown's, on side 3?

A. No, for the reason --

Q. Thank you.

A. -- stated.

Q. So that we're clear then, sir, while -- strike that.

Is it true also, sir, that on the side -- the second sock, 42-B, first
one with the cut-out that you've told us about with the little red
balls and the Simpson blood, second sock, Nicole Brown's blood at the
ankle, around the ankle stain, isn't it true that you also saw about
12 to 14 other separate little stains?

MR. BAKER: I object. This is outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no, sir, did you see 12 to 14 other little
stains?

A. You said a specific blood type. I don't remember whose blood. I saw
some smaller stains, yes. I don't know whose they were.

Q. Now, those stains were consistent with -- strike that.

Is it true, sir, that in a stabbing or cutting of a victim, that can
generally result in a -- well, strike that.

Did you attempt to determine whether or not, with respect to these 12
or 14 other blood stains that were found, if any of them created any
little red balls on side 3?

MR. BAKER: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no, sir?

A. No, I don't recall.

Q. Now, where we are then is, and correct me if I'm wrong, we have two
socks, A sock and a B sock.

On the A sock we have Mr. Simpson's blood at the top and the bottom,
and Ms. Brown's blood in the center.

On the B sock we have Ms. Brown's blood.

What you're talking to the jury about is only -- I'm not seeking to
minimize it, but only the A sock and a particular dot or ball that you
claim you saw on side 3 that has some significance from a -- the ankle
cut out; is that correct?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. That misstates the evidence. He said a
dozen balls at least.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you've realized before your April 2
examination that it was an important examination, did you not?

A. No, not really. I was asked do examine the sock. I didn't know what
I'd find at that time. The red balls had not been seen, so that to me
seemed significant, but I didn't anticipate it.

Q. Well, as a scientist it would be fair to say, would it not, sir,
that you would customarily take detailed notes of your observations?

A. If I were the only one doing the examination, yes, I would.

Q. And you knew at the time of your examination that you might be a
witness in connection with whether or not Mr. Simpson committed the
murders we're here discussing today; isn't that true?

A. I anticipated that, yes.

Q. And you knew since that time might be very far off, as you have to
look at your red notebook to see what date the meeting was, you would
want to have detailed notes so you could tell the jury exactly what
you saw with the help of your contemporaneous notes; isn't that true?

A. No. I was relying on the photograph to show anyone who was
interested in what I saw.

Q. So is it your practice, then, sir, not to take detailed notes if
somebody else with you is taking a photograph?

A. Depends on who it is. In Dr. Lee's case I have no problem.

Q. So did you make a conscious determination not to take any notes or
very many notes?

A. I took a few notes, made a few sketches, but I did not take copious
notes, no.

Q. Now, you said a few moments ago that, you know, nobody had seen
these little red balls you claim you saw and you know that was
significant.

That's not in your notes, is it, sir, yes or no?

A. No, it's not in my notes.

Yes, it's not in my notes, no.

Q. In fact, you don't have in your notes not only that you didn't see
any little red balls, you don't have the number of these little red
balls you claim you saw, do you?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I do not have notes to that effect.

Q. You don't have anything about the size of these little red balls,
do you?

A. I just said small I think. No, I didn't measure them. They're
microscopic.

Q. You didn't say small, did you, sir?

A. Small.

Q. You didn't say small in your notes, did you?

A. No, I just said it now.

Q. Oh. We can say a lot of things now.

What I'm worried about and wondering about is when you tell the jury
what you said then, when you saw what you claim you saw.

And I -- what mean, sir, is we know you didn't write red balls, we
know you didn't write the number. Did you write small?

A. No.

Q. Thank you.

A. Took a photograph.

Q. Thank you, sir.

You didn't take the photograph, you told us that already.

A. No, the one shown today I did not take.

Q. Yes, sir.

A. I took my own photographs.

Q. Whatever you took, you haven't shown us; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, today you told us about 12 of these balls. At the trial you
talked about 6 or 7; is that right? Not 12? 6 or 7?

A. I don't remember what I said then. I don't have a copy of my
transcript. If I said 6 or 7 I'll go with 6 or 7. I saw quite a few.

As I said today, I don't know if I saw the same ones twice.

Q. Sir, you say 12 today under oath to this jury.

Are you now saying if you said 6 or 7, you'll buy into that, and maybe
it wasn't 6 or 7, maybe it was 12 'cause maybe you saw 6 or 7 twice
and that got up to 12, and maybe that's where the 12 is?

MR. BAKER: I have no idea if that's a question or if he's trying to
make a speech, but --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you say 6 or 7?

MR. BAKER: I move to strike his entire colloquy with himself.

MR. MEDVENE: It's very cute.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) But do you know --

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you know, putting aside the objection --

A. Over a year ago if I said 6 or 7, I probably meant 6 or 7. Today I
thought about it and I said 12 because I --

Q. Okay, sir.

A. -- I don't know how many I saw, but I saw quite a few.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, let the witness finish speaking before you
start speaking.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

A. I don't know. There might have been 30, but I saw 10 or 12 or 6,
whatever, I recall at the time. My memory was better a year ago than
it is now. I'll go with 6.

Q. And of these 6 or 7 or 12 or 30, we have a photo of one of the
balls.

Now, do you have photos that you can show us of the other 6 or 7 or 12
or 30 balls that you claim have some significance?

A. Well, there in the photographs that were taken at lower
magnification, but to isolate them and show this magnification, no, we
don't -- I don't have those. I've seen others, but I don't have them.

Q. Now, as a world renowned photographer, and knowing the importance
of seeing these little red balls which nobody else had seen -- in
fact, let me step back for a minute.

You knew at the time of your examination that the place where you
claim, on side 3, you saw these tiny little red balls, Gary Sims from
the California Department of Justice had previously looked at that
area and not seen any such phenomenon, you knew that, did you not? Yes
or no?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. There's no foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you know that, sir?

MR. BAKER: I --

THE COURT: Sustained, Mr. Medvene.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is it true that you were aware, sir, that Mr. Sims
had previously examined this very sock and this very spot?

MR. BAKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You can answer if you knew or not.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you know, sir?

A. I possibly did. I do not specifically remember, but if he didn't he
should have. I would have concluded he probably did.

Q. And you reviewed his notes, did you not, sir?

A. I'm sure I did.

Q. And you knew, did you not, that it would be important to document
any claimed little red balls which you knew Mr. Sims said he had not
seen them; isn't that true, sir?

A. That's why we took the pictures, yes.

Q. Now, when you say that's why we took the pictures, we were shown
one picture which we'll talk about.

But these other 5 or 6 or 12 or 30 of these little red balls, since
you knew Mr. Sims had previously examined the same place and seen no
such phenomenon, didn't you believe, as a scientist, it was important
to take pictures with sufficient magnification so you could show them
to some jury and say this is what I rely on?

MR. BAKER: You know, Your Honor, I'm going to object. There's no
evidence that Sims examined this with a microscope, these socks. He's
just keeps throwing it in like he did the same thing this witness did.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Overruled. If you understand the question you may answer.

A. I don't know how he examined them, but he missed them, they were
there.

THE COURT: Excuse me. That's not the question.

MR. MEDVENE: With the Court's permission, Ms. Reporter, can you repeat
the question, please.

THE REPORTER: (Reading:)

Q. Now, when you say that's why we took the pictures, we were shown
one picture which we'll talk about.

But these other 5 or 6 or 12 or 30 of these little red balls, since
you knew Mr. Sims had previously examined the same place and seen no
such phenomenon, didn't you believe as a scientist it was important to
take pictures with sufficient magnification so you could show them to
some jury and say this is what I rely on?

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you knew in Mr. Sims's notes that he said he
examined this area under his stereomicroscope?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to this, Your Honor. This is -- has got
to come in from Sims.

MR. MEDVENE: He said he read the notes.

MR. BAKER: He said I may have read the notes and he doesn't recall. To
put them in is improper.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may inquire whether or not those are the notes he saw. A. You
answered the question. He used a stereomicroscope, and we used a high
power microscope. He could not have seen these at the magnification of
a stereomicroscope assuming it is 25 diameter maximum. That's -- most
of them are 20, 25.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Understanding the importance of what you claim you
saw, it's true that you have no picture to show of any other of these
balls; isn't that right?

A. I do not have them, no.

Q. Now, is it also true, sir -- well, let's move to another area.

And what you did do on April 2 --

MR. BAKER: April 2 of '95?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Is it true, Mr. MacDonell, that on your April 2
examination, and at no time up to the present, did you ever look at
the cut-out that you spoke to the jury about?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you never asked to see the cut-out?

A. That's correct.

Q. And this cut-out is, so we're picturing it, it's a piece of the
sock, side 1 and 2 of the sock, the furthest away, the side you touch
putting on, and the inside of that, side 1 and 2 of the sock?

A. I think it's lower than that, but it's on that side, the left side.

Q. Okay.

Now, you don't know then, from your own personal observation that Ms.
Brown's, whatever, blood of herself was on side 1 of Mr. Simpson's
sock? You don't know from your own personal knowledge, from the
cut-out, whether that blood soaked through to side 2 'cause you never
examined the cut-out; is that correct?

A. Well, I know it did because it's there. Something soaked through
and if you --

Q. Excuse me.

A. -- go around the lake, you don't have to go to the middle to know
there's water there.

Q. Sir, I'm not good on those kind of explanations. I just want to
stay with the basics with you.

We have a cut-out that there was a stain on side 1, and you showed
that stain to the jury, and I think that was what, 1239 or whatever;
is that correct?

A. I don't know the number.

Q. A cut-out was taken of that stain, correct?

A. Yes. A cut-out was taken out of the center of the stain.

Q. What you then did was look through that cut-out to what we're
calling side 3 of the sock, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And the issue we're discussing is not only what, if anything, did
you see on side 3, but how did it get there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you don't know because you never observed it that -- the
cut-out portion, I take it, was above where you claim you saw the
little red balls, whether blood soaked through from side 1 to side 2
of that cut-out portion; isn't that correct?

A. No. It soaked through to the periphery, and when you cut out a
section it saturated through, it saturated in the center, too.

Q. We'll deal with the periphery in a minute.

I'm talking now about the cut-out itself.

And I'm saying on the cut-out itself, isn't it true since you never
saw it, you don't know whether blood went from side 1 to side 2 of the
cut-out; is that correct?

A. I never physically seen it and I cannot say that I saw it saturated
with blood.

Q. You cannot say that it was -- it went from side 1 to side 2; is
that correct, sir?

A. Yes, that's what I'm saying, it did because it's on side 3.

Q. Sir, that's your conclusion, not only that it's blood but what's on
side 3 -- but what I'm asking you is on the cut-out -- it's a pretty
straightforward question.

A. I did not examine the cut-out. I've testified to that.

Q. So, I want you to tell this jury, is it true that you cannot state,
under oath, that on side 2 of the cut-out there was any blood; isn't
that true?

A. Within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty I can conclude
that, and that is my opinion, yes, it's so true.

Q. Sir, you've never looked at side 2; isn't that correct?

A. That's correct.

It was in the center of the cut-out.

Q. You've mentioned the periphery.

When we say periphery, that's a fancy word for what's around the
cut-out?

A. It's an English word.

Q. Not minimizing the word.

It's what's around the cut-out?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you examined the periphery portion around the cut-out?

A. That's correct.

Q. And isn't it true, sir, that the side 2 of the periphery did not
show any blood -- any blood soak through?

A. No, it was on both side 1 and side 2. It -- as you get further from
the center it's on side 1 only.

Q. Excuse me. The question is, sir, were you asked the following
question --

MR. MEDVENE: I'm at page 39,581 of the transcript.

MR. BLASIER: Line.

MR. MEDVENE: Starting at line 16.

(Reading:)

Q. Without limitation, sir,

but you cannot tell us what portion of

this stain contributed to the little

balls on surface 3, whether it was the

periphery on the center of the stain,

can you? A. Yes. I can eliminate the

periphery because it did not soak

through the fabric.

MR. MEDVENE: I've stopped reading.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) It did not soak through the fabric, only the
center area, which, I take it, means the cut-out, only the center area
soaked through, so that is the only area that could have caused the
staining on the third side.

Now I go back again, Mr. MacDonell, isn't it true, that the periphery
-- the area around the cut-out did not have blood soak through from
side 1 to 2 of the periphery; isn't that what you said?

A. No, I'm trying to interpret what you read.

Q. Sir?

A. The periphery does not lie over the area we found the balls, so
even though it had soaked through in the periphery it would not stain
that area.

Q. I understand that, sir, I'm taking it a step at a time, and I'm
saying does this refresh you?

A. It does but --

Q. Excuse me, sir.

Does this refresh you, 'cause you don't have any notes that --

A. I have them, but you won't let me look at them.

Q. You can look at them, sir.

A. My recollection is it soaked through the periphery, but the answer
given there would indicate it did not -- my meaning is that if it
soaked through the periphery it's not over the area, so it is not the
area that caused the stain.

Q. I understand that.

And feel free to look the your notes.

A. Not all of it went through.

Q. Sir, there's no question.

And feel free to look at your notes, if you have to, and if there's
anything there -- would you look through and see if there's anything
to show that it -- contrary to your testimony under oath, that it
soaked through from side 1 to 2 of the periphery.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that's argumentative. I object to that.

THE COURT: Overruled. Witness is arguing with the answer he gave at
the trial.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, do you have anything in any notes or any
records of any kind, Mr. MacDonell, before you, anywhere, to indicate
that the statement you gave under oath at the prior proceeding, that
there was no soak-through of blood on -- on the periphery area from
side 1 to 2 is not accurate, any notes of any kind?

A. Not in notes, no.

Q. All right.

Now, is it fair that what you've now told us is there's -- there's
little red balls on side 3, you've never looked at the cut-out to see
if there's any soak-through from side 1 and 2, and you did look at the
periphery, and there's no soak-through from side 1 or 2?

Is that fair as to where we are now?

A. That's right. I had a periphery. I didn't have a center.

Q. Thank you.

Is it true, sir, that you never conducted any experiments of any kind
to determine the amount of blood on the periphery?

A. No, that's not true. I duplicated it with one drop of blood, but
depending on how much you smear it around you could cover a bigger
area.

Q. When you say you duplicated, you don't know how much blood was on
the periphery because you didn't scientifically examine it, isn't that
true, yes or no?

A. Yes, I scientifically measured it.

Q. Okay.

How much blood was on the peripheral area, and where in your notes
does it say that that's the amount of blood that was on the peripheral
area of the sock surrounding the cut-out that you've talked to the
jury about? Show me in your notes.

MR. BAKER: Argumentative, compound.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't have --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Please show me.

A. -- the periphery.

Q. Sir --

A. I measured the total stain, that includes the periphery.

Q. Sir, is there any indication in your notes of what the volume of
blood was in the so-called peripheral area? And if there is, show us.

A. Less than one drop.

Q. You have anything there?

A. No. My knowledge of the subject is it was a 1 by 1-1/2 inch stain,
total. You can do that easily with one drop, so if you cut some out
it's less than one drop.

Q. I'm asking you around the periphery area?

A. That's what I'm talking about.

Q. Yeah. So you made a judgment by visualizing what it was, and your
experience how much blood you thought it was, is that --

A. That is correct.

Q. So the nature of this experiment you did was looking at it, and
seeing a blood stain around a hole, and saying in your mind, well,
that must be a drop, is that fair?

A. No, I added a drop -- I knew I added 50 microliters, a drop, to
reproduce it, and I said it could be as little as one drop. That
includes the center.

Q. Now, sir, you don't know who might have touched or manipulated this
sock in any way prior to the time you first saw it on April 2 of 1995,
so as to possibly account for these little red balls you say you saw;
is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you, other than knowing you claim you saw them on April 2, you
have no idea if they got there in April, if they got there March '92,
or '94 or '95, or when or how?

A. No, nor on April 1.

Q. Okay.

And you know from your -- would it have been -- strike that.

It would have been of some importance, would it not, sir, to know who
had handled the socks and manipulated them, touched them, prior to
your examining them, in terms of possibly explaining how the blood got
from side -- the alleged -- what you claim is blood, these red balls,
from side 2 to 3?

A. Not at all. I don't know how it got there. I know the mechanism.

Q. Would you agree, sir, with the gentleman that was with you at the
examination, Mr. Lee, that there is no scientific evidence to support
any statement that law enforcement officers planted any evidence in
this case?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you ever discuss with Dr. Lee his testimony
that he has no scientific evidence to support any statement that any
law enforcement officer planted evidence in this case?

MR. BAKER: I move to strike and have the jury admonished relative to
that statement, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

I sustained the first one and the second one is exactly the repeat of
the first one. I admonish you not to do that.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, there are -- is it correct, sir, that these
little red balls you say you saw are extremely small?

A. That is correct.

Q. How small are they, could you describe it for the jury?

A. I do not recall the diameter. I just don't know. They're extremely
small, down in the micron range, smaller than the diameter of a human
hair.

Q. Now, is it true, sir, that because you were dealing with something
so small, you did not do any testing to try to abrade it or move these
little balls? That's true, isn't it, yes or no, sir?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. All right, sir.

I'll read you, sir, what's -- strike that.

Is it true, sir, that you did -- they were so small that you were
afraid of fracturing them, and because of that you did no actual
testing, only observation; is that true, yes or no?

A. Yes, that's what I did.

Q. So it's true you did not touch the balls?

A. I did not, no.

Q. Nor did Dr. Lee, according to your testimony?

A. Not touching them in that sense, as I --

Q. No manipulation of them of any kind?

A. Dissolved them, he took a sample with a swab in that area. I'm sure
he touched this one as well as others.

Q. You didn't see him touch this one, did you?

A. No, I couldn't resolve that one, no.

Q. Okay.

And in terms of you, sir, is it a correct statement that you did no
testing to try to move the ball in any way, all you did was look at
it; isn't that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And if you were looking -- if these balls, sir, were sitting on
this table, and one of them was this bottle and one was this black
box, without -- and they're sitting on the fiber --

A. They're bonded there, not just sitting.

Q. Unless you raise this, you don't know if that's stuck to the fiber,
did you, sir, from observing this tiny, tiny, tiny, little red ball?

A. Yeah. It's bonded, it's wrapped around it.

Q. Isn't the way to find out, sir, by moving it to see if it stuck, or
to see if you can raise it off of the fiber?

A. That would be a way, if it were possible.

Q. That would be a good way, wouldn't it?

A. If you can manipulate it microscopically, yes.

Q. That would tell you, definitely, how deeply embedded in the fibers
the so-called little red ball was?

A. It's not embedded in, it's wrapped around fibers, plastic.

Q. Now, sir, did you quantify any of these little red balls, whether
it's 6 or 7 or 12 or 30, did you quantify any as to volume?

A. No.

Q. To give us an idea of the size, if you took 6 or 7 of them and put
them in a test tube and set them on top of each other, could we see
them?

A. I doubt it very seriously, without optical assistance.

Q. Now, the socks of Mr. Simpson, they were elastic socks that
stretched; is that correct?

A. They were synthetic, yes, in a weave that did give to it, had give
to it.

Q. Now, blood, when it dries, is not elastic, is it?

A. No.

Q. And if blood were dried on the sock, and you stretched the sock,
that blood could flake off to the other side of the sock; isn't that
true?

A. A large volume, yes. Not those tiny red spots that are on an
individual fiber, but a larger volume.

Q. Could flake?

A. It could flake off, could break.

Q. Now, you knew that there was certain presumptive testing done for
blood, you've told us about that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And if a little too much solvent was put on the Q-tip, that could
hydrate the blood that was on the sock, couldn't it?

A. Certainly.

Q. And it's possible if that were done, that could be another
explanation of whatever you saw on side 3, isn't that correct, a
possible explanation? Yes or no, sir?

A. In theory, yes.

Q. But -- That's what I want, sir.

Now, how about if they were new, these socks.

MR. BAKER: Could he be given time to finish his answer.

THE COURT: You can do it on redirect, Mr. Baker.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you know that socks are preserved, the blood
frozen and unfrozen; isn't that true?

A. Yes, it's preserved whether it's frozen or not, if it's dry.

Q. These socks, you were advised, were frozen and unfrozen?

A. That's what I understand.

Q. And during the course of freezing and unfreezing, it's at least
possible that that could have caused the phenomenon with the drop of
moisture that would account for what you claim you saw; isn't that
correct?

A. No. The sock material has such a low thermal capacity it couldn't
be at a temperature gradient enough to cause significant condensation,
so I would say that would be almost a physical impossibility.

Theoretically it would be, but practically it would not happen.

Q. Now, you talked about -- you talked about a drying experience, but
it's possible, is it not, that if someone was wearing those socks,
that had been involved in a quick, violent murder, and was rushing,
that their foot would perspire, isn't it?

A. Certainly possible.

Q. And that the perspiration on that person's foot could moisten the
blood that was on the sock; isn't that true?

A. It could retard the evaporation in drying, yes.

Q. And it would be possible, then, if that blood was moist, for it to
be transferred from side 2 to 3 if they were taken off and inside out,
it's possible, is it not, sir?

A. I don't think so, not damp. Wet, yes, but damp, I really don't
believe it could happen.

Q. You didn't conduct -- you said you conducted some experiments but
that's not --

A. That was wet, that was wet blood.

Q. But you didn't conduct the experiments we just talked about, did
you?

A. No.

Q. And in the experiments we talked about, and the drying, you didn't
know the amount of blood that was on Mr. Simpson's socks before you
did the experiments because you never quantified the volume of blood
on A and the volume of blood on B; is that correct?

A. No. I did the experiments after I'd examined the sock, and I had
the measurements of the size, and that's the experiments I did
afterwards.

Q. My question, sir, is if you put a lot of blood -- we're talking a
lot -- a few drops of blood on the sock or a lesser amount of blood on
the sock, that can control the drying time, can't it?

A. The variations in volume will control drying time, and the
thickness of the material, certainly.

Q. So the first thing we want to know is, in terms of duplicating
conditions, you never determined with any scientific accuracy the
volume of blood found on Mr. Simpson's socks, so you could duplicate
it on these other socks; is that correct, sir, yes or no?

A. That is not correct.

I did it in reverse. I added a drop of blood to see if I could produce
a stain anywhere near the size of the stain I'd examined on the sock.
And when I added one drop and teased it around a little, it soaked in,
it appeared about the same.

My conclusion that it was one drop is an approximation. It certainly
wasn't two or three or a tenth of a drop, but it was about a drop.

That's as scientific as I can make it.

Q. That's not very scientific, is it?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

A. It's not a guess.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, in the experiments -- one that you did that I
don't think you told us about, the blood completely dried in an hour
and 35 minutes; isn't that right?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. Now, you didn't -- when you're talking to the jury about 3 minutes,
4 minutes, 5 minutes, you didn't tell them about the experiment where
human blood was added to this fabric from a medicine dropper, teased
into the fabric, and it took an hour and 35 minutes, you didn't tell
them about that one, did you?

A. Yeah, that was 2 or 3 drops.

Q. It took an hour and 35 minutes?

A. Correct.

Q. And you didn't do that experiment with someone's ankle in the sock,
did you?

A. No, it was just lying flat, and it had more volume, and it soaked
into a larger area.

Q. And in terms of your observation of whatever it was you saw, what
you were able to see was something that -- it appeared to do
something, but from the degree of magnification you were looking at it
from, and because you weren't able to touch it, you don't really know
if it surrounded or didn't surround the fabric; isn't that true?

MR. BAKER: Well, I object. That question is vague, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I can't make it out either.

Sustained.

(Court reviews realtime computer screen.)

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, I just want to talk about the gloves for a
moment, if we can.

The experiment you did was on brand new gloves; is that correct?

A. That is correct, they appeared new.

Q. They appeared to you to be brand new?

A. Brand new, yes.

Q. And you're saying that they hadn't been worn for years, and in wet
weather, snow or sleet or whatever, is that true?

A. Apparently not. No, they were new.

Q. And in terms of what we're talking about here is not what shrinkage
happened afterwards, but what shrinkage happened before June 12, and
is it true that you weren't able, 'cause you weren't there, to conduct
any experiment to determine what would happen to those gloves if over
a two- or three-year period they were worn during the winter in sleet
and snow, you couldn't perform such an experiment, could you?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this is argument, this is not a question.
There's no probative value. He wasn't there before 1994.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) You were not -- strike that.

You didn't know under what conditions, how many times in the rain, how
many times in the snow Mr. Simpson were those gloves prior to June 12
of 1994; is that true?

MR. BAKER: Well, wait a minute. That assumes that Mr. Simpson ever
were those gloves and --

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Whoever wore those gloves prior to June 12, 1994, you
have no idea how often they were worn, the weather conditions, how
much rain, sleet or snow they were subjected to, do you?

A. They didn't leave Los Angeles. They didn't see much snow.

Q. But if they left Los Angeles on the hands of somebody that was a TV
commentator at football games in Buffalo in the snow, in New York's
Shea Stadium in the snow, let's assume they saw a lot of snow, you
don't know --

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

(BY MR. MEDVENE) -- do you, sir, how much adverse weather conditions
those gloves saw before June 12; is that correct, sir?

MR. BAKER: I object to his arguing the case.

THE COURT: Overruled. The testimony appears to be that the experiment
conducted by this witness was on new gloves, and plaintiffs'
contention is that the gloves that were recovered were not new gloves.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you answer, sir?

A. The answer is that I grew up in snow.

Q. Excuse me?

A. I've never seen snow on my gloves outdoors. It doesn't accumulate
on your gloves.

THE COURT: Mr. Witness, that wasn't the question.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you answer the question, sir?

A. Is this under the assumption there's snow on the gloves?

Q. Sir, you've made --

A. Would you read the question back.

Q. Sir, you've made whatever point you're trying to make, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: We're going to ask the court reporter, with the Court's
permission, to repeat the question.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I wonder if you can answer it, sir.

(The court reporter read the question as follows:)

"Q. But if they left

Los Angeles on the hands of somebody

that was a TV commentator at football

games in Buffalo in the snow, in New

York's Shea Stadium in the snow, let's

assume they saw a lot of snow, you don't

know, do you, sir, how much adverse

weather conditions those gloves saw

before June 12; is that correct, sir?"

A. The --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) That's correct?

A. The last part is.

Q. And, sir, isn't it true that the gloves you tested had not lost
their waterproof protection? That's true, isn't it?

A. There was none on that leather. That's my understanding of it. It's
not leather that has a treatment. It's naked leather.

Q. Sir, do you know if they're waterproof or not? The gloves you
examined, you didn't check them to see if they're waterproof?

A. I don't know how to check them.

Q. You don't know if they were or not?

A. That's true.

Q. If there was waterproofing on the gloves that you checked, and no
waterproofing on the other gloves, you would have no way of --

MR. BAKER: There's no evidence of any waterproofing on those gloves.
It's improper to ask these questions.

THE COURT: Sustained as to the last question.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further. Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Did you grow up in New York?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you worn gloves all your life?

A. Only in the wintertime.

Q. One for your side.

Did any of those gloves shrink?

A. Only when I grew older and my hands got bigger they seem to shrink.
Otherwise, when I come in soaking wet and put them on the furnace pipe
in the basement, let the hot air dry them out, I find the next morning
they were tough and stiff, but if I broke them up, they fit.

Q. Did you see the glove experiment in the courtroom when Mr. Simpson
put on the gloves, or the videotape of him putting on the gloves?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I did at one time. I don't think I saw it at the time it was live.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And did those gloves fit Mr. Simpson?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On which basis?

THE COURT: He's got no ability to testify whether they fit or not, I
find, and I so rule.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your April 2, 1995 when you went to
Technical Associates helping in Altadena, California, do you recall
that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was specifically to examine evidence, was it not?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you went there with Henry Lee, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And Henry Lee is a criminalist of some reputation, is he not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And he and you examined the socks, did you not?

A. That is correct.

Q. And Dr. Lee took notes during the examination of the socks, did he
not?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

A. He was the scribe.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And during the examination, both you and Henry Lee
looked through the microscope and saw the red balls that you described
in this courtroom, did you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for a conclusion as to what Dr. Lee saw
or didn't see.

THE COURT: Sustained as to Dr. Lee.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, he was asked these questions -- well, strike
that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you have conversations with Dr. Lee about the
red balls?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that was all opened up by his examination and
his talking about Dr. Lee being there.

THE COURT: Dr. Lee's opinion can come from Dr. Lee; not from this
witness.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did Dr. Lee take photographs along with you, to
document what you saw on April 2, 1995?

A. Yes, we could see it the same instant.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And how could you see it at the same instant?

A. It had a ground glass such as this (indicating to television
screen) over the microscope which allows you to see what you're about
to photograph. And so regardless of who clicks the shutter, that's
what we're going to get. And that's the way we took the pictures. I
moved it for some; he moved it for others.

Q. So what we're talking about, is when you're taking a photograph or
Dr. Lee is taking a photograph --

MR. MEDVENE: I apologize, Mr. Baker. These questions are leading the
witness.

THE COURT: I'll allow it.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you want to, whether or not you --

MR. P. BAKER: 1241 on the screen.

(Exhibit 1241 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were both in the same room, both viewing the
same thing; is that correct, sir?

A. Yes, we used two microscopes. This was the one we took pictures
with.

Q. When you say you didn't take a picture, does that mean you didn't
push the button on the microscope that allows you to take the picture,
that Dr. Lee did that?

A. It was a camera -- release on the camera to the microscope. I
clicked some; he clicked others.

I think he took this one. That's my best recollection (indicating to
1241).

Q. What you were attempting to do on April 2 was to document what you
were able to visualize, is that not correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, leading and suggestive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That's what we did, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, there isn't any question in your mind that --
well, strike that.

Blood, after it dries, can flake, can it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And if you have blood on a material such as a synthetic sock, that
can flake off, can it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And residue of blood -- flakes from blood, would be anticipated to
be seen on the socks in various areas from just residue, true?

A. Well, if you knew it had been manipulated and the blood had broken
up, you would see flakes -- you could see flakes. They would probably
be formed -- they would be much, much larger than this.

Q. And flakes are not spherical in appearance, are they?

A. No, they're jagged, they break up just like peanut brittle.

Q. And they're thin and jagged, are they not?

A. They may not be thin. If the stain and cloth material is thick,
they will be larger.

Q. Okay.

And based upon your 40-some years experience, did you have any
problems determining whether this was a compression of blood on side 3
as contrasted to a flake?

A. No, I didn't. Looking at this, I didn't think of the size, I saw
blood, which is wet and encircled a fiber and also go up the fiber to
a certain degree and it's conclusion that it is wrapped around and it
certainly not lying there loose so the fluids do that. This is a fluid
dynamic that just happens, that fluids will ball up and encircle
something like that. That is exactly what it appears like.

Q. Now, while you were in the laboratory, there on April 2, 1995 and
examining the socks, did you observe Dr. Lee swatch the area for a
presumptive test for blood?

A. When we were through taking pictures, yes. That was the only way we
could determine if these did give a positive reaction for blood. Not
limiting it to blood, but the negative reaction means it's not blood.

Q. And was a positive reaction observed by you after Dr. Lee swatched
the area?

A. Yes.

Q. And there was no question in your mind based upon the location --

MR. BAKER: Put up the cut-out for the sock.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1239.

(Exhibit 1239 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you were never provided this cut-out area, were
you?

A. No. I never asked for it and I was never given it.

Q. And the area where the red balls were, were directly under where
the staining would have been?

A. Well, it is stained -- it's stained all the way around, that light
color is the stain, but the center portion has been cut out, and that
would have been, of course, the most concentrated area and that's
where those red balls were.

Q. And I guess if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it may
be a duck.

In other words, those balls are right under the area of the highest
concentration of where the blood stain would have been on the sock
that was removed from -- the portion that was removed, correct?

A. Yes, I can conclude, but I can't prove -- everything that I know
about blood tells me this is blood, but I cannot do a serology test on
something that small.

Q. Now, in terms of the experiments that you did do, tell the jury the
experiment that you did do relative to the socks?

A. Well, having --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. You examined.

A. When I returned after examining these socks, quite independent of
any intention, I was wearing a pair of very similar socks, and having
blood available almost wherever I am, I just put some on my sock for
one purpose only, and that was to spread out a drop to see how long it
would take to dry on my warm body.

One drop I teased around in an oval which was very close to an inch by
an inch and a half, so I know it wasn't two drops or half a drop, it
was about a drop, I don't want to say it was within 10 percent, but it
was a drop which duplicated what I had seen.

And using a white tissue, which is an extension of the paint drying
test done by ASTB -- oh, they use paper, I used tissue, I would touch
that spot and apply very little pressure, and after five minutes or
so, the stain was completely dry, I could not get any blood adhered to
the clean white tissue.

That is a way of determining that it is dry.

So on my body, that day, it dried within about five minutes, and so
that was a thin stain.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And Mr. MacDonell, in terms of this drying test, in
other words, what you're doing is taking, like a Kleenex tissue, that
we have in the bathroom and you're seeing if there's any transfer of
the blood that you put on the sock, on yourself, and seeing if there's
any transfer onto that white Kleenex, correct?

A. Any microscopic transfer. I was looking at it with my 20-power
microscope, and even though you can't see it with the human eye, you
can sometimes still see it with this. After that had happened, that I
couldn't see it, then I concluded that it was dry.

Q. And obviously the transfer of the red balls is only going to occur
while the blood is wet and able to be transferred?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you obviously don't know who manipulated the
sock before you saw it on April 2, 1995, do you?

A. I don't like the word manipulated. I don't know what happened to
the sock, but it was stained.

Q. And you don't know what happened to any of Mr. Simpson's reference
blood or the reference blood of the victims before -- well, at any
time, do you?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you don't know whether or not the blood that's
in that stain contains EDTA, a blood preservative from a reference
vial, do you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, he's arguing the case.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, relative to the phenolphthalein --

A. It's phenolphthalein. You drop the E when it's reduced.

Q. All right.

Relative to the -- Mr. Medvene asked you if the presumptive blood
test, in putting too much liquid on the swab, could produce the balls
that we have shown, or the ball that we have shown in the photograph,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in this case it wasn't swatched until after the photographs
were already taken, isn't that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. So it couldn't have produced the red ball that we see in the
photograph, correct?

A. Not that swabbing. However, if someone had swabbed the surface on
top prior to that and used a lot of liquid, whether it's saline
solution or distilled water, just actually soaked it, that is
possible. But that would be very poor technique. That's not the way
you do it. You usually cut it out and then do it.

Q. If they had done that in this exceedingly poor technique, they
would have to have done it at the time before the cut-out was made to
have the transfer of blood go through to side 3, correct?

A. Precisely, yes, that's why it's cut out.

Q. You obviously have -- you were not given any information that any
such poor technique was ever used, or that any technique was used on
this sock before the cut-out was actually cut by LAPD, correct?

A. That's correct. I was not.

Q. And as I think you indicated, freezing and unfreezing just simply
isn't going to do it, correct?

A. No. My socks did not get damp when I did that.

Q. Mr. Medvene had asked about perspiration and a quick and violent
murder.

Do you have an opinion as to whether or not -- well, this is -- strike
that.

This area we're talking about is not on the foot, is it, that's up on
the ankle area?

A. Yes, it's on the ankle.

Q. So he talked about perspiration of a foot causing a dilution in the
blood and a possible causing of the phenomenon of the balls.

If there was perspiration that got as high as the ankle, would you
anticipate that you're going to see some sort of sodium chloride or
salt deposit as well?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: He's an expert on sodium chloride deposits. Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: No foundation.

A. If you have --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

Have you ever seen deposits left from perspiration?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And have you ever examined them under a microscope?

A. Some of them you don't need a microscope. You see crystals of salt,
sodium chloride, particularly on the underarm area of clothing, on
shirts and blouses.

Q. Was there any sodium chloride deposit on those socks at all?

A. I didn't see anything that I could call crystals, but it would take
a lot of perspiration to leave a significant deposit.

I would have to say that the person could perspire and they could have
damp skin, cold, clammy skin, but more likely in the shoe than above
it, where you got more radiation area, except that area could be
confined by the pants, standing up, the pants would cover that, and it
might somehow keep it damp longer, but also prevents you from bumping
into something and getting it on it if the pants were over the sock.

Q. Now, in terms of your own -- the drying experiment that you did
relative to socks that are similar to this, drying at 5 or 6 minutes,
that was -- well, strike that.

When did you do that?

A. I did that after I got back, I think, in June. I just did it one
day, as I said. I saw I was wearing similar socks, I wanted to see the
drying time, and that's why I did it.

Q. Blood is going to dry quicker when the sock is on a person because
of the body heat we all radiate; is that correct?

A. That's correct. Not so much what we radiate, but what we transfer
to the fluid if we radiate it, it's gone.

Q. Fair enough.

Just one other question on these gloves.

Now, when you have a -- when you looked at those gloves, did you see
that there was any coating, or anything whatsoever on the leather?

A. No, it was very smooth leather, and I didn't -- you can't see
scotch-guard or anything like that anyway on the clothing, you can't
see a treatment if it's there on leather, in my experience, but I did
not see any obvious signs of anything except just plain leather.

Q. And the fact that it didn't shrink after you had put blood on it
and tried to -- and replicated the atmospheric conditions, was that
consistent with your knowledge, and having worn gloves basically since
you were a kid, that they don't shrink?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, lack of foundation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I didn't know if they would shrink or not and if so, how much. I
had no idea because I don't have gloves such as that. They're very
nice gloves and -- I don't have bad gloves but I don't have nice ones
like that, and so -- I've never had them shrink, and that -- I can
remember them -- getting them sopping wet. So I didn't expect them to
shrink. I gave what I considered a very fair evaluation of it, and I
could not detect any shrinkage.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

THE COURT: Recross.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. How many pictures of little red balls did you take, Mr. MacDonell?

A. I do not remember. Dr. Lee took the film. It was his microscope and
--

Q. More than five, more than ten? You've shown us one. Was it more
than five or more than ten or less than that?

A. I would say perhaps a dozen. I don't know -- he might have taken --
used the film up, but he might not have taken it all of the same
thing.

Q. I read from the criminal trial transcript, 389, line 4 through 13.
(Reading:)

Q. Mr. MacDonell --

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

MR. P. BAKER: 39?

MR. MEDVENE: 389.

MR. BLASIER: 39?

MR. MEDVENE: 389.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) (Reading:)

Mr. MacDonell, please listen --

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute.

(Pause.)

MR. MEDVENE: Okay?

MR. BAKER: No. Our computer's gone haywire over here.

MR. BAKER: Let me look over your shoulder.

MR. MEDVENE: Sure.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) (Reading:)

Mr. MacDonell --

MR. BAKER: Let me read it.

(Pause.)

MR. BAKER: Okay. Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) (Reading:)

Mr. MacDonell, please listen to the question I ask you.

When you took only -- there was only one photograph taken of those
little balls that you saw on the inner surface of the sock?

A. I answered that when I said Dr. Lee took it, I did not take any.

Q. The question is, only one photograph, correct?

A. To the best of my knowledge.

A. Is there a question?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. MacDonell -- or Mr. MacDonell, I want to move
to a somewhat different area.

Is it true that you cannot tell this jury that the little red balls on
the inner surface that you claim you saw are absolutely associated
with the outer stain that you testified about, is that correct?

A. I can't absolutely say that they are.

Q. And getting back to that area for just a moment, the space or the
spot on side 3, where you claimed something went through to form this
ball, is on top of the cut-out where you have no personal knowledge
whether there was even any blood there to drip through and surrounded
by the periphery where you've told the prior jury there was no blood
that went from side 1 to 2; is that correct, sir?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that's at least three questions, it's compound
and argumentative.

THE COURT: I think you asked that question the last time around.

Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You made some reference to Dr. Lee.

Is it correct sir, in his notes he doesn't describe the shape of any
alleged round red balls; that's true, is it not?

A. I don't know what his descriptions are or his testimony was.

Q. Is it true, sir, that he never uses the words, I saw 6 or 7 little
red balls, he never says that, does he, in his notes; isn't that
correct?

MR. BAKER: There's no foundation for that question and he knows it.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) To the best of your knowledge, is it true, sir, that
Dr. Lee did not record in his notes seeing any 6 or 7 little round
balls?

MR. BAKER: Same question, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) You're saying, Mr. MacDonell, that you took no notes
on April 2 describing this phenomenon, and yet you have never even
seen Dr. Lee's notes?

MR. BAKER: Objection, argumentative, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that your testimony?

A. I've seen Dr. Lee's notes.

Q. Excuse me. You've seen --

A. I've seen Dr. Lee's notes.

And I do believe I may have made a notation about the -- I think it
just says photomicrographs were taken, but in that notation on my
diagram I made at that time, I don't think I added to it little red
ball or something. I have it in here.

Q. Is it true, sir, that Dr. Lee makes no reference to seeing 6 or 7
little red balls?

A. He told me that several times.

Q. Excuse me?

A. Documented, I don't know. But we discussed it at the time.

Q. Sir, you knew. My question --

A. No, I don't know what you said.

Q. My question is, you knew it was not in Dr. Lee's notes 'cause
you've now told us you've seen those notes?

A. You didn't say notes in your last question. You asked if we had
discussed it.

Q. No, I don't believe I did, but the record will be the best
evidence. I don't want to quarrel with you.

A. All right.

Q. Is it true that when you looked at Dr. Lee's notes, you did not see
any reference to seeing 6 or 7 little red balls; yes or no, sir?

A. I don't recall. I am not sure whether he put it in or not. He may
not have and he may have. I do not remember.

Q. Sir, counsel asked you about, you know, your examination of these
little red balls.

Let me ask you, isn't it true that on the side of the cut-out, where
you claim you found this little red ball, you tested another spot
where there was a Nicole Brown blood stain is; is that true?

MR. BAKER: That's beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Isn't it true, sir, that you probed other places on
the sock where Nicole Brown's blood was identified, and did not find
any of the blood soak through to side 2 or 3 of the sock?

MR. BAKER: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You wouldn't categorize yourself as an expert on
leather gloves, would you?

A. No, just as a wearer thereof.

Q. Just as a wearer.

And you're not testifying here, are you, sir, that the gloves worn by
the killer in this case did not shrink to a certain extent prior to
the time of the murders; you're not saying that, are you?

MR. BAKER: That's outside the scope, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no, sir?

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: I ask to reopen for one area.

THE COURT: No. Finish this.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Could you tell us how much you've been -- how much
you've billed?

MR. BAKER: I object to that. That's outside the scope as well.

THE COURT: That you can answer. Go ahead and answer that.

A. I haven't billed anything.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) How much have you been paid?

A. I received a retainer of $5,000, but that was not something I
billed for.

Q. And you have an arrangement for payment?

A. Well, I got paid, I have my airline tickets and that sort of thing.

Q. And you have your arrangement for payment in connection with the
work you've done, in connection with your testimony here; yes or no,
sir? Yes or no, do you have an arrangement for payment?

A. No arrangement, no.

Q. But you --

A. Going to bill them for the time that's spent, and the three days
time away from my laboratory but --

Q. I understand.

A. -- we haven't sat down and said this is what we're going to charge,
this is what you're going to pay, no.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. MacDonell, with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, is
it your opinion that the balls that you and Dr. Lee saw on April 2,
1995 are blood from a wet transfer from side 1 of the sock through
side 2 of the sock into side 3?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you know of any reason why LAPD would cut out an area in the
sock that had no blood or nothing else on it?

A. Yes, they would cut out an area for a control. You always take a
sample from an area that is not stained to run reagents on as opposed
to an area that you cut out to test with the area that does not have a
stain gives a positive test, then the positive test on the other area
is meaningless. So you will take out controls. But I think you're
referring specifically just to this stained area.

Q. This area is basically in the center of the stain, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's the area from which you would anticipate the highest
concentration of blood volume, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

Now, in your analysis, there was blood around the perimeter of the
area that was removed, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And as you got further away, the blood volume -- farther away from
the cut-out area, the blood volume became less, did it not, sir?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, beyond the copy.

THE COURT: This is beyond the scope of the redirect.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

1:30, ladies and gentlemen.

THE CLERK: For the record, Mr. Medvene, you made reference to 42A and
B.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

THE CLERK: Those weren't exhibits.

MR. MEDVENE: They're not exhibit numbers.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, defense calls Dr. Michael Baden.

MICHAEL BADEN, M.D., was called as a witness on behalf of the
Defendants, was duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this Court, shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, please, when you're ready, state and
spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Michael Baden, B-a-d-e-n.

Thank you. DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Baden.

You are a forensic pathologist, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And tell the jury briefly what a forensic pathologist does.

A. A forensic pathologist is a physician who specializes in
determining how people die from -- from unnatural causes, and who is
trained in determining how injury affects the living or dead person.
That's to distinguish the forensic pathologist from the general
pathologist, which -- whose expertise is to determine disease and
abnormalities that are natural, from doing various tests: Looking at
tissue under the microscope, or doing chemical tests.

And the pathologist -- forensic pathologist, hospital pathologist
doesn't treat living patients, but gives information to the surgeon or
the dermatologist, or the internist, who does the treatment.

MR. BLASIER: Erin, can we have a new number?

THE CLERK: 2267.

(The instrument herein referred to as Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Michael
Baden was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2267.)

Q. Dr. Baden, let me show you 2267.

Does this appear to be a copy of your C.V.?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And has that been updated recently?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

A. But it's recent.

Q. Can you describe to the jury your educational background, please.

A. Yes.

I received a bachelor of science degree in 1955 from the City College
of New York, and then a medical degree, an M.D. degree in 1959 from
New York University School of Medicine. I then was an intern and
resident, initially specializing in internal medicine, and then
resident and chief resident in pathology at Bellevue Hospital Medical
Center in New York City. And finished my training at Bellevue as a
fellow in pathology, 1965.

Q. You mentioned the term "internal medicine." What is that?

A. Yeah. Internal medicine -- there are about 25 specialties in
medicine; pathology is one, internal medicine is another.

Internal medicine is that specialty in medicine that treats illness in
nonsurgical ways.

Q. Can you describe to the jury the various professional positions
that you have held?

A. Yeah.

While a resident doctor at Bellevue Hospital, I became a part-time
medical examiner for the City of New York, which is similar to medical
examiner/coroner in -- in Los Angeles.

And in that position, I did autopsies on persons who died of,
potentially, unnatural causes; went to scenes of death; and stayed as
a part-time medical examiner from 1960 to 1965.

When I finished my training at -- as a resident doctor at Bellevue, I
then became a full-time medical examiner for the City of New York, and
stayed in that office until 1985, holding various positions, including
that of Chief Medical Examiner for the City of New York.

Since 1985, I have been Director of Forensic Sciences for the New York
State Police. But I'm here in a private capacity, not as a
representative of that agency.

Q. Now, during the course of your experience, have you -- have you had
any clinical experience?

If so, tell us what that is.

A. Yes.

Clinical experience, being the treatment of living patients, was my
initial area of specialization. And I was initially starting to
specialize in internal medicine. And I did that at New York University
Medical School, and Bellevue Hospital, and Columbia Presbyterian
School of Medicine, until I entered the pathology program and became
an -- have been acting as a pathologist since 1963, about.

Q. With your clinical experience, have you had experience with people
who have had stab wounds or other traumatic injuries?

A. Yes.

As an intern and resident and medical student at Bellevue Hospital,
New York City, which is the major hospital for trauma then and now in
Manhattan, I admitted, treated, diagnosed, assisted in operations on
many people, hundreds of people who had injury and trauma and who
survived.

Q. And those injuries and trauma, are they similar types of injuries
that you -- we have seen in this case?

A. Some of them are, yes.

Q. And do you hold any board certifications?

A. Yes. I hold three board certifications.

Q. Go ahead and describe those.

A. Board certification is a means that's been established largely
since World War II, to permit patients to know whether a physician who
holds himself or herself out as a specialist, has all the requisite
training to be a dermatologist or a pediatrician or whatever.

And the various specialties have boards that set criteria. The
criteria, in general, consists of having successfully graduated from
an accredited medical school, having successfully completed a
residency program in that specialty, in the -- in an approved hospital
in the United States, and finally, having passed various examinations
at the end of that program, written, oral, and treatment examinations.

Upon successful completion of those examinations, the individual is
then a diplomat of that specialty, or board certified in that
specialty, and can hold himself or herself out as a board-certified
surgeon, pathologist, radiologist et cetera.

Q. And in what fields are you certified?

A. I'm certified in three areas, in three fields in pathology.

First one was anatomic pathology. And that has to do with the
evaluation of any abnormalities that might be present in the structure
or anatomy of the body, such as determined by looking at a biopsy
under the microscope and seeing what it is, cancer or not cancer.

Also, part of that entails doing autopsies to determine what
abnormalities were present. And this looks at the actual structure, to
see if the liver looks abnormal, if the brain looks abnormal. And
that's anatomic pathology.

Secondly, I'm certified in -- board certified in clinical pathology.
And clinical pathology looks at the chemistry of the body. The
clinical pathologist is often the director of the laboratory at the
hospital, the lab that does urine tests and blood tests, and
determines if the cholesterol is high, if the sugar is high, et
cetera, and gives that information back to the treating doctor to
incorporate in evaluation of what's wrong with the patient.

Q. These are living patients?

A. These are living patients.

And the third area that I'm certified, which is really the area that I
do 95 percent of my work, is forensic pathology.

And forensic pathology really specializes in unnatural conditions that
affect the body, as opposed to natural conditions that 99 percent of
pathologists are involved with stroke, heart disease, cancer.

All parts of the hospital pathologist's expertise includes accident,
suicide, homicide, drug overdose is part of what the forensic
pathologist specializes in, and part of -- that's part of -- the
pathology part of it, the forensic part of it, is also -- includes the
ability, training to give testimony, and to give evidence in hearing
procedures so that other people can understand what our findings are.

Q. In addition to your professional positions that you told us about,
have you been appointed to any -- by any government agencies to --

A. Yes. That is, I've been appointed to a number of committees and
subcommittees by various mayors of New York City, when I worked there:
Committees on drug abuse, child abuse, alcoholism, areas that a
medical examiner sees a lot of in an urban area.

On a state level, I have been on various appointments by the governor
to be on committees and commissions that examine health care and all
deaths that occur in prisons, lock-ups and jails throughout New York
State. I'm appointed to a similar commission that evaluates all health
care and causes of death -- evaluate causes of death of persons who
die in mental institutions and mental hospitals throughout New York
State.

On a federal level, I was appointed, back in the late 1970s, Chairman
of the Forensic Pathology Panel for the United States Congress Select
Committee on Assassination that was charged with the responsibility of
reevaluating the deaths of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin
Luther King.

Q. Doctor, was Werner Spitz on either of those panels?

A. Yes; he was on the President Kennedy panel.

Q. What was your position on that panel?

A. I was chairman of both panels to look into the -- the pathology and
the causes of death of President Kennedy.

And similarly, I was chairman of the panel to look into the death of
Dr. Martin Luther King.

On a -- on a federal level, I have served on various commissions and
committees to teach aspects of forensic medicine and forensic
pathology in South American countries: Panama, Equador, Columbia.

About three years ago, I was a member of a four-member team that went
to -- to the Ural Mountains in Russia, arranged by the U.S. State
Department and the Russian government to examine remains that were
thought to be those of Czar Nicholas, Alexandria, and the Romanoff
family that was murdered in 1918, and possible skeletal remains had
been recovered.

I've been a member of -- requested by the Singapore government,
Philippine government, West Bank, Gaza Strip, human rights groups;
Canadian government to do autopsies, examine causes of death, read
autopsies in matters that have come up in those countries.

Q. Did you work on the -- Medgar Evers case?

A. Yes, I've served as a consultant to various district attorneys'
offices around the country, including that of the District Attorney in
Jackson, Mississippi. About 1991, 1992, I was asked by that district
attorney's office to do a reautopsy on the body of Medgar Evers, who
was a civil rights leader who was murdered in 1963. And there had been
a couple trials at that time that were hung juries. And new evidence
had come forth, and I was asked to do a reexamination.

I did that reexamination and then did testify at the subsequent murder
trial.

Q. You indicated that you've consulted with D.A.'s offices throughout
the country. Have you consulted with the Los Angeles District
Attorney's office on occasion?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. And approximately how many times?

A. A few times I was consulted by them to testify and to reevaluate
the death of John Belushi, to evaluate and testify in the cases
involving a Dr. Boggs, recently, who was involved in a murder trial.

I've also been retained -- in fact, in this very courthouse, I
testified relative to the death of -- involving Christian Brando,
Marlin Brando's son, a few years back. That was for the defendant.

Q. The Boggs case that you mentioned, were you testifying as an expert
for the Los Angeles D.A.'s office, at the same time you were a defense
expert in this case?

A. At the time of the criminal trial in this case, when I testified --
I was testifying in the criminal trial -- I did testify two different
times across the hall as an expert for the Los Angeles District
Attorney, on their behalf in a homicide trial, yes which involved
actually three -- in total, three different defendants.

Q. During the course of your professional experience, can you break
down the number of times that you worked for the prosecution versus
the defense, just approximately?

A. Well, in general, all my official work as Medical Examiner in New
York City, as Medical Examiner for the State Police is almost entirely
evaluating and being called to testify by the prosecution.

In my private practice -- and I'm permitted, since working with the
New York State Police, to have a private practice, because my job with
the state police -- New York State police is not full-time in that
capacity. I do private consultations both for -- for prosecution and
defense attorneys.

It works out, possibly, about 60 percent for prosecutors' offices, for
40 percent in defense matters.

Q. That's just in your private practice?

A. In my private practice.

But in me official capacity, which 90 percent of my work over the
years has been done, officially as the medical examiner for New York
City, as the Medical Examer for the state police that's -- 99.9
percent, I'm called by the prosecutor's office to testify.

Q. Now, can you give us an estimate of how many autopsies you think
you've done over the years?

A. Over the years, since the 1960s, more than 20,000 autopsies.

Q. Now, during the course of your professional experience, how often
do you go to a crime scene?

A. Oh, when I was in New York City, almost all the homicides that I
would be involved with, I would go to the crime scene.

Since working for the state police, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

Q. In your opinion, is it important to go to a crime scene, as a
forensic pathologist?

A. Yes. The crime scene is extremely important for the forensic
pathologist and for the police investigators.

Q. Now, are you acquainted with Dr. Werner Spitz?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Is he a friend of yours?

A. He is a very close friend and a very excellent forensic
pathologist.

Q. We need a towel up there?

A. I'm sorry. (Indicating to small spill.)

That wasn't a Freudian slip.

I've known Dr. Spitz for a long time, and I have the greatest respect
for him. I think he's excellent. I think we disagree on some matters
at issue, but he's an excellent forensic pathologist.

Q. You're aware he's testified in this case on many of the same issues
that you testified to in the criminal case?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Now, when did you first start working on the Simpson criminal case?

A. I was called by the attorney for Mr. Simpson, Mr. Robert Shapiro,
on the night of June --

Thank you very much. (Bailiff hands paper towels to Dr. Baden.)

June 14, 1994.

Q. That would have been two days after the murders in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you come to Los Angeles at this time?

A. I came to Los Angeles on the 16th -- that is a Thursday -- arrived
Thursday, late afternoon, from New York City.

Q. And can you describe briefly the amount of time that you spent
working on the criminal case?

A. Yes.

I spent a lot of time. I spent about two or three weeks, initially,
review -- going through the crime scenes, of course -- the crime
scenes: The Bundy scene, the Rockingham scene; going to the medical
examiner's office; going to the Los Angeles Crime Lab; consulting with
the attorneys.

I would say over the 1994 -- two-year period of time, 1994, 1995, I
spent more than 70 days in Los Angeles, alone, and then I did a lot of
work in New York City.

Q. Do you know how many trips you actually made back and forth?

A. I must have made more than a dozen trips back and forth.

Q. And what is your daily fee?

What daily fee did you charge in the criminal case?

A. I charged in this -- in this matter, $150 -- excuse me -- $1500 a
day.

Q. Dr. Spitz indicated that his charge was $3,000 a day.

Do you have -- is your $1500 a day fee, is that a governmental fee? Is
it some other --

A. Well, presently, my normal fee would be $2500 a day, or up to
$3,000 a day, depending on the situation.

But in this matter, since I'd worked out an arrangement with the Los
Angeles District Attorney's office, and the John Belushi matter and in
the Boggs matter, to charge them $1500 a day in the cases I worked
with them, I thought it was only fair that I would charge the same to
Mr. Simpson.

Q. Now, the 70 days that you spent at $1500 a day is approximately
$105,000; is that approximately what you received in the criminal
case?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you charge for any additional time that you worked in New York?

A. No. I only charged for the time that I had to come here to -- to
Los Angeles. I didn't charge for reviewing materials in New York City.

Q. During the course of your preparation for your testimony in the
criminal case, did you review all the autopsy reports?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you review all of the testimony in the various proceedings that
related to the pathology, forensic pathology issues?

A. Yes.

Q. And specifically, whose testimony did you review?

A. Well, I reviewed from previous proceedings, Dr. Golden's testimony,
the doctor who did the two autopsies.

I was present and reviewed Dr. Lakshmanan's testimony in the criminal
trial. I reviewed all the documents that were created at the time of
the autopsy, including going down and making more sections and looking
at the tissues that were retained in formaldehyde and making
additional sections from those.

Q. You actually examined all tissue samples that were obtained in the
autopsy?

A. I did not do a second autopsy but I did review everything that was
retained which included tissues made -- Meant to make microscopic
sections and also I reviewed all the tissues that were retained for
toxicology purposes to be sent to the laboratory for chemical
analyses.

Q. Did you request to do a second autopsy?

A. Yes.

Q. And were you able to do that.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Mr. Shapiro couldn't work it out. As far as making those
arrangement.

Q. Now, have you also reviewed the testimony of Werner Spitz, both in
deposition and in this civil case with respect to the issues that you
testified to in the criminal case?

A. Yes I have.

Q. And have you also discussed the case with Dr. Lakshmanan and Dr.
Golden?

A. Yes, I have in the past.

Q. Have you examined all of the physical evidence in this case.

A. Yes. That is, I did examine all the physical evidence that was
available at the medical examiner's office. All the clothing from both
parties.

All the trace evidence that was available in the Los Angeles crime
lab. Whatever microscopic sections were available and all the
photographs that were many, many photographs taken of the crime scenes
and related to the homicide investigation and I did go to the various
-- to Bundy and to Rockingham a number of times and examined those
areas.

Q. Now, were you also present with Mr. Simpson on the 17th of June?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you examine him at this time?

A. Yeah. I arrived on June 16th, which is Thursday, late Thursday, and
made arrangements with Mr. Shapiro at that time, and Dr. Henry Lee,
who came with me, who also arrived that -- that evening, to examine
Mr. Simpson the following day.

And we did meet with him the following day, the following morning, to
evaluate him for -- first to take samples of hair, to take samples of
blood, to take samples of urine. And in the process of that, we're
told that the District Attorney's office had decided they were going
to arrest him.

Q. Now, during much of the time that you worked on this case, were you
also working with Dr. Henry Lee?

A. Yes. The entire time. A great deal of the time, yes.

Q. And are the opinions that you testified to in the criminal case,
and the ones you'll be testifying to here today, are they based on all
of the information you've reviewed about this case?

A. They incorporate all of the information that I reviewed, all the
evaluations I did, and all of the -- and after discussing the matters
with other -- with Dr. Golden, Dr. Lakshmanan and, Dr. Lee.

Q. Incidentally, when you were examining physical evidence, was -- one
of the items that you examined was the white envelope with the glasses
that had been found between the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman?

A. Yes. On the first time I went to the Los Angeles Police Department
Crime Lab, there were about 57 items of evidence, and one of those
items was a white envelope that contained eyeglasses with the name
Nicole -- Ms. Simpson on them, or that would identify to me as being
the eyeglasses that were being returned to Mrs. Simpson.

Q. When you examined those, how many lenses were in the glasses at
this time?

A. There were two lenses. They were separate. I examined them. There
was a frame and two lenses, separate. Everything, in fact, intact,
nothing broken.

Q. Do you have any idea what happened to one of those lenses?

A. The following January, when we were -- When I was next able to
review that evidence, when it was brought to my office in Albany, New
York, and I reviewed the evidence with Dr. Lee, Dr. Wolfe, who was
also present, one lens was missing. I don't know what happened to it.

Q. Now, I want to ask you some questions about your examination of Mr.
Simpson on the 17th of June.

MR. BLASIER: Could we show the middle -- the cut on the middle finger,
please.

MR. P. BAKER: This is photograph 715.

Q. Doctor, can you look at the television there and tell us what that
is?

A. This is a photograph that I believe I took of Mr. Simpson's hand,
left -- left hand.

This would be the middle finger (indicating).

This would be the ring finger (indicating).

And this would be a ruler that I used.

And in the middle of the photograph is the knuckle. The knuckle -- not
the knuckle, the middle of the index -- of the middle finger, with a
healing laceration on the top of the joint.

Q. Now, do you have an opinion on whether that particular wound could
have been caused by a fingernail?

A. It's -- yes, I have an opinion.

Q. What is your opinion?

A. My opinion then, and my opinion now, is that it was not caused by a
fingernail, by somebody's fingernail.

Q. Is it accurate that Dr. Spitz is the first person to have expressed
that opinion?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you have an opinion on what could have caused
that cut?

A. Well, it's a deep, irregular cut. And it was my opinion, and is my
opinion, that it was cut by some sharp, irregular object.

One object that was raised to me as being a jagged piece of glass,
which certainly be able -- would cause that kind of injury, could
cause that kind of injury, or a very jagged knife could also cause
that, not a sharp knife, possibly could cause it.

My opinion, after going over this and consulting with Dr. Lee, was
that it was most likely broken glass.

Q. Now, you've observed, also, the wounds on the two victims in this
case, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And we'll get into more detail in a minute, but you share the
opinion that those wounds were caused by a sharp knife, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Could the kind of -- the sharpness of the knife that caused those
wounds on the victims have caused this cut?

A. No. In my opinion, the knife that caused the wounds on Mr. Goldman
and Mrs. Simpson, was a sharp knife or knives. It was some -- one or
more knives that caused those were sharp.

And this is irregular. (Indicating.) This was an irregular wound that
-- and that was the reason that I thought it was most likely caused by
glass.

Q. Can you tell us why, in your opinion, that couldn't be a fingernail
gouge mark?

A. I've never seen a fingernail gouge mark produce a long -- that long
and deep a wound on somebody. Even cats and animals create scratches,
but not deep gouges. And that, in addition, which -- when I examined
in the Los Angeles Coroner's Office the nail clippings from Mrs.
Simpson, for example, there -- they were all intact; none of them were
damaged. None of them had skin on them, but none of them were damaged.
And she had long, artificial fingernails.

Q. None of those?

A. Whereas, none of them were injured in any way.

Mr. Goldman had very -- didn't have any fingernails; they were
clipped; they were very close to the skin.

My impression was, after looking at the fingers of the decedent, and
after looking at this wound, that it was not a -- a scratch, but that
it was some kind of an irregular, sharp object. And that -- that's
what my opinion was and is today.

Q. Have you heard anything since you gave your opinion in the criminal
case to change your mind about that?

A. No.

And in the criminal case, it wasn't even raised in the criminal case.

Q. Now, on the 17th, you examined Mr. Simpson's hand.

Did you observe this second area that appears to be a cut?

A. Yeah. There were two other breaks in the skin that I observed. One
was on the inside of the same finger, and another was on the opposite
portion of the ring finger, the fourth finger. There were two
additional healing cuts or tears in the skin.

Q. Let me show you -- this is also part of 715.

Does this appear to be that second cut that you're talking about?

A. This would be the third cut.

Q. Or the third cut?

A. Yeah. This is the cut on the inside of the fourth finger, also of
the left hand of Mr. Simpson, a photograph taken on that Friday
morning, the 17th I think.

Q. Do you have an opinion on whether the cut that's depicted in this
picture could have been caused by a fingernail gouge?

A. Didn't look -- it didn't, and doesn't look like a fingernail mark
to me.

Q. Now, how about the second cut on the -- on the middle finger?

A. No, I didn't think at that time, nor do I think now, that any of
these are fingernail marks.

And fingernails cause abrasions with different kinds of marks, in my
experience, than what is on Mr. Simpson's hands in these photographs,
and what I saw with my own eyes back on June 17th.

Q. Let me show you, also, part of 715.

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

MR. BLASIER: 715.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recognize these as two small scrapes that
you saw on the 17th?

A. Yeah. I -- I don't have an independent recollection, but I think
this photograph was taken by Dr. Lee.

That's my finger holding the ruler.

And they certainly do show crusted, superficial abrasions. They
weren't cuts; they were broader abrasions.

Q. Are those very small?

A. Yeah, they're very small.

This is an inch between the two lines. This is -- it would be a third
of an inch, maybe, in diameter.

And when I examined -- well, they're there.

Q. Do you have an opinion on whether those two abrasions were caused
by fingernail gouges?

A. They don't look --

No, in my opinion, they're not caused by fingernails, they're caused
by rubbing against something, friction, abrasion, when skinning one's
knees, when one rubs off the top layer of the skin and it crusts over.

Q. Let me show you another part -- another picture from that next
series.

It's a little hard to see.

Do you see the very small abrasions?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you have an opinion of whether those were caused by fingernail
gouges?

A. Those could be. There are lots of things that could cause those
two, and it's possible that fingernails could cause that.

But that wasn't my opinion; but it's possible.

Q. Are those extremely small?

A. Yes, they're pin-head size, very tiny, but a scraping fingernail
could cause that.

Q. Dr. Baden, do you have an opinion now -- Withdrawn.

You examined the two scenes involved, the autopsy, and all of the
evidence that you've described, in order to form opinions with respect
to what might have happened at Bundy at the time of the murders,
correct?

A. Yes; that is part of what a forensic pathologist does, is to try
and utilize examination of living and dead victims to reconstruct what
happened at the time of the injury, yes. And that was one of the areas
I was looking into.

Q. Now, you're familiar with Dr. Spitz's testimony in this case, where
he provided a very detailed specific recitation of his opinion on how
he thought every wound was inflicted and in what order.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That misstates the record.

MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates --

MR. MEDVENE: Misstates Dr. Spitz's testimony.

THE COURT: Sustained, unless you show me where it is.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, you reviewed Dr. Spitz's testimony as
to his opinion as to how the murders took place?

A. Yes.

Q. And in your opinion, as a forensic pathologist, do you have an
opinion as detailed as Dr. Spitz's, based on the evidence that was
presented in this case?

A. In my opinion, in this case, one can't get as detailed as Dr. Spitz
had gotten. That are -- there are times you can get detailed if there
are eyewitnesses, and we're able to use the autopsy findings to see if
they support one version versus another.

But in a situation like this, where there were no eyewitnesses, I
don't think it's reasonable to give a blow-by-blow description with
any accuracy.

Q. Now, have you formed an opinion with respect to the number of
perpetrator or perpetrators that might have been responsible for these
murders?

A. I have an opinion.

Q. What's your opinion?

A. My opinion is that -- it's based on all the evidence and all the
circumstances -- that it's more likely that there were more than one
perpetrator.

Q. Why do you say that?

A. Because it's very difficult for a single perpetrator to control two
victims at the same time in a public place, whether in an apartment or
closed-off area.

It would not be, in my experience, possible to reliably prevent people
from yelling, screaming, asking for help, from escaping from doing --
taking many evasive actions, that were not done here in a public
place, with people walking around outside.

So it's my opinion, it's more likely that there's more than one
perpetrator.

Q. Incidentally, did you observe any wounds on Ronald Goldman that
would have prevented him from hollering out during the course of
whatever struggle took place?

A. Neither victim was incapacitated or unable to call out for help
prior to losing consciousness.

That even though the neck was injured in both said individuals, the
vocal cords and the voice box were still normal. So even in a
two-second struggle, people can yell. One can yell help five times in
a second or two seconds or three seconds.

So there was nothing structurally in the victim to prevent either one
from yelling for help until the time of loss of consciousness.

Q. As to Nicole Brown Simpson, the large neck wound that she had that
went around to the spine, would she be able to holler out at that
time?

A. No, because the neck wound went through the top part of the larynx.
It didn't injure the voice box; it didn't injure the vocal cords. So
even though the very top of the epiglottis, the -- which is sort of
back of the throat -- was cut, the other aspect -- the other parts of
the voice box was not.

However, my opinion would be that when she suffered that cut, that was
the same time that she suffered the cuts to the carotid arteries. And
when she suffered the cut to the carotid arteries, she would have lost
consciousness in ten seconds or so.

Q. Prior to that injury, was there anything that would have prevented
her, from an injury standpoint, from screaming?

A. No. During, whatever preceded the cut wound across the neck,
whatever time there was, no reason that she could not have called out
for help or yelled in some way. Whatever time interval there was,
there was some time interval, because there were cuts on her hands.
She had defensive marks on her.

Q. We'll talk about that in a little more detail in a minute.

Do you have an opinion with respect to the number of weapons that were
involved inflicting the wounds to the two victims in this case?

A. Yes. I think that it could -- it could be one single weapon, if it
was shaped properly, that could have caused the wounds to both
individuals -- the wounds to both individuals -- individuals.

But certainly, much of the findings would be equally consistent with
two weapons, that there are descriptions and photographs in the -- of
the stab wounds, somewhat -- some are double-edged, some are
single-edged.

That doesn't mean necessarily that you need more than one weapon, but
it would be consistent with a double-edge weapon, as well as a
single-edge weapon.

Q. So, is it your opinion that you can't say that it was only one
weapon? It could be one; it could be more?

A. I think that's fair. It could be one, could be more; absolutely.

Q. I want to ask you if you have an opinion with respect to -- given
the wounds on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, what sort of
blood would have resulted on the perpetrator or perpetrators who were
involved in this struggle?

A. In my opinion, again, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,
when Nicole Simpson's neck was -- was cut so that she bled from the
carotid arteries, that blood needn't have gotten on the perpetrator if
he were behind her.

But in the course of the struggle with Nicole Simpson and with Ron
Goldman -- there was a considerable struggle, in my opinion with Mr.
Goldman. The very fact that both had stab wounds and injuries to the
hands that bled, would be, in and of itself, a reason that blood would
get on the perpetrator, from bleeding hands, in the course of combat.
So my opinion would be that there would be blood on the perpetrator's
skin or clothing.

Q. Now, is it accurate there were defensive wounds on both victims?

A. There were wounds that -- on both victims that are absolutely
alluded to as defensive wounds.

Q. Is it fair to say there are more defensive wounds on Mr. Goldman's
hands?

A. Yes. I think he had about three separate cuts on his hands.

Q. We have a board that we have prepared.

(Board referred to was displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. BLASIER: For the record, we have a compilation of pictures, that
of Mr. Goldman's hands, which include 384, 385, 1993, 1994, 1995,
1996, 1997, and 1998.

Dr. Baden, could you step down here briefly.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me, Mr. Blasier. Are you calling that a
number.

MR. BLASIER: No. This is a compilation of already produced exhibits.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Could you point out to the members of the jury,
the basis for your opinion that the defensive wounds were -- would
have bled on the perpetrator?

A. Yes.

I think on the 384, the first one, the right hand -- yeah, right hand
-- there's a stab wound right between the base, between the first and
the second -- the second or third fingers, that seems to have a sharp
edge on the side. That's a double edge which goes into the underlying
skin, which is very vascular, lots of small blood vessels in that
area.

And I think in the course of a struggle, blood would be oozing at some
rapidity from that stab wound.

And in addition to that, there was a stab wound on this same hand, as
seen in 1998, in the palm of the hand, which would also is be in a
vascular area that would bleed.

And on the left hand, which is 1986 -- 1996, below the pinky, there's
a cut wound on the hand, which would also -- all of which go down into
the underlying blood vessels. So all of those would have bled during a
struggle. And if the hand came in contact with the clothing or person
of the perpetrator or perpetrators, would leave some blood on it.

Q. Now, looking at 1997, could you tell us about the wounds indicated
on the back of Mr. Goldman's right hand; what could have caused those?

A. Yeah, there are bruises on the back of Mr. Goldman's right hand,
the black-and-blue marks, which are due to blunt-force trauma, due to
the fact that the back of the hand came in contact with an object, and
is typical, in my experience, with punching injuries, if somebody's
punching somebody else.

These bruises kind of curve on the back of the hand, the knuckles and
the joint of the fingers in the places that are present in this
photograph, which is 1997.

Q. Okay.

(Witness reassumes witness stand.)

Q. Now, Dr. Baden, would you agree that in addition to the wounds on
the hands, that there was a tremendous amount of blood at this crime
scene, the Bundy scene?

A. I agree; there was a great amount of blood at the Bundy crime
scene, yes.

Q. Now, did you examine -- again with respect to the issue of how long
the incident took place -- did you examine Mr. Goldman's clothing to
attempt to add weight to your opinion?

A. Yeah.

In order to try and determine how long Mr. Goldman was standing up
after he started to bleed, the clothing examination would be very
helpful in arriving at an opinion in that regard. In addition, the
clothing is important to see if there's any evidence of a struggle:
Tears in the fabric, torn buttons, are some ways in which clothing can
tell us how much of a struggle was going on.

Q. Were there any torn buttons on Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. Yes, I think three of the buttons were torn off.

Q. And did you observe the amount of blood on Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. Yes, there were --

Q. Go ahead.

A. Yeah. There was considerable amount of blood when I saw the
clothing in the medical examiner's office about a week later. The
blood was all dried in the photographs of the crime scene. The blood
was not as dry as when I saw it later on. But in looking at the
crime-scene photographs of the clothing and examining the clothing at
the coroner's office the following week, there was a great deal of
blood present on the shirt and on the -- on the jeans, the pants that
Mr. Goldman was wearing, particularly on the left leg, the left leg
and lower extremity of the blue jeans that he was wearing at the time
that he was murdered.

MR. BLASIER: Let me show you Exhibit 38. And I apologize for the
picture.

(Exhibit 38 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recall seeing this picture of Mr. Goldman
after the murders?

A. Yes.

I don't think you have the whole thing on the -- yeah. If you make it
a little smaller, I think you'll get the context better.

Yeah, this -- this is a photograph of Mr. Goldman as he lay in the
crime scene when -- before the body was moved.

Q. Now, you've examined the jeans, as well as these photographs,
correct?

A. Yeah.

If I may, this is Mr. Goldman's back against the -- the metal fence,
the blue -- blue jeans going down to the white shoes, the ankle-high
boots or shoes. And what impressed me in this photograph, and when I
examined the clothing subsequently, was a great deal of blood that had
soaked down from the top of the jeans into the -- to where it ended by
the shoes, and that blood further soaked into the left shoe.

Q. Now, you observed the shoes, as well, of Mr. Goldman, did you not?

A. I did examine the shoes at the coroner's office a week after this
--

Q. And --

A. -- photograph.

Q. -- and your description of the blood-soaked shoes -- did your
examination of one of Mr. Goldman's shoes confirm it was blood-soaked?

A. Yes, the left one.

Q. Now, Dr. Spitz testified that, in his opinion, some of that dark
area was shadow.

In your opinion, after looking at the pants, was that blood?

A. Yeah.

I think, in fairness to Dr. Spitz, it's hard to tell from the
photographs, which are not so distinct on the Elmo, what's shadow and
what's dark blood.

But clearly, in my opinion, all of that dark area on the jeans was dry
blood when I examined the -- the clothing at the medical examiner's --
at the coroner's office.

Q. All right. Let me show you --

A. And with my naked eye and with a magnifying lens.

Q. Let me show you 2168.

Does this appear to be part of the jeans that showed a continuous
stain from top to bottom?

A. Yes.

I'm a little disoriented here. But this would be the jeans. And the
dark was -- was -- yes, the dark is dry blood extending down into the
left shoe that he was wearing.

And this is a photograph taken after Mr. Goldman was removed from the
crime scene. (Indicating.)

Q. Now, did you observe anything about Mr. Goldman's shoes that
indicates that he was engaged in a struggle?

A. Well, apart from the blood that was present on the shoes, which
turns out was my -- in my opinion, evidence of a struggle, there was
also a cut on the top of the right shoe, what I interpreted as a fresh
cut, which, in my opinion, was entirely consistent, or appeared to --
appears, to me, to have occurred at the same time that the stab wounds
occurred.

Q. Now, I want to ask you about some of the specific wounds, now.

There was an indication of a bruise to Nicole Brown Simpson's brain,
correct?

A. There was a bruise; that is, when I examined the tissues that were
stored in the medical examiner's office -- and it is usual and
customary at the time an autopsy is done to take a little bit of
tissue for possible further examination under the microscope -- and
when I went to the medical examiner's office, I was able, through the
courtesy of Dr. Lakshmanan, to examine the tissues that were in the
formaldehyde and preservation. And included in that bottle was a
section of brain removed from the time of autopsy from Mrs. Simpson
that did contain on it a very prominent bruise, a damage and
hemorrhage on the outside of the brain.

Q. Is it accurate that nobody else had observed that until you
discovered it?

A. It had not been described in the -- all the protocol, so it was not
present in the autopsy description prior to our finding it.

I looked at it, with Dr. Lakshmanan being present, and he then had the
autopsy report amended to include that.

Q. Now, did you also observe information in the autopsy report with
respect to a bruise on Nicole Brown Simpson's scalp, in the area of
that bruise to the brain?

A. Yes.

Dr. Golden, when he prepared the autopsy report on Mrs. Simpson, did
note, I believe, on the right side of the top of the -- on the right
side, on top of the scalp, a distinct bruise to the skin when he -- he
viewed and reviewed the brain injury, it was his recollection, and he
so amended his report to indicate that his best recollection, the
bruise on the brain was also on the right side, right under the -- the
scalp tissue, and he had forgotten to include that in his report. So
he amended it.

There was no skull fracture, just a bruise on the scalp and a bruise
on the underlying brain.

Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not that bruise could have
been caused by Nicole Brown Simpson falling down onto the pavement?

A. Assuming that Dr. Golden's recollection is correct, I have no
reason to doubt it. It would be a typical bruise for direct blow to
the head.

In general, when the brain is bruised, it's different patterns of
injury, depending on a direct blow to the brain -- to the forehead,
versus a falling blow to the head. When there's a direct blow to the
head, as by a baseball bat or whatever blunt object, there's an injury
on the skin and there's an injury on the brain immediately under it.
And that's called a coup injury, c-o-u-p-e(sic). And that's to
indicate that it is a stationary -- a blow to a stationary head.

When a person falls and injures the head, because our brains are
encased in a thin layer of water -- the spinal fluid encases our brain
-- when our head strikes something, we fall, the brain is jarred and
strikes the other surface, so that the scalp injury may be on the back
of the head, but the brain injury will be opposite, on the front of
the head. That's called a contrecoup injury.

And that helps the pathologist reconstruct, at the time of an autopsy,
whether the injury was due to a fall or due to a direct blow, which
sometimes is of importance.

And in this instance, my opinion would be that the nature of the blow
-- the coup nature of the blow would indicate that Mrs. Simpson was
struck with a blunt object on the top of the head, and that this
caused the direct bruising of the brain underneath.

And this opinion is further supported by the nature of the wound. The
-- the injury to the scalp is near the top of the scalp, and it's not
a likely place to be injured during a fall.

Usually, during a fall, it's more to the side.

So my opinion is that Mrs. Simpson, at some point during her struggle,
was struck in the forehead with a blunt object.

Q. Now, did you -- from the autopsy report, can you tell us
approximately how many wounds, in your opinion, were inflicted on
Nicole Brown Simpson prior to the fatal neck wound?

A. About ten cut and stab wounds. There could be more, because --
depends how one distinguishes the wounds. There are about ten wounds
prior to the fatal neck wounds.

Q. Can you describe the direction of those wounds in relation to each
other?

A. They were on both sides of the body. There was a clustering of four
on the left side of the neck, in addition to the stab wound, to the
cut wound. But the knife that caused those stab wounds were in
different directions. The blood was in varying directions, so that --
and there were injuries to both sides of the body, different kinds of
blunt force and stabbing injuries, which indicated to me that it was
part of the struggle.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor this might be a good time.

THE COURT: Okay ten minutes.

THE CLERK: For the record Exhibits 1407 and 1411 from this morning are
by reference to Case Number BA097211.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, the first week that you were out here
after the murders in June of '94, did you and Dr. Lee and others
inspect some of the physical evidence that had been collected?

A. Yes.

Q. Where was that done?

A. At the Los Angeles Police Department Crime Laboratory in Los
Angeles.

Q. And who supervised that for the police?

A. Detective Vannatter seemed to be in charge of the operation, and
Dr. Kestler, who was the chief criminalist there, was also there.

Q. Was one of the items that you requested to examine a pair of socks
that supposedly had been found on Mr. Simpson's bedroom floor?

A. Yes. I believe that was item 13 out of the -- of the evidence that
we -- that was then at the crime lab. And I did look at them.

Q. Were you actually prevented, however, from examining them
personally?

A. I was not permitted to touch or photograph any evidence. It was
more of a documenting what was there, according to Detective
Vannatter.

And I did look at the socks. I didn't touch it; I didn't handle the
socks.

Q. Were they in a container when you looked at them?

A. As I recall, they were in a clear plastic container.

Q. Did you observe, at this time, any blood on those socks?

A. No.

Q. Now, I want to ask you some questions about the length of the
incident in this case, that resulted in the murders.

Now, would you agree that the question of how long a period of time
elapsed, from the time the perpetrator or perpetrators got to the
scene and left the scene, is a different question from how long it
took to inflict various wounds?

A. Yes.

Q. And in terms of looking at wounds after -- after a homicide, are
there certain things that you can infer from the nature of the wounds
as to the sequence of wounds?

A. Sometimes we can get information as to sequence of wounds, and
certainly we can distinguish and autopsy the degree of injury each
wound causes, which may be helpful in determining what was first and
what was last, and whether the person could have yelled or struggled
or -- and how long the person could be conscious after receiving
certain wounds.

Q. Now, you used an analogy with me the other day about a boxing match
to try and illustrate this idea.

A. Yes.

Q. What is -- explain that analogy.

A. In a boxing match, one can wind up at the end as -- a recent boxing
match, with a boxer having many injuries on the face, tears,
lacerations, and bleeding points and all.

As a medical examiner, I can determine the minimum length of time it
took to get those injuries, but I can't tell the maximum length of
time the same injuries any boxer has at the end of nine rounds, 27
minutes could be incurred in one or two minutes. So I could say these
injuries took at least a minute or two minutes with a blunt object, a
fist or a gloved fist, to produce; but I can't tell if there were time
periods in between the injuries.

Q. You can describe how the injuries got there; you can't say how many
rounds the fight was?

A. Exactly. I could say that there are injuries, but I can't tell if
it lasted one round or ten rounds.

Q. Now, I want to ask you some questions about the wounds to Mr.
Goldman and how this fits into the idea of how long the perpetrator or
perpetrators were on the scene, as a minimum.

Do you have that in mind?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, what is your opinion as to the --

Well, let me ask you this: Do you agree that both victims bled to
death?

A. Yes.

Q. And is bleeding to death from a -- from a knife wound, for
instance, different than when one is struck with a blunt object or
shot?

A. Yes.

Q. And explain that difference. END SECTION 4A BEGIN SECTION 4B

A. Yeah.

In deaths caused by shootings or blunt objects, baseball bats, or an
automobile accident, when there's crushing injuries to organs, damage
to organs -- bullets through the brain or crushing injury to the chest
and heart, can cause death by direct organ damage. And loss of
consciousness immediately by direct organ damage, direct brain damage,
or heart damage.

In stabbings or cuttings, incapacity, impairment, and death doesn't
result from direct organ damage, as in these instances, but from loss
of blood. It's the bleeding that causes incapacity and death, not the
damage to the organ.

So that when somebody is stabbed, as Mr. Goldman was, and/or cut and
stabbed, he is not immediately incapacitated, necessarily, depending
how rapidly the blood flows out, and also depending on whether an
artery is injured or a vein, because they have different rates of
blood flow, and depending on the size of the blood vessels and where
the blood vessel is. Blood vessels near the surface of the skin, the
wrists -- blood vessels to the wrists, for example, will bleed more
profusely than the same size blood vessels that may be in muscle which
is -- contracts; the blood collapses the blood vessel.

So, in stabbing and cutting injuries, as opposed to blunt force and
shootings, it's the hemorrhage and bleeding that causes gradual
incapacity, depending how quickly the blood flows, unconsciousness,
and then death. And those are all different periods of time.

Because even once we lose consciousness from bleeding, we may still --
the heart can still pump, and a person be technically alive for five
or ten minutes after loss of consciousness, 'cause the heart doesn't
need as much -- much oxygen, where the brain needs a great deal of
oxygen, and causing unconsciousness.

Q. Now, do you have an opinion with respect to the principal wound
that caused Ronald Goldman's death?

A. In my opinion -- and this was my opinion when I first reviewed the
autopsy findings, and in agreement with what I felt interpreted was
doctor -- the opinion of the person who did the autopsy, the main
source of bleeding and the main vessel that was injured that caused
Mr. Goldman's death was the cut jugular vein, the internal jugular
vein, which is right next to where the carotid artery.

We feel for a pulse in the neck; we feel the artery. Right next to it
is the internal jugular vein. And this was severed, cut through
completely, as found by Dr. Golden when he did the autopsy on Mr.
Goldman. And that's my opinion as to the principal reason for cause of
death.

Q. In the autopsy report, would you agree that that's the first wound
that's listed by Dr. Golden?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that have any significance of being the first wound?

A. Yes.

It is customary and traditional that whenever we do an autopsy -- we
find many abnormalities in the body, many abnormalities that are of
interest but not caused -- do not immediately cause death. And the
most important abnormality related to the death is customarily listed
first. And is -- is customarily listed first. And the listing of the
abnormalities are done in an order that roughly approximates how
significant it was in leading to the cause of death.

Q. Now, can you describe what kind of bleeding would result from the
wound to the neck, to Mr. Goldman?

A. As opposed to the wounds that Mrs. Simpson suffered with the
carotid arteries, were cut, which bleed very rapidly, these arteries
were not injured in Mr. Goldman. He suffered a severance, a cutting
through of the internal jugular vein. That's the main vein in the
forehead that brings blood back from the brain and from other parts of
the head, back to the heart. And that is a large blood vessel that
bleeds slowly. It bleeds profusely, but slowly, when it's severed.

Q. Would it bleed internally, externally, or a combination?

A. Because it's near the skin, it bleeds externally. Essentially,
blood vessels under the skin, near the wrists, and in the neck, will
bleed externally, outside of the body, because there's no compartment
for the blood to go into.

Q. And would it be blood from that wound that would or could account
for the blood on Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. In my opinion, the blood oozing from the cut left internal jugular
vein is the blood that continued down the shirt and down the blue
jeans into the shoe. Because blood, like water, flows by gravity. And
if Mr. Goldman is standing up, it will flow from the cut, the severed
jugular vein in the neck, downward to the shoes, so long as he is
standing, more or less upright.

And once he's on the ground, it will then flow horizontally and not
downward.

Q. And the speed with which the neck wound would bleed, did you say
whether or not that would be fast or slow, or how would it relate to
it in terms of timing?

A. It would be slow, especially compared to the carotid arteries,
which was the cause of Ms. Simpson's death, which is very rapid,
because the arteries are pumping blood under a very high head of
pressure. And the pressure in the jugular veins are very low. But
there's a lot of blood that comes back. All the blood that goes up to
the carotid arteries has to come back through the jugular veins.

Even though it's bigger and under less pressure, there's a lot of
blood coming back into the heart through the jugular vein.

Q. And that's called venous bleeding versus arterial bleeding,
correct?

A. Yes.

Arterial bleeding, what we refer to when we do a blood pressure --
when we have a blood pressure 120 over 80, we're measuring the head of
pressure in the arteries, and the areas are the arm -- in the arteries
of the arm; and venous pressure would be more about 3, 4, or 5,
compared to 120 over 80 in an artery.

Q. Now, there were three other major stab wounds to Mr. Goldman, were
there not?

A. Well, there were three other stab wounds that struck vital organs.

Mr. Goldman suffered about 22 to 30 stab wounds or cut wounds,
depending how each one is counted. Only four of the stab wounds
injured a vital organ; the others were on the surface of the skin and
the hands.

One of them cut the internal jugular vein; three, a vital organ. Two
of them entered the right chest and the right lung -- the lung is a
vital organ -- and one entered the left side, the left flank, and went
from back, forward through the aorta. The aorta is about an inch and a
half above the belly button, in that area where the aorta is.

And all of those are vital organs.

But only -- only the jugular vein bled.

Q. Now, would you agree that the testimony of Dr. Spitz, that all of
these injuries were inflicted in about a minute, depends upon his
conclusion that it was the wound to the aorta that was one of the
earliest -- were the first wounds?

A. That's my interpretation of Dr. Spitz's testimony in this
courthouse.

Q. And would you agree that, of necessity, if that was an earlier
wound, there would be massive bleeding in the peritoneal area?

A. Yes.

Yes, that would be my opinion, strongly my opinion. That is, if any of
us in this room were stabbed in the aorta or stabbed in the lung, we
would have massive internal bleeding very quickly, as long as our
heart was beating. And that massive bleeding would continue until the
heart became feeble and couldn't beat effectively. But we would wind
up with a -- two quarts of blood in the right lung area, one or two
quarts of lung -- of blood in the abdominal cavity, some blood in the
peritoneal space.

Q. Now, what was the finding of Dr. Golden with respect to blood in
the chest area or the lung area?

A. As I recall, there were -- in the right chest area, there was about
100 or 200 cc's -- that's about 6 or 7 ounces, at most -- of blood
around the left -- around the right lung.

And that is a very small amount for a stab wound to the lung.

That would indicate -- and I agree with Dr. Spitz's interpretation of
that -- that when the two stab wounds occurred in the lungs, in the
right lung, the heart was not beating effectively; it was --

In effect, the heart is just a pump; the only job is to pump blood
around the body. And normally, if a healthy person is stabbed in the
lung, within a few minutes, the whole lung cavity would fill with
blood.

This did not happen to Mr. Goldman. So this would reasonably be
interpreted, and I -- it's my opinion and Dr. Spitz's opinion, as I
read his testimony, that that indicated that he was -- Mr. Goldman was
not -- the heart was not functioning properly. He was near to death at
the time of those stab wounds.

Q. Is it accurate you can conclude from that, those two wounds to the
chest were probably toward the end of sequence of wounds?

A. That's right. Because the heart continues to beat, even after the
brain is dead, and after the body is not able to function, because it
doesn't need much oxygen.

And it would represent feeble, passive bleeding. That is, I say
passive bleeding. Even after death, every death, even after the heart
stops, if we stab a body when we do an autopsy, some blood flows out
that's already in the blood vessels. There's no pumping of new blood,
but there -- blood will flow as we do an autopsy.

In this instance, about 100, 200 cc's of blood could passively come
from the lungs if the lungs were stabbed as the person was dying, or
even after death.

Q. Now, would you agree that Dr. Spitz's opinion with respect to the
aorta wound was based on his concluding that there were approximately
two quarts of blood in the retroperitoneal space?

A. Yes, that's my interpretation, again, of his testimony.

Q. Now, let's take a look at exhibit -- I think it's 2025, Plaintiffs'
Exhibit.

And, Doctor, could you tell us if this is an accurate drawing of the
aorta and the peritoneum?

A. May I approach?

Thank you.

The drawing is diagramatic. It's a diagram; it's not an accurate
drawing.

It indicates the peritoneum, which is like a thin cellophane, a very
thin plastic. That's one layer or two layers thick, that lies over the
back of the abdominal cavity. And it covers the aorta. It's right
against -- there's no space between the peritoneum and the -- and the
aorta.

So that on this cross-section of the body that is shown in this
exhibit, the back bone is up by 12 o'clock; that's the spine bone in
the back. And the spine goes about halfway through the body.

And the green space -- it's not really green -- it's just the lining.
The lining is the -- lining the whole peritoneal cavity and all of the
intestines in this very thin membrane which lays directly on top of
the aorta, that lays against the spine.

See, the aorta itself touches the spine. It lays on the spine. And
it's covered in the front and sides by the peritoneum, so that if
something happens inside, the peritoneum cavity -- suppose somebody
gets appendicitis. The appendix lays in here. (Indicating.) They get
peritonitis that stays in this area; it doesn't go back because this
membrane prevents it from spreading to other part of the body.

Q. The membrane is like a sack?

A. I took this from lunch, if I may, a plastic bag. It's thin as
plastic (indicating to a plastic bag.)

It would be a plastic lining of everything. My hands might be the
intestines. And so the intestines lay within this sack. And the sack
is -- there's no space in it; there's no air in it. It just lays on
top of all of the organs: The liver, the spleen, the intestines.
They're all covered by this membrane.

And the back side, where my left index finger is, would be the aorta.
Again, the spine, if I might use this.

Q. Now, we'll use that a little more in a second.

But on the diagram, you see where there's an indication of a knife
going through the aorta and subsequently going through the peritoneum?

A. Yes.

Q. Is this misleading in a sense, that the size of the tear in the
peritoneum is smaller than the size of the aorta?

A. To that extent, it would be. That is, if the stab wound in the back
is a half an inch, as Dr. Golden described in the autopsy, and it's a
half an inch on the way out to the front, it would also be a half an
inch through this thin membrane, because the membrane is just -- is as
close to the aorta as this. (Indicating.) This plastic is around my
finger. Anything going through my finger will cause the same hole in
the plastic as it would in the skin of my finger, because it's right
on top of it.

Q. So?

A. So it would be the same size, a half an inch.

Q. Can you describe what would happen in a person who suffered a wound
such as this, where that wound was one of the first wounds that they
suffered?

In other words, they were still pumping blood and had a regular blood
pressure, maybe a higher blood pressure.

A. A stab wound of the abdominal aorta is very serious and will bleed
very profusely. Any of us here who suffered such a stab wound would
have a belly filled with blood. The abdominal cavity filled with blood
within a few minutes.

Q. What is it that's filling up?

A. What's filling up is from -- since the stab wound goes through the
peritoneum, the blood would come out from the aorta, through this
membrane. And whereas I would have -- the intestines would be in the
sack. As the blood filled the sack, the sack would get bigger and
bigger. The abdominal cavity -- the abdominal cavity can expand.

So, like somebody -- most common thing is an alcoholic who gets
ascites and gets a lot of fluid in this space. The abdominal cavity
can get very big because the peritoneal sack can expand a great deal.
And this is what happens when there's hemorrhage into the peritoneal
space. This sack just enlarges and enlarges and accommodates all of
the blood that accumulates.

Now, in this instance, there would be bleeding into the space and back
into the -- around the aorta, which is called the retroperitoneal
space. Behind the peritoneal here, another peritoneum. This is behind
the peritoneum. However, the retroperitoneal space isn't really a
space; it's filled with fat and soft tissues, so that the blood can
bleed backwards into that space, but that space kind of seals itself
off and causes what's called a pseudo aneurysm, because it's one of
those hemorrhages that are increasingly common as we get older and
have aortic aneurysms, and mini aortic aneurysms that occur to men in
about the 70s or so, and they'll rupture back here behind, and this
space will fill up. But it compresses the aorta and slows the bleeding
down, so that person can get to a hospital in timely fashion and get
operated upon.

But in this instance, there would be hemorrhage both into the back and
into the front at a very rapid rate if the heart was functioning
properly.

Q. You can resume your chair.

A. Thank you.

Q. How much blood did Dr. Golden find in the peritoneal sack?

A. About 100 -- again, about 100, maybe 200, he says, different cc's.
Four, five, six ounces of blood in the peritoneal cavity and
peritoneal sack, which is, again, a very small amount.

Q. And what does that tell you with respect to Mr. Goldman's state of
health at the time that that wound was inflicted?

A. At the time I examined the autopsy, and my testimony previously, my
opinion now is, I interpret the small amount of blood in the
peritoneal cavity the same way as the small amount of blood in the
right chest cavity: That all three of those wounds were inflicted at a
time when Mr. Goldman's heart was not beating effectively and not
functioning properly. Undoubtedly, when he was unconscious, and very
little bleeding occurred as a result.

If this were the first wound, I would expect quarts of blood to be in
the peritoneal cavity and in the retroperitoneal space, neither of
which was found by Dr. Golden at autopsy, nor testified to at any of
the previous testimonies by him or by Dr. Lakshmanan, his boss.

Q. Do you recall Dr. Spitz's testimony, that he concluded there was
two quarts of blood in the retroperitoneal space, based on a picture
of a piece of tissue?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Can we look at that, please.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 1977.

MR. BLASIER: 1977.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection to the question. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Dr. Spitz did not say there were two quarts in the retroperitoneal
cavity.

MR. BAKER: Yes, he did.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Incidentally, Dr. Baden, you actually examined
that piece of tissue, did you not?

A. Yes. But I use quart and liter to be the same -- essentially the
same.

They were quart and liter, about the same. Yes, I examined this. This
is one of the pieces of tissue that Dr. Golden removed at the time of
the autopsy and put into the formaldehyde bottle in which he preserved
tissues, which is customary.

And this -- a small piece -- this is -- there's an inch ruler. And
this is about a little more than an inch in either direction, I guess,
or two inches.

This is the inside of the aorta after it was opened up. The aorta is a
round tube. And look, what is done at the time of the autopsy is, the
tube is cut open from the front, in this instance. And this is the
back of the aorta.

In this area where there are lines is one area of stabbing, a cut
through the back of the aorta. And then there was -- would have been
another area -- it's not quite clear -- in the front. That's where the
knife came out. And each was measured by Dr. Golden to be about half
an inch.

Q. Now, the tissue there, what is the most approximate size of that
piece of tissue?

A. It's at most, about two inches in greatest dimension, and it's
about three-eighths of an inch thick or so.

Q. What did you say from observing the tissue itself, with respect to
the amount of blood in that tissue?

A. This tissue -- this is not a blood clot around it. It looks dark
around it. And I felt it. I looked at it, this is fatty tissue that's
been infiltrated with blood; that is, hemorrhages from the stab wound
has bled into the fatty tissue that's normally present in the back of
the aorta, because there's no space.

Those white areas on the diagram are not spaces; it's all solidly
packed with muscle tissue and with fatty tissue. And this is the
normal fatty tissue that has been infiltrated by the aorta bleeding
into it.

And this tissue is in the retroperitoneal space; that is, it's in the
tissue behind the peritoneal lining. And this is what happens whenever
there's a stab wound.

Dr. Golden, in the autopsy report, describes all of the stab wound
tracks in the lungs in the -- in the flank, in the jugular vein, the
stab wound tracks in Ms. Simpson, as having hemorrhage around the stab
wound track, because whenever there's a stab wound, blood vessels are
broken, and a little bit of blood always accompanies the passive
bleeding that goes along with a stab wound.

Q. So the appearance of this tissue is blood that you would expect to
find along a wound path, which is described that way in Dr. Golden's
autopsy, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, Dr. Golden, also in his autopsy, described various areas where
there was bleeding, did he not?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Well, he described various quantities of blood, such as in the
lungs and in the peritoneum?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he anywhere describe any massive amounts of blood in the
retroperitoneal space?

A. He did not.

Q. And can you conclude in figures, about how much blood is in the
retroperitoneal space from this small piece of tissue?

A. No. No. All you can conclude is that there was hemorrhage along the
stab wound track, which would be present. This would be present
whether there was bleeding into the retroperitoneal space or whether
it wasn't. And clearly, hemorrhages into the retroperitoneal space is
very obvious at an autopsy.

It sits there for the pathologist to see when he does or she does the
examination. And no retroperitoneal hemorrhage was described, except
for the hemorrhage that occurred along that wound tract that goes from
the back to the front, through the aorta. If you'll note that there,
the kidney and the pancreas, adrenal gland are all in that
retroperitoneal space. And there's no blood described about any of the
organs, except for a small amount next to the adrenal gland.

Q. Now, in the autopsy protocol, where does the description of this
wound to the aorta appear in terms of the sequence of wounds?

A. Oh, it's the first wound listed in the anatomic -- in the
diagnoses, after the autopsy is completed, is the cut wound of the
internal jugular vein.

May I look at the autopsy report?

Q. Sure.

A. In the next grouping of -- of wounds, number 2 are stab wounds of
the chest, abdomen and left thigh, which is not distinguished as to
which bled more or less. And it lists with resultant hemothorax.
That's the 200 cc's of blood around the right lung and hemoperitoneum
-- that's blood in the peritoneal cavity, also about 100 cc's. Those
are listed.

He does not say in this report, and this conclusion doesn't mention
the retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Q. Had there been massive bleeding in that area, would that be
something that should be in the report?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, assuming that, as listed in the autopsy report, the wound to
the neck of Mr. Goldman was one of the first or the earliest wounds
inflicted -- have you that in mind?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you have an opinion on how long it would take from the time,
given the rate at which that wound would bleed, between that wound and
the wound to the aorta?

A. Yes, I have an opinion.

Q. What is that opinion?

A. And I've expressed it previously.

My opinion is that, once this wound was inflicted in the neck, causing
complete transection of the internal jugular vein, Mr. Goldman was
able to stand up at the -- and to continue struggling for perhaps up
to five minutes, until he lost enough blood to lose -- to get dizzy
and to collapse because not enough oxygen and blood was going to the
brain.

This is supported by the path of the blood down the -- the left side
of the clothing to the shoe. It takes time. It would take that much
time for the oozing blood from the neck to reach the shoe that Mr.
Goldman was wearing.

At that point, at some point, about five minutes or perhaps a little
longer, he would collapse, would not be able to stand up. And at that
point, any blood coming out would go sideways, wouldn't go down
anymore, either from his neck or from the thigh.

He also had a stab wound in the left thigh, blood from that stab wound
could have contributed to the blood adherent to the blue jeans, but
again, as long as he was standing up, because it has -- blood goes
down by gravity.

At that point, when Mr. Goldman would collapse, he would then -- the
heart would still be beating. He'd still be alive. And if he were
stabbed at that point, there would be very little bleeding from the
lungs and from the aorta.

Q. So what is your estimate of the total time that it would take from
-- forgetting whether he was struggling all this time -- but how much
time would it take between the neck wound and the last wound, if
that's the wounded aorta?

A. My opinion would be that once the neck wound was incurred and he
started bleeding, he would be able to stand up for a few minutes, plus
or minus five minutes, maybe three minutes or four minutes, or five
minutes, and then he would collapse. And he would stay that way for
five or ten minutes longer, until the heart would stop beating
completely.

During that time period, if he were stabbed, then there would just be
a trickle of blood, as was present in the lungs or the aorta, as found
in Mr. Goldman's autopsy.

Q. So as best you can opine, what is the range of time that we're
talking about in terms of the time between the neck wound and the
aorta wound?

A. I think between the first neck wound and the final aortic wound, I
think the aorta -- my interpretation is that the wound to the flank
and aorta was the last wound, because it matches the final position he
was in, that he was found lying on his right side, with the left side
exposed upwards. And if somebody stabbed him in that position, the
stab wound would go from the left flank down into the -- to the aorta.
And the time interval between the jugular vein until the aorta would
not have bled anymore, is at least five or ten minutes, possibly a
little longer.

Q. Now, you're not saying that he was struggling all that time?

A. No, he's not struggling the whole time. He stopped struggling,
effectively, pretty quickly after a few minutes -- after a few minutes
of bleeding. But he can stand up until -- he did manage to stand up
until the blood from the jugular vein got down to his shoes, because
once he collapses, the blood no longer goes down to his shoes.

Q. So is it accurate that this interval you've given, this five- to
ten-minute, does not count how much time the perpetrator or
perpetrators might have been on the scene before the next wound was
inflicted, as well as after the wound to the aorta?

A. That's right. I can't factor into this with the information I have,
how long the perpetrator or perpetrators were there before the neck
wound was -- was inflicted. And I can't factor in how long the
perpetrator or perpetrators remained there after the stab wound in the
flank.

But somehow, there had to be a delay between the jugular vein cut and
the stab wound to the flank of at least five or ten minutes -- at
least five or ten minutes, so that when the aorta was stabbed, it did
not bleed very much.

Q. Okay.

Doctor, one final area:

When you examined Mr. Simpson on the 17th, a bunch of pictures were
taken of him, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me show you one of those pictures.

MR. BLASIER: Do you have the number?

MR. P. BAKER: 714.

MR. BLASIER: 714.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You observe the mark that appears where my finger
is?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you review the part of Dr. Spitz's testimony where he
described that as a fresh bruise?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me show you another picture.

Is that ticket picture taken at the same time?

A. Yes. I took that picture, yes.

Q. Does that show that mark a little better?

A. It shows the mark around this area, there was -- he had -- Mr.
Simpson has lots of marks on his body.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, at this time, I would ask that Mr. Simpson be
allowed to remove his shirt so Dr. Baden can examine his left arm.

THE COURT: You want him to disrobe?

MR. BLASIER: I want him to take his shirt off.

THE COURT: I am not going to have him disrobe.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Baden, did you look at Mr. Simpson's left arm
just the other day?

A. I again, yesterday, examined that area because of the testimony of
Dr. Spitz, yes.

Q. It's still there, isn't it?

A. Yeah. That same mark is still there. It's an old scar, and it's not
a fresh bruise.

Q. Was it a fresh bruise on June 17th of 1994?

A. No, it was not.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you. That's all I have.

Just a minute, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did he have any fresh bruises on his body
whatsoever on the 17th?

A. No, there were no bruises, other than -- the only injuries I saw
were on the hand.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have..

THE COURT: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, take a short break.

Bring them back in 10 minutes exactly.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: May we approach briefly?

THE COURT: Yes.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with reporter.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, it's my understanding that the plaintiffs may
be trying to play a part of the Geraldo show that Dr. Baden appeared
on a month or so ago.

I would object to that on the presumption of -- I'm not aware of any
inconsistencies or anything relevant on that.

MR. MEDVENE: They got into Dr. Spitz's testimony pretty heavily, and
if Dr. Baden is -- if he's inconsistent in particular areas with what
he said during his TV appearance, we would intend to play it.

MR. BLASIER: I would ask there be an offer of proof prior to doing
that.

THE COURT: I would like to see an offer of proof before you play it.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay. Well, we have to see what his testimony is.

THE COURT: Well, you will not put on anything from any TV show without
some offer of proof.

MR. MEDVENE: I understand, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MEDVENE:

Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Baden?

A. Good afternoon, Mr. Medvene.

Q. Is it fair to say you have the greatest respect for Dr. Spitz as a
forensic pathologist and the quality of work that he does?

A. Yeah. I think that's fair, yes.

Q. And his book, the Spitz and Fisher book, "Medical Legal
Investigation of Death," fair to say that's a standard reference work
in the field of pathology?

A. I think so, yes.

Q. And on occasion, if there's a need, you yourself use it?

A. I certainly -- I've read it through. I contributed some chapters in
the first two editions.

Q. Contributed a chapter on?

A. Drug abuse.

Q. Drug abuse.

Now, fair to say you regard Dr. Spitz as not only an excellent
pathologist, but an excellent teacher in the field of pathology?

A. Yes. Yes.

Q. And in Dr. Spitz's book, being familiar with it, you're aware that
he has a section on fingernails, fingernail marks, and a series of
pictures on fingernails; is that correct?

A. I believe there's such a description in the chapter on
strangulation.

Q. Now, is it correct, sir, that you've never published an article in
any recognized forensic pathology text on the subject of sharp force
injuries, including stab wounds? That's a correct statement, isn't it,
sir?

A. I've never written an article specifically about that. I think
there's a book that I edited that has a chapter on sharp force
injuries, an atlas of legal medicine.

Q. My question, sir, is, is it correct that you never published an
article on sharp force injuries including stab wounds in any
recognized forensic pathology text book?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: You may answer.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that a correct statement?

A. I think the text that I referred to is a Japanese text that
published in Japan and the United States, an atlas of legal medicine
that contains a chapter on the stab wounds, that was published back in
the 1960's.

But I haven't written specific articles about stab wounds.

Q. Is it fair to say you've not published a chapter in any recognized
forensic pathology text book on the subject of blunt force trauma; is
that correct?

A. The same -- the same caveat that is in this atlas of legal
medicine, there's a chapter on blunt and force trauma, too, but I
haven't specifically written articles about it for publication in
medical journals.

Q. You've not published or written a chapter in any recognized
forensic pathology text on the subject of fingernails and how you
identify fingernail markings; isn't that true?

A. That's true.

Q. You haven't published -- strike that.

Now, is it correct, sir, that you were -- you made some reference
several times in your testimony to your position as a medical examiner
of New York City?

A. I was in that office from 1960 part-time, '65 full-time, till 1985,
yes.

Q. And you were terminated or fired at that time?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. May we approach?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that correct, sir?

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with reporter:)

MR. BLASIER: He knows there was a political dispute with Mayor Koch.
Now that he asked the question, I think I better withdraw my objection
because I'm going to go into it, too.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Were you terminated, sir, from your job as medical
examiner in New York City in approximately 1985, sir?

A. That's not true.

I can explain to you what happened, but that's not true, as you say
it.

Q. Were you terminated at that time, sir?

A. No, absolutely not.

Q. You left the job at that time?

A. In 1985 I left --

Q. Excuse me, sir.

My question is did you leave your job as medical examiner of New York
City in 1985?

A. I left it to take a better job, yes, in 1985.

Q. You were asked to leave, were you not, sir?

A. No, absolutely not true.

Q. You mentioned work with the state police.

Is that work about 20 hours a week, sir, roughly?

A. It's a half-time job, but it's 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.

Q. Is it on average about 20 hours a week, sir?

A. I have to put in at least 20 hours a week, but it permits me to do
private practice. That was the arrangement I made with the state, yes.

Q. And your testimony here today has nothing to do with that job, it's
completely in your private capacity as a retained consultant; is that
right?

A. That's true, yes. Absolutely.

Q. Fair to say that you make four plus times as much money working as
a consultant and testifying as you do in that other job?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is that a correct statement?

A. I make appreciably more income in my private practice of forensic
pathology than with my pay from the New York State Police. That's
true, yes.

Q. Now, you've told us you were paid over $100,000 in connection with
your function in this case, and that was up through what time, sir?

A. Up from June of '94 until the present time, that encompasses two
and a half years or so.

Q. Now, since the criminal trial was over, have you been paid
anything?

A. No.

Q. Have you billed anything?

A. No.

Q. Is it your intention to work for free, to continue on the case?

A. No, I intend to submit a bill.

Q. And how many hours have you spent, sir?

A. I've spent a lot of hours, but I'm not billing for the hours that I
was in New York City.

Q. Do you treat this case because of the high profile nature of it, in
terms of billing practices, somewhat differently than you handle your
other cases, sir?

A. No, I am billing less in this matter because of the inability of
the defendant to pay money.

Q. Now --

A. As happens not infrequently in my private practice.

Q. Now, you spent, in addition to your 70 trips to Los Angeles --

A. No, 70 days.

Q. Excuse me. 70 days in Los Angeles. Your expenses were paid, I take
it?

A. Yes.

Q. And in addition to that time, you spent some several hundred hours
talking to Mr. Shapiro by phone; is that correct, in terms of
discussing the case in its various details?

A. I spent several hundred hours reviewing the case and looking at
photographs and talking to Mr. Shapiro, but -- and being on the
telephone and consulting on the matter, but I did not bill for the
time that I was able to function from my office in New York.

Q. You had -- no, I wasn't asking about billing right now, I was
asking you if it isn't true, sir, that in addition to the time here,
you spent several hundred hours talking to Mr. Shapiro about various
aspects of the case?

A. I think several hundred hours should include time spent in New York
City. I don't think I spent several hundred hours on the phone with
Mr. Shapiro.

I did spend a lot of time talking on the phone. I don't think that
much, but I did spend more than that time reviewing records, reviewing
testimony, reviewing photographs and the discussions with Mr. Shapiro.

Q. I read you, sir, from page 41021 of the criminal trial transcript,
and I will start at line 15 when Mr. Blasier has it.

MR. BLASIER: 4102 --

MR. MEDVENE: I can read the whole section if counsel wants, but I
intend now to read you the part about the hours on the phone.

MR. BLASIER: Starting with which line?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry, which line?

MR. MEDVENE: 15.

MR. BLASIER: I think you need to read the whole answer and the
question. I have no objection to that.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Well, I think this is the portion -- it's a long
answer. I'd suggest that Mr. Blasier read it all. I'm going to read
the part about the hours.

MR. BLASIER: No, I object to him reading part of an answer. He's got
to read the whole thing and a question.

MR. MEDVENE: I'll read the whole thing if, Your Honor, wants me to. I
was just --

THE COURT: You're the one that volunteered to read it. You want to
read it, you read it.

MR. MEDVENE: I shouldn't have volunteered.

41020, and I will read the whole thing.

(Reading:) Q. Were you able to -- Did

you follow and listen to all of his

testimony in this case? Yes, I did.

MR. MEDVENE: This is at line 11.

(Reading:)

In addition to those times, what

other time have you spent generally in

preparing for your evaluation and

opinions in this case. Well, I spent time with Dr. Lee

arriving in from Los Angeles immediately

the -- the next morning examined

Mr. Simpson for any forensic evidence,

any injuries, any medical or scientific

findings that might aid in the

evaluation of what happened and how it

happened. I did spend time in the coroner's

office with Dr. Lakshmanan reviewing

records and photographs. I did spend time in Los Angeles

Police Department laboratory with Dr.

Kestler and others reviewing evidence. I did make a few trips in, and

examinations of the crime scene at the

Bundy location and at evaluation and

examination at Mr. Simpson's home in

Rockingham. I did review evidence that was

sent to Albany Medical Center for review

in February of this year. Much of the

evidence was made available to the

forensic scientists for the defense for

review. I did visit the crime laboratory

in March of '95 in Los Angeles to review

additional materials. And in addition to that, I

participated in many, many conferences

in Los Angeles with you -- (Referring to Mr. Shapiro.)

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. --- with you and

Mr. Cochran and associates in reviewing

and going over and trying to interpret

the medical and scientific evidence that

I would have knowledge of and

interpreted in the light of the

questions that lawyers have and other

information that was being gathered and

developed by Dr. Lee and others.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And now the portion I wanted to read you. At line
15.

(Reading:) And I spent hundreds of hours on

the telephone with you from New York

City over the time reviewing evidence

and materials.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Does that refresh you, sir, that in addition to
the 70 days in Los Angeles, and what you described as doing, you spent
hundreds of hours with Mr. Shapiro on the telephone going over various
aspects and strategies to develop in the case?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That's not what it says. Is says hundreds of
hours on the phone and reviewing evidence and materials.

THE COURT: Answer the question.

A. Yeah. I --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Excuse me, sir. Could you -- and it yes or no,
just yes or no, sir, if you could.

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you, sir.

A. To speaking to Mr. Shapiro and looking at evidence.

Q. Okay, sir.

Now, is that your answer, sir?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you've appeared on TV a number of times as an advocate or
spokesman for Mr. Simpson, have you not?

A. No, I haven't.

Q. Well, you've appeared on TV and put forward certain material as to
his defense; isn't that true?

A. No. I appeared -- may I answer the question, Mr. Medvene?

Q. No. If you say no, that's fine, sir.

A. No.

Q. Is it correct that you have appeared on TV a number of times?

A. Yes.

Q. And you've given press conferences yourself, and with Dr. Lee,
about various aspects of this case; is that correct, sir?

A. The only press conference that I can remember was at Albany Medical
Center when Dr. Lee and I did examine evidence at Albany Medical
Center, and it was a press conference just to say that we examined the
evidence, not to discuss any aspect of the evidence, and that was
because the director --

Q. Excuse me.

A. -- director of Albany Medical Center wished us to do that. It
didn't discuss the evidence, just said yes, we did it.

Q. Well, in addition to that time when you appeared, you appeared a
number of times on TV after you first came to Los Angeles, did you
not?

A. In the first week before we were allowed to look at the evidence.

Q. My question --

A. I did appear on television, but that was before we saw the
evidence, any evidence. I wasn't an advocate.

Q. Well, when you say before you saw any evidence, you appeared on
programs after you examined Mr. Simpson, did you not, yes or no?

MR. BLASIER: I'm going to object to the relevance of any of this.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or --

A. You're correct. I examined Mr. Simpson on the 17th of June, and I
think I did appear in some television programs up until June 23 or
something like that.

Q. And you also were at the coroner's office and examined things at
the coroner's office and then appeared on TV; isn't that correct, sir?

A. I believe we were at the coroner's office around June 23. Once I
examined things at the coroner's office I did not -- there may have
been one program that was in the works, but I did not otherwise appear
on television, as far as I remember.

Q. You appeared on television as recently as a month ago, after Dr.
Spitz testified, to give some contrary version on the Rivera show in
November this year?

Could you answer that yes or no, sir.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I'm going to object.

And --

THE COURT: You may answer that yes or no.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you answer it yes or no.

A. No. No, as you asked the question that's not true.

Q. But did you appear on November 11 on the Rivera show, and discuss
this very case and the facts of this very case; yes or no, sir, just
yes or no?

A. The date is what I'm -- I'll adopt the date. I did appear on the
Rivera show.

Q. November 11. Sir, my question --

A. I'll adopt your date. I mean I'm not sure about the date. I'll
adopt what you say.

I did appear on the Rivera show.

Q. Excuse me, sir.

My question is did you appear on November 11, or some date in
November, on Rivera Live along with Mr. Simpson's criminal counsel,
Mr. Dershowitz, and others, and discuss the facts of this case?

Could you answer yes or no.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: You may answer?

A. You --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes or no.

A. The way you say it is no.

You're not getting it right, no.

Q. Sir, let's see if I can get it right.

A. Okay.

Q. Was it the day Mr. -- while Dr. Spitz was testifying, you got on
TV, on the Rivera show?

A. Not Rivera Live -- Rivera Live.

Q. Oh, that's what I mixed --

A. That's one of the things you missed.

Q. It's a different show?

A. It's a different show. It's the evening show where he talks about
this case.

Q. At the evening show where he talks about this case, and you knew he
talked about this case, and you got on that show with Mr. Dershowitz
and talked about this case; is that correct, sir, yes or no?

Just yes or no.

A. Yes, as you say it.

Q. Thank you.

A. That wasn't the purpose of my appearance, but that's what happened,
yes.

Q. And on -- And that was the date when actually Dr. Spitz, to your
knowledge, had testified; is that correct, sir?

A. As far as I can remember, the first day he testified, yes, that
night.

Q. You didn't get back on the second day he testified?

A. It was one day to publicize an HBO special. That's what I was on
for.

MR. MEDVENE: Move to strike. I didn't ask that.

THE COURT: Stricken.

A. Sorry.

Q. Now, you gave a bunch of opinions today, Dr. Baden, and you've been
doing this long enough to know that there are opinions that are --
that have a certain percentage of probabilities and there are opinions
that are only possibilities; isn't that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it true there's certain magic words that people that testify
a lot use, and one of them is "consistent with," is that true?

MR. BLASIER: I'll object to the characterization of the magic word.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) One of the words you used was "consistent with"?

A. I don't think I used the word consistent with in my testimony.

That's one form of opinion that can be held, consistent with.

I try in my -- all my testimony to be beyond a reasonable medical
certainty.

Q. You're telling us -- are you telling this jury -- well, let me
withdraw that.

What percentage is -- what word did you use, beyond a reasonable
degree of medical certainty, or with reasonable medical certainty, or
would you use them interchangeably?

A. I would use them interchangeably.

Q. You said, in the past, that's up in the 95 percent category, didn't
you?

A. Or more.

Q. Or more than 95 percent?

A. Yes.

Q. Right?

A. Yes, Mr. Medvene.

Q. Are you telling this jury, with a reasonable degree of medical
certainty, more than 95 percent, that it's your opinion there were two
assailants that slaughtered Ms. Brown and Ron Goldman; is that what
you're saying, yes or no, sir?

A. That opinion was not to a reasonable degree of -- reasonable degree
of medical certainty, it was more likely than not.

Q. Do you remember telling this jury that, unlike other opinions, when
you threw out this two assailants, that it was more likely than not,
and not beyond a reasonable degree of medical certainty?

Did you tell that to this jury, sir, yes or no, sir?

A. I answered the question that Mr. Blasier asked.

Q. But you knew as a witness -- how many times have you testified?

A. Many hundreds of times.

Q. And you knew when you answered that question that you were
conveying or attempting to convey an impression to this jury that
wasn't fair, it was --

A. No, Mr. Medvene.

Q. -- is that correct, sir?

A. No, it's not correct.

If you can read back to me the question that Blasier asked, I could --
I answered the question as Mr. Blasier asked it.

Q. Now, you went over --

A. If you can pull it back and ask it I can relate to it directly.

Q. You went over with Mr. Blasier, did you not, his questions before
he asked them to you?

A. No, no. I had not heard that question.

We haven't even -- hadn't even discussed that in any degree. I didn't
know what kinds of questions he was going to ask.

Q. You didn't go over anything you were going to say?

A. Oh, in general terms, but I didn't know the questions. I tried to
listen --

Q. You went --

A. -- to the way the questions are asked, and I try to answer them
accordingly.

Q. You went over in general terms --

A. We discussed the matter.

Q. Well, when you say you went over in general terms, it's not too
complicated a question, one assailant or more than one assailant.

Now, you went over that in general terms with Mr. Blasier, didn't you?

A. Very general terms.

Q. Well, when you say very general, I can get a hold of that, is it
one assailant or two; did you talk about that?

I mean it's not a matter of general terms. You knew that was going to
be asked, didn't you?

A. I didn't know it was going to be asked, no.

Q. Well, you said you talked about it in general terms?

A. Lots of things we talked about that Mr. Blasier didn't ask me
about.

Q. I'm not talking about what he didn't ask you about. I'm talking
about what he did ask you about.

And you told us --

A. I didn't know he would ask that question.

Q. Excuse me, sir.

You told us a few moments ago you talked with Mr. Blasier in general
terms. I don't want to misstate it. If you didn't say it, tell me you
didn't say it.

Didn't you just tell this jury that you spoke to Mr. Blasier in
general terms about the area, was there one assailant or two
assailants?

A. Yes, I think in very general terms.

Q. And you had spoken about it months before with Mr. Shapiro, had you
not?

A. I don't recall that. That may be. If you could refresh -- I don't
remember being asked that question at the first trial.

Q. Let's go back to Mr. Blasier.

In terms of what you're conveying and what impression you're conveying
to this jury, you would agree that when you testified that if you
testified it was your opinion it was two assailants, that was
misleading in the sense that you weren't giving that opinion to a
reasonable medical certainty, which is really your area, isn't it, Dr.
Baden?

A. No. I can answer things more likely than not.

I can't understand how these two people could have been murdered and
not yell out --

Q. Excuse me?

A. -- unless there were two people there.

Q. Dr. Baden --

A. That's what I'm --

Q. Dr. Baden, there's no question pending.

A. I can't quantitate that.

Q. Now, the facts, as you see them, and I won't go through them, but
the one set of the bloody Bruno Magli shoe prints leading away from
the scene, the facts are certainly consistent, are they not, Dr.
Baden, with there being one assailant?

You would say that, wouldn't you? Yes or no, sir, not a speech, just
yes or no.

A. No, I find it difficult to put it together with a single assailant.

Q. Now, the only set of bloody shoe prints leaving the scene are size
-- the evidence is they're size 12 Bruno Magli shoe prints, Dr. Baden.

Now --

A. No, I don't agree with that. There were other shoe prints that Dr.
Lee referred to.

Q. No, he did not refer to other shoe prints, Dr. Baden, and I move to
strike that answer, Your Honor.

THE COURT: That's his answer.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) If Dr. Lee withdrew that testimony, and the jury
will get to see it, maybe next week if he's now withdrawn that
testimony, after the FBI agent have now testified, and all we have,
Dr. Baden, is one set of bloody shoe prints going west, as far as your
testimony is concerned, and what you know, isn't the scene consistent
with one assailant?

MR. BLASIER: I object to the part of that about Dr. Lee's testimony.
It misstates the evidence.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Just assume it.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, improper hypothetical.

THE COURT: Why don't you approach the bench a minute.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with reporter:)

THE COURT: Okay, what about it?

MR. MEDVENE: What about what?

MR. BLASIER: Dr. Lee hasn't changed his testimony.

MR. MEDVENE: Dr. Lee's testimony is that there was one set of bloody
shoe prints. He did not identify -- he did not identify one other
thing as a shoe print and --

MR. BAKER: That's not true.

THE COURT: There's the transcript.

MR. BLASIER: There's evidence consistent --

THE COURT: Just a minute. Show me in the transcript.

MR. BAKER: Judge --

THE COURT: Just a minute. I want to see the transcript.

MR. PETROCELLI: Would you like me to find it?

THE COURT: I'm waiting.

MR. MEDVENE: We'll have to find it, Your Honor, but my memory is he
said --

THE COURT: Excuse me. There's an objection and there's a contention by
the objecting party that that was not the evidence.

MR. MEDVENE: I understand, sir.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's going to take too long, Your Honor. It's 4:30.

THE COURT: There is no too long.

MR. MEDVENE: We do know there --

(Counsel reads transcript.)

MR. PETROCELLI: There's one reference, Your Honor. I think there are
other references in there.

(Court reviews transcript.)

THE COURT: Okay. Page 26 is not very conclusive.

MR. MEDVENE: Well, we will look in at the evening break, Your Honor,
but I'll represent to you --

THE COURT: I don't need a representation. I want to see it. This is a
crucial point, and this is a crucial objection. I'm not going to go on
representations.

MR. MEDVENE: We'll find it for you late this afternoon.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, see you tomorrow at 8:30. Don't talk
about the case, don't form or express any opinions, don't watch
anything on TV about this case. See you in the morning.

Do a little research.

(At 4:33 P.M. a recess was taken until Tuesday, December 17, 1996 at
8:30 A.M.)

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1996
8:45 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: All right. We have the plaintiffs' objection to designation
of Dr. Lee's video testimony, which is extensive. And I don't have a
transcript, so I don't know what you're talking about.

MR. BAKER: So far, they've objected to everything you've looked at. I
just got this this morning. They've objected to everything that --
every question that was asked and every answer that was given, except
Mr. Medvene's objections. So I don't know why they were complaining
yesterday they needed more time. They just objected to everything.

MR. PETROCELLI: Here you go.

(Mr. Petrocelli hands transcript of Dr. Henry Lee's deposition to the
Court.)

(Pause for the Court to review transcript.)

THE COURT: Well, it would appear it's going to take some time to go
through this.

So what witnesses do you have here today?

MR. BAKER: We've got Detective Spangler, who's a very short witness.

We've got Mulldorfer, who's also a police detective, a very short
witness.

We've got John Gerdes. He's one of our experts.

Your Honor, this can't be construed --

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm trying to get organized.

MR. BAKER: All right.

THE COURT: What is your time estimate on these witnesses today?

MR. BLASIER: Dr. Gerdes will be an hour or two. We'll probably be
finished with our witnesses in the morning.

MR. LEONARD: The two police witnesses, for direct, are 10 or 15
minutes.

MR. P. BAKER: I also planned on reading some depositions, but we can
move it.

THE COURT: So your whole testimony presentation, you think, is going
to be about half a day?

MR. BAKER: Yes, of live testimony.

MR. LEONARD: Or less.

THE COURT: Okay. We'll do this in the afternoon.

MR. LEONARD: Excellent.

THE COURT: Bring the jury in.

(Pause in proceedings.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Good morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record I'd like to move in Exhibits 537, 538,
and 539.

Thank you.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 537 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 538 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 539 was
received in evidence.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, we'd like to move in the copy of the logbook
that got identified, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE COURT: Received.

THE CLERK: I need a number.

MR. LEONARD: It was -- at the time, it was next --

MR. BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: No. It was 11-something.

THE COURT: 1177.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 1177 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

THE CLERK: Correct.

THE COURT: See, I'm paying attention.

MR. LEONARD: Good morning.

We call Detective Kelly Mulldorfer.

KELLY MULLDORFER, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Kelly Mulldorfer. That's K-e-l-l-y, M-u-l-l-d-o-r-f-e-r.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Good morning, Detective Mulldorfer?

A. Morning.

Q. Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury and the Court,
what your present occupation is?

A. I'm a detective for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Q. And where are you presently assigned?

A. I'm currently assigned to the legal affairs division.

Q. How long have you been a detective with the Los Angeles Police
Department?

A. About three years.

Q. How long have you been a Los Angeles police officer?

A. Oh I've been on the department for 16 years.

Q. Now, directing your attention to July of 1994, where were you
assigned at that time?

A. I was assigned to the police commission, investigation division,
enforcement section.

Q. Just tell us in general terms, what that division does, or what
that department does.

A. Well, the police commission issues permits for various businesses
in the City of Los Angeles and we investigate -- we investigate those
companies or businesses that hold police commission permits, which
would include official police car garages and security guard
companies, and things like that.

Q. Well, can you explain what is an official police garage, Detective
Mulldorfer?

A. An official police garage is the garage that has the contract with
the city to do all of our towing for our vehicles when we have them
towed or stored for one reason or another.

Q. That would include vehicles impounded for investigatory purposes,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in July of 1994, were you assigned to investigate security
issues surrounding the white Ford Bronco owned by Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And in particular, were you -- were you assigned to investigate an
alleged break-in to the vehicle, and some theft of some items from the
vehicle?

A. Yes, I was assigned to investigate a theft --

Q. Okay.

A. -- from the vehicle.

Q. And I take it that part of your assignment was to make sure that --
that the security procedures that were in effect at this garage that
the Bronco was being held at were adequate; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

By the way, what is the name of the garage?

A. Viertels tow.

Q. Where is that located?

A. It's located on Temple Street.

You know, I don't have the exact address. I have it with me, if you
need the exact address.

Q. No. Just tell us in general terms what part of Los Angeles that's
in, if you know.

A. Well it's in the Rampart area on Temple Street.

Q. Okay.

And, of course, Viertesls is what's called an OPG, or official police
garage?

A. Yes.

Q. Who gave you this assignment, by the way?

A. My commanding officer.

Q. And what were you told your assignment was?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay.

MR. LEONARD: It's to explain the subsequent conduct, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was given the investigation to -- I was told to investigate the
theft, and to look and see if Viertesls had violated any of the rules
that they are required to abide by.

Q. Okay.

And in particular, what were you told about the theft?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay.

MR. LEONARD: Same.

THE COURT: That's sustained.

MR. LEONARD: It explains her subsequent conduct, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: Given the assignment, Your Honor --

MR. LEONARD: The breadth of the investigation, I think, is relevant.

May we approach?

THE COURT: No.

MR. LEONARD: It's one question.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, this is another instance where
parties want to get in some hearsay to explain another purpose, or in
this case, conduct. When we let you hear that, that's not being
received to show that a theft occurred or anything in particular
happened in this particular conversation or report that this officer
received.

It's only to explain what she did subsequent to that, so you can't
consider it as proof of any theft or anything like that.

Everybody understand that?

JURORS: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: As briefly as possible, can you explain in some detail
what you were told about the theft?

A. Well, actually, we --

Q. The alleged theft.

A. Okay.

We received a letter from Mr. Viertels, and I was given a copy of the
letter that outlined the -- the circumstances under which one of their
tow-truck drivers was let go. And that included the allegation of a
theft from that particular vehicle.

Q. That the tow-truck driver had gone into the vehicle and taken
something out of it?

A. Yes.

Q. What were the items?

A. Some type of papers, credit-card receipts, cleaning receipts, or
something like that.

Q. Now, were any limitations placed on you in your investigation?

A. I don't understand what you mean.

Q. Well, were you simply going to investigate this particular theft,
or did you have in mind making sure that no other thefts had occurred,
or that there hadn't been any other illegal entries or unauthorized
entries? Let me put it that way.

I take it you weren't limiting yourselves once you got this.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Why don't you ask her the scope of her assignment?

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) I take it you weren't limiting yourself in your
investigation; is that right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague. She already said what her assignment
was, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Were you interested, Detective Mulldorfer, in
determining whether or not there had been any other unauthorized
entries of any kind?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: It explains her subsequent conduct. I can --

THE COURT: You could ask her about this vehicle.

MR. LEONARD: I intend to.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) As part of the investigation you undertook, you
inspected the Bronco; is that right?

A. I don't know if "inspected" would be the right word.

I went and looked for the items inside the vehicle.

Q. Well, you used the word "inspect" when you were asked the same
question at the criminal trial. Do you remember that?

A. Well, if it's in the transcript, then I must have said it, so I'll
stand by that.

Q. So you did an inspection?

A. Okay. I -- that's --

MR. GELBLUM: Can we get a page and line number?

THE COURT: No. Because it hasn't been used.

MR. GELBLUM: He's representing some --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you inspect the Bronco?

A. I looked in the Bronco. Yes, I did.

Q. It was your intention, when you went there, to inspect the Bronco,
correct?

A. It was my intention to go and look for the paperwork that was
allegedly missing.

Q. And in the course of -- of your investigation, and your inspection
of the Bronco, tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury which
portions of the Bronco that you looked into or looked around.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Misstates the testimony. She said she did not
inspect it; she looked for the receipts.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Okay.

I looked in the side-door pockets of the Bronco. I believe we looked
in the console, in between the seats, and we may have looked in the
glove box.

I don't have any independent recollection of that.

Q. You -- you looked in the side-door panels; you looked in the
console and around the console I assume, correct?

A. What do you mean, "around?"

Q. Well, you wanted to make sure that -- that if you were looking for
the credit slips -- correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You wanted to make sure you looked everywhere that the credit slips
could be, correct?

A. Well, I -- I looked in -- I can only tell you where I did look.
That was in the side-door pockets. We lifted up the -- or I think it
was Bob Jones that may have lifted up the console lid. We looked in
there and the other door pocket. And that was it.

Q. Okay. So you -- you did look around the console; is that correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection misstates the testimony. Asked and answered.

A. Well, I don't --

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. (Continuing.) I don't quite understand what you're getting at. If
you're asking me did I look down between the seats, press them apart,
look down in there --

Q. Yeah.

A. No, I didn't. No, I did not.

Q. But you did open the console; is that right?

MR. GELBLUM: Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It's my recollection that Bob Jones opened the console.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You were present when he did that?

A. Sure.

Q. You wanted to see what's in there?

A. Yes. I was standing next to him.

Q. You didn't have your eyes closed?

A. No, sir.

Q. You didn't look away, right?

A. This was three years ago. I don't remember if I looked away. I was
there when he opened it. I glanced, overlooked, and --

Q. By the way, do you wear glasses?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Were you wearing your glasses?

A. No.

Q. What do you wear glasses for?

A. To read small print.

Q. I want to call your attention to the testimony at the criminal
trial.

It's 38267, line 24.

A. Okay.

Q. Now, Ms. Mulldorfer -- Detective Mulldorfer, did there come a time
when you -- you, yourself, inspected the Bronco?

Answer: "Yes."

Does that refresh your recollection as to whether or not you inspected
the Bronco, or that you used that term at the criminal trial?

A. It sounds like he used the word and I said yes. And if that's my
testimony, then -- then I must have interpreted his question to mean
did I look in the vehicle.

Q. Did you -- if you want to look the at transcript?

A. Sure, yes. I'd like to. Thank you.

(Witness perusing criminal trial transcript.)

I'm sorry. Where is it on here?

Q. I'm sorry.

A. Well, okay.

He used that word, and it was my interpretation that he meant to look
in the vehicle. It's not a word that I possibly would have chosen to
describe my activities, but. . .

Q. Did you attempt at any point to correct Mr. Scheck when he asked
you that question?

A. No.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. Did you say to him, that's your interpretation, but I didn't do
that?

A. No. I think the record will reflect that I didn't say that, no.

Q. Okay.

Now, was there any problem with the lighting in the vehicle that day?

In other words, were you able to see adequately for your purposes?

A. Well, I don't remember that -- I don't believe I had to use a
flashlight or anything. I don't really have any specific recollection
about the lighting.

Q. Is there any reason for you to believe that you would have
undertaken your investigation and inspection without adequate
lighting, Detective Mulldorfer --

A. Well, if there had --

Q. -- since you don't recollect?

A. If there hadn't been adequate lighting, I would have asked for a
flashlight.

Q. So the lighting was adequate, correct, for you to do your
inspection?

A. For my purposes, yes.

Q. Okay.

And again, you weren't wearing your glasses. Did that -- do you think
that impaired your ability to see at all?

A. Well, it would have if I needed to look at a receipt.

And to be honest with you, I don't know that I wasn't wearing my
glasses. I don't remember that. I may or may not have been. But the
fact that it would have, had -- if I had to see something in detail,
but certainly I think I would have been able to -- able to spot a
paper receipt. I possibly would have put my glasses on to read the
receipt.

Q. You wouldn't have any trouble, for instance, spotting an object
maybe that big from, like, inside the car?

The receipt would have been about that big, right? (Indicating.)

A. About that big.

Q. You wouldn't have any problems seeing the object?

A. No.

Q. You might have had problems seeing the small print, the print on
the object, without your glasses?

A. Yes.

Q. Having talked about this, now, for a couple of minutes, is your
memory refreshed at all as to whether or not you were wearing your
glasses?

A. No.

Q. Now, when you went into the Bronco, what --

What date was that, by the way?

A. I don't know what date that was.

Q. Let me ask you something:

One of the reasons that you were investigating was to make sure that
Viertels had the proper paperwork or documentation of when people went
in and out of the Bronco, correct?

A. Yes, that became an issue in the investigation.

Q. And you determined rather early on that they didn't have -- they
did not keep a log, as they were supposed to, of individuals who came
in and out of the Bronco; isn't that correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer.

A. At the time, I believe the requirements were that they -- they keep
a log of people who go in and remove things from the vehicle.

And they didn't have that in place at this time.

Q. They didn't have any records of -- of any kind indicating who went
in and out of the vehicle; isn't that right?

A. No, they -- but they're not required to indicate who -- at that
time, they were not required to indicate anyone who had gone in and
looked in the vehicle, or if they didn't remove anything from the
vehicle -- remove any property from the vehicle. They were not
required to log that in.

Q. But if -- if anything was removed from the vehicle, that should
have been lodged, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Including biological material, correct?

A. You know, I'd have to look at OPG rules. But I don't think that we
would normally sustain a violation of that section if we went in there
to remove biological evidence.

Q. By the way, this requirement that a log be kept of people who go in
and remove items, that would include police officers and criminalists,
correct?

A. Again, I'd have to read the section again on that.

I don't -- it's my recollection that it talks about removing property
for safekeeping or things like that. But on an evidentiary stored
vehicle, I don't believe they were required to note what we took out
of the vehicle, because a lot of times, we may not want that.

I mean, it's part of a criminal investigation. I don't think the OPG
had any reason to know what we would remove in terms of evidence.

Q. Now, this vehicle was being held under what was called special care
requirements or provisions; is that right?

A. It was in their evidentiary hold area, yes.

Q. You're familiar with the term "special care," right?

A. It's on the vehicle impound sheet.

Q. Explain what that is to the jury.

A. Special care is the -- I believe it's a box on our vehicle report
form that lets the garage know that it's to be kept in a certain area,
the evidentiary hold area, which is an area that's cordoned off
inside; it's covered, so that the elements can't get to the vehicle.

Usually, it's used with vehicles that we're holding for some type of
evidence, or prints, or part of a criminal investigation.

Q. And as part of the requirements for special care, isn't it true
that -- that there should -- that's one of the reasons there should be
a log of people who go in and out of the vehicle; isn't that right,
that when a vehicle is held under special care provisions; isn't that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And again, there was no log for this vehicle, correct?

A. No, there wasn't.

Q. And there wasn't a log created until after you had done your
investigation, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. By the way, you didn't indicate anywhere in writing when you went
in and out of the vehicle; isn't that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. When you went into that vehicle, did you see blood anywhere?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence that she went
into the vehicle.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You did go into the vehicle. You reached in or
looked into the vehicle?

A. I leaned in, yes. Um-hum.

Q. When you were looking at the console, did you see blood there?

A. I -- I don't remember if I did or I didn't.

Q. Okay.

I'd like to show you a photograph.

See if this refreshes your recollection.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 1420.

(Exhibit No.1420 is displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. This was a photograph taken on August 10.

By the way, when -- when -- before we start, when did you go -- when
did you go over and inspect the vehicle, approximately?

A. It was shortly after I got the investigation on July 13, I believe.
I would say within a week, probably.

Q. Do you remember yesterday we had a chat out in the hallway, and I
showed you something in your report which indicated that in your
report, you had indicated as of 7/18 you had already been into the
vehicle?

Do you remember that?

A. I remember the conversation. I don't think there was an indication
in any report when I went in there.

Q. Do you remember your report says that you, on your -- it was your
first visit with Mr. Jones, that you went into the vehicle, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And your second visit with Mr. Jones was on the
18th of July, correct?

You can look at your report.

A. I believe that's what my report said.

Q. So it would have been before July 18 that you went into the Bronco?

A. I think that would probably be fair to say.

Q. Okay.

Take a look at that photograph. I want you to concentrate, in
particular, on the sections of the console that you can see.

A. Okay.

(Witness perusing photograph.)

MR. LEONARD: Right in here.

(Indicating to photo displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you see any blood there?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I'm going to object to the use of this unless
we have some foundation where it was when it was taken.

MR. LEONARD: We'll prove it up. We have a witness who will prove it
up.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

A. I can't see anything from the photograph, no.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Does that -- does that refresh your recollection
in any way, whether or not there was blood in that vehicle when you
saw it between July 10 and July 18?

A. No.

Q. Doesn't refresh your recollection at all?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Show the next photo.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 2 of 1420.

MR. LEONARD: Put it so that the dark line on the console is
horizontal.

(Photo adjusted on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, I want you again --

MR. LEONARD: Do we have a number for that?

MR. P. BAKER: That's page 2 of 1420.

Q. MR. LEONARD: I want you to direct your attention again to the
console area, and ask you: Does that refresh your recollection of
whether or not there was blood on the console when you saw it between
July 10 and July 18, 1994?

MR. GELBLUM: Same objection about foundation.

MR. LEONARD: We'll prove this up, just like you did.

MR. GELBLUM: I didn't do anything. Showing a witness a picture with no
foundation about when it was taken or where it was taken.

MR. LEONARD: It was taken on August 26, 1994. And we'll prove it up.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, does that refresh your recollection whether
or not there was blood there?

A. Well, no, it doesn't.

But I must add that I didn't look in the console from the passenger's
side.

Q. Oh, you remember that?

A. Yes, I do. I do remember that.

Q. So you -- you did go to the side pocket on the door on the
passenger's side, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you look at all in that direction, at that time?

A. I don't remember that.

Q. Did you look in the glove compartment?

A. Probably.

Q. Okay.

And do you think your vision was just focused entirely on the glove
compartment and/or the pocket, and you had no occasion to look
anywhere in the direction of the console; is that your testimony?

A. No, I'm not testifying -- I'm not saying that I didn't look in that
direction.

I'm saying I don't recall whether I saw anything or not. I wasn't
looking for that particular type of evidence; I was looking for
receipts. And it would -- and it -- It didn't leave an impression on
me whether or not I saw it.

I don't recall any more than I recall whether I had lunch that day. It
was just not something that I remember.

Q. Now, was -- were these two photographs ever pointed out to you at
any time?

Did you -- were you ever asked to do any investigation of -- of these
photographs and how blood apparently got on and off the Bronco?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Were you ever asked to do that?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I've never seen these photographs.

MR. LEONARD: I don't think so.

No further questions.

THE COURT: Cross?

CROSS-EXAMINATION

MR. GELBLUM: Would you put that back on?

MR. FOSTER: The first one?

MR. GELBLUM: No, the one that was just on.

(Page 2 of Defendants' Exhibit 1420 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Were you asked to investigate blood in the Bronco?

A. No.

Q. You were asked to look for receipts that somebody stole, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was the man who stole it?

A. John Meraz.

Q. Who is he?

A. He's a tow-unit operator who towed the -- towed the vehicle from
the print shack to Viertels.

Q. He got fired from Viertels for doing that?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you have any idea where this photograph -- do you have any idea
where this was taken?

A. No.

Q. Where it was taken?

A. No.

Q. Whether it was taken with a flash?

A. No.

Q. Do you see it looks like maybe a flash there with the reflection
off the seat?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. GELBLUM: I'm asking her to observe the photograph, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

She's not an expert in photography. You haven't established that.

Q. Have you ever taken a picture with a flash?

A. Yes.

Q. You ever see how it reflects off objects?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Can you bring that up, please.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you -- does that look like a flash off the
seat?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you have any idea when that was taken?

A. No.

Q. Does it look like it's outside, rather than in a shack or a shed?

A. That's what it looks like.

Q. Did it look like it was a flash used?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objection.

Q. Do you --

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you know whether a flash was used?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you know anything about these photographs?

A. No.

Q. Were you looking for blood when you went into the Bronco?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) There was no breach of security at Viertels, was
there?

I'm sorry. Putting aside Mr. Meraz's theft.

MR. LEONARD: Other than that?

MR. GELBLUM: Yes, other than that.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) The Bronco was held properly in a cordoned-off
area, in a proper manner, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. It was kept sheltered?

A. Yes.

Q. And roped off?

A. Yes.

Q. And secure from the public?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. No foundation for that.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) When you approached the vehicle, did you see print
dust on the outside of the vehicle?

A. I recall seeing the car had a bunch of gray smudges all over it,
that I would assume was print dust.

I knew the car had been processed at the print shack. REDIRECT
EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Let me get this right.

You don't remember whether you saw blood, but you remember there was
gray smudges indicative of fingerprint patterns; is that your
testimony?

MR. GELBLUM: Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) That's your testimony?

A. Could you restate the question, please.

Q. Yeah.

You remember now that there was fingerprint dust on the outside of
this vehicle, but you don't remember whether there was blood or not on
the console. Is that the way you want to leave it with the jury?

MR. GELBLUM: Argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Is that your testimony?

THE COURT: Just a minute. That's uncalled for.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Is that your testimony?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. You're not just remembering now about the print dust; you
remembered at the criminal trial, didn't you?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you. No further questions.

MR. LEONARD: Nothing, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may step down.

THE COURT: Call your next witness.

MR. LEONARD: Detective Frank Spangler.

FRANK SPANGLER, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE CLERK: Please state and spell both your first and your last names
for the record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Frank Spangler, F-r-a-n-k, S-p-a-n-g-l-e-r.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Good morning. Is it -- is it sergeant, detective,
what is it?

A. I'm a lieutenant.

Q. Excuse me.

Lieutenant Spangler, can you see that board okay, or is there too much
of a shine?

You need to wear glasses? Okay. Make sure you're wearing your glasses.

A. Yes, I can see it fine.

MR. P. BAKER: That board is 408.

(Exhibit 408 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You are a Police Department lieutenant, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. How long have you been employed by the police department?

A. Twenty-eight years.

Q. How long have you been a detective?

A. Since --

Q. You are a detective, right?

A. Yes.

Q. How long?

A. Since 1984.

Q. And as of June 12, 1994, you were in charge of all West Los Angeles
Division detectives; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Including Mark Fuhrman?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And Mr. Phillips?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Detective Phillips?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Detective Roberts?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. How long had Detective Fuhrman been under your supervision as of
June 12,1994?

A. Not counting days off, about 28 days.

Q. Okay. And where, if you know, where had he transferred in from?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Directing your attention to June 12,1994, at
approximately 2:30 in the morning, you arrived at the Bundy scene?

A. Approximately 2:30 in the morning.

Q. Is that right?

A. On the 13th.

Q. Excuse me. The 13th?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you were initially briefed by Detective Phillips; is that
right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you did a walk-around, and a walk-through with Detective
Phillips; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. In other words, you arrived; you walked to the back of the --

Why don't you show us where you walked to. I know that the street
isn't on here, but show us where you met Detective Phillips that night
on the diagram.

A. Do you want me to approach the board?

Q. Yeah. There's a pointer up here.

A. Okay.

(The witness complies.)

A. Umm --

Q. The front is over on the right?

A. This is the front gate here. (Indicating.)

Q. Yes?

A. And this is the -- (Indicating.)

Q. That's the back?

A. And this is the garage.

Q. Yes?

A. It would be standing in this area back here. (Indicating.)

Q. Okay.

A. Near the alley.

Q. You had a brief discussion with Detective Phillips at this point?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then Detective Phillips took you into the house; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, before you went into the house --

And by the way, when you went into the house, it was just you and
Detective Phillips, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Before you went into the house, you saw Detective Fuhrman outside?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

You went into the house with Detective Phillips, walked through to the
front of the house, went out on the landing, and made some
observations from the front landing, correct?

A. Actually, most of the observations were done from inside the
doorway that leads to the landing.

Q. Okay.

But you never went down into the Bundy -- the actual crime scene in
the front of Bundy, correct?

A. Are -- that's the steps here?

Q. Yeah.

A. This would be the front door here. (Indicating.)

Q. Is that where it is?

MR. P. BAKER: No, back there.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Back there, where you see the opening?

A. Back here. (Indicating.)

Q. Yeah.

A. Most of my observations were made from this area here, and out in
this landing area here. (Indicating.) We never went down towards where
the bodies were laying.

Q. And again, you're with Detective Phillips, and you don't know where
Detective Fuhrman is at this time, right?

A. I know where he was the last time I saw him.

Q. Right. Okay.

And you never went down into the walk -- see the walkway that runs
along the north side of the property?

A. This here.

Q. You never entered that walkway, did you?

A. Yes, I did.

This walkway back -- this? (Indicating.)

Q. Yes.

A. Going back towards --

Q. Yes.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

Do you recall testifying at your -- at the criminal trial as to what
you did during this time period?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember that?

A. Correct.

Q. Do you remember testifying at the criminal trial that you walked
through the --

MR. MEDVENE: Page and line?

MR. LEONARD: Well, I'm just trying to refresh his memory.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, show it to him.

MR. MEDVENE: There's no showing.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Go ahead. Examine him.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you recall testifying at the criminal trial,
that you walked with Detective Phillips out to the landing area near
the front door, came back out, and walked around to the front? Do you
remember that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. You didn't mention anything in the criminal trial about walking
down that pathway, did you?

A. Correct. I was never asked if I had been down this pathway; you're
right.

Q. Is it your testimony, now, that at some point during this initial
walk-through with Detective Phillips, that you did walk down the
pathway?

A. This pathway back here. (Indicating.)

Q. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. You're just remembering that now?

A. I was never asked that.

Q. Let's go. You can --

A. Yeah.

Q. -- go back up.

Let me refer you to your criminal trial transcript, 19065 all the way
over to 19068.

Do you recall being asked these questions by Mr. Bailey and giving
these responses, starting at 19065, line 7.

Actually, let's start up, actually, over on 19064, line 26. "Q. Can
you tell us where you

went after your arrival, what you looked

at. "A. Yes, sir. Detective

Phillips and Sergeant Rossi spoke to me

briefly, and Detective Phillips escorted

me into the condo via the garage."

Do you remember giving that answer?

A. Yes.

Q. (MR. LEONARD READING:). "Q. Did you view the crime

scene from the steps, the front steps? "A. I stayed inside the

condominium. I did not go outside onto

any steps, sir";

A. Correct.

Q. Do you remember giving that?

A. Correct.

Q. Next question. (Reading:) Did you ever enter the crime

scene from Bundy? "A. Yes, I did, sir. "Q. When was that? "A.
Detective Phillips, after

taking me through the interior of the

condominium and showing me some things

from the doorway, took me back via

Dorothy, to the front of the location,

and the illuminated a pathway through

some plants that were just south of the

sidewalk, where the female victim was

lying. And we approached it from that

position, sir."

Do you remember giving that answer?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Okay.

When you recounted what you did in that initial walk-through, you did
not mention, did you, sir, that you walked down the north pathway;
isn't that right?

A. There was no discussion of that pathway; that's correct.

Q. Did you just forget about that when you were answering questions
for Mr. Bailey in the last trial?

A. I was never asked about the pathway.

Q. Sir, were you asked just what you did, just as I did in this trial,
and did you forget at the criminal trial to say that you had walked
down that rear pathway?

Yes or no?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked --

THE WITNESS: Is that two questions?

THE COURT: Looks like two questions.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Withdrawn.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Are you telling this jury, sir, that you were not
trying to recount to that jury at that trial, what you did after
Detective Phillips took you through the condominium, you went out to
the front steps and then back out?

Are you saying that you -- that you are not trying to tell the jury
everything you did?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Am I trying to tell this jury that I'm not recounting everything
that I did?

Is that what you're saying?

Q. My question is: When Mr. Bailey put the question to you in the
criminal trial, were you intentionally trying to tell the -- The jury
in the criminal trial that you did not go down that pathway?

A. No, I was not, intentionally.

Q. You just forgot?

A. I did not forget.

I was not asked about that pathway. I was asked how we approached the
crime scene. The crime scene that I'm referring to is out where the
bodies are lying. Within that little, enclosed fence area, and we did
not approach that.

Q. Did you not give the following answer: "Detective Phillips, after
taking

me through the interior of the

condominium and showing me some things

from the doorway, took me back via

Dorothy to the front of the location."

A. And that is?

Q. Did you give that answer?

A. I did; that's correct.

Q. You did not say anything at that time about going into that north
pathway, did you?

A. I did not.

Q. You forgot to tell the jury; is that what it was?

A. I did not forget, sir.

Q. You didn't put that in here, in that answer, did you, sir?

A. I was not asked that question; you're correct.

Q. Now, when you saw -- after you went around front to Bundy, keep
that in mind, now.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you -- did there come a time when you saw Detective Fuhrman
again?

A. While I was standing on Bundy, that's -- yes, I did.

Q. That was about what, 15 minutes after you had seen him earlier?

A. No. I would say it would be more in the area of 25 minutes to a
half an hour, I would think.

Q. Okay.

Now, when you first saw Detective -- when you saw Detective Fuhrman
the second time, he did not have a coat on, did he?

He did not have a sport jacket; is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. When you saw him the first time, he had a sport jacket on; isn't
that right, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you have been -- you were -- you were on the plaintiffs'
witness list in this case, weren't you, sir?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you actually appeared about a month ago, and you stood out in
that hallway and waited to testify, didn't you, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you, in preparation for -- for your expected
testimony as a plaintiffs' witness, tell the plaintiffs' attorneys
that Mark Fuhrman had his coat on and then didn't have his coat on at
some point, sir?

Did you tell them that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you showed up here, they told you they didn't want you to
testify; isn't that right, sir?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you testify?

A. No, sir.

Q. Thank you.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Lieutenant Spangler, you were asked about your arrival about 2:30
and where you went. You said you went to the rear of the Bundy
residence; is that correct?

A. Yes, I did, sir.

Q. And what did you do -- what did you see when you got there, and
what did you do?

A. At the rear?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. I saw Detective Phillips, Detective Roberts, and Detective Fuhrman
standing to the rear. Fuhrman and Roberts were over to one side,
engaged in a conversation.

Phillips, upon recognizing me, walked over to me and had a brief
conversation with me.

I believe Sergeant Rossi was also in the rear of the location.

I got a briefing of what they thought we might have. And then we went
into the interior of the condominium.

Q. And was it at that time that Mr. Fuhrman had a jacket on?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you so testify, also, at the criminal trial?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you went inside the conversation -- inside the condominium
with Detective Phillips?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you walk to the front steps?

A. I'm sorry.

Q. Did you walk to the front-step area?

A. I walked to the front-door area.

Q. All right.

And what did you do there?

A. I viewed the area where the bodies were laying from the front-door
area, staying inside the door, shining my light around that, kind of,
you know, trying to get a view from that angle of what we had.

Q. Okay.

And then what did you do?

A. After that?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. We saw some bloody footprints that were on this pathway; that is,
on the north end of your drawing here, that appeared to be leading to
the back of the condominium, going out towards the back gate. And we
took a look at some of that.

There was a hand rail that looked like it had been touched, perhaps,
by someone that had a bloody hand.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation; lack of
foundation; and outside the scope.

(The Court reviews the real-time computer screen.)

THE COURT: Appears to be outside the scope. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You were -- after you walked through, did you walk
through to the rear again, where you started?

A. When I went to the rear, we went to the rear through the
condominium, not through the pathway.

Q. Okay.

And then where did you go?

A. Around to the front of the condominium, out on Bundy.

Q. And did you approach the crime scene again?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Tell us where you went.

A. This time, we approached where the --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I'm objecting. This is outside the scope.

MR. MEDVENE: This is within. He asked him about, I believe, coming --

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Sorry. Go ahead.

A. We approached where the bodies were laying, by approaching through
some foliage that was just to the south of the sidewalk that led up to
the front of the condominium.

Q. And who was "we?"

A. Detective Phillips and myself.

Q. Did you have your flashlight?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What power is it?

A. It's extremely -- it's a very powerful, bright, rechargeable
flashlight that the city gives us.

Q. Did you shine the flashlight on the crime scene?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I object. This is outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you view the crime scene from three different
locations?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: That's overruled.

A. Yes sir, I did.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you only see one glove after you used your
flashlight?

MR. LEONARD: Object. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, this witness is only offered to testify
wherever he went on his visit, not what he saw. So that's beyond the
scope of redirect examination.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you went to the --

Did there come a time after you were at the front of Bundy -- you told
us you viewed the crime scene three additional times -- did there come
a time when you were on Bundy when you again saw Mr. Fuhrman or
Detective Fuhrman?

A. Yes.

Q. And approximately what time was that?

A. Approximately 3 o'clock in the morning.

Q. And was he wearing a jacket at that time?

A. No, he was not.

Q. And was Mr. -- or Detective Fuhrman in your sight from that time,
around 3:05 or in that vicinity on Bundy, until approximately 5:00
a.m.?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. And at 5:00 a.m., where did he go?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained as phrased.

MR. LEONARD: And beyond the scope.

THE COURT: That's overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you know where Detective Fuhrman went at 5:00
a.m.?

A.: I know where they asked permission to go.

Q. And where was that?

A. They asked permission to go to the Rockingham address of Mr.
Simpson.

Q. Incidentally, you were in charge of the -- I think counsel asked
you, all the detectives at West LA?

A. Correct.

Q. And did you instruct your detectives that while robbery/homicide
division from downtown was taking over, those detectives were to stay
available to robbery/homicide and give them every assistance asked
for?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Beyond the scope. Move to strike.

THE COURT: It is beyond the scope. I'm going to let it stay.
Otherwise, he's going to have to come back to testify just to that.

MR. LEONARD: He was here before.

THE COURT: I'll stand on what I said.

Now, if you go beyond that, I'm going to start striking it.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor. To save -- whatever Your Honor's
pleasure is. There are certain areas --

THE COURT: No. If that's what you're going to do, then you can call
him back.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir. We'll do that, then.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much, sir.

Thank you, Lieutenant.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Just one question. You kept an eye on Fuhrman from 3:00 in the
morning until 5:00 in the morning; is that right?

A. I don't believe that's what I said, sir.

Q. You said he was in my view; I didn't keep an eye on him.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. He was in your view because you were in Bundy, in front of the
residence, waiting for the robbery/homicide detectives to arrive?

A. That's right. We waited out front.

Q. And Detective Fuhrman was also out front with other officers; isn't
that correct?

A. He was one of the officers that waited; that's correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you. I have nothing further.

FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Do you know where Detective Fuhrman's jacket ended up?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Thanks.

THE COURT: You may step down.

THE WITNESS: Thank you, sir.

MR. BLASIER: You want to start with the next witness or take a break?
Whatever you like.

THE COURT: Okay. Take ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: Call Dr. John Gerdes.

JOHN GERDES, called as a witness on behalf of the Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated, sir.

THE CLERK: Sir, would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: John C. Gerdes, G-e-r-d-e-s.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Good morning, Dr. Gerdes.

A. Morning.

Q. Dr. Gerdes, can you please tell the folks on the jury here, what
your occupation is?

A. I'm the clinical director of a laboratory called Immunological
Associates of Denver.

Q. Are you a molecular biologist?

A. Yes, I am.

MR. BLASIER: Could I have a new number, Erin, for the C.V.

THE CLERK: 2263.

(The instrument herein described as Curriculum Vitae of Dr. John
Gerdes was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2263.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you what's been marked as 2263.

Is that an accurate copy or current copy of your curriculum vitae?

A. It appears to be an accurate copy as of the end of November.

Q. And can you please briefly describe your educational background in
the field of molecular biology?

A. Yes. I received a Bachelor of Science degree, University of
Wyoming, in microbiology, and proceeded to U.C.L.A., University of
California at Los Angeles, where I did a Ph.D. thesis on microbial
genetics and also microbial pathogenesis. And microbial genetics is a
predecessor field, if you will, of molecular biology.

And then I did a post-doctoral fellowship, again at U.C.L.A.,
investigating the molecular biology of herpes simplex virus and
investigating the mechanism of causing latent infection in animal
models.

And subsequent to that, I went to University of Colorado in Denver,
Colorado, Health Science Center, the medical school, where I was an
assistant professor for four years.

Q. What topics did you teach there?

A. Primarily virology, which is a study of viruses, and some molecular
biology for medical students.

Q. Go ahead.

A. Then I went to Hawaii for about five years, where I taught at a
community college, and also was a quality control microbiologist at
this time.

And I returned to Denver, spent one year as director of a laboratory
investigating multiple sclerosis and investigating the detection of
viruses in brain tissue from autopsies of multiple sclerosis patients
and trying to find out if we could determine or identify a virus as a
cause of multiple sclerosis was our goal.

And then I joined -- or was hired in my current position at
Immunological Associates in 1988.

Q. And the study of viruses and what you described in your educational
background, does that deal with issues relating to DNA?

A. Yes.

Q. And how so?

A. Well, a virus is simply a piece of DNA that's wrapped in a protein
coat. Either DNA or RNA. RNA is a second type of nucleic acid. In
investigating viruses, you're also investigating nucleic acid.

Q. Tell us briefly what is your position in the lab that you work at
now?

A. I actually have three titles.

As clinical director, I'm responsible for the testing that involves
detection of infectious agents and any clinical chemistry types of
tests we do related to -- specifically what we are is a transplant
laboratory, so organ transplants.

And what we do is we investigate infectious -- obviously, we're
interested in whether or not -- if you have a potential donor, it's
our responsibility to ensure that not only do you match the immune
system of that particular donor organ with the recipient, but also
ensure that it's not infectious.

So you need to look for infectious agents to ensure that you don't
inadvertently pass an infectious agent into the recipient and
therefore give them an infection.

So that's my clinical title.

And I'm also the director of DNA parentage analysis. Our lab does
paternity testing or parental testing. It is for the purpose of the
legal -- it's an interface between science and the legal or law and
involves any situation in which there's a question as to the -- the
parent of a child. So that would -- can determine whether a father is
indeed the biological father or not. That kind of question, that
involves DNA testing. We use both RFLP type of testing as well as PCR
base testing now for that purpose.

And my third title is director of research and development, and it's
my responsibility to identify testing that's new, testing that can be
helpful for us to introduce into the laboratory, validate it for that
-- whatever purpose that new testing would have.

And in addition, I've received a grant to investigate a new strategy
of doing DNA testing in such a way that it could preclude the
possibility of contamination.

Q. In the work that you've done in your laboratory, have you become
familiar with the DQ Alpha HLA region of the DNA, the DQ Alpha gene?

A. Yes. The HLA region actually involves several different gene loci,
and DQ Alpha is one of them. And we're very familiar with that because
of the fact that the other thing our laboratory does -- and I actually
was involved in setting this up, but we now have another Ph.D. that
has this department of the lab.

But what we do is molecular DNA dot blot base testing for the purpose
of matching the organ or matching a bone marrow transplant for a
recipient.

That's by DNA base testing of a dot blot format and that involves
matching in the HLA region because the HLA region is that area of DNA
that's involved in the immune recognition. So that's the critical area
that you need to match between the donor and the recipient to ensure
that the -- there's no immune rejection of the grafted bone marrow.

It's very critical that you match that very precisely so the
individual doesn't reject their transplant.

Q. Now, are you familiar with the DQ Alpha testing kit that is used
for forensic applications, or analysis of the DQ Alpha gene?

A. Yes I am.

Q. Now -- incidentally, with respect to the DQ Alpha gene, how many
alleles are there in the DQ Alpha gene?

A. Well, the kit detects 6 alleles. In fact, there are -- there are
more alleles than that; perhaps twice that many. And there are new
ones discovered all the time and -- but the kit was designed to detect
6, but in fact there could be as many as 12 to 14 now.

Q. If you describe that system as only having 6 alleles, that would be
inaccurate?

A. There are subtypes of those alleles, yes, that's --

Q. Now, in your work with transplants, in terms of matching the donor
to a recipient, you use the DQ Alpha gene system, do you not?

A. Sometimes we do, yes. Not always.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Not always.

Q. Is the 6 allele system that is in the kit used in forensics,
adequate for transplant technology?

A. No. We use a direct dot blot method that detects more of the -- all
of the alleles, in fact.

Q. And why is that important?

A. Well, in -- in a situation where you're doing a bone marrow
transplant, you want to match as precisely as you possibly can. And so
we use the highest -- the test with the greatest discrimination in
order to -- to do that matching.

Q. Now, let me ask you about professional societies that you belong to
in areas relevant to your testimony.

Tell us what those are?

A. Well, I belong to the American Society for Histocompatibility of
Immunogenetics, which is ASHI for short. That's an organization that's
responsible for accrediting laboratories for the purpose of doing HLA
diagnostics, specifically HLA diagnostics relating to transplant work.

I'm a member of the American Association of Blood Banks, AABB for
short. AABB is the organization involved in accreditation and
inspection of laboratories that do DNA testing for the purpose of
parentage testing.

I belong to the American Society of Microbiology Clinical Ligand,
L-i-g-a-n-d, as an associate. A ligand is just a target. It's another
word for that. It's a clinical target. This organization is involved
in investigating that, or basically it's a collection of individuals
whose job titles involve clinical testing.

And I believe --

Q. American Society for Clinical Virology?

A. Yes. That's a society for virologists and it's a collection of
directors of clinical virology laboratories.

Q. During some point in your career, did you become interested in the
forensic issues of different technologies?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that?

A. I believe that was back in 1990. At the time, we were doing DNA
testing for parentage testing and had an advertisement that was in the
yellow pages for that purpose.

And there was a local murder case and I -- the story is that the
attorney just looked me up in the yellow pages and called me and said
would you look at this testing.

And I did.

And I had some concerns and expressed those concerns about that
particular case.

And then subsequent to that, I was invited to give a talk at a Defense
Attorneys Conference in Colorado, and discussed specifically RFLP in
that conference. But I met several individuals; Simon Ford and Bill
Thompson. From that time on I started to get referrals. After
discussing my concerns with them, I started to get referrals of cases,
forensic cases.

Q. In your -- your work preparing forensic cases, have you been called
upon to visit forensic labs?

A. Yes.

Q. Approximately how many?

A. I believe I've actually visited nine labs. I've reviewed the
protocols of 16.

Q. Now, when you say reviewed the protocols, what does that mean?

A. Well, any laboratory has a written document that is called their
standing or standard operating protocol. And what that is is it's just
a written -- the written directions, if you will, or instructions that
the technicians need to follow. And so by reviewing those
instructions, one can determine the policies of the laboratory without
actually going to the laboratory.

Q. And as far as the labs that you visited, is one of those labs a Los
Angeles Police Department SID lab?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Is one of those labs the Department of Justice DNA Lab --

A. Yes.

Q. -- in California?

Is one of those labs Cellmark Diagnostics in Maryland?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you reviewed the protocols for each of those three labs as
well?

A. I have.

Q. When you actually visit a lab, what is it that you're looking for?

A. Well, my usual procedure in looking at a laboratory is I ask them
first to give me a tour of the lab, and what I look for in a tour of
the lab is if, for instance, they're taking PCR base testing, I'm
looking for the organization of the laboratory in terms of how the
laboratory deals with common problems in PCR testing, mainly the fact
that you can have contamination.

So we look for how they deal with that, and what precautions they take
for that, and whether their laboratory -- what their laboratory -- the
appearance of the laboratory in terms of all of the aspects that might
have to do with that.

After going through the laboratory tour -- and during the laboratory
tour I usually just ask the director to tell me, well, assume that a
specimen just came in the door, it's from a case, how would you handle
that specimen, and walk me through the physical locations of that
evidence of that specimen, that reference specimen, and how would you
do that.

After that, I usually ask to see records of all of the testing that
has been done, that tracks the test that's of interest or that -- the
case that I'm looking at.

And the reason for that is to get an impression of how good the
laboratory is in term of not having incidents of contamination.

So I can look at the control strips that are run around the same time
as the case that I've been hired to look at.

And I get some impression about how clean the laboratory is, how well
their protocols -- even though they have -- they may have a very good
written protocol on paper, but that gives you a window of looking at
how well those protocols are actually followed, or how effective they
are at actually preventing contamination. You can look at a window of
time around the testing as far as their control strips, look at a lot
of those control strips and see if there's any problems in the lab.

Then I ask to look at their proficiency testing. Proficiency testing
is just a -- a mechanism of testing the laboratory to see how
effective their -- their typings are, and there -- there's a number of
organizations such as the College of American Pathology that send out
blind specimens that the laboratory doesn't know the results of, and
they just type those and then send back the results. So I look at
those testing events to see how well they did on those tests.

Q. Are all those steps important in assessing the reliability of test
results in a particular case?

A. Absolutely.

Q. Incidentally, your lab, is your lab accredited?

A. Yes.

Q. By whom?

A. Well, we're accredited by a number of organizations. There's
actually four of them, and I've mentioned them already.

The American Association of Blood Banks accredits our parentage
testing by DNA.

The American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, or
ASHI, accredits our HLA testing, and that includes HLA DNA testing.

The National Marrow Donor Program doesn't actually accredit. They're
an organization that is responsible for typing specimens for the
purpose of bone marrow transplants. They only contract labs that are
ASHI accredited so they depend on ASHI accreditation, but they -- they
perform what are called blind proficiency for their contract labs.

What that means is we have a certain number of individuals we have to
do the typing on every week, and a percentage of those, about 10
percent of those are actually controls that -- we don't even know
which ones are the controls. So the specimens that come in are all
just given numbers -- accession numbers. That just means each sample
that comes in is given the next number in sequence. So we don't know
who the individuals are, we don't know which ones of those specimens
are controls. We run those tests, and then every week we're graded in
terms of how well we've done on the control samples.

So they're a proficiency organization as well as the regular industry
organization.

And then there's the CLIA. This is the Department of Health and Human
Services. The federal law for clinical diagnostic testing is called
CLIA, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of '88.

Q. That's a federal law?

A. That's a federal law.

According to that federal law, inspectors, I think it's every two
years, inspect your laboratory and accredit those laboratories for the
purpose of doing any specimen that will be used in human diagnosis.
And we're accredited by them as well.

Q. Is it accurate to say that to maintain your accreditation, you have
to subject yourself to the blind proficiency testing?

A. That's true in the case of NMDP, the National Marrow Donor Program.
The CLIA regulations at the present time, they all -- all of these
accrediting agencies require proficiency testing, but the distinction
is that only NMDP requires them to be blind in terms of not knowing
which ones are the test specimens.

All of the others involved, on a monthly basis or on a quarterly
basis, specimens that come into the laboratory that need to be tested,
but we know that they're quality control specimens that are coming in
the door.

But we have to do proficiency for all of those organizations.

Q. Do any of those accrediting agencies have any authority over
forensic labs?

A. No.

Q. And is it accurate that the Los Angeles Police Department
Scientific Investigation Division lab is not accredited by anyone?

A. That's accurate.

Q. Now, approximately how many cases have you worked on -- how many
forensic cases have you worked on since you became interested in
approximately 1990?

A. There are 35 that I've actually testified in. There are perhaps
another half dozen where I've consulted but I did end up testifying.
And there's perhaps two or three cases right now that I'm involved
with.

Q. And the 35 where you've testified as an expert are in approximately
how many states?

A. I'd say somewhere around 8 or 10 states. I'd have to count to make
sure.

Q. And is it accurate that all those times you've worked for the
defense in a criminal case?

A. That's true.

Q. Your lab doesn't do any -- any forensic testing for prosecutors,
does it?

A. No. With the exception of parentage testing.

Q. Paternity testing?

A. Yeah.

Q. Have you now -- you worked on the Simpson criminal case, correct?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And you spent a considerable amount of time reviewing materials for
the Simpson criminal case, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. Now, you already indicated you reviewed all the protocols and did
lab visits for all three labs.

Have you reviewed the collection procedures used in this case by the
Los Angeles Police Department?

A. Yes.

Q. And have you reviewed testimony by the various people who collected
the evidence in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And why don't you tell us which testimony you reviewed about that
topic?

A. In terms of sample collection, I believe that was Andrea Mazzola
and Dennis Fung.

Q. How about in terms of processing of those samples once they're
collected, what have you reviewed with respect to that?

A. That would be Collin Yamauchi as well as the other DNA individuals,
Robin Cotton and Gary Sims.

Q. Have you reviewed all of the PCR testing results obtained by all
three of those labs in this case?

A. I have.

Q. Have you also reviewed a video that was prepared by the Los Angeles
Police Department to show how they used -- how they collected evidence
in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. We'll get to that in a minute.

Do you have an opinion with respect to the risk of error in the
results in this case due to contamination at the Los Angeles Police
Department.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant, violative of the Court's order.

THE COURT: At the Los Angeles Police Department. Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Can't elicit his opinion --

THE COURT: No.

MR. BLASIER: -- about the results in this case?

THE COURT: I think I made my ruling clear yesterday.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) As a molecular biologist, Dr. Gerdes, and a DNA
laboratory director, do you have an opinion about the specimen
handling and sample methods used by the LAPD personnel in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And what's that opinion?

A. I believe there's an unacceptable risk or chance in the way those
samples were handled of there being cross-contamination.

Q. Do you have an opinion with respect to the reliability of the PCR
testing results obtained in this case by the LA Police Department?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor, same objection as before. This is
trying to incorporate the outlawed testimony.

MR. BLASIER: I'm asking just about the results in this case, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, I know you understand my ruling and I trust
you are being guided by it.

MR. BLASIER: I am.

THE COURT: Are you?

MR. BLASIER: I'm just asking about the results in this case.

THE COURT: I asked you a simple question and you're answering yes. So
you may proceed.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember the question?

A. Can you repeat it, please.

Q. Do you have an opinion -- a professional opinion, as a laboratory
director, and given the evaluation of the results in this case that
you have done with respect to the reliability, to a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty, of the PCR results obtained in this case by
the Los Angeles Police Department?

A. Yes.

Q. And what's that opinion?

A. Again, I feel that the sample collection, manipulation and PCR
setup protocols are such that there's an unacceptable risk of
cross-contamination.

Q. Do you have an opinion, same question, with respect to the PCR
results obtained in this case by the Department of Justice?

A. Yes.

Q. And what's that opinion?

A. Well, I believe that the -- the results -- the Department of
Justice results are reliable. However, with the qualification that
whatever -- their typing went through the LAPD first, and so if there
were any errors made in terms of cross-contamination at the LAPD, the
Department of Justice would -- Justice would simply repeat those
errors. The other qualification is that the Department of Justice has
an artifact that's frequently found in their testing strips which is a
1.3 allele, which makes the interpretation of results in a number of
specimens suspect.

Q. Do you have an opinion with -- we'll talk about that in specific.

Do you have an opinion, same question, with respect to the PCR results
obtained by Cellmark Diagnostics in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is that opinion?

A. It's similar to the DOJ, and that is that I believe the Cellmark DQ
Alpha system is -- poly marker system, excuse me, or both, is run
reliably at Cellmark laboratories. However, they are going to again
retype any errors or just amplify those errors that occurred prior to
the samples coming to them.

And again, there are some occasions of contamination in a number of
the specimens -- specific specimens that were run at Cellmark.

Q. In this case?

A. In this case.

Q. Okay.

Now, we've had some testimony about the comparison of the use of DNA
technology in the clinical setting versus the forensic setting. You
have some views about that, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. I'd like to put up --

MR. P. BAKER: The number should be on the back.

MR. BLASIER: 1248.

(Exhibit 1248 displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a board was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1248.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Doctor, you recall seeing this board in the
criminal trial?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there -- there is a significant difference between the type of
DNA testing that you do, or that's done in a clinical setting, and in
the forensic setting with respect to the -- the type of samples that
are used?

A. Definitely, yes.

JUROR: Can you move the board?

MR. BLASIER: Sure.

(Mr. Blasier adjusts board.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) What are the differences on samples?

A. Well, the samples -- in a clinical setting we receive samples that
are sterile samples, that have been collected by a trained nurse or
individual who knows how to follow what's called an aseptic technique,
which is a manner in which to collect a specimen with sterile
protocols so that it's a clean specimen.

Q. Why is that important?

A. Well, it's extremely important especially if you're doing something
that involves identity testing.

Because of the fact that's in a clinical sample, then we can guarantee
that that came from a single individual.

And so if there's any spurious results, meaning that we have some
signals on our typing strips that shouldn't be there, then we know
that there's something wrong, and we need to have that specimen
redrawn, and we can retype it and repeat it.

Now, in a forensic setting, the samples are -- are dirty, they're not
aseptically collected, they can't be because of the nature of -- just
crime scenes, and therefore when we have those unusual results, it's
very difficult to determine with any certainty whether or not there
was a problem with the way the test was run, or there's contamination,
that is, human DNA got in there that shouldn't be in there.

That's what the definition of contamination is; there's foreign DNA,
somebody else's DNA somehow got into that sample at some point, or
that there's some artifact that happened in the way that the testing
is done. You can't really distinguish between those possibilities.

So basically -- and the other possibility is that it's a true mixture
that, yes, at the crime scene there was more than one person there.

And obviously, it's very important to be able to distinguish between
whether an allele that you observed there is a second individual
contributing to that sample. It's very important to understand, or be
able to say with certainty that that additional allele that is there
is due to in fact somebody at the crime scene as opposed to an
artifact that happened in the lab.

Now, an artifact is just -- it's a defect. And these dot blot based
testing systems where we can sometimes get weak signals on these
strips that are due to an artifact, due to a defect in the way that
the testing is set up, and so it's not a true result, it's a mistaken
result.

So it's very important to be able to distinguish between whether
there's a true result there or a mistaken result, obviously.

And in the clinical setting we can because we know that the specimen
we get came from a single individual, and we know that anything there
that's unexpected, as far as additional signals or alleles indicating
an additional person, means that there's something that has gone wrong
in the testing, and so you can redo the testing.

Q. Now, is there a difference between forensic applications of this
technology and clinical applications with respect to the size of
samples that you have to work with?

A. Absolute. Absolutely.

Q. In what sense?

A. Well, in a clinical -- in the vast majority of clinical testing you
have a generous sample size, a blood specimen that's asteriley
collected blood specimen, you can ask them to collect whatever amount
you need for the particular test. And usually, for these PCR-based
tests you don't need a lot. Certainly, you can request a blood tube
which contains around 6 to 8 cc's of blood. So that's plenty. That's a
lot of -- of blood to be able to work with that's clean blood.

In a forensic setting there's frequently very minuscule size samples;
a small blood drop that's found at the crime scene, a hair that's
found at the crime scene, the very small flecks of blood, and it's
much more difficult to get a correct typing result when you're limited
in the amount of material you have to start with.

Q. Incidentally, let me ask you, can you give us an estimate of the
number of nanograms of DNA in one and a half cc's of blood?

And I don't mean to put you on the spot.

A. Well, let's put it this way: A drop of blood would have about a
thousand nanograms, and a drop would be about 50 microliters.

Q. So there would be about 20 drops in a cc?

A. Right.

Q. Which would be about 20,000 nanograms?

A. Correct.

Q. So then there would be about 30,000 in one and a half cc's?

A. Correct.

Q. And is it accurate that in the samples in this case, in the Simpson
criminal case, in the -- in the civil case, the amount of DNA involved
in many of these samples that were subjected to PCR testing is
extremely small?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, is there a difference in terms of reliability of results
between the clinical setting and the forensic setting with respect to
how often samples have to be handled?

A. Yes. In a medical setting, again, we get a sample which was
aseptically collected, it's transported to the laboratory, and then a
specimen is withdrawn directly from the blood tube, and the DNA is
extracted directly from there.

In forensic -- in a typical forensic case, there are swatches and
multiple swatches that are taken of stains of blood, for instance, and
then those are manipulated in terms of they have to be dried, they
have to be packaged at the crime scene, they have to be dried so that
you -- that you don't have degradation, they have to be transferred
into the bindles.

And so there are multiple manipulations where they're like shuffling
these little swatches around.

Every -- each time you manipulate a sample, it; number one, increases
the possibility of an error occurring; number two, increases the
possibility of the introduction of foreign DNA or contaminants into
those particular samples.

Q. Is the issue of error rates of a particular laboratory important in
assessing the reliability of results of a particular lab?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. In light of the admission, it's irrelevant in
this case.

THE COURT: As long as you stay away from what I told you to stay away
from.

MR. BLASIER: I am.

A. Yes, I believe error rates are very relevant. And it has to do with
the fact that in a typical identity test DNA figures will be quoted in
terms of the likelihood of a match being in a certain population, and
then -- and they're very high numbers.

And yet if you -- if you look at the testing of the usual laboratory
in a clinical setting, for example, where there have been control
studies that have been done, the usual type of error rate in a
clinical lab is somewhere around 1 percent. It has to do with the fact
that there's human error, and that's about the rate at which people
make mistakes. And that's in the best clinical labs.

And so error rate generally tends to be much higher than the gene
frequency estimate. And so in my mind, it just makes sense that you
would look at both of those and say that, well, if the gene frequency
is 1 in 10 billion or whatever, but the lab makes a mistake in 1 in
100, you need to know both of those, all of that information, in terms
of how much weight to put on that evidence.

Q. Now, the number 1 percent, does that come from evaluation of
proficiency testing that's required to be done?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, with respect to laboratory standards -- I think you already
talked about this.

Basically, the clinical labs have very stringent standards about
sample handling and how they process a sample from start to finish,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. In your experience, do the procedures used by the police department
SID division in this case, required the same -- require the same kind
of rigorous controls?

A. No.

Q. Now, in the DNA testing that you do, and that's done in the
clinical setting, do you ever get into the statistical controversy in
terms of trying to predict percentages of populations that might fit a
particular pattern?

A. We do statistics in association with parentage testing which is not
identical but similar. I'm aware of the statistical issues.

Q. That's a situation where you know all three contributors, you know
who they are --

A. Correct.

Q. -- after typing?

A. Correct. In a typical clinical setting, an HLA typing, where we do
the typing for the purpose of matching donor and a recipient, there's
no statistics involved at all.

So you really don't -- it's not a concern, it's not something that
you're -- that's an issue because, you know, you have both individuals
you try to match, they're known individuals, and you're just asking
the question, does the sample from individual 1 and individual 2, do
they match. And you're not concerned about, well, how often would that
happen at random in the population. All you're really concerned about
is how close the match is between those two specific individuals. So
statistics aren't even involved.

Q. Does the affect of environmental conditions on a forensic stain,
does that affect the ability, to or the reliability, of results that
you can ultimately get from DNA testing?

A. In my experience, yes, because it's -- again, it's not when you --
take a specimen that's been taken off of carpet; there can be carpet
dye or shampoo or anything in that carpet. Or off of a dirty sidewalk;
dirt has been shown to interfere with the extraction and the ability
to type DNA. So -- and in a forensic setting there's an infinite
number of different substrates -- those are called substrates,
different areas where you can find a specimen.

And all of those can affect DNA typing.

Q. In the clinical setting are you ever put in a situation where you
collect a stain off of a ground somewhere where you don't know how
long it's been there or what conditions it's been subjected to?

A. No.

Q. Now, let's talk about contamination in DNA testing.

Incidentally, is contamination a big issue in the clinical setting as
well as the forensic setting?

A. Yeah, this is a big issue for anyone who uses this technique, the
PCR technique.

Q. Why is it a big issue with the PCR technique?

A. Well, because of the fact that this is an extremely sensitive
technique. It literally has the potential of detecting a single copy
of the gene you're looking at.

And so with that extreme sensitivity, that means that it's very easy
if you're working at very -- at sensitivity levels where you're
demanding that the test detect very low numbers of copy, it's very
easy for a foreign DNA or extraneous DNA to be introduced into that
sample and appear as a mixture, which would be a false mixture if it's
accidentally introduced, and that's called contamination.

And with this technique, it's so sensitive that it literally could
wipe this bench and get somebody's DNA, whoever sneezed here last,
probably, you could get their DNA type off this bench. It's that
sensitive.

So it's sensitive enough that you begin to pick up DNA that's sort of
a background DNA in the environment.

And in a laboratory that creates problems because, obviously, you're
trying to only get a DNA type for the specimen you're interested in.
And the fact that it is so sensitive to that extraneous DNA makes it
extremely difficult to control that.

Q. Does that sensitivity come from the fact that small amounts of DNA
in the PCR process are multiplied or amplified to many copies?

A. That's right. The PCR, polymer chain reaction, it basically starts
with a very small amount of material and then copies that millions and
billions of times so that you have many, many copies of what you
started with.

Q. Incidentally, let me look at --

MR. BLASIER: What number is this?

MR. P. BAKER: This is 987.

(The instrument herein described as a chart was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 987.)

(Exhibit 987 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Doctor, have you ever seen this chart before?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. Can you just tell us approximately how big -- What's another size
of 20 nanograms of DNA?

20.

A. 20 nanograms would probably be somewhere around five millimeters to
a centimeter, something like that I would think.

Q. About the size of the head of a pin?

A. Yeah. Well, a little bigger than that, I think, for 20 nanograms.

Q. How about for 2 nanograms?

A. That would be about the size of a head of a pin I would think or --

MR. BLASIER: Now, you can take that down, sir.

(Exhibit 987 removed from display.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You remember there being discussions in this
criminal case about whether DNA could fly or not?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant to what was discussed in the
criminal case.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you describe some of the ways in which DNA
gets moved from one place to another without you being aware of it.

A. Yes.

One of the most subversive ways, and especially in forensic cases, one
that is of greatest concern is what's called cross-contamination.

There's definitions for different -- so basically three different ways
you can contaminate:

The first one is cross-contamination. That has to do with the fact
that if you touch an item that has DNA on it, such as a blood stain
that's a large blood stain, you can get some of that on your glove,
and because we just said that it's very, very small, essentially you
wouldn't even notice or see it on your glove, you can still have
plenty of DNA there to transfer.

What can happen is you can get that DNA on your glove, it doesn't have
to be a glove, it can be the instrument that you pick that up with, or
whatever, and then if the next item you handle happens to be an item
that's very -- is an evidence item that has very little DNA, where
it's extremely degraded, then you can transfer the DNA from the larger
amount to the second one that has the smaller amount.

And when you type that in the laboratory, what can happen is now
you'll see a match between the two items, but the match was created by
the accidental transfer that occurred onto your glove.

Now, that can happen -- as I said, it's extremely subversive. It can
be as simple as perhaps you collect an item and you don't change your
gloves, and pick up a pen. Now it's on your pen. You may change your
gloves but then you pick up the same pen. Now it's on your new glove.

And you can see how easy it is to really transfer DNA around without
being aware of it.

And you can think back and you really don't remember how you possibly
could have touched one item to another.

And there are techniques that allow you to avoid that. And it's
basically developing a second sense of the -- those kind of -- of
motions and movements that you don't even think about. And in
microbiology it's called aseptic technique; you learn -- if you work
with an organism that's a dangerous organism that can infect, you
learn not to do that kind of thing. Now, even if -- even in the best
laboratories it can still happen that you have an inadvertent transfer
from one item to another; cross-contamination. It can happen at any
stage, at any time when samples are manipulated.

Q. And could anything happen if you wear glasses, and happen to adjust
your glasses as you're doing your work?

A. Yes. It's those kinds of subconscious movements. You're not aware
of it. You might -- I have -- everybody who wears glasses has a
constant habit of just adjusting them. They fall down on your nose.

But if you're doing this kind of technology, before you adjust your
glasses, you'd have to change those gloves because you put it on your
glasses, then you're not aware of it, next time you touch your
glasses, it's on your glove, you transferred, now you're transferring
to the next item.

So there are an infinite number of ways, when you really think about
it, how you can transfer things without being aware of it, from one
item to the other.

Q. Now, one of the things that you evaluated in connection with the
results in this case was the procedures used by the Department of
Justice to protect just against that kind of contamination?

A. Yes.

Q. And what -- And that was you observed Gary Sims and the techniques
he used?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he use special techniques with respect to the paper that he
writes his results on?

A. Yes. I mean he -- I think Gary goes-- he does an excellent job of
trying to avoid this kind of problem. And he goes -- he's tried to
think of everything.

So, for instance, if you were to have notes -- and as you know
everything has to be documented. And in these kinds of cases there's
-- every time you're handling a specimen you're going to be recording
that fact, and if your DNA happens to contaminate those notes, the
notes following the specimen, so now it's on the notes. And you handle
the notes the next time, now it's going to be on the -- even if you
got fresh blood, you transfer it off the notes onto the next item, or
at least that's potentially possible.

He actually takes the notes and he exposes them to UV which kills DNA
between each manipulation.

That's how paranoid you get at the possibility of this kind of
transfer.

Q. Incidentally, does the Los Angeles Police Department's SID division
do that at all?

A. No.

Q. Are there other procedures with respect to cleaning the work area
between handling samples?

A. Yes.

Q. What sort of procedures?

A. In most forensic laboratories, in between each item you would
totally change the paper, preferably bleach the area down. Bleach
kills DNA. Bleach the area down and change the paper in between each
manipulation of every evidence item.

It makes it an extremely slow, painstaking process, but it's a
precaution that most forensic laboratories feel is necessary to avoid
this kind of cross-contamination transfer.

Q. Does LAPD do -- do they bleach the table between samples?

A. No.

Q. Now, is there another way to illustrate how a substance like DNA
can move from one place to another without you even knowing it, an
analogy with respect to getting a cold?

A. Yeah. It gets back to your question about can DNA fly.

Well, it doesn't have wings so it can't fly in that sense. But
certainly DNA is very analogous to an infectious agent in terms of --
as I said, a virus is DNA wrapped up in a protein coat. And basically,
it can introduce -- be introduced into what is called an aerosol.

An aerosol is fine droplets of moisture that can be suspended in the
air. And those drops of moisture can then attach to dust, and it can
float around in the air for actually quite a while. And that's --
that's really not farfetched because the analogy is catching a cold.

The way we all catch a cold is exactly by that transfer; someone
sneezes, I've got droplets in the air and you happen to walk into the
room a few minutes later and breathe that in. Now I've transferred the
virus from individual 1 to individual 2. It's a very small amount of
material that's transferred. When you breath it in, the virus
replicates itself, copies itself like the PCR, and it gives you the
cold.

So if you think back, how many of you really know the last time you
had a cold, can you identify a specific incident or a specific
individual you know gave you that cold.

Most of us can't.

You have no idea. You just know I caught a cold somewhere, and along
the way you had to have -- to have had DNA transfer into your bodies
for you to catch that cold.

So it shows you that this PCR process is every bit as sensitive as an
infectious process, and in detecting that transfer.

Q. Let me ask you a little bit more about contamination. You say there
are three kinds. The first one was cross-contamination?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you explain that briefly?

A. Cross-contamination is the transfer of DNA by manipulating an item
and then accidentally transferring DNA on your instruments, or
whatever, pencil, notes, whatever, to the next item.

Q. And what are the other two kinds of contamination that you can see
in these kinds of tests?

A. The second kind of contamination is called reagent contamination.
Reagents are the fluids or liquids that we have to use for the methods
of extracting and amplifying this DNA.

So we mix together these -- it's kind of like if you're baking. It's
the ingredients list. You mix these ingredients together. That's what
allows you to create an environment so that the DNA can copy itself.
So you have to add a certain amount of this and a certain amount of
that in order for it to -- for this reaction to go.

Those reagents are generally in much larger volumes than you would use
just to do a single item.

So, for instance, you might be able to do 100 or a thousand or 10,000
different tests by using these bottles of reagent.

So if you have a bottle that's like the size of, you know, a typical
mouthwash bottle type size, then you're only using a drop at a time.

And that means you're going to be going in and out of that bottle a
lot of times when you do this DNA testing. And every time you open the
lid, you're exposing that bottle to the possibility of DNA falling in
there.

And in fact, that does happen.

And when it happens, then if you were to just take the fluid that you
need to put in -- the ingredients you need to put in the PCR, and you
leave the DNA out, then all of the sudden you start seeing DNA where
it wasn't there before, because it actually accidentally got
introduced into that bottle, then that's going to be introduced on top
of the sample that you're trying to test.

So that's called reagent contamination.

Q. And is it important because of that potential problem to change
chemicals frequently

A. Yes.

Q. Did you make an observation, in your visit to the LAPD lab, with
respect to the chemicals that they were using in their DNA lab in the
tests they did in this case?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: In this case.

THE COURT: If he was present during the testing of the evidence in
this case, you may examine him.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You're talking about chemicals that were used in
the lab in the testing in this case?

A. Yes. The lots of some of the reagents that were used in this
particular case were up to six months old.

Q. Why is that?

A. Well, because the longer you keep those reagents around, the higher
the risk or chance of some of that DNA -- extraneous DNA being
introduced, and it being a contaminant.

Q. How often do you change the lots of reagents in your lab?

A. It depends on the reagent.

Most of them are aloquated (phonetic) so they're used only once. If
we're doing an extremely sensitive technique, we use a technique to
detect the virus, for instance, that is present in very low copy in
transplant patients, and we have everything set up so we only use that
once and throw it away. It's disposable. We never go into it twice.
Other techniques where we're not working at quite as high sensitivity
such as HLA typing, reagents, we probably change every week or perhaps
every two weeks.

Q. Now, what's the third kind of contamination?

A. The third kind of contamination has to do with the fact that in
this process of PCR, what you do is you identify a very specific
target, piece of DNA, and you copy that millions and billions of
times.

If you do that in a laboratory over and over, day in, day out, that's
your routine, you're always copying that same -- same piece of DNA,
eventually you get a buildup. And those billions of copies are being
handled in the laboratory in the same environment where you're trying
to find, you know, a few copies.

And so it's very easy to cross-contaminate the previously amplified
product and -- to what hasn't been amplified before, and then
reamplify it. And that's called amplification carryover, amplification
contamination.

Q. Is there a term that you're familiar with called one-way work flow?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you explain that.

A. When, as I said, I go into the laboratory and look at the physical
design of the lab, that's pretty much what I was looking for, this
one-way work flow.

It has to do with the fact that in order to try and avoid this
contamination with the previously amplified materials into things
they're trying to evidence, items or whatever, that have very low
copies, if you design the laboratory so that you always have the
evidence or the small copy numbers items come in the door, and then as
you go through the process and end up with the amplified material, you
never have cross-talk between or physical connection between the post
amplification area and the preamplification area. Then you can, to a
certain degree, avoid this kind of transfer from amplified product
contaminating the unamplified materials.

Q. Now, the PCR test that was done by LAPD in this case, what was
their procedure with respect to this amplified product and what they
did with it?

A. Well, they amplified -- they do the extraction in one location or
building, and then they go to a second building to do their post
amplification. That's good because that -- I mean you can't get better
separation than that. But --

Q. And that's at Parker Center, where they --

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

A. Correct. They do it at Parker Center, they do the amplification.
And at Piper, they do the preamplification. And then they take the
amplified product and do their gels back at the original lab.

So they're going not one way, but this direction and then back.

(Indicating.)

A. (Continuing.) And even though it's done in a separate room, it
still means that amplified product is being carried back to that lab
and has a potential of cross-contaminating or contamination by this
method.

Q. Let me ask you some questions about controls.

A. Okay.

Q. What sort of controls are used or were used in this case to --
well, first of all, what's a control?

A. Well, because we're aware that there are problems, there are
potential problems in terms of this contamination issue, especially,
or, you know, artifacts that may happen in testing, controls can be
designed to try and detect those artifacts or those contaminants, and
the controls then are used to determine whether or not there's an
issue -- that those are issues.

Now, the problem with controls is sometimes, not always, do those
controls detect a problem. But if they do detect a problem, then it
does tell the laboratory that -- that they have suspicious typing
results and they need to repeat it or do something to it. It affects
how you interpret that result.

So the kind of controls then is -- we start back at where you start.
You start where you manipulate the specimen. So at the crime scene,
when you're collecting the specimen, there's a control called a
substrate control, which is taken at the same time that you collect
the evidence item.

And what that is, is, it's just a blank piece of swatch that is
ideally manipulated immediately after manipulating the evidence item
that was collected. And that -- that swatch should be a sterile swatch
that doesn't have any DNA at all on it. When this goes -- then, from
that point on, you have to intersperse one of those control substrate
swatches in between every evidence item; so you do an evidence item
which has DNA, a control substrate swatch which shouldn't have any
DNA, an evidence item that should have DNA, a control substrate swatch
that shouldn't have any DNA, and so forth.

Now, you not only have to collect it that way, in order for this
control to be effective, you have to be absolutely sure that at every
subsequent step that same sequence is followed, and that is you always
manipulate the control swatch at the same time you manipulate the
evidence swatch, in the same way, with the same tools.

And that hopefully would allow you to pick up this cross-transfer
because if there's cross-transfer it should presumably be transferred
onto that control.

Q. Is there any --

A. That's --

Q. Is there any indication whether or not that procedure was followed
in this case by LAPD?

A. It was.

Q. And is there any indication at some point it was not followed?

A. Yes. As far as the sequence of always handling the swatch, the
control swatch, at the same time that you control -- that you handled
the evidence swatch, there's evidence that that chain of doing these
things in series was not followed at all -- on all occasions.

Q. And what's that evidence?

A. Well, in this particular case there were two occasions where
samples were packaged and mailed to other laboratories; they were
mailed to the Department of Justice, and they were mailed to Cellmark.

Now, if this protocol was stringently adhered to and understood that
it needed to be stringently adhered to at every stage of manipulation,
then when those samples were sent, they should have sent the control
swatches because they had -- if you're going to package it, you have
to package the control, handle it the same way, and make sure you're
following that protocol to make sure there's not transfer.

But, in fact, those specimens -- the evidence items were mailed to the
DOJ and Cellmark, and the controls weren't mailed with them. So that
says they weren't following this as religiously as they should be as
far as handling the control always at the same time as the evidence.

Q. Now, you're familiar with the National Research Counsel Report on
Forensic Applications of DNA Technology issued in 1992, are you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And I want you to read the statement and tell me if you agree with
this one.

MR. BLASIER: For the record, it comes from page 67 of that report.

(Page displayed on Elmo.)

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. This calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Well, let me ask you --

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, we're over the hour.

Are we going to be longer?

MR. BLASIER: Yeah, we are going to be longer.

THE COURT: How much longer?

MR. BLASIER: I have a video to go through, and a few other things, and
some boards to go through. It may be another hour.

THE COURT: Two hours? You said one hour.

MR. BLASIER: I said one to two.

THE COURT: 10-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Dr. Gerdes, where there is contamination, does it
always show up on controls?

A. Not always.

Q. And if you do have what might be contamination show up on a
control, does that affect the reliability or protect the reliability
of other tests done -- results of other tests done at the same time?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it accurate the PCR tests done by LAPD in this case in
particular were all done at the same time?

A. Yes.

Q. Pretty much?

A. Well, two different days they did the PCR.

Q. Okay.

Now, you indicated expressing your opinion about the reliability of
results in this case, PCR results, that you reviewed a videotape that
was prepared by the Police Department Scientific Investigation
Division, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was a videotape that was prepared by them for their
presentation in the criminal case to demonstrate the technique that
they use to collect evidence in this case, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And let's start that video. It's 955.

(The instrument herein described as a demonstration videotape showing
Andrea Mazzola was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit
No. 955.)

Q. This video is Andrea Mazzola collecting samples as she collected
them in this case?

A. As a demonstration, yes.

(Videotape played.)

Q. Can you tell what she's doing there?

A. Yeah. I believe she's --

MR. BLASIER: All right. Stop right there. Stop it there.

A. Oops.

MR. BLASIER: Can you back it up just a little bit. Little more. Stop
there, please.

(Tape rewound.)

Q. You see her right hand?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is her right hand doing?

A. Well, her right hand is resting on the pavement there, so even
though it's gloved, she has now transferred anything that was on the
pavement at that exact spot onto her glove.

MR. BLASIER: Let's go.

Continue.

(Videotape resumes playing.)

THE WITNESS: Stop.

MR. BLASIER: Stop, please.

(Videotape playing ceases.)

THE WITNESS: You know, she just picked up the tweezers in that right
hand, so now she transferred anything that was on the pavement onto
the tweezers. And the tweezers, if you look closely, I think are held
within the hand so the point of the tweezers are touching the glove,
so now the tweezers are contaminated. At least anything that was on
the pavement there that she touched the glove to is now on the
tweezers.

MR. BLASIER: Continue, please.

(Videotape resumes playing.)

A. Now she picked up those same tweezers. Now if they had anything on
them -- she's taking an evidence swatch now, now they transferred onto
the evidence swatch.

Now she's collecting the blood. This is a substrate control she's
doing first here.

Q. Which is supposedly a clean area separated from the blood spot.

Now, this is the substrate alcohol that she --

A. Correct.

Q. -- that we talked about?

A. Correct.

So it's an area adjacent to the blood, presumably shouldn't have
anything there. And that's the control. Now she's placing it into a
plastic bag.

Q. And she's touching about everything with her right hand?

A. Well, yeah, her right hand and her left hand are touching now and
--

Q. The things that were on her right hand could now be on her left
hand?

A. Correct.

Q. You agree that she's probably not even aware --

A. I'm sure she's not aware.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, calls to speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I think you can see that there are some swatches that are on the
ground there that -- when she shook that out, they're on the ground.
So the technique they use to get those swatches is not very efficient,
but I'm sure they make, you know --

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now is she getting another swatch?

A. Right. And she's moistening that now -- you know, that I don't -- I
don't know if I saw that or not because you could touch the dropper to
the swatch. I don't know.

MR. BLASIER: Stop there, please.

(Videotape ceases playing.)

(Video tape resumes playing.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, do you see the moisture that she put on the
ground for the substrate control; what has happened to that?

A. Well, the moisture has sort of spread out so it's touching the
blood stain.

Q. And would you agree that that could cause any material that's in
that moist area to now get into the blood?

A. Yes.

Q. Go on, please.

A. Now she's dabbing the blood, and she -- you can see she's trying to
get the blood to come up on the swatch. She's actually moving that
into the substrate control area too, so -- there -- you definitely see
it there.

And the way this technique is performed, you can see that the rubbing
back and forth is definitely going to be -- you can almost see flakes
on that tweezers there of blood that's now on the tweezers. So you
definitely got some blood on that tweezers, forceps.

Q. She's taking the wet swatch and putting it in a plastic bag?

A. Correct.

Q. What affect does that have on the degradation of DNA?

A. Well, it accelerates it because it's a nice, close, warm
environment. It won't dry in that bag, so if it's -- as long as
there's moisture, bacteria can grow, so it encouraged degradation of
the DNA by bacteria growth.

Q. That was then put in the back of a crime scene truck and left it in
the sun for a number of hours.

A. In this case, that's correct.

Q. What kind of affect would that have?

A. It's like an incubator. It's like a perfect environment.

You know, she didn't -- she's wiping the tweezer, she's only using
water. And as sensitive as this technique is, you can't wipe DNA off.
You should use a separate sterile instrument.

Now, I guarantee you could possibly get DNA off those tweezers again
from that blood stain that she just took. Even though she's doing a
pretty thorough job of trying to wipe it off, she's just using water.

Q. Now the right hand --

A. That's not going to clean DNA off.

Q. The right hand's going on the ground there?

A. Right. Correct.

Q. Now she touched her leg there with the glove. Now what's she doing?

A. Now she's wiping the area with the glove.

And you also notice she didn't change her gloves in between, though
presumably she's going on to the next specimen. She didn't change her
gloves in between. So all of those incidents where she possibly got
something on the glove, it's because she hasn't changed her gloves.
Now they're still on the glove.

Q. Now she appears to be getting an envelope and writing something on
it, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And --

A. She's writing with that right hand and now has something on it
because of the -- or may have, so now she transferred whatever that
DNA is onto her pen, presumably the same pen she's using for recording
the evidence all the way through the entire -- all the evidence she's
collecting today or during this particular setting.

Now she got her hand on the ground again I believe.

Q. She's brushing the ground?

A. Yes. And --

Q. There's the pen?

A. There's the pen again.

Then she has the pen and the cap in the other hand.

Q. Now, the cap has gone into the crime scene box.

A. Into the crime scene box. Now whatever is on her hand got on the
cap is now in the box.

And again, she's moving onto -- she's trying to wipe those tweezers
off with just water.

Q. Now she has the end of the tweezers in her right hand?

A. Yes, she does.

So everything that's been brushed around with her hand is on the
tweezers, and she's now introducing that tweezer into the swatch.

The cap, you notice, is on the ground, so -- the cap for the swatches,
so if there's something there where she put the cap, now it's on the
cap.

Q. Now what's she doing?

A. She's doing another substrate control.

MR. BLASIER: You can turn it off now.

(Videotape ceases playing.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, did you also evaluate in assessing
reliability of the PCR results in this case, the procedure used by
Collin Yamauchi to process the samples he analyzed on June 14 and 15?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there anything important about the order in which he processed
the items?

A. Yes.

Q. And tell us what that is?

A. Well, ideally, forensic laboratories are aware that it's -- the
greatest risk of cross-contamination is when you do what I described
in explaining how it happens, that is handle a sample with a lot of
DNA, and then handle a sample after that that's an evidence item which
may have a very small amount of DNA.

So you want to try and set up the order that you do things so that,
number one, you never do reference items which are known exemplars or
known blood specimens or from known individuals, you never want to do
those at the same time and in the same place that you do evidence
items.

They should be separated, well separated, so that there's no
possibility of accidentally getting something on your glove and then
walk it down and -- or getting it on the pen while you're working
there and transferring these things.

They should be done totally separately and everything cleaned in
between in terms of bleaching down and making sure that there's no
possibility of that transfer.

Now, that was not done in the LAPD -- by the LAPD. They handled Mr.
Simpson's reference vial as the very first thing they handled.
Immediately after that, the blood of the -- of the glove was sampled,
in the wrist area of the glove, specifically. And then immediately
after that, the Bundy drops.

So the sequence of events is -- is a setup for the possibility of
transfer between Mr. Simpson's reference vial to the glove to the
Bundy blood drops.

Q. Now, Mr. Yamauchi also testified, I think, that on the first day
that he did tests, he tested 23 items at the same time?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is there any -- did you find any fault with that?

A. Well, that is an awful lot of items if you think about how
carefully that you need to do everything when you do a crime scene.

For instance, what Gary Sims would do, changing paper and washing down
the bench in between everything, and changing gloves in between
everything is an extremely laborious, tedious process where you
consciously think about these things at every step.

It will take all day to do four or five samples for Gary Sims. As a
typical thing, he just takes his time, he makes sure that he does one
item and he cleans up, and he does another -- the next item, and he is
very careful and meticulous.

23 items at one time, and getting it through the entire processing,
not only the DNA extraction, but the amplification of the typing, in
one day, is a tremendous number of samples.

Q. So the record is clear, isn't it accurate that every single item of
evidence that was sent to Department of Justice and Cellmark was
collected by the Los Angeles Police Department, using the techniques
we've seen --

A. That's --

Q. -- and processed through LAPD?

A. Correct.

Q. Thank you.

Now, what is an artifact?

A. An artifact is a defect in the typing system that -- the DNA system
that you're using. And what it simply means is you may get -- as I'm
sure you're aware, on these DQ Alpha strips there are dots and those
dots reflect, presumably, the presence of DNA.

Well, there are certain situations where you can get weak signals on
those dots, and it doesn't really reflect the fact that there was DNA
in the original sample. It's a defect in the way the sample is washed,
so that you can get what's called cross-hybridization, that is a weak
signal.

That is because of the fact that if two different genes are very
close, and you haven't washed it properly, you can have these weak
signals that show up, and it's not because of the fact there was DNA
there, it's because of the fact that there's a problem in the way the
sample was washed.

Okay. And where that's the biggest problem is where the genes come
closest together in terms of their sequence, their very close, and it
takes very -- what's called stringent conditions to be able to
differentiate those.

And sometimes I'll have a weak signal, a bleed through, if you will,
and it's not because there's any DNA in that particular allele there,
it's because of this artifact, the washing artifact. So it's called an
artifact.

You need to be able to recognize that to say that's not real, that's
just something -- a problem with this particular way in which we
detect the DNA after we've amplified it.

Q. Now, if the testing kit that is produced by Kirk and Zelmer
(phonetic) is followed pursuant to the -- the book that tells you how
to do the test, should you see cross-hybridization show up?

A. If you use DNA -- greater than 6 nanograms of DNA, that is a fairly
large number of DNA, actually, you would see this type of
cross-hybridization. You certainly should not see that frequently. It
should be rare. And my experience in looking at other laboratories is
it is rare, you don't see that often.

Q. Is it an indication that the test has not been done properly?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you always tell the difference between cross-hybridization and
contamination?

A. No.

Q. Now, let's look at civil board 1279.

(Exhibit 1279 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Doctor, you recall this board from the criminal
trial?

A. Yes.

Q. And -- now, this indicates the DQ Alpha testing strips produced by
the Department of Justice for LAPD item number 30, which was a Bronco
console stain, item 31, which was in the same area from the Bronco,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And this third strip down here that says QC816, what is that?

A. That's quality control. And one of the controls we didn't talk
about is called a positive control, and that's simply a known sample
that is run to ensure the strips are -- are good, and that the
appropriate type is being found on a known.

And so this is -- at the Department of Justice, what they have is
individuals at the laboratory where they know what their type is; they
do blood stains, those are run in concurrence with cases and -- so
that you can look at the typing results on those knowns that
presumably came from, or did come from single individuals, and then
that gives you confidence that there weren't any artifacts in that
typing run.

Q. And you should also --

A. So that you're running --

Q. You should only see the two alleles that belong to the person that
made up the sample?

A. That's correct. Every individual only has 2 alleles, that's two
numbers. If you find three, that means that's either a mixture,
meaning there's more than two individuals there, or one of those
artifacts occurred, or there's contamination.

Q. Now, the bottom strip indicated positive control.

What is that?

A. This is a control that is incorporated in the kit itself, the
company provides this, and it simply is another mechanism of just
checking that the strips were made correctly, and that the appropriate
typing results is being obtained. It's a 1.1,4 genotype DNA that's
just sent to the laboratory and they're asked to type it as a control.

Q. Now, is it accurate that all of these four testing strips are all
done at the same time?

A. Yes.

Q. And so that these two controls at the bottom were done at the same
time as 30 and 31?

(Indicating.)

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, the fact that there's an indication of a third allele --
fourth allele, I'm sorry, QC816, what should that have come back?

A. That's a 1.2, 1.2.

Q. You actually should have seen one allele?

A. That's correct. That's the homozygote person.

Q. The person who got the allele from both parents?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. That strip actually showed something other than what it was
supposed to show?

A. It showed a 1.1 and hint of a 1.3.

Q. You've heard the terminology hints and traces and hint of traces?

A. Yes, that's a nomenclature that they use at the DOJ.

Q. Okay.

And the fact that you see occasions of two alleles that aren't
supposed to be there, is that an indication that's a problem with the
test?

A. Yes. It indicates -- this obviously is a quality control. It should
have come from a single individual. Even though the singles are weak
-- singles are weak here, it indicates one of two things; either
there's a contamination event here or the hybridization was performed
in such a manner that there's cross-hybridization, that's an artifact,
and because of the washing conditions in this particular batch, you've
got these weak signals.

Q. Now, in the positive control, what typing -- what alleles should
you have seen on the positive control?

A. The 1.1, 4.

Q. And the fact there's an indication of a 1.3 tells you what?

A. Again, either that positive control somehow got contaminated or
there is a problem with the washing and -- in this particular run, and
the 1.3, either the washing, or the development time, I should qualify
that, but one or the other has created an artifact so that that 1.3
dot which shouldn't be visible at all is visible.

Q. And could that be contaminated as well?

A. It could be.

Q. Now, the development lengths, what does that mean?

A. Well, these strips, after you've hybridized the DNA to them, then
you go through a color development reaction that allows these dots to
become visible.

And it's very -- it's analogous to developing a photograph.

So if any of you have done photography, you know that you can
overdevelop or underdevelop a photograph when you're in the -- doing
that process.

You allow it to go for a certain amount of time until the dots become
visible and then you stop it.

And if you allow it to go for a longer period of time, then the dots
are going to become more intense. The longer you let it go, the darker
they get.

And so that's critical in terms of the intensity that you'll observe
on that strip in terms of how long you allow it to develop before you
stop the development.

Q. Now, the Department of Justice in interpreting item 39 interpreted
this as --

A. 31.

Q. I'm sorry, 31, as being a 1.3 representing a real DNA, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And they ignored the extra alleles on the controls, did they not?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in your opinion, given what showed up on the controls here, are
the results for 30 and 31 reliable?

A. No, because the controls failed.

Q. Now, what is the -- in calling this a real allele, and calling
other ones not real alleles, is there a great deal of subjectivity
that goes into this?

A. Yes. If it's taken in a scientific test, it should be totally
objective. You should be able to look at these and read off the
numbers and that's the result. But because of this artifact, now it
means on certain alleles, especially the one alleles, now it becomes
subjective.

You look at it and you say, well, it's kind of, there's maybe
something there, but you know, I really don't think that's real in
this case. Then the next time you look at it, you'll say, well, maybe
that is real, and your decision becomes a subjective decision as to
whether to count it as real or not.

So the discrimination ability of the test has been lost, it's been
converted from a scientific test to a subjective test, that in the
opinion of the analysis -- the analyst, this is the interpretation, as
opposed to a strict scientific just read it out and this is what the
results mean.

Q. And certainly two experts ought to be able to look at the same data
and come up with the same conclusion, shouldn't they?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's look at 1281.

(Exhibit 1281 is displayed.)

Q. Now, you recall seeing this board?

A. I do.

Q. And on this board we have four strips.

Item 52, which is a Bundy blood drop, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. QC877, which is a control quality. That should have come back as a
1.1 and a 4?

A. No, that one is 3, 4.

Q. 3, 4, I got ya.

Then a positive control that was supposed to be a 1.1, 4, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And these three strips were all run at the same time, were they
not?

A. They were.

Q. On item 52, a Bundy blood drop, there is evidence of a dot at the
1.3, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And if that is actual DNA, that would be an indication of a
component in the Bundy blood drop that was inconsistent with Mr.
Simpson, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And what did the Department of Justice in interpreting this, what
did they decide about whether this allele was real or not?

A. They decided that was not real.

Q. And comparing the two charts, what they decided was real and not
real, is that a good example of the problems with the subjectivity of
this kind of analysis?

A. I think it is, yes.

Q. And the results on the Bundy blood drop, if that's real DNA, are
consistent with some other contributor contributing to that stain,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And 52 -- well, it's actually a fairly large stain compared to the
other Bundy drops, was it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. It was -- about how much DNA was in 52?

A. Well, if I remember correctly, it was around 200 nanograms of
degraded DNA, but on slot blot and interpretation of the RFLP, around
25 nanograms of undegraded.

Q. And the other Bundy drops had all the way down to 2 nanograms?

A. Yes, ranged from 1 to 4.

Q. And I think you testified that one drop of blood should have about
a thousand?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, look at -- look at civil 1275.

(Exhibit 1275 is displayed.)

Q. You've seen that chart before?

A. I have, yes.

Q. Now, would you agree that in forensics cases, the reference sample
from the suspects and from the victims is critical?

A. Yes.

Q. I mean it's kind of like the hub of a wheel from which everything
else is compared to, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the reference samples should be done -- because of the way
they're collected, certainly should be clean, and only have one
person's DNA in it, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right.

Now, at the top of this chart we have the DQ Alpha types for Mr.
Simpson and the two victims and the GC locus of the polymarker system.

Why don't you tell me quickly what that is?

A. The polymarker is a similar system to DQ Alpha. It looks at five
other genes other than DQ Alpha, and as far as the format is as to how
it's interpreted and read, it's the same kind of thing, you're looking
at dots, but it's -- the GC is one of those five and it's just a
second gene that you would have to look at that's in a similar way to
DQ Alpha.

Q. Okay.

And Mr. Simpson's GC type is a BC?

A. Correct.

Q. And he's the only one that has a B allele in that locus?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, did you evaluate the typing sheets produced by LAPD on the
reference samples that they typed?

A. Yes.

Q. And -- incidentally, those again were done in the same runs as the
evidence, were they not?

A. Yes, this is a second day now, and what happened here is, item 12,
which is a Rockingham sample, was processed, and then after that
Nicole Simpson's reference sample and Ron Goldman's reference sample.
They were all processed together and in that order.

Q. And item 12 is a drop that was found on the Rockingham foyer?

A. That's correct.

Q. That had -- that had a lot of DNA in it?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. Now, what result did Mr. Yamauchi get for Nicole Brown Simpson's
reference sample that was processed in the same run after item 12?

A. He records a 1.1, 1.1.

Q. You have examined that strip, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there evidence of an additional allele in that?

A. It's very faint, but I think I can see there is definitely a 1.2 --
a hint of a 1.2.

Q. The only potential source among the three people involved here of
1.2 is Mr. Simpson?

A. Of those three people, correct.

Q. Certainly there would be a 1.2 in abundance in item 12?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, you've examined the strip produced by Mr. Yamauchi for Ronald
Goldman, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And what -- what alleles show up on that strip?

A. The 1.3 and a 4 and he records a faint 1.1 which is definitely
visible.

Q. You agree there's a 1.1 there?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see a 1.2?

A. No, you don't see -- you see that dot, but in this particular case
it's because of, again, the way this typing is set up, the dot for the
1.2 is not specific only to 1.2. It's 1.3, 1.2 or 1.3 or 4. It's
called masked because the 4 dot would also light that dot up. You also
have to consider whether that -- when you have a 1 allele plus a 4,
then you also have to consider the possibility that the 1.2 could be
there. It's a possible allele.

Q. And that's really a deficiency in the DQ Alpha kit?

A. It's a deficiency in the way the testing strip is set up.

Q. It doesn't have a dot specific to the 1.2, you have to do that by
deduction?

A. That's correct.

Q. The 1.1 that shows up in Mr. Goldman's sample is consistent with
the 1.1 in item 12, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the 1 -- the possible 1.2 is also consistent with item number
12, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And could not have come from Mr. Goldman.

A. Correct.

Q. At the time this run was done, isn't it accurate that the substrate
controls for item 12 and other items that were run in the same run,
were run one after -- I mean the sample is run, and the substrate
control was run as you described it should have been done, correct?

A. Yes, according to what they recorded, that was the case.

Q. And for this run which was on the 15 --

A. 15.

Q. How many items were run?

A. 19.

Q. And isn't it accurate that none of the substrate controls showed
any possible extraneous alleles?

A. That's correct.

Q. And is that an example of how you can -- how you can get possible
contamination or extraneous alleles that didn't show up on the
substrate control?

A. I believe it is, yes.

Q. Now, you've reviewed the typing sheet produced by Cellmark for the
two victims' reference samples, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Cellmark, in processing Nicole Brown Simpson's, got the correct
result, but in the -- in the polymarker system, there is evidence of a
B allele in the GC locus, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. The only source of that among the three people is Mr. Simpson,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in their typing of Mr. Goldman, they got that one right?

A. Yeah. In both of those cases, the C dot was extremely faint, so the
strips were not developed nearly as long as they would have been -- as
they were developed at LAPD. By looking at the C dot comparisons, you
can tell.

Q. Let me ask you about that.

Cellmark uses a shorter development time than the Department of
Justice, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And isn't it true that if you use a shorter development time, that
they -- that may mask the presence of contamination, that doesn't show
up, because you don't let the dots develop?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

Now, Department of Justice also tested both victims in December of
'94, and you've reviewed those DQ Alpha strips?

A. I have, yes.

Q. And isn't it true that the Department of Justice, when they tested
Nicole Brown Simpson's, found a trace of a 1.2 allele?

A. That's what they record on their sheet. That's correct.

Q. This is not a masked allele because you don't have the 4 allele,
you can tell --

A. That's a true 1.2.

Q. True 1.2. Again, the only source of that among the three people is
Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. And for Mr. Goldman they also found a faint trace of a 1.1 and a
possible 1.2, and this one might be masked because you have the 1.2?

A. That's right. You have to consider it because of the way the test
is set up, but the 1.1 is definitely visible.

Q. They recorded it?

A. Yes, they record it on their sheet.

Q. The only source of that is Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, it's true that some of these might be cross-hybridization as
well, correct?

A. Yes. Well, basically, the alleles that are showing up here are the
alleles that can cause artifact or be due to artifact, but the
interpretation that -- my interpretation of this is either there is a
coincidental artifact that happens in all three labs, to come up with
those same results, which is unlikely, I think, or cross-contamination
happened between these samples and the cross-contamination occurred at
LAPD and then was repeated -- retyped at Cellmark and DOJ.

Q. Now, would you agree that the most reasonable explanation for that
is cross-contamination, not cross-hybridization?

A. That's my opinion, yes.

Q. In a reference sample, again, that's the known sample taken in this
case from Mr. Simpson, and the two bodies at the autopsy, correct?

A. That's correct. So cross-contamination in this case means that a
substantial amount of DNA had to have been transferred because all of
those have a lot of DNA.

Q. Incidentally, the B allele, there's nothing indicated in the
literature that that could be caused by cross-hybridization, is there?

A. No. So that that is a second gene system. That confirms -- to my
mind, confirms the DQ Alpha system in terms of an interpretation of
this being cross-hybridization by a second gene system.

Q. And these are all high-concentration DNA samples, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Dr. Gerdes, would you please tell the jury how many times you have
collected evidence at a crime scene?

A. I have never collected crime scene evidence.

Q. Would you please tell the jury how many times you yourself have
tested crime scene evidence?

A. Never.

Q. Would you tell the jury then, how many times your lab has tested
crime scene evidence?

A. We don't do forensic testing.

Q. Well, maybe you could tell the jury then, how much training you
have in forensic crime scene analysis?

A. Well, my training is in regards to my experience of being involved
in the field of DQ Alpha PCR testing since -- essentially, since its
beginning, in terms of interpreting results and consulting on other
cases.

Q. Consulting with criminal defendants; is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. And their lawyers?

A. Correct.

Q. And how many times have you yourself given classes in forensic
science?

A. Never.

Q. How many classes in forensic science have you ever taken?

A. None specifically for forensics.

Q. And your experience in -- in evidence collection is all experience
you've gained working on behalf of criminal defendants; is that right.

A. Well, reading the literature and working in testimony of those
cases, that's correct.

Q. Have you ever conducted any validation studies on forensic evidence
samples?

A. No.

Q. Have you ever conducted any experiments in the forensic evidence
area?

A. No.

Q. Have you ever published a peer review article in the forensic
science area?

A. Not peer review, no.

Q. Are you even a member of the American Academy of Forensic
Scientists?

A. No.

Q. Now, Robin Cotton is, isn't she?

A. Yes.

Q. Gary Sims?

A. Yes.

Q. They're experienced forensic scientists, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you are not?

A. Other than what I've told you, no.

Q. Why don't you tell the jury how many times you yourself have run
the DQ Alpha test using the DQ Alpha kit?

A. Not very many times. I think we have one kit that I ran at one time
--

Q. Okay.

A. -- just to run it.

Q. You've run it one time.

Gary Sims has run it, what, a thousand, 2,000?

A. I'm sure he has, yes.

Q. How about Robin Cotton?

A. I'm sure she's run it a number of times.

Q. Okay.

So you're looking at their DQ Alpha test results on a test that you
yourself have almost never run; is that right?

A. That's correct. The tests should be run so that independent
scientists --

Q. Why don't you answer my question.

MR. BLASIER: He's trying to answer, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) The D1S80 test, why don't you tell the jury how
many times you've run that test yourself?

A. We don't run that test.

Q. You've never done it?

A. We run a similar test.

Q. No, I'm asking you if you've ever run the D1S80 test?

A. Not that specific test.

Q. So you yourself have never done any forensic evidence testing, you
don't run the test that we're discussing here, but you have testified
frequently in court as an expert, isn't that right, sir?

A. That's right.

Q. 35 times?

A. Correct.

Q. And every single time on behalf of a person charged with a crime,
correct?

A. Every time for the defense, that's correct.

Q. Every time on behalf of a person charged with rape, murder or both,
right?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant, argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) All of your work in this area is on behalf of
criminal defendants who are trying to get off of rape or murder
charges?

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: You've gone far enough with that.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Okay.

And on the times that you have testified in court, every single time
your testimony has been that the DNA evidence is contaminated and not
reliable; isn't that right, Doctor?

A. No, I've never -- I haven't always said it was contaminated. I have
always been concerned over the design of this particular dot blot base
type of testing.

Q. It was -- your testimony was always that the evidence was
unreliable; is that right?

A. It's been critical of the DNA -- of that specific type of DNA
testing, yes.

Q. And that specific type of DNA testing is done by hundreds of
forensic labs across the country, isn't it?

A. It is now, yes.

Q. It's accepted in probably every court in the country, isn't it?

A. It is now.

Q. And it's now a well established part of forensic science; isn't it,
Doctor?

A. I think you can say that, yes.

MR. LAMBERT: This be a good time, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Okay.

1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the case, don't form or
express any opinion.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

JOHN C. GERDES, the witness on the stand at the time of the luncheon
recess, having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified
further as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Now, Dr. Gerdes, I'd like to make sure that the jury is clear on
what you are saying and what you're not saying here today.

First, you're not opining that the RFLP test results obtained by
Cellmark and the Department of Justice were in any way the result of
contamination, are you, Doctor?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Beyond the scope. Nothing offered by my RFLP
results.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. On the RFLP -- there's only one RFLP that I would suspect might be
cross-contamination. That's item 52, which is a Bundy blood drop. All
of the rest are valid results.

Q. Valid results. And the RFLP test, you concur, is a well recognized,
high quality test, isn't it?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. All right. So all those test results are good test results that the
jury can rely upon?

A. In my opinion, that's true.

Q. Now, in regard to the PCR test, you're not saying that the PCR test
results in this case were the result of contamination; only that they
-- it's possible that they could have been; isn't that right?

A. There's a significant risk that they could have been, yes.

Q. And it varies, of course, from PCR result to PCR result, how high
that risk might be, in your opinion; isn't that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And in terms of actual evidence of contamination, the only items
that you pointed to during your direct examination were item 31, item
52, and the reference samples; isn't that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And other than those items, there is no other evidence of
contamination in any of the test results that you looked at in this
case?

A. There's no direct evidence of that.

Q. Well, let's put up here the Bundy results board.

Can you see this? I can tilt it a little bit.

A. I think I can see it.

Except for this corner on the bottom here, if you move these or the --

THE COURT REPORTER: Do we have an exhibit number, please?

MR. FOSTER: 291.

MR. LAMBERT: 291.

I have a sheet here; I forgot. 291,

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 291 displayed on the easel.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Now, this is a list of the various results of some
of the items collected at Bundy, correct, Dr. Gerdes?

A. Yes.

Q. The first one here, item number 47, that was tested by two
different labs, and they both got results consistent with Mr. Simpson,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the labs' results are consistent with one another, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And there's nothing in those results on that particular item that
you saw that would indicate any contamination, true?

A. Well, there's nothing directly in what you read off of there, in
terms of that reflects what was seen on the strip.

But I feel the way that that sample was handled, there's a significant
risk that this it could have been, due to cross-contamination.

Q. There's nothing in the actual readings that the labs got that shows
any evidence of contamination?

A. That's correct.

Q. So you're saying, based upon the way that sample was handled, you
think there could have been some contamination?

A. Correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Steve, would you put up -- put this up.

I'm going to put up on the Elmo, Dr. Gerdes -- I'll give you a copy,
too, because it might be easier for you to look at it there.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. LAMBERT: This will be the next in order, Your Honor, number --

THE CLERK: 2264.

(The instrument herein referred to as Chart entitled Bundy Crime Scene
Items was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2264.)

MR. LAMBERT: 2264 is labeled Bundy Crime Scene Items.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) This -- Dr. Gerdes, this document is a list of the
crime-scene items sampled by Collin Yamauchi on June 14, 1994; is that
correct?

A. I've never seen this list, but it appears to be that by its title,
yes.

Q. And you looked at Collin Yamauchi's notes --

A. Yes.

Q. -- that he prepared when he did that evidence sample, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. In those notes, he listed each of the items that he sampled, the
number of swatches for each item, just like this, right?

A. Yes. There is a form in there where you list the number of
swatches.

Q. And when Mr. Yamauchi was doing this sampling that day, he sampled
them just the way that you said they should be done in evidence,
alternating with the control item, correct?

A. That's what he records, yes.

Q. That day when he did this sampling, he sampled evidence items and
control items in parallel, correct?

A. That day, yes.

Q. All right.

And there were a whole number of swatches, as you can see on this
chart, for all these various evidence items that were handled that
day?

A. Yes.

Q. And some of these swatches were tested by Collin Yamauchi that day,
when he went through the PCR process, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. A swatch for each evidence item?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And in addition, other swatches, not the ones that Collin Yamauchi
tested, but other swatches for those same evidence items were sent to
the Department of Justice or to Cellmark Laboratories to have them
tested, correct?

A. I don't recall if he packaged it at exactly that moment. I don't
believe he did. At a later time, they were sent.

Q. They were sent. So the swatches that Collin Yamauchi took through
the PCR testing process were not the same swatches that went to
Cellmark and to DOJ, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So that if there was any contamination that took place during the
actual PCR process that Collin Yamauchi was following, that could not
have affected the test results of Cellmark or DOJ, true?

A. Unless the contaminant was in the other swatches at the time,
before it was tested.

Q. My question was, if a contamination took place during the PCR
process that Collin Yamauchi followed, rather than some earlier point
in time, then that contamination could not have affected Cellmark and
DOJ; is that true?

A. That's true.

Q. Okay.

So in order for your contamination possibility to account for all of
these test results, that contamination had to take place before Collin
Yamauchi started his PCR test, right?

A. Either that, or a subsequent time in which those samples were
handled at another time.

Q. Well, except we know that when Collin Yamauchi went through the PCR
process that day, he got these results that are the same as Cellmark
and DOJ, correct?

A. On the swatches he ran, yes.

Q. So we know that either those are the correct results for all those
swatches, or the contamination took place before?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, when contamination takes place, and you do PCR tests, the
normal result of that is that you see a mixture, correct?

A. Generally that's true, yes.

Q. But the PCR test, as you've described it, is so sensitive that it
can actually get just a few molecules from one person's blood, right?

A. Correct.

Q. So that if these evidence samples had somebody else's blood on
them, and then they somehow got contaminated, normally you would
expect to see two person's blood show up in the PCR test?

A. Unless they're excessively degraded, that's true.

Q. In this case, all of those samples that were tested from Bundy that
day, the ones that we have up on the video screen, there's no evidence
that there was two people's blood in there, is there?

A. On these specific items, no.

Q. Okay.

So in order for your possibility of contamination to exist here, you
would have had to have had first all of the DNA degrade, all of these
swatches, and then they would have all had to have been contaminated
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. That would all have to have taken place before Collin Yamauchi
started his amplification process?

A. Correct.

Q. It would have had to have happened so that every one of these
swatches in the case of 47, 4, in the case of 50, all the swatches had
to be contaminated, too, right?

A. Or at least the ones that were tested, yes.

Q. And first, they all had to be completely degraded, so the original
blood was out of them, and then they all had to be uniformly
contaminated; isn't that true?

A. That's true.

MR. LAMBERT: Would you move that up a little bit Steve, so I can see
the bottom.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) So we have 32 evidence swatches that he processed
that day, and seven control swatches. And in order for your
possibility of contamination to have -- be correct, all the evidence
swatches had to be completely degraded, and then all of them had to be
contaminated; isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. But there couldn't be any contamination on the control swatches,
because all of those control swatches tested negative for DNA, true?

A. That's true.

Q. So somehow, this contamination that you're talking about finds its
way into closed coin envelopes, into closed bindles, and only gets on
the evidence samples and not the control swatches. Is that what you're
telling this jury?

A. It has to get into those in a systematic basis, based on something.
It would be a systematic sort of contamination of those in sequence.

Q. And wouldn't it get on the control swatches at the same time,
Doctor?

A. One would think it should, yes.

Q. And here it did?

A. The swatches looked -- the substrate controls looked clean.

Q. Right.

In fact, those substrate controls were tested by Collin Yamauchi that
day, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then they were sent out to the outside labs, and they tested
them, as well, correct?

A. They weren't sent out -- they weren't sent out at the same time as
the evidence items, but eventually they were, yes.

Q. Right.

And when they were tested by the outside labs, they found no evidence
of contamination, correct?

A. That's true.

Q. So now we've had all of the substrate controls tested twice. No
evidence of contamination?

A. Yes.

Q. And it would only -- the PCR test is so sensitive, that it would
pick up even a few molecules of contaminant on those control swatches,
correct?

A. It should.

Q. All right.

Now, you testified that you thought that you know that this process is
so sensitive that it's possible that contamination can that place, and
you gave some examples: If somebody sneezes, if somebody puts their
hands up on the glass like this (indicating), that can somehow result
in contamination?

A. That can transfer the DNA to those objects. If those objects are
then handled, it would transfer to whatever is subsequently handled to
that object. So you transfer to your glasses; you transfer to what you
handle next.

Q. You're not saying any of those things actually took place when
Collin Yamauchi did this?

A. I have no proof.

Q. He doesn't even wear glasses, does he?

A. No, he doesn't.

Q. So that didn't happen, did it?

A. Andrea Mazzola wears glasses.

Q. She wasn't there in that room, processing this stuff?

A. No; she handled the original specimens.

Q. Certainly, people handling the original specimens in the -- and the
contamination is taking place during the evidence collection process,
you're certainly going to see mixtures, then, aren't you, Dr. Gerdes?

A. Not if those samples are degraded.

Q. Wait a second, Dr. Gerdes.

She's collecting evidence samples. You're saying she can
cross-contaminate from one evidence sample to the other, right?

A. Yes.

Q. At this point in time, you'd have to see a mixture, true?

A. Unless whatever she's transferring is in a much higher
concentration than what you're transferring to.

Q. You're saying one of the evidence samples might be so degraded, and
the other one is not degraded, then you can have a transfer? Is that
what you're saying?

A. Right. Correct.

Q. You haven't seen any evidence of that actually happening here?

A. I have no proof of that, no.

Q. Now -- and you made a point about how, in this instance, the order
in which Collin Yamauchi handled these evidence samples might somehow
affect your contamination possibility; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And is that -- that's because the first one of these evidence
samples that he handled was item 52, that had more DNA content?

A. No, it's because the first item that was handled was a reference
item of O.J. Simpson; and subsequent to that, the glove; and then
subsequent to that, the 52.

Q. 52. And 52 is the one that had more DNA content than the other
swatches?

A. Yes.

Q. Before he handled 52, when he got to these Bundy evidence swatches,
what was actually the very first thing that he handled?

A. As I said, the first thing he handled that day was Mr. Simpson's
reference vial.

Q. No. I'm talking about when he got to the evidence swatches from
Bundy.

A. Yes.

Q. What was the very first thing that he handled?

A. When he got to these?

Q. Yeah.

A. I can't remember if he did the control swatch first or after.

Q. Why don't we put up 333?

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 333 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

A. I have to check that in my notes.

Q. These are Collin Yamauchi's notes. And he took them in the order in
which he did things, correct?

A. Yes, in this, in organizing the evidence, yeah.

Q. Right. Okay.

Move it over a little bit.

The first thing he did was a control, right?

A. Yes.

Q. So before he even did item 52, he did the control for item 52,
which you admit is completely negative for DNA, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So if he was transferring somehow DNA from the reference sample
into the evidence samples, surely the very first swatch that he
touched, 52 control, would show some evidence of DNA, wouldn't it?

A. It should have, yes.

MR. FOSTER: That's 333.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) You would agree, Dr. Gerdes, when Mr. Yamauchi was
handling these evidence items this day, he changed his gloves after he
did the reference sample, correct?

A. I believe, from my recollection of his testimony in the criminal
trial. I'm not sure he was -- sure that he changed it between every
item.

Q. Well, Dr. Gerdes, we're not in the criminal trial now; we're in
this trial.

Have you read Collin Yamauchi's testimony from this trial?

MR. BLASIER: I object and move to strike.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I glanced through it. I haven't read it in as much detail as I did
the criminal trial.

Q. Well, you're going have to take my word for it, because Collin
Yamauchi testified he changed his gloves after he handled the
reference vial.

A. Okay.

Q. He then testified that during the process of sampling the
Rockingham glove, that he changed his gloves again during that
process.

You with me so far?

A. Yes.

Q. And he also testified that he then changed his gloves after he did
the Rockingham glove, and before he started on the evidence samples,
okay?

A. Okay.

Q. Now, you would agree, under those circumstances, it's very unlikely
that he was transferring enough DNA to -- to contaminate all 36 of
those evidence samples?

A. It would have to be a situation where it was something like a
pencil or something he was handling in common between those.

Q. It would show up on the control watches?

A. The controls don't always show the DNA, but it should have, yes.

Q. Just a few molecules of DNA can show up in those controls?

A. They should have, yes.

Q. And once again, all the controls were always negative, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And while this -- while he was doing the preparation of the Fitzco
card, and the sampling of the glove, you acknowledged that the
evidence samples, themselves, were in closed bindles inside of closed
coin envelopes, ten feet away, correct?

A. That's what the testimony is, yes.

Q. And there is no forensic literature that supports the theory that
the DNA could have somehow penetrated the coin envelopes and the
bindles, is there, Doctor?

A. No, it would not have penetrated those. It would have to be
something manipulated between, such as a pencil or something.

Q. And just before we take this Bundy board down, you will agree that
this nine-probe RFLP match on the rear gate is something that the jury
can rely upon as a valid DNA result, correct?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And a nine-probe match, that's an extremely important match?

A. It's a significant match.

Q. Very significant. Very significant in identifying Mr. Simpson as
the person who left the blood there; isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And now, item -- we'll come back to item 52 later. That's a little
bit of a different subject.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 293, board entitled Results of DNA Analysis,
Bronco Automobile, displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Now, this is a set of results from the Bronco
automobile, Dr. Gerdes?

A. Yes.

MR. FOSTER: 293.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And the only one of these that you mentioned at
all during your direct examination is item 31; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. So?

A. 30 and 31 were mentioned.

Q. 30 and 31, all of these other items. You've seen no evidence at all
of any kind of contamination in these test results themselves, have
you?

A. Well, there are results that are consistent with mixtures of -- and
mixtures and -- or they could be contaminants, I suppose. But
additional alleles are as to one individual.

Q. And as to item 30 and 31, you will agree that items 303, 304, 305.
They were taken from the same place in the Bronco, 30 and 31?

A. Those items were taken at a subsequent time, at a later time. In
the same place.

Q. The PCR results from 303, 304, 305, they validate the results from
30 and 31?

A. They appear to, yes.

Q. And that is evidence that 30 and 31 weren't contaminated, correct?

MR. BLASIER: Objection? Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It's a subsequent contamination from that same area.

Q. Which is evidence that 30 and 31 weren't contaminated?

A. Yeah, I guess you could say that.

Q. And I won't go back to the Bundy board, but I meant to ask you:

Nothing that you're testifying about here concerns in any way
conventional serology testing, does it, Dr. Gerdes?

A. That's correct.

Q. So that if it turns out, as the evidence has established, that the
item number 49, for example, that was a blood drop at Bundy, has the
same four conventional serology types as does Mr. Simpson, that would
be something that would tend to indicate that that item wasn't
contaminated; isn't that true?

A. That would have to be looked at independently as to how reliable
those results are, but yes.

Q. Well they're admitted in this case, so pretty reliable?

A. Again --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That misstates or never admitted any of this
stuff.

THE COURT: Well, I sustained the objection

If you're going to say that, say it fully.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And if only so -- if only one out of every 550
people had the four conventional types that item number 49 had, and
Mr. Simpson was one of those, one out of 550 people, that would be
pretty strong evidence that contamination doesn't account for item
49's DNA result; correct, Doctor?

A. I'd have to look at -- I mean, I'm a little -- I guess I could say
that, yes.

Q. And in regard to the various items on this chart, which show DNA
test results consistent with Mr. Simpson, you have no evidence that
these items ever came anywhere near Mr. Simpson's reference sample on
the day that they were handled by Mr. Yamauchi, correct?

A. These items were handled on the same day, originally, by LAPD, as
certain items that were collected from Rockingham, which are
consistent with O.J. Simpson's.

So that would be the possibility of cross-contamination in this
instance.

Q. My question had to do with the reference sample. Shall I ask it
again?

A. Yes.

Q. You cannot tell this jury that any of these items, when they were
handled by Collin Yamauchi, came into contact in any way with the
reference sample?

A. Not the reference sample.

Q. So your possibility of contamination as to the Bundy items, that
has to do with possible contamination from the reference sample, true?

A. Yes.

Q. That couldn't explain these, right?

A. That's right.

Q. So what you're saying is, some other contamination may have taken
place from some other evidence item?

A. Yes.

Q. But that would mean that other evidence items would have to have
contained Mr. Simpson's blood, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So are you assuming that that's the case?

A. That the items that I'm referring to would be items collected at
Rockingham, which are consistent with Mr. Simpson, if those which were
handled prior to these. So, yes, that's what I'm saying.

Q. You're saying the blood collected at Rockingham was Mr. Simpson's
blood?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I'm saying that blood has the same type, and therefore, that type
could have been transferred. I'm not saying it's him, it's consistent
with his type.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) You made a presentation at a conference called
Promega in late 1995, did you not.

A. Yes.

Q. You talked about this case?

A. I did.

Q. Here's a page from the proceedings in that case. I want to ask you
something about that.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Hearsay. I couldn't do it.

MR. LAMBERT: It's his own article. I'm asking him about something he
wrote in his article about this case.

THE COURT: About this case?

MR. LAMBERT: About this case.

THE COURT: Okay. Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. LAMBERT: This is a specific article on the test results in this
case. I want to ask him what he said right there.

(Court reads document proffered by Mr. Lambert.)

MR. BLASIER: Which part?

MR. LAMBERT: Right here (indicating), where Mr. Simpson acknowledged
he cut himself.

THE COURT: What do you want to offer this for?

MR. LAMBERT: I want to ask him if this is the basis for his conclusion
as to how the contamination on the second day of collection, that the
only way it could have been, is if it was actually his blood.

MR. BLASIER: This came out with --

THE COURT: Wait. I can't understand what he's saying, first. So let me
try to understand what he's saying. Then I'll hear from you, okay?

(Pause for Court to read document.)

THE COURT: Okay. With are you saying?

MR. LAMBERT: He's now saying that on the second day of collection,
it's possible that some contamination took place between evidence
collected at Rockingham and that found in the Bronco.

I want to ask him if the basis for that, as he states here, is that
the reason that that fits his theory, is that the evidence collected
at Rockingham was, in fact, from Mr. Simpson.

MR. BLASIER: It's a hearsay statement. We couldn't do this with Dr.
Weir, when I tried to use some of his article from the Simpson case.
We weren't allowed to do it.

THE COURT: What was it about Dr. Weir?

MR. BLASIER: He wrote an article about the Simpson case. You wouldn't
let me read excerpts from it.

THE COURT: What was it that he wrote that warranted you to use that?

MR. BLASIER: It was the article that he had written where he talked
about tape 31, as a matter of fact, and gave the wrong --

THE COURT: What did he say?

MR. BLASIER: You wouldn't let me read it.

MR. LAMBERT: You cross-examined him.

THE COURT: Will you stop it?

MR. LAMBERT: Sorry.

MR. BLASIER: I cross-examined him. You can cross.

THE COURT: Try to answer my question. I'm trying to get some
information from you.

What is it that I prevented you from asking Dr. Weir?

MR. BLASIER: I wanted to read -- like Mr. Lambert wants to do -- I
wanted to read from an article that he had written.

THE COURT: Tell me what it is so I can understand your point.

MR. BLASIER: It was a statement that he had in his paper about item
31.

THE COURT: And did he -- what did he say in the paper?

MR. BLASIER: He gave statistics about item 31 that were later
determined to be wrong.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: He stated his analysis there of how, gee, the defense
should have done it this way; it would have gotten much more favorable
results.

I was not allowed to do -- I was allowed to cross on it, but I wasn't
allowed to read the article.

THE COURT: Okay. And you want -- you want to ask him about this
highlighted part?

MR. LAMBERT: Yeah. Where he acknowledged that he cut himself.

THE COURT: That who acknowledged it? Simpson?

MR. LAMBERT: That's a good question. I'll ask this guy.

THE COURT: No, I'm not going to allow that.

MR. LAMBERT: What if Simpson told him?

MR. PETROCELLI: If it's an admission --

MR. BLASIER: We'll make an out-of-the-presence jury --

MR. LAMBERT: I'm entitled to ask him if he cut himself from Mr.
Simpson.

MR. BLASIER: Do it without the jury.

THE COURT: You can do it outside the presence of the jury, but I'm not
going to let you do that in front of the jury.

MR. LAMBERT: Okay. Maybe I should ask him where he got this piece of
information.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LAMBERT: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Outside the presence of the jury.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay.

Jurors, you want to step out in the back? Take them back into the
hallway or into my chambers.

Don't let them read anything on my desk.

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: The jury has left the courtroom.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) This is a portion of your paper from the Promega
Conference.

When you say, on the next morning here you're, talking about June the
15th, correct Doctor?

A. Correct.

Q. This is the second day of Collin Yamauchi's work?

A. Yes.

Q. Right.

And that's when evidence from Rockingham was processed that we just
talked about?

A. Yes.

Q. And here you say in parentheticals, "where Mr. Simpson acknowledged
he cut himself," right?

A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Simpson told you that?

A. That was my understanding from the testimony. He didn't tell me
that.

Q. From Mr. Simpson's own testimony, you heard that?

A. From the testimony of the criminal trial.

Q. What testimony was that, that led you to believe that he cut
himself?

A. I can't recall specifically. I can't recall where I saw it.

Q. Did this article -- before you presented it at Promega, it was
reviewed by Mr. Simpson's lawyers?

A. It was reviewed by one of their lawyers, yes.

Q. Barry Scheck?

A. No, Bill Thompson.

Q. Bill Thompson.

So Bill Thompson reviewed this article. He didn't tell to you take
that parenthetical out?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

A. He doesn't say anything about that.

MR. BLASIER: It's sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) You're sure you didn't hear that information
directly from Mr. Simpson, that he cut himself?

A. Pardon?

Q. You're sure you didn't hear that directly from Mr. Simpson, that he
cut himself?

A. Yes. I never spoke to Mr. Simpson.

MR. LAMBERT: That's all I have on that subject, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: So you never got that information from Mr. Simpson, did
you?

THE WITNESS: No.

THE COURT: Same thing he just asked.

MR. BLASIER: You don't know where that came from, do you?

THE WITNESS: That's correct; I don't.

MR. BLASIER: Thanks.

THE COURT: Okay. You want to argue it, go ahead.

MR. LAMBERT: Well, Your Honor, what I want to use it for is the
purpose of trying to clarify that his purpose, or his idea as to how
contamination could have taken place on that second day of collection
has to do with the evidence at Rockingham, one containing Mr.
Simpson's blood. That's the underlying hypothesis.

THE COURT: Why don't you ask him?

MR. LAMBERT: Can I do it with the jury?

THE COURT: No. Ask him now.

MR. LAMBERT: I don't think I want to let him practice too much, Your
Honor.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Isn't it, in fact, the hypothesis, Dr. Gerdes?

A. Well, it's not specifically that it's Mr. Simpson's, but that
particular item has a lot of DNA, and has the type that's consistent
with Mr. Simpson.

Q. Right. That particular item that's got an RFLP result, it's
directly indicative of being Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. Therefore, that is likely his blood. You're saying that could have
been the cause of this other?

A. Most likely the same type; so, yes.

MR. LAMBERT: That would be the examination, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

Bring the jury back in.

You may examine in the manner that you have just done.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. Can I use the exhibit?

MR. BLASIER: No.

THE COURT: No.

MR. LAMBERT: Okay. I'll do it without the exhibit.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to announce a disclaimer.
That's not my chambers.

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: I'm borrowing that chambers. And all the art work and
everything, except for - Are not mine.

(Laughter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Inside joke, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) We need to get the Bronco board.

MR. FOSTER: 293 again.

MR. PETROCELLI: 293, Gina.

THE COURT REPORTER: Okay. Thank you.

(Exhibit 293 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Dr. Gerdes, before the brief break, we were
talking about none of these evidence items that are consistent with
Mr. Simpson on this particular board could have come into contact with
the reference vial of Mr. Simpson and be explained by
cross-contamination from that vial, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So your only theory as to how any contamination could possibly
account for these results is if some of the Rockingham evidence
samples caused this contamination, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And that would mean that the Rockingham samples were also
consistent with Mr. Simpson's blood, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the -- once again, the -- this RFLP result down here, you're
not saying that was a result of contamination, are you, Dr. Gerdes?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. In that particular case, that there -- there's a very minor
component. I think Dr. Cotton's testimony was about 20, or Gary Sims'
testimony was around 20 nanograms of DNA in there. And it's when you
combine things of that -- in that nature, I think there is a risk of
-- of picking up a contaminant, especially when he estimates that the
-- The RFLP results were based on just 20 nanograms of DNA.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) But that's just theoretical, right?

You didn't see anything in the results to indicate contamination?

A. No I didn't, no.

Q. You're saying that's a, well, very --

A. I'm saying it's a risky kind of thing to do when you're trying to
combine things, and you're working with very small quantities of DNA
like that.

Q. But the RFLP results are basically consistent with the prior PCR
results from the same blood stain?

A. The appearances are consistent, yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, this is the result from Rockingham. And as to this five-probe
match, you're not saying that that was caused by any contamination,
correct?

A. No.

Q. Now, are you saying that either of these results were caused by
contamination?

A. Which two are you talking to, number 6 and number 7?

Q. Number 6 and 7.

You're not saying that either 6 or 7 is caused by any contamination,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So when Cellmark and DOJ got those items and tested them. They got
the correct results?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And you have no basis for saying that when those
evidence items were processed by LAPD, that they did anything to cause
any contamination?

A. There's no direct evidence of that.

Q. Let me show you a couple more boards quickly here.

(Exhibit 295 was displayed.)

MR. FOSTER: 320.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 320 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. LAMBERT: This it which exhibit?

MR. PETROCELLI: 320.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) This is the board showing the results of the DNA
analysis on the glove. And here again, we see several RFLP matches,
correct, Dr. Gerdes?

A. Yes.

Q. And once again, you would agree those could not possibly be caused
by contamination, correct?

A. The RFLP, no.

Q. Yes, sir.

Now, you, in regard to the PCR matches here, are you saying that any
of those might possibly be caused by contamination?

A. Yes.

Q. Which ones?

A. In the wrist area, the matches with Mr. Simpson -- that's the area
that was handled immediately after the reference sample? That's the
one where there's a possibility of that happening.

Q. Well, Collin Yamauchi didn't handle just the wrist area, did he?

A. No. He handled other areas, as well.

Q. Right.

So you would think if he was contaminating the wrist area, he would
have contaminated other areas, as well?

A. Not necessarily. Other areas may have had more competing DNA. It's
a matter of how much DNA was transferred, and what the background DNA
that he's amplifying the presence of, that's the state of that.

Q. But it seems likely that if he was contaminating the wrist area of
the glove, he either would have contaminated other areas on the glove
or the control swatch that he handled immediately after that. Isn't
that true, doctor?

A. That's a possibility.

Q. And let's finally look at RFLP results on the socks.

MR. PETROCELLI: 299. Referring to 299.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 299 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. This -- the results board on the socks found at Rockingham.

You agree, Dr. Gerdes that those RFLP results obtained by Cellmark and
DOJ are not possibly caused by contamination, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And, in fact, this 11-probe and 5-probe match together between
Cellmark and DOJ showing the blood of Nicole Brown Simpson was on
those socks. That's an extremely probative RFLP result.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Argumentative. Calls for legal conclusion.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, it is.

Q. MR. LAMBERT: And the nine-probe match showing Mr. Simpson's blood
is also on the socks.

That's a very significant result, isn't it, Dr. Gerdes?

A. It is.

Q. And do you have any reason to believe that any of the PCR results
on those socks are the subject of contamination?

A. No.

Q. So of all of the RFLP results --

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, that's Exhibit 299.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) -- of all of the RFLP results, the only one that
you have any quarrel with at all is item 52?

A. That's correct.

Q. We probably don't need any more. (Indicating to boards.)

Item 52 was one of the five Bundy blood drops, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And what's your basis for stating that that could have been caused
by contamination, even though it's an RFLP result?

A. Well, there's several different aspects.

Number one, extremely degraded sample -- there's a very small amount
of analyzable DNA. And it's at -- on the borderline of what's a level
that you can actually do an RFLP on.

And so because there's a very small amount of DNA there, the
concentration of DNA, at least in the range in which, theoretically,
you could have cross-contamination.

The second thing is the fact that it was handled at that time
subsequent to, or at the same time as the reference sample. And from
experience of other laboratories, that's a situation where you have an
extreme risk of the possibility of cross-contamination.

Q. Okay.

A. There's errors, where that has been shown to be the cause of those
errors.

Q. So you're saying that's a low amount of DNA in that particular RFLP
result, correct?

A. Very small amount of analyzable DNA, highly degraded sample.

Q. About how much analyzable DNA would you say, 25 to 50 nanograms?

A. About 25 nanograms is what Robin Cotton estimated.

Q. Right. She wouldn't have been able to get an RFLP result unless she
had about 25 nanograms to analyze with DNA?

A. That's correct. That's what I'm saying. It's right on the
borderline of what you need to get a result.

Q. She did get a result. You're not challenging her result, correct?

A. No. I'm saying that that result, because it is on the borderline of
RFLP, you're now in the realm of where there's a risk of
cross-contamination also showing up on an RFLP type of test.

Q. 25 nanograms?

A. Correct.

Q. At the very same time, as a matter of fact, right before Collin
Yamauchi handled that evidence item 52, we've just seen how he handled
control for 52, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in order to contaminate the control for 52, if he got on as
little as point 1 nanograms of DNA, it would have registered on the
PCR test, correct?

A. I'm not sure I'd go as low as point 1, but much smaller amount,
certainly one or around there.

Q. So something on the order of 100 times less DNA would have shown up
on the PCR test if the control item was contaminated, and would have
had to have contaminated the evidence item in order to get an RFLP
test?

A. It should have shown up.

Q. Right. Not very likely, is it, Doctor?

A. Again, these controls don't always come up. And so there are things
-- other explanations that are theoretical explanations to explain
that. But it should have come up.

Q. The control was tested right, then, by Collin, and it didn't show
anything at all, did it?

Now. Let's go back just briefly to Mr. Yamauchi's work on those two
days.

MR. LAMBERT: Let's mark this as the next in order.

THE CLERK: 2265.

(The instrument herein referred to as list of items - 6/14/94 and
6/15/94 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2265.)

MR. LAMBERT: I'll give you a copy, too. Easier to see.

(Counsel hands Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2265 to witness.)

Q. Now, Dr. Gerdes, this is a list of the two different runs done by
Collin Yamauchi on 6/14 and 6/15. We've listed the evidence items
tested. The exemplar you did, one exemplar that day for Mr. Simpson,
and all other controls.

And you will agree that Collin Yamauchi, when he did those sample
tests that day, employed all of those controls, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let's see. The next day -- then the next day he had 19 things,
19 samples tested. And again, we see all the controls that were used
by him when he ran those two tests, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Let's see the bottom.

So between the two days, 42 evidence -- 42 samples were run through
the process, 21 of them evidence samples, and 21 of them controls,
correct?

A. I'd have to add it up quickly.

I'll I take your word for it.

Q. And will you take my word for it that, therefore, 50 percent of the
samples that went through the process were actually controls? Right,
Doctor?

A. Yes.

Q. And every single one of them was negative for DNA, correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. LAMBERT: I have no further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. You testified that those controls were clean. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you take a substrate control as demonstrated by Andrea
Mazzola in their video of how to do it right, you should have some
dirt on the substrate controls. Shouldn't you?

A. That would be -- I mean yes. You should.

Q. And these controls were almost -- were clean in the sense that
there was no evidence of any dirt on them; isn't that true?

A. That's what's been recorded. I haven't actually seen them myself,
the actual swatches.

Q. What's "dry labbing"? What does that term mean?

A. Well, dry-labbing, means that you -- say you do an experiment and
you don't -- you just fake the results.

Q. Incidentally, you're aware of testimony by Andrea Mazzola from
August of 1994, that she put her initials on all the bindles that she
prepared prior to the time these evidence items from Bundy and
Rockingham went to Mr. Yamauchi?

MR. LAMBERT: Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes. I'm aware of that testimony.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you're aware that her initials don't show up
on any of those bindles?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you're aware that she testified that according to the procedure
used by the LAPD lab, the swatches that went into the bindles were dry
at the time they went in there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you're aware that one of the Bundy drops, 47, the bindle that
was later examined by Mr. Yamauchi, has a wet blood transfer stain --
several of them, actually?

A. I'm aware.

MR. LAMBERT: Beyond the scope. Irrelevant. Has nothing to do with this
witness's testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) When you talk about the reliability of RFLP
results, are you making any statements whatsoever with respect to the
source of the blood, that produced the spot, that produced RFLP
results?

A. No.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) In fact, the stain that Mr. Lambert asked you
about with what -- with the five-probe patch for Nicole Brown Simpson,
that had over 13 hundred nanograms from it, didn't it?

A. Yes. There's a lot of DNA in that.

Q. And that's more DNA than in all of these other stains combined,
isn't it?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, the back gate, 117, when you testified about the reliability
of those RFLP results. You weren't saying anything about the source of
the blood that came off the back gate, were you?

A. You can't say that. All you can say is the result that you get.

Q. And the results that were obtained -- in fact, there was large
amount of DNA in 117, as well?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. Far more than all of the Bundy stains put together, right?

A. That's true.

Q. And would you agree that the stain on the sock, and the stain from
117, are both consistent with blood coming from a reference tube, it
could have?

A. In terms of the amounts, yes; that's in that range.

Q. Now, let's talk about the Bronco, quickly.

You testified, did you not, that stains 30 and 31 -- that the original
tests that were done in June were not reliable because the controls
showed extraneous alleles, correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. P. BAKER: Looking at board 293.

(Defendants' Exhibit 293 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) When stains 30 and 31 were processed, there was
such a small amount of DNA, they couldn't do RFLP testing on it,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was only after two months later, in August, did they go back
and find, lo and behold, a lot more DNA, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope; leading; argumentative.

THE COURT: I'll sustain that part.

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: In 303, 304, 305, which were collected on August
29, there is a lot more DNA than there was in the original stains,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Much higher quality, too, right?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. And it was from the console, 303, 304, 305?

A. Yes, from the same area.

Q. Now, about the Rockingham glove --

MR. P. BAKER: That is board 320.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry?

MR. P. BAKER: 320.

(Defendants' Exhibit 320 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, your testimony about the RFLP results only
related to DNA consistent with the victims, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. The only DNA found on the Rockingham glove consistent with Mr.
Simpson were extremely small amounts of DNA in the wrist area,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And these gloves -- this glove was handled right after Mr. Yamauchi
opened Mr. Simpson's reference vial, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Mr. Yamauchi testified at the criminal trial that he didn't
remember changing his gloves between opening the reference vial and
processing that glove. Do you recall that.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for hearsay, what he testified to --
somebody else testified to at the criminal trial.

THE COURT: You can rephrase that.

I'll sustain the objection.

You may ask him if that was a factor that he considered.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Was it a factor that you considered in deciding
that Mr. Simpson's -- or blood consistent with Mr. Simpson on the
Rockingham glove came from possible cross-contamination, the packet
that Collin Yamauchi testified in the criminal trial, he didn't know
whether he changed his gloves?

A. Yes.

Q. And the areas it, the wrist areas where those stains were found,
were areas that were handled by Mr. Yamauchi with his hands, right
after opening Mr. Simpson's reference blood, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you're aware of the testimony? You relied on the testimony of
Mr. Yamauchi that the blood came out of that reference tube, onto his
gloves, and his chemwipes, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you gave some testimony with respect to cross-contamination
happening sometimes. You'll see evidence of more than one person as
evidence of contamination incident, that's what you saw on 30 and 31,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And sometimes you may only see evidence of one person. And tell me
the example where that could happen?

A. Where you would only see the evidence of one person?

Q. Yeah.

A. It's actually from two?

Q. Yeah.

A. That would be possible, certainly, if you had two homozygous
individuals, the combining of those two would be, actually look --
appear to be one person, but it's actually from two.

Q. How about excessively degraded samples?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

A. Excessively degraded samples would be an example where the initial
sample is so degraded, that the second contaminating DNA over -- over
-- well, the original type, and all you see is the contaminant.

Q. And every one of the Bundy drops was excessively contaminated,
weren't they?

A. They were.

Q. Unlike 117, which had high quality DNA, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, from the results that Mr. Yamauchi got on the 14 and 15 from
the Bundy swatches, you cannot conclude from that anything about the
source of the blood on those swatches, can you?

A. No.

Q. Mr. Lambert asked you questions about transfers of DNA, and you
mentioned something about glasses.

Do you recall reviewing the videotapes of Andrea Mazzola collecting
evidence at the Rockingham crime scene?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you make any observation about her collection technique,
vis-a-vis, her glasses in that video?

A. Yes. There's a sequence there where she actually does take a glove
and adjusts her glasses with her gloved hand and adjusts her glasses.

Q. Mr. Yamauchi never took any substrate controls from the glove, did
he?

A. No.

Q. Now, Mr. Lambert asked you what was your basis for concluding that
item 52 might be the result of cross-contamination.

Did you state everything that you considered in making that
assessment?

A. I believe I did. I may have forgotten something.

Q. Now, he also asked you about validation studies.

Every case that you look at, you look at validation studies of the
laboratory that you're looking at, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor. Beyond the court order.

MR. BLASIER: He opened it up.

MR. LAMBERT: No, no, no.

THE COURT: You're not getting into the area where I ruled, are you?

MR. LAMBERT: Yes, he is.

THE COURT: If you are, the objection is sustained.

MR. BLASIER: May we approach?

THE COURT: No.

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: Now, you were asked about forensic testing, and you
don't run a forensic lab correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, the technology that's used by crime labs is technology that
came from the clinical setting, in the medical setting that you work
in, correct?

A. The fundamental science is molecular biology. Then it goes to the
clinical field. And then it goes to forensics. Usually that's the way
it goes, yes.

Q. In the forensic community, they didn't develop any of the
fundamental sciences in just forensics?

A. No, they outlined the fundamental sciences developed in molecular
biology.

Q. And would you agree that one of the critiques of the forensic
community is the lack of controls that they have in terms of sample
collection, preparation, contamination controls, et cetera?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Vague and ambiguous. Critiqued by whom?

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Forensic labs that do this for a business,
generally come in and say it's okay, don't they?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) By the way, Dr. Gerdes, how many crime scenes has
Robin Cotton processed?

A. I believe she testified that she does not go to crime scenes, so I
would say none.

Q. And she has no forensic experience whatsoever prior to Cellmark,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Gary Sims, in the last five years, how many crime scenes has he
processed?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Lack of foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you know?

A. I notice he testified he hasn't gone to a crime scene in five
years.

MR. LAMBERT: Hearsay.

THE COURT: Well, it's hearsay, but we'll allow it.

MR. BLASIER: From all of the techniques that are used in forensics
that you've testified here about, are techniques that were used
previously, or for longer periods of time in the clinical setting that
you do your work in, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And all of the issues that you talked about, contamination and
sample processing, are all extremely important issues in the work that
you do every single day, correct?

A. Yes, that's true.

Q. And in your opinion, do you need to be a forensic scientist in
order to have any knowledge about DNA technology, as you do in your
clinical lab?

A. No.

Q. In fact, in the 35 times that you've testified, this is always
brought up, that you have a clinical lab and not a forensic lab; is
that correct?

A. That's true.

Q. You've been qualified by judges 35 times to testify as an expert in
this field?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes. That's true.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you. That's all I have.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. You will acknowledge that Robin Cotton and Gary Sims are forensic
scientists?

A. Yes.

Q. An they do, every day, test evidence from crime scenes, correct?

A. They -- they test the evidence; they don't collect the evidence.

Q. They test it?

A. Yes.

Q. You never test evidence at crime scenes?

A. That's true.

Q. Now, you were asked by Mr. Blasier whether any of these controls
were dirty, and said you didn't know, right?

Let's look at the very first control, the one I've been asking you all
the questions about. Number 52 control.

Here's Collin Yamauchi's notes.

Move them over a little bit.

See what it says right there? What's that say?

A. Is says "pink."

Q. Pink color, right?

A. Yes.

Q. That was taken from the driveway at the back of the Bundy
residence, wasn't it?

A. Yes.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 333 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. That driveway has got a pink coloration to it, doesn't it, Doctor?

A. I believe it does.

Q. Dr. Gerdes, how much has Mr. Simpson paid you already, thirty,
forty thousand dollars?

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

A. In this civil case?

Q. Total.

A. For both cases?

Q. Yeah.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant; outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I am not -- my laboratory has a policy of basically any consulting
fees go to the laboratory. I've received zero.

Q. How much has the lab received?

A. Somewhere around forty thousand, probably.

MR. LAMBERT: No further questions, Doctor.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. How much is your lab receipt for the work in the civil case?

A. We have a retainer and --

Q. How much?

A. Five thousand.

Q. Okay. Thank you, sir.

THE COURT: Everybody finished?

MR. LAMBERT: I'm done.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, you're excused until tomorrow at 9 o'clock.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: I would like to address the motion to quash the subpoena by
Sojourn Services.

MS. WITHEY: Good afternoon. Pamela Withey, appearing for Sojourn
Services for Battered Women in the Ocean Park Community Center.

We have filed a motion to quash the subpoena on Vivian Rothstein,
Executive Director of Ocean Park Community Center, requesting any and
all call sheets prepared by or for Nancy Ney dated June 7.

The basis for our objection is set forth in the moving papers, which
we have filed with Your Honor.

I think it's fairly simple, as it comes squarely within Evidence Code
Section 1037.5 and 1037.6, which requires the counselor and the
shelter to claim the privilege unless there is some exemption. And
there is none in this case, as there is no showing that there was any
waiver of the right to confidentiality and no showing that any caller
would be deceased. Therefore, these callers, if any exist, are not
involved in this case, and any callers have their right to this
privacy and to this privilege; and therefore, we are asserting that.

And I do believe 20 -- I'm sorry, 1037 does apply to this case,
despite the argument of defense counsel, because it squarely defines
who a domestic violence counselor is. And clearly, Nancy Ney fits that
definition. And it clearly defines what a confidential communication
is. And this entire code section addresses the need for
confidentiality and privilege by women calling into hot-line numbers
dealing with domestic violence.

The information on a call sheet, which is what is being requested
here, would clearly come within the definition of a confidential
communication. And the person who was the domestic violence counselor
at the time of the confidential communication is the one that must,
and we do indeed now, assert that privilege.

I'll address any questions the Court may have on this.

I think it's pretty straightforward.

THE COURT: How many call sheets are we talking about?

MS. WITHEY: First of all, the mere fact that there is or is not other
calls, in and of itself --

THE COURT: Come on. How many call sheets on June 7?

MS. WITHEY: We believe there is one other.

THE COURT: Okay.

And, Mr. Baker, you signed this, so I'll assume you wrote this, unless
Ms. Bluestein name is all over it.

What is it you want to derive from the other documents?

MR. BAKER: Nancy Ney first testified, as the Court will recall, that
she premarked the call sheets with the date. And I want to see --
because she said that that call came in at 11 o'clock. We don't
believe that call sheet is an accurate call sheet relative to -- that
pertains to anything relative to this case. The point being that she
has said that she was at that institution --

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm really --

MR. BAKER: We want to see if there are any other call sheets.

THE COURT: What part do you want to see?

MR. BAKER: I want to see, number one, the date.

Number two, she says we don't write on the call sheets because they're
only used for funding purposes.

I want to see if any other call sheet has any writing on it.

THE COURT: What kind?

MR. BAKER: As is indicated in our opposition, they can take out
anything that would identify the caller in any way, shape, or form,
and show that it's just redacted, to see if there's anything on it. If
it comes out --

THE COURT: Okay.

Just a minute.

MS. WITHEY: Let me explain where our problem is.

Any confidential information received from a caller -- now, it may be
true that the date is not confidential information received from the
caller.

This code section says the confidential communication of any
information, whether it be age or whether it be race or whether it be
the circumstances of the abuser or whatever, any information obtained
from the caller by Nancy Ney is privileged.

Now, if counsel's only talking about the date, that information is not
obtained from the caller.

If he's talking about Nancy's name, that's not obtained from the
caller.

And if we're talking about a time, then that would not be information
obtained from the caller.

Any information obtained from the caller would be privileged.

I'm going to refer you specifically to Evidence Code 1037.2.

Confidential communication is information transmitted between the
victim and the counselor in the course of their relationship and in
confidence by means which so far as the victim is aware, discloses the
information to no third person other than those who are present to
further the interest of the victim in the consultation, et cetera.

So what we will not -- what we believe is privileged and is privileged
is in the information.

Now, if you're interested just in a date, Nancy's name and the time,
and delete everything else and make -- and not reveal any information
that was obtained from the caller --

THE COURT: I'll tell you what, Mr. Baker: My thought is, if -- let me
see if this would meet your needs.

If the holder of the document redacts whatever has been entered that
would indicate to you that there were entries there --

MR. BAKER: Correct.

THE COURT: -- would that be sufficient?

MR. BAKER: Yes, sir.

MS. WITHEY: Say that again?

THE COURT: In other words, leave the date on. Redact everything else
that's been entered.

MR. PETROCELLI: But --

MS. WITHEY: In other words, just completely black out --

THE COURT: If you redact it, you're going to represent -- will you
represent to me, as an officer of the Court, that you're redacting
items that have been entered onto the document?

MS. WITHEY: Yes.

THE COURT: I don't want you to make a redaction where something is not
to be redacted.

MS. WITHEY: Yes. If it was blank, it will stay blank.

THE COURT: Yes. So it will have some probative value? So there were
items entered. And it was redacted.

MS. WITHEY: Yes. Therefore. The information not being --

THE COURT: Exactly.

MS. WITHEY: -- whoever.

THE COURT: We don't -- Mr. Baker doesn't care about the information.
He's concerned about how the forms were filled out by the witness.

MS. WITHEY: So none of the writing will show, none of the information?

THE COURT: Right.

MS. WITHEY: One moment. I was just --

Can you do that? (Indicating to member of the audience.) I was
conferring.

THE COURT: My suggestion -- and, Mr. Baker, would it be agreeable with
you if they make a -- redact a copy, redact that, and make a copy of
that so that it can be --

MR. BAKER: Of course.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: The date, the time and her name is not information
contained therein, and that will not be redacted.

THE COURT: Her name?

MR. BAKER: The name of Nancy Ney.

THE COURT: Exactly.

MS. WITHEY: Her name -- to make a long story short, this will then
fall squarely within the privilege, that no information obtained from
this caller will be revealed?

THE COURT: That's right.

MS. WITHEY: Thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MS. WITHEY: We'll need some time to do that.

THE COURT: Two copies, one for each, or do you want --

MS. WITHEY: We'll make a copy. We'll do that tomorrow. I'll make
arrangements with you.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Just fax it to both sides.

MS. WITHEY: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, may I be heard briefly on this Lee
situation?

THE COURT: The who?

MR. PETROCELLI: Henry Lee situation.

THE COURT: Briefly.

MR. PETROCELLI: Here's the problem, Your Honor.

After Dr. Lee's deposition was taken in September, we filed a motion
in limine, number 11, that was precipitated specifically by Dr. Lee's
deposition.

His deposition is replete with testimony about how, in effect, he
could have done a better job.

Your Honor ruled that to render our motion, and indicated the
parameters of your ruling in transcripts which we have cited at
various times throughout the trial.

Immediately after that ruling on September 23, I wrote to Mr. Baker's
office and I said: "Dear Bob: "If you intend to make any

reference to Dr. Henry Lee in defense's

opening statement, we would request that

you immediately designate those portions

of Dr. Lee's testimony you intend to

offer into evidence."

Going on to explain, this is in light of your -- The Court's ruling
September 23.

No response to that letter was received.

On December 1, 1996, I wrote a letter to Mr. Baker, indicating that we
had still not received the designation of the portions of the
videotaped deposition of Dr. Henry Lee, and we anticipate having to
make a number of objections, and would like to receive them.

Okay. No response.

On Monday, in the afternoon, we get the designation. We immediately go
to work on it.

We discover that they did not redact or eliminate a single sentence of
Dr. Lee's testimony on direct.

They designated the entire direct, except for our objections, which
they deleted.

So in their designation, Your Honor, for Dr. Lee's deposition, all of
these references are simply to all of the testimony without our
objections, the entire direct, as though this Court never entered its
ruling.

In other words, they completely disregarded this Court's ruling and
paid no attention to it at all, thereby shifting the burden on us to
go through this thing line by line, which we did. And at Your Honor's
request, we worked late at night to get it done. And we indicated all
of our objections to the testimony that they have designated.

And I believe that the Court, unfortunately, because of the way that
this was handled, now has to go line by line on the deal.

I'm prepared to meet and confer with Mr. Baker about this, but he has
told me he will not meet and confer with me.

I don't know what else to do, Your Honor.

I'm not going to surrender the rights that we have obtained. This was
an important motion.

And if you go through the testimony, the first 58 pages of Dr. Lee's
deposition are directed to his qualifications, concluding with a
statement that he's the world's greatest criminalist. I mean, 58 pages
of deposition testimony, that's more than we read in this entire case
so far.

And then there is page after page, Your Honor, about how he offered to
help the LAPD solve these murders and they declined.

Who cares? It's totally irrelevant.

Then he gives a big lecture.

THE COURT: Look --

MR. PETROCELLI: So --

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, if you can't agree, I said I would go line
by line, and I'm ready to do it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm trying to spare the Court.

THE COURT: You're not -- you know, I'm just hearing argument on
something that's not going to be helpful. If you gentlemen are going
to meet and confer, meet and confer.

If you don't want to meet and confer, the only thing I can do is go
through and -- and rule line for line and --

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me offer a suggestion.

In going through this the last hour -- I've gone through about 40
percent of it. I'm prepared to eliminate some of my objections, maybe
about 20, 30 percent of them so far.

I'm also prepared to annotate this in a way to make it easier for the
Court, so you can see the subject matter of each of these objections.

If we dispense with playing this deposition tomorrow, then you're not
under this artificial time pressure, and I can, you know, redo the
objections, make it easier for the Court to deal with this, and we can
play this video sometime next week.

That would be my proposal.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, they've made at least -- before we got a court
order going back to take the depositions, two or three motions to
preclude the deposition of Henry Lee.

In the objections that were filed by the plaintiffs in this case, the
only thing that we could possibly play to the jury, if we adhere to
their objections, are the objections by Mr. Medvene.

So they'd hear Dr. Henry Lee, then they'd hear about 45 minutes of
objections. Then that would be the end of the tape.

Not terribly probative.

I think that this document is in bad faith. I'm not going to sit down
and start with this as a negotiating tool.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I don't think it's necessarily in bad faith,
because I read the objections; and clearly, there are matters that
ought not to be in here, like Dr. Lee's pre-American history, et
cetera. Those are matters which I'm going to exclude.

MR. BAKER: I disagree with the Court.

THE COURT: That's my job; I make a ruling, and you get to take me up
if I'm wrong.

MR. BAKER: I understand that.

THE COURT: So there are going to be some rulings. And it seems to me
that if you're not able to meet and confer on this, we've got to get
the show on the road.

MR. BAKER: Let's go. Let's do it.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Would it be helpful if we dispense with this for
tomorrow and I submit my objections? I'm prepared to submit --

THE COURT: It's going to take the rest of the day for me to rule on
this, anyway, so -- it's going to be the defense's problem to do the
redactions on the videotape, so if they want to work on it all night,
that's their business.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're going to have to prepare a videotape in
response. And I guess Your Honor --

THE COURT: I'll have the whole weekend to do that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Fair enough. We don't have to play it tomorrow, then.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: First one, Your Honor, just to make clear, the column
on the left is Mr. Baker's designation, and the specific line and page
reference to which we object are under the heading "Objection."

MR. GELBLUM: It's less than all of the designations.

THE COURT: Okay. Page 11, lines 11 through 14. Okay. Objection
sustained.

11, 19 through 11, 22 --

MR. BAKER: Background information.

THE COURT: Objection sustained. Irrelevant. Does not go to his
professional competence.

All of these objections with regard to background, the Court is
sustaining on the basis of the fact that it does not go to the
witness's professional competence.

Page 12, 13 -- let's see.

The objection is page 13, lines 10 through 16?

MR. GELBLUM: Correct.

THE COURT: Objection sustained. Background not relevant to the issue.

We seem to be losing our audience.

(Laughter.)

MR. GELBLUM: There's a typo on the next one. It should be 13, 22
instead of 12, 22, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: This is basic background information, Your Honor.

THE COURT: That's 13, 10 through -- didn't I just --

MR. GELBLUM: No, the next one. You did just rule on that.

THE COURT: I see what you're saying. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: 13, 22 to 14, 5.

THE COURT: 13, 22 to 14, 5.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, there's no reason to chop up the video because
of information -- the background information like that.

THE COURT: That's stricken. Irrelevant background.

14, 24 to 15, line 7, that's stricken. Same reason.

15 -- page 15, lines 15 through 17 --

MR. BAKER: Judge, what you've stricken -- they'll think he's
unemployed for a couple of years because you've taken out where he was
employed.

THE COURT: That's stricken.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, did I understand you to say you're striking --

THE COURT: 15, lines 15 through 17. The question is stricken.

15, 20 --

MR. BAKER: When he went to John Jay College of Criminal Justice is
stricken?

THE COURT: No. Just your question. The answer may remain. Lines 18
through 19 may remain.

20 through -- 15, lines 20 through 16, 18, that may remain.

THE COURT: What's Peter DeForest got to do with this deposition?

MR. BAKER: Peter DeForest was, and is, a criminalist that they
designated as an expert, got the Court to allow him to sit in on the
deposition, and whose deposition was taken in this case as an expert
witness for the plaintiffs, and he sat through the whole two days of
it.

THE COURT: Okay. 16, 25 to 17, 10 is okay. 17, 15 to 17, 25 is okay.
19, 1 through 6 is okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, withdraw the objection on the next one, 21
to page 22 there. Okay?

THE COURT: Okay.

23, 5 through 11, that's stricken.

Doesn't seem to be relevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Incidentally, Your Honor, would you like a larger text
to make it easier to work with?

THE COURT: No, not really. This way I can go four pages at a time.

Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: 24, 7 through 9 --

MR. PETROCELLI: That discussion continues, Your Honor, on the next
page or so about the lab.

MR. BAKER: Background information about what Gerdes is saying about a
laboratory and how you have flows.

THE COURT: 24, line 7 through 9, 12 through 18, 21, 21, 22 -- I'm
sorry, that's 24, line 21 through line 25 may remain.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, did you strike anything on 24? I don't --

THE COURT: No.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Thank you.

THE COURT: 110 through -- I'm sorry. Page 26, line 10 through page 27,
line 21 may remain. Page 27, line 24, page 28, line 1 may remain.

Page 28, line 6 through page 29, line 1 --

MR. GELBLUM: It's actually a little break in subject matter, beginning
at --

THE COURT: Line 22 -- let's -- page 28 is okay up to line 21. Okay.

From page 28, line 22 to --

MR. LEONARD: What page?

THE COURT: Page 31, line 12 are excluded.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I didn't hear where that started. I heard 31,
line 12.

THE COURT: Started at 29, page 29. I'm sorry? Page -- it started at
page 28.

MR. PETROCELLI: Line 22?

THE COURT: Line 22.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I be heard on that?

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: That goes directly to his qualifications. The fact that
he is so qualified, his representation is so outstanding that he's
asked by a governor in another state to get involved in a case.

THE COURT: You don't need to. You got all that gory detail in there,
and that's irrelevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: No other expert has been permitted --

MR. LEONARD: Excuse me, Mr. Petrocelli.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: Also you've excluded on line -- on page 31, unless I
misheard you, that he's got 30 to 40 cases pending in other states.
That also goes to his qualifications.

THE COURT: I'll leave that out.

MR. LEONARD: You'll leave that out?

THE COURT: Yeah, I'm striking it.

MR. LEONARD: On what basis, Your Honor?

Every expert that has been up there has been asked about how many
cases they have pending, how many cases they're involved in.

THE COURT: I don't think so.

MR. PETROCELLI: That hasn't been the case at all, Mr. Leonard.

THE COURT: Page 30, line 13.

MR. LEONARD: 30?

MR. GELBLUM: I thought --

MR. LEONARD: You already excluded that.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, he went up to line 12.

30, 12 he went up to.

THE COURT: No, it was -- I went to 31, line 12.

MR. GELBLUM: Right.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

THE COURT: Okay. And then from 31, strike that. Yeah, from 31, line 12
-- line 13 to page 33, line 19, the Court will allow.

I'm sorry. Make that through line 19. 33 line 19. To line 19, the
Court will allow.

MR. GELBLUM: On that page, it's just the next three lines we object
to.

MR. PETROCELLI: They're dropping like flies.

MR. P. BAKER: You can't clear the courtroom right now, Judge; it's
already clear.

(Laughter.)

(Mr. Baker waves white handkerchief.)

MR. BAKER: Judge, we're not going to finish tonight. I know that we're
not going to be able to play this tonight. He got his way. I
understand it.

THE COURT: What are you surrendering to? I don't understand.

MR. BAKER: We're not going to go through -- the deposition is 200 and
--

MR. GELBLUM: I think it's --

MR. BAKER: It's 383 pages. We already got 10 percent of it done. We're
not going to finish it tonight. So I surrender.

We'll go through it and we'll take his deals and we'll work over the
weekend and we'll get it done.

I mean, I admit defeat. I wanted to play it tomorrow. I admit defeat.

THE COURT: I just want you guys to work it out, that's all.

MR. PETROCELLI: We all just want to get along, Your Honor.

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: I've heard those words somewhere.

MR. BAKER: Want to --

MR. PETROCELLI: Why can't we all get along?

MR. BAKER: Withdraw your objections and we'll get along with you
perfectly.

MR. P. BAKER: We won't be able to play it until after we get back from
Christmas break.

THE COURT: You --

MR. PETROCELLI: You take a day off?

MR. P. BAKER: We have four, five depositions to read tomorrow.

MR. PETROCELLI: All right. Read those depositions and get it over.

THE COURT: All I have to say for the record, please, at both sides --
all sides have progressed and I don't think anybody's really been
dilatory -- hard fought, not dilatory. I appreciate it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you very much, Your Honor.

MR. P. BAKER: Judge, we're thinking of proposing that if it's possible
-- I don't know if we can contact the jurors about going dark tomorrow
and depositions are only going to take about 30 minutes, 45 minutes. I
can shove it up next week or the week when we return.

THE COURT: That's all you have for tomorrow?

MR. BAKER: We don't have any live witnesses 'cause we anticipated
this.

THE COURT: Tomorrow's Friday?

MR. P. BAKER: Tomorrow's Friday.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay by me.

THE CLERK: We'll get the jury.

THE COURT: Okay. Monday, 8:30.

MR. BAKER: Yes, sir.

(At 4:00 P.M. an adjournment was taken until Monday, December 16,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: This proceeding is without the presence of the jury.

The Court is addressing some motions. First motion the Court will
address is Plaintiff Goldman's motion in limine to exclude the
testimony of doctor John Gerdes concerning an alleged contamination at
the SID.

You -- the moving party, go ahead.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you Your Honor.

As we point out in our papers, Your Honor, there's really three
reasons why Dr. Gerdes' testimony should be excluded in this case.

Number one, Dr. Gerdes' testimony is premised upon a study that he
performed so-called validation tests and proficiency tests. These were
tests done by LAPD, not on actual cases, but when they were preparing
to start doing case work, or when they were testing themselves on
their ability to adequately run the DQ Alpha system.

From that study, Dr. Gerdes attempts to extrapolate into giving an
opinion that the actual testing done in this case could have been
affected by contamination.

He doesn't say that he studied the actual test strips in this case,
and discovered they were contaminated. Instead, he's saying, I looked
at these validation studies; I saw evidence of contamination. And in
the validation studies, therefore, there must be some -- or could be
some contamination in the actual case done here.

THE COURT: What was the nature of the contamination that he allegedly
found?

MR. LAMBERT: What he did, Your Honor, he looked at the DQ Alpha
strips, and if they were -- let's say they were -- there's a strip for
a single person. If he saw three alleles or, you know, one of the dots
lit up to indicate that there was a third allele where there should
only be two, he said that could be contamination, even though, as Gary
Sims and Robin Cotton testified many times, that's simply called
cross-hybridization.

It often produces an effect of cross-hybridization, which an
experienced reader, like Sims or Cotton, or for that matter, I suppose
Dr. Gerdes, understand to be that elicited every time he saw an extra
allele on his chart, and he added them all up, and he said that shows
evidence of contamination during these validation studies at SID.

He then goes on to say that, well, I didn't see that same evidence of
contamination in the test results in this case.

But that doesn't mean it's not there; it could be the result of
contamination.

Now, the problem -- and the second problem with this testimony is
that, the defendants' theory of the case as explained to the jury by
Mr. Baker and frankly, as is necessary, for the contamination theory
to do them any good is, the contamination didn't take place during the
DQ Alpha testing process by SID, which is what Dr. Gerdes studied.

Because if the contamination took place there, the only problem would
be in the test results of the LAPD testing, not the test results by
Cellmark or DOJ, which are testing different swatches that were sent
out to them to be tested.

So in order for the defense to use contamination as a defense to the
Cellmark and DOJ test results, they've got to push the contamination
test results back to an earlier stage in -- of the process to the
evidence processing room.

So the theory of the defense, as explained to the jury by Mr. Baker,
as they attempted to develop in the cross-examination of Collin
Yamauchi, is that the contamination took place in the evidence
processing room when Mr. Yamauchi was sampling the evidence samples,
and Mr. Simpson's reference sample.

The theory explained to the jury by Mr. Baker is that Mr. Yamauchi
spilled the blood during that process, spilled the reference sample
that somehow affected all of the evidence samples that he was testing,
and that were ultimately sent off to Cellmark and DOJ to be tested.

Dr. Gerdes' testimony can't obviously have anything to do with what
went on in the evidence processing room. What he was talking about is
actual DQ Alpha test results on validation tests, not real tests, but
he was looking at what he said showed these extra alleles.

That -- none of those cases -- they weren't cases. None of those
validation studies that he was looking at even went through the
evidence processing room, because they weren't real evidence, they
were just mock samples created in the lab to see if they knew how to
run the program correctly.

So what he's talking about can't have anything to do with whether Mr.
Collin Yamauchi did or did not spill any blood, or whether that did or
did not contaminate the evidence samples. He would be trying to
confuse the jury, and extrapolate from his work on validation studies
to say what Collin did somehow cause contamination. Two completely
different events.

Finally, Your Honor, as I point out, they have, in responsfor
admissions, admitted that the laboratories got these various DQ Alpha
tests that we have now put into evidence. The DOJ got them; Cellmark
got them; as you saw, LAPD got the very same results.

So it can't be that Dr. Gerdes is saying that there was something
wrong in the testing process itself, and that's where contamination
took place, because they've admitted these results were correct
results.

They have to be saying, as indeed they are, that the contamination
didn't take place during testing, but instead, during evidence
handling itself. That way, Gerdes's handling in validation is
irrelevant and does not support that theory at all. It is simply a
method to confuse the jury about the whole contamination issue.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

First of all, you've already ruled on this motion. You've ruled that
the contamination study is relevant to the weight of the evidence in
this case.

But beyond that, Mr. Lambert has made a number of misstatements. Dr.
Gerdes will be testifying about contamination in the samples in this
case.

We've already talked about stains 29 from the steering wheel, 30, 31,
and the victim's reference blood samples. He's going to testify about
all of those stains, and about the extraneous alleles that have shown
up on all of those stains, and that they are the possible product of
contamination or cross-hybridization.

Now, with respect to cross-hybridization and contamination, Dr. Gerdes
will testify, which is consistent with their expert's deposition, that
when you get cross-hybridization, it means you're doing the test
wrong. This isn't something that happens all the time. If the tests
are done properly, you shouldn't get contamination or
cross-hybridization. Many times you can't tell the difference from the
test; it could be one or the other.

The study that he did was on every testing strip that we could get
from LAPD. They refused to give us any of their case work. All they
would give us was there validation study, which presumably are the
cleanest samples that they have.

And he analyzed every strip that we could get from, not a different
period of time, from a span of time before the tests in this case, as
well as after the tests in this case.

And he found out that there are the same alleles that are common to
this case showing up unexpectedly in virtually all of the work that
they have done in their lab, that we were given access to.

And all of that is relevant to the weight of the results in this case.

We have never admitted that the results in this case are the accurate
results, and we went through this thoroughly at the beginning. Our
admission was qualified to say that we are not admitting anything
about the period of time from collection up until the time the actual
test was done.

The only thing we admitted when they ran the tests, those were the
results they were going to testify about, not that they were the
correct results, not that the evidence was not contaminated, not that
it was not collected properly. We didn't admit any of that stuff.
There's nothing new here justifying the Court changing its ruling.

MR. LAMBERT: Let me just read, if I could, one other request for
admissions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LAMBERT: This the first Bundy blood drop. Admit that the blood --
this is request number 14.

"Admit that the blood contained in the item identified at the criminal
trial as LAPD evidence item 47 had an HLA DQ Alpha blood type 1.1,
1.2."

The response: "Admit."

And then they have the qualification about the point in time.

MR. BAKER: Read the qualification.

MR. LAMBERT: "In admitting this request for admission, the defendants
will adopt the plaintiffs' definition, as communicated to the
defendant, as that point in time when an item was tested by an outside
laboratory, as opposed to the time of collection or any other point in
time."

So they're admitting that when the lab tested item 47, it got a 1.1,
1.2.

Any testimony about them not following the correct procedures, or
cross-hybridization being evidence of improper testing technique, is
irrelevant in light of all those requests for admissions they've
admitted. Those were the test results they do have, could have denied
them, and said no, that's cross-hybridization; that there was
something wrong with the way the testing was done.

But they didn't. They admitted them. All the labs got consistent
results in this regard.

MR. BLASIER: That is not what we were admitting. Dr. Gerdes will
testify that because of the unacceptable high risk of contamination in
LAPD, which is where every one of these samples started out, you
cannot rely on the results in this case.

That goes to the weight of the results, and it is certainly viable.

THE COURT: Is the defense's contention that -- that the DOJ Lab and
Cellmark produced different DQ Alpha results from SID?

MR. BLASIER: No. It's our position that Cellmark and DOJ also had
evidence of contamination because of 30, 31.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I'm -- I'm asking you these questions for a
specific reason.

Are you contending that Cellmark and DOJ got different DQ Alpha
results from SID?

MR. BLASIER: On some of the samples, yeah. On 30 and 31, 29.

MR. LAMBERT: Your Honor, the difference is that on some of the
samples, LAPD got no results --

MR. BLASIER: No.

MR. LAMBERT: -- They didn't get a different result.

THE COURT: 30 and 31. What is your response to that?

MR. LAMBERT: I'm doing this from memory.

My recollection is on 31, LAPD got no result, just inconclusive. They
didn't get a result when they tested it.

On 30, I don't, off the top of my head, remember. But essentially,
Your Honor, the test -- the DQ Alpha test results are, across the
board, the same between all the laboratories.

MR. BLASIER: We went all through this with Gary Sims and Doctor --

THE COURT: I'm trying to be very specific, okay? I don't need to be
deflected from what I'm asking.

Would you explain to me why those two results were --

MR. BLASIER: Sure.

THE COURT: -- Dissimilar.

MR. BLASIER: We showed the strips where they are calling a 4 allele,
when -- I think it was a 4 -- when there's no dot that appears; that
one of them called it at one point, didn't call it another point, that
there's a 1.3 allele that shows up. That could be the result of
contamination, cross-hybridization, one or the other. They can't tell
the difference.

But more importantly --

THE COURT: Don't deflect me.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

THE COURT: I'm just asking you a specific question.

MR. LAMBERT: Here's the results board, Your Honor. We have the big one
down there, but if I could hand this up to you, you'll see that the
results from -- on number 31 for LAPD and Cellmark are the same.

MR. LAMBERT: That's 294, Your Honor.

(Pause in proceedings for the Court to review document.)

THE COURT: 31. What was the other?

MR. LAMBERT: 30. We got no result from LAPD on that one.

MR. BLASIER: Tell you what Dr. Gerdes is going to say, if you like.

(Pause in proceedings for the Court to review document.)

THE COURT: Okay, go ahead.

MR. BLASIER: He is also going to testify that those results in 30 and
31 are not valid because of the -- the extraneous alleles, which
showed up in the positive controls; that because of those alleles
showing up where they're not supposed to be, that those whole -- that
whole series of tests is invalidated.

THE COURT: By whom?

Tests by whom?

MR. BLASIER: All of them by DOJ. I'm sorry. I think it's DOJ on 30 and
31; that they had extraneous alleles on the positive controls.

He's also going to testify that Bundy drop 52 shows evidence of
contamination, as well, with an extra 1.3 allele as a result of
possible cross-contamination at the crime scene.

MR. LAMBERT: Your Honor, if he's going to talk about specific evidence
samples, as opposed to this study that he did of validation samples
and trying to extrapolate from that, I would say that at the very
least, let's limit him to talking about the evidence in this case, not
to the validation study and what conclusions he draws from the
validation study, if he wants to come in, even though they've admitted
these results, and try to undercut their admissions.

I suppose that, you know, maybe that's relevant, but certainly not the
validation studies, although I think in light of the admissions, none
of it is relevant.

THE COURT: You want to argue any more about number 30?

MR. BLASIER: No.

THE COURT: Okay. That's my conclusion; that Dr. Gerdes' testimony will
be allowed, but will not be allowed in the area of the -- the -- what
do you call that?

MR. LAMBERT: Validation study, study of the validation tests.

THE COURT: He can testify to anything else.

MR. BLASIER: It's the Court's ruling that presence of extraneous
alleles in the LAPD lab is irrelevant?

THE COURT: Yes, based upon the reasons stated by the plaintiff.

So that will be the ruling.

There is a declaration by Gary Randa, submitted by the defense, with
respect to service or lack of service on William Blasini. There's a
counter-declaration filed by the plaintiff by Yvette Molinaro, and
that Mr. Blasini, B-l-a-s-i-n-i was reached by telephone on December
10, and in Chula Vista, he resides in southern California, Chula
Vista.

I'll hear from the defense.

MR. P. BAKER: Judge, we tried, as the declaration of Gary Randa
attached -- we tried to serve Mr. Blasini. The two locations have had
him stationed there for about 40 -- I don't know, 30 hours or
something like that.

We've tried to serve Mr. Blasini; we've been unable to do so. I guess
they spoke with him, didn't say that he'd appear, or that they knew
exactly where he was.

We tried to reach him. I tried to move this case along by reading in
his testimony -- be about 15 minutes. It's similar to the issues
raised in Kardashian. They were unable to serve him. We've been unable
to serve Mr. Blasini.

THE COURT: Where Ms. Molinaro?

MR. GELBLUM: She's at the office.

THE COURT: Where is Mr. Blasini residing?

MR. GELBLUM: In Chula Vista. I don't know his address, Your Honor. I
have a business phone number for him, where we spoke with him.

THE COURT: Give that to the defense.

MR. GELBLUM: Be happy to.

THE COURT: Give you an opportunity to serve him.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

THE COURT: Order the plaintiffs to supply you with all of the
information they have as to his whereabouts.

MR. P. BAKER: We attempted to serve him, Judge but . . .

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: They didn't attempt to serve Kardashian. You let that
deposition in. Why can't you let this one in?

MR. GELBLUM: We have -- it was with the glove photographer in San
Francisco, so same point. They had unavailability. You ruled in their
favor.

MR. P. BAKER: We served the glove photographer. We haven't been able
to serve --

MR. GELBLUM: They went to the wrong place. They went to Sun Valley.
That's a hundred files miles from Chula Vista.

THE COURT: Try to serve him.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, they've also filed a declaration on Mr.
Meraz. I don't have a declaration. Our investigator told us he
verified he worked for the gas company in Santa Monica, Mr. Meraz.

MR. P. BAKER: There's no declaration we tried to serve him. We've been
unable to serve him. I'm trying to get this case moving.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, there's also -- Mr. Randa says in his
declaration, he kept going back to this house. We have no information
why he picked this particular house. There's no information this is
this guy's address, where he lives. He says he kept going to his
address, kept going back; there -- no one was there.

MR. P. BAKER: Let the record reflect we have the county records that
we he lives there.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. P. BAKER: That's what we have from the county records, that he
lives there. We were unable to serve him.

THE COURT: What information do you have about his whereabouts?

MR. GELBLUM: All I have is that he works for the gas company in Santa
Monica.

THE COURT: What's the basis of that information?

MR. GELBLUM: An investigator's phone call to the gas company, asking
for Mr. Meraz, says that he works there, but he wasn't in.

THE COURT: Where was he called at?

MR. GELBLUM: Excuse me?

THE COURT: Which gas company?

MR. GELBLUM: I don't have -- I believe it's Southern California Gas
Company, an office in Santa Monica; that's where it is. I don't know.

I can find out at a break, Your Honor. I can make a phone call to the
office --

THE COURT: All right I'll reserve rulings.

MR. PETROCELLI: -- And we'll provide it to the defense.

MR. GELBLUM: Of course.

THE COURT: Okay. The Willie Ford video.

I'll hear from the moving party on this.

MR. GELBLUM: On the Willie Ford video, Your Honor, as we said in the
papers, there's two reasons why it's really -- it's irrelevant, under
--

THE COURT: I read your moving papers.

Do you have anything else you want to add to that?

MR. GELBLUM: Just that I don't think I mentioned the legal basis
relevance under 352, because it doesn't show -- it's meaningless; it
doesn't show the area where the socks would be. He has --

THE COURT: It shows the bedroom, doesn't it?

MR. GELBLUM: But not the area where the socks were collected.

THE COURT: That's your contention.

MR. GELBLUM: There's another undisputed evidence. If they have
evidence to the contrary, fine. The only evidence from Mr. Ford
himself is that he -- his testimony -- if they have other evidence,
fine.

MR. P. BAKER: There's two issues.

The video shows the room; it bolsters Mr. Ford's testimony that he did
not see socks there, or we -- he would have videotaped the socks there
on the rug, number one.

Number two, the issue on the counter is completely disingenuous that
Rockingham sock log shows him being there from 3:10 to 4:30.

Mr. Fung sat there and said he collected blood.

THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry. You're going to have to repeat that.

MR. P. BAKER: He collected item 12 in the foyer at 4:30. He collected
item 14 in the master bathroom at 4:40. I believe he collected item
13, the socks, between 4:30 and 4:40.

Mr. Ford will testify he was in the bedroom at approximately 4:15. He
was there before Mr. Fung collected the socks, and didn't see the
socks.

This video goes to his credibility. That's what cross-examination is
for. This is directly contradictory to what they argued at side bar.

MR. GELBLUM: I have no problem with Mr. Ford coming and testifying
about the crime scene log, but the video, it's a 352 problem. It does
not show he did; it doesn't contradict; it doesn't show the place
where the socks were. And the counter on the video is admittedly off.
And he admits he has no idea how far off it is.

That's the evidence, Your Honor. I have no problem with him coming in
and saying he didn't see the socks; that's fine. But the video is the
problem. I'm not trying to preclude the evidence, just the video.

MR. P. BAKER: Submit, Judge.

THE COURT: Motion denied.

Okay. Anything else?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Your Honor.

I just found out yesterday from the defense that they intend to recall
Kato Kaelin, who, as Your Honor will recall, was examined by me on
direct, over my objection, specifically permitted them to go way, way
beyond the scope of my direct, on the representation that he would not
be called again.

And they went into areas unrelated to my examination. And I would ask
that he not be permitted to be called again.

MR. P. BAKER: Two issues.

MR. BAKER: Wait.

MR. P. BAKER: Wait.

(Counsel Robert Baker and Phil Baker confer sotto voce.)

THE COURT: First team, second team.

MR. BAKER: You're going to have the second team.

THE COURT: Or the third team.

(Indicating.)

MR. LEONARD: Oh, thanks.

(Laughter.)

MR. BAKER: Where are you in this picture?

(Indicating to Mr. Blasier.)

MR. BAKER: Kato Kaelin has made a lot of statements since he left the
witness stand that contradict his testimony. And I want to examine him
on those statements. I could -- he's never seen a camera -- he's never
met a camera he didn't like.

And further, there's an area I want to get into relative to what he
has testified Mr. Simpson was wearing when he got into the limousine
at approximately 11 o'clock on June 12, 1994. That area has not been
gone into at all.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, you released him. They went on and they
did what they did.

I don't know what Mr. Kaelin did, but he went over everything he
wanted to, plus more. And I don't think he should be recalled again.

MR. BAKER: I don't know there's any legal precedent for your motion.
Give us some authority that I can't call a witness to the stand.

MR. PETROCELLI: Judge Fujisaki is my authority.

THE COURT: That's not much authority.

(Laughter.)

MR. BAKER: Don't tempt me, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm just relying on the prior court order, permitting
Mr. Baker to take my witness out of order.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll give reasonable examination to Mr. Kaelin.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. PETROCELLI: One last thing Mr. Medvene will address.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the defendants want to play the
video of Dr. Lee. We got their designation the other day.

We're asking until Friday morning, if possible, from -- not till
tomorrow morning, to counter-designate, and then a couple days for
both sides, after Your Honor rules on the objections, so that the
videotape can be prepared and edited properly.

We think if we had an extra day, we could limit our objections to just
the key portions, so you don't have to rule on too, too many items.
But there are a number of items we think in Dr. Lee's testimony that
violate the previous court order on relevance of certain collection
techniques and that sort of thing.

So what we're asking for is until Friday morning, if possible, to file
with the Court our counter-designation. If for whatever reason that's
not possible, until tomorrow, tomorrow morning, to file our
counter-designation. And that's a couple days, so both sides can get
the video edited properly to play.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: On Henry Lee, I gave them the designation on Monday, and
that was to comply with the rules and the procedures of Mr. Petrocelli
-- I screwed that up -- I believe Mr. Petrocelli used in the Paula
Barbieri deposition. I'm trying to comply.

We want to start it tomorrow. I've had it edited. They haven't
objected to it so far. It's edited. I figured we'd have Mr. Rokahr's
deposition read, Mr. Gerdes I'd start Henry Lee's deposition, we'd be
able to finish sometime early Friday afternoon. And I'm just trying to
comply with the promise I made you in chambers about how fast I can
put this case on.

They've had enough time. They've had the deposition since September.
They knew what our questions were. I've had this thing edited and they
worked on it over the weekend. They knew what the issues were. And the
stalling and -- it's the same exact thing that happened during Ms.
Barbieri.

I want to start it tomorrow afternoon, according to our designation on
Monday.

MR. MEDVENE: Your Honor, them playing the deposition next week isn't
going to interfere with their case.

THE COURT: Why didn't you get on it earlier?

MR. MEDVENE: Well --

THE COURT: Why didn't you get -- you demand things of them; they have
a right to demand things of you in terms of complying.

MR. MEDVENE: We haven't demanded without flexibility, Your Honor. And
what we're asking is, we can -- we can give them now, unedited
objections to portions of Dr. Lee's testimony. We can give that to
them now.

THE COURT: Why don't you do it?

MR. MEDVENE: I'd like to be able to edit it, and go over it a little
bit more thoroughly before we give it to them, because we think we can
cut down some things. And all we're asking is the deposition, if
they're going to play it, be played next week instead of Friday, so
both sides can have a proper opportunity to edit.

We're going to have to address you on some of the objections, and
we're just trying to limit it, as best we can.

MR. PETROCELLI: I think it's 2025(i).

THE COURT: The motion --

THE COURT REPORTER: Your Honor, I didn't hear you.

THE COURT: I didn't intend you to hear me.

THE COURT REPORTER: Oh, I'm sorry.

MR. P. BAKER: You've got a copy of Dr. Lee's --

THE COURT: C.C.P. 2025 subdivision (i) -- sorry -- that's subdivision
(l), subdivision (I) states that:

A party intending to offer an audiotaped or videotaped recording of a
deposition in evidence under subdivision (u) shall notify the Court
and all parties in writing of that intent and of the parts of the
deposition to be offered within sufficient time for objections to be
made and ruled on by the judge to whom the case is assigned for trial
or hearing, and for any editing of the tape. Objections to all part of
the deposition shall be made in writing.

The notice was filed on December 9. This is December 11. Why is the
request unreasonable? That's a short period of time.

MR. P. BAKER: Judge, I complied with their request on Paula Barbieri.
They stated on the record that reasonable time was three days; I gave
them three days. We couldn't even do -- show the video of Paula
because they objected to it because we didn't give them reasonable
notice.

And in this case, there's reasonable notice; they've had enough time.
They had all day yesterday to do it, all day today. They've got enough
time.

THE COURT: You said what in your notice?

MR. P. BAKER: For --

THE COURT: You didn't say it's required that they respond by a certain
time.

MR. P. BAKER: I'm -- I'm saying that in terms of the Paula Barbieri
deposition.

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. P. BAKER: They objected to us objecting to that videotape because
we didn't provide them with reasonable notice.

They stated that reasonable notice was three days. I used that three
days and let's put Henry Lee on December 9 -- started on December 12.
They haven't objected to it yet.

They have to play by the same rules. They try to interrupt our case.
We want it to flow so that I can get it done when I promised you,
Judge. And we couldn't even show the Paula Barbieri videotape; we had
to read it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, the situation is different with Ms.
Barbieri. They never -- we gave them our designations; they never
responded with any counter-designations or objections. And then they
just wanted to play things on the videotape at the time that we
offered the videotape.

On Monday afternoon, they served this very lengthy designation of Dr.
Lee's deposition.

Now, just to drive this point home, prior to opening statement, I
wrote Mr. Baker a letter and I said, could you let us know what you
intend -- or Mr. Medvene did -- what do you intend to offer by way of
Dr. Lee's videotaped deposition, so we can have a lot of time to work
this out.

He said, "I don't have to tell you now and I'm not going to tell you
now."

I wrote him another letter last week, which I'll produce to the Court,
saying, please give me Dr. Lee's videotaped designation so we can work
this out.

No response.

Then I get the designations on Monday afternoon.

I had alerted him that this is going to be a serious issue because of
the Court's in limine motions and all the objections that were made at
the deposition, that we would need time. A very lengthy designation.
Got it Monday afternoon. I've had someone working on it last night and
yesterday. Probably get it in to the Court by the end of today.

I would like tomorrow morning -- be a little more reasonable -- then
I'd like to have a hearing on the objections.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: I told them I was going to use all of the direct and all of
the cross. To say that I didn't say what I was going to designate is
nonsense. They know.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's not accurate, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: We spent two and a half days back there with Henry Lee, and
all I got out of Medvene was objections, objections. That is all I'm
going to take out, is the objections I from got from Medvene on every
question that I asked Henry Lee.

MR. BAKER: That's what the designation is. He objected to every
question, regardless of the content. Regardless of giving him a
standing objection to everything, he had to interject an objection; he
was compelled to do it to every question from us. There was a hiccup
in the room, he objected to it.

That is what was edited out of Henry Lee's depo; that is all.

To allow them now to say well, we want to have more time and we want
to object more and to stop our case, and we'll have to go dark
tomorrow afternoon and Friday because of them, is ridiculous. And all
they want to do is interrupt the flow of our case. I don't think it's
appropriate.

THE COURT: Okay. The Court will set hearing for tomorrow morning. And
you have your papers in -- if you're going to have any papers in.

You have a copy of the tape?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

MR. BAKER: They've had it since mid-September.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Be prepared to show the video Friday.

Okay. Bring in the jury.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, your Honor.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

TOM LANGE, the witness on the stand at the time of the adjournment on
December 10, 1996, called by the Defendants pursuant to Evidence Code
Section 767, having been previously duly sworn, was examined and
testified further as follows:

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

Would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange, L-a-n-g-e.

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Lange, at the time Fuhrman went over the wall, you did not have
any suspicion whatsoever that O.J. Simpson may have committed the
murders, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Not relevant, Your Honor. State of mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your only concern was whether Mr. Simpson was dead
or dying in his residence?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your -- after you said you got into
the house, Mr. Simpson's house that is, through the back southeast
door -- excuse me.

MR. P. BAKER: That's 116 on the board.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 116 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You went through the den, through the bar area, into
the kitchen area, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Vannatter follow you?

A. I don't recall whether he was beside me or right behind me. He was
in the same vicinity. I don't exactly recall where everyone was
standing or walking.

Q. Where was Fuhrman?

A. I believe Fuhrman was still outside with Kaelin.

Q. Is it your testimony, then, that Fuhrman did not come in with
Arnelle and the other three detectives?

A. He might have come in after -- after I did. I don't recall.

My attention wasn't on Fuhrman coming in.

Q. Well, Detective Phillips was engaged in a conversation with Arnelle
in the kitchen, correct?

A. Subsequently, yes.

Q. And at that period of time, Kato was still in his residence with
Fuhrman; that's your testimony, is it not?

A. At the time that Phillips was talking to Arnelle in the kitchen, I
am not quite clear on, because I do recall Fuhrman entering and Kato
entering, and I believe Kato sat down at the bar.

But again, my attention wasn't focused on them.

Q. Were you in the kitchen nook when you don't know whether Fuhrman
and Kato were in his guest house or the bar area?

A. I believe that they were in Kato's house when we entered.

Now, again, my attention wasn't on them once we'd entered, so I don't
know.

Q. And you then went directly through the bar/den area, dining room,
and into the kitchen nook area, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You remained in the kitchen nook area until sometime later, when
Fuhrman came and got you, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so you don't know what happened, whether Fuhrman even entered
the house; isn't that correct?

A. What happened?

Q. No. My question was: You don't even know, after you entered the
house from the southeast entrance, whether Fuhrman came into the
house, 'cause you didn't see it; isn't that correct?

A. No. Subsequently I saw him in the house with Kato, and Kato was at
the bar.

Q. I thought you just testified that you didn't see him from the time
you were in the kitchen nook until he came back and got you, and you
wandered around the garage to the area where Fuhrman says he found the
glove?

A. No, I didn't say that.

Q. So you didn't stay in the kitchen nook the entire time after you
entered the house. True or untrue?

A. I was in that area. I walked down the hall by the washer and dryer
to look at the housemaid's room.

Q. Well, you can't see the bar or the den area from the area where the
washer and dryer is, can you?

A. No.

Q. And you can't see from the kitchen nook area where the bar is,
where you say Kato and Vannatter was, can you?

A. If you stepped out far enough, yes, you could.

Q. If you stepped into the dining room, you could, but you can't see
it from the kitchen area, can you, sir?

A. I haven't been in that house for a couple of years.

It's my recollection that I became aware that they, in fact, were back
in the bar area. Now, I don't -- in fact, I can't give you exactly
where I was standing. And this has to do with not just what I see, but
what I hear.

Q. Well, since you were in the home of Mr. Simpson on June 13, 1994,
you testified about it about four, five times, have you not?

A. Sure.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have also gone on multiple -- multiple TV shows
talking about your experiences, and trying to hype a book deal over
your experiences with Mr. Simpson, have you not?

A. No.

Q. How many TV shows have you been on trying to hype a book deal?

A. Trying to hype a book?

Q. Hype a book deal, get one signed?

A. I don't think we've ever tried to hype a book on a TV show. We have
a deal already signed.

Q. Well, you didn't until relatively recently, but you've been hyping
it for about two years, trying to get a book deal?

A. No.

Q. No?

A. In fact I was against a book initially.

Q. I see.

But it was the money that changed your mind?

A. Not at all.

Q. Okay.

In any event, Mr. Lange, you went into the kitchen nook area. Did you
or did you not stay in that area the entire time until Fuhrman came
and got you to point out where he purportedly found the glove?

A. Other than walking to the maid's quarters, as I told you earlier.

Q. And the maid's quarters is off to the south of the kitchen, is it
not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. So you never went back into the dining room area, never went back
into the bar/den area, correct?

A. I -- I might have walked toward that area. Again, I can't
specifically recall every place I went, and everything I did that day.

Q. Well, you have had to recall this in conversations you had with
Bill Hodgman and Marcia Clark when they asked you to recall and set
forth in detail what you did at Mr. Simpson's house on June 13, 1994,
isn't that true?

A. No, I don't recall them at all asking me specifically where I was
at every moment that I was in that house.

Q. Well, you were certainly questioned about it for days in the
criminal trial, were you not?

A. No, not about whether I walked in the kitchen and out of the
kitchen, no, I don't recall any of that.

Q. Don't recall that at all?

A. No.

Q. Now, when you were in the house, did you look for any blood in the
house?

A. That was the first thing that I was concerned with, would be a
struggle -- sign of struggle.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question I just asked you. Maybe
you can answer it yes or no.

Did you or did you not look for blood in the area of the house that
you were in before Mark Fuhrman ever came and got you to look for this
purported glove he found?

A. I looked for signs of a struggle. If that included blood, then,
fine, so be it.

Q. So you went through the house, stayed in the kitchen nook area,
went to the maid's area, were there for, what, a half-hour?

A. I don't think so. Probably less than that.

Q. During that period of time, it's your testimony that Phillips was
in a conversation with Arnelle Simpson, correct?

A. For part of that time.

Q. And he was contacting Mr. Simpson's secretary, Kathy Randa, to find
out where Mr. Simpson was, and you stayed in the kitchen area during
that period of time, right?

A. Actually I believe Arnelle made the call and spoke with her
initially, and I was in the area.

Q. You stayed in the kitchen area during that period of time, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you didn't know -- well, strike that.

Had you heard before you went in the kitchen nook area about any
representation by Kato Kaelin of thumps or noises that he said he had
heard the evening before?

A. No.

Q. Never heard that?

A. Not at that time, no.

Q. Now, during the period of time that you were with Fuhrman in the
morning of the 13th at Rockingham, did he have his coat on or off?

A. I don't believe --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection in terms of vague as to time, what time, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: In the morning. Overruled.

A. I don't recall him having a coat on.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It's your recollection you had the coat -- he had a
coat off the entire time?

A. I don't recall him having it on for -- whether he went to put it
on, I don't know, I just don't recall him having a coat on.

Q. Now, did Fuhrman tell you that he was going to leave the house and
go investigate outdoors before he left the interior of the residence?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, I take it that when there's four of you there,
there's two lead detectives, you and Vannatter, that you are in charge
of that scene as well, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that these -- Phillips you had right in front of you and he was
talking to Arnelle, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you didn't know where Fuhrman was, correct?

A. No, I did know where Fuhrman was.

Q. You knew Fuhrman was out in the bar, you said you saw him out in
the bar from your vantage point in the kitchen area, right?

A. During that time Fuhrman was somewhere between Kato's room and the
bar area, yes.

Q. How do you know that?

A. Because I left him with Kato, as we walked in, for awhile. Kato --
my recollection is that Kato entered sometime after that. It's just
what I recall.

Q. Well, Kato entered sometime after that. Do you have a recollection
of Fuhrman entering -- do you have a recollection, sir, of seeing
Fuhrman enter the residence?

A. Physically walking in?

Q. That's what I mean.

A. I can't say that I specifically had that recollection.

Q. Do you have a recollection as you sit her now, of Fuhrman ever
being in the Simpson residence after you knocked -- after he rapped on
Kato's door and before he came and got you and others to look at the
glove that he says he found on the south side of Mr. Simpson's
property?

A. I don't recall if he was in there or not.

Again, my attention was not focused on Mr. Fuhrman's whereabouts.

Q. Now, at any time, were you asked by Fuhrman or anybody else to
provide a backup to investigate the grounds of Mr. Simpson's house?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

A. A backup, I don't think I understand what you mean by a backup.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, if there is a concern, sir, of dangerous or
unlawful activity on the grounds, I take it that one police officer
wouldn't examine the grounds when there are four there without the
assistance of others being in his or her company; would you agree with
that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, the concern was for victims, not suspects.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Maybe you didn't understand the question.

If there is a suspicion of dangerous activity, thumps are being heard,
nobody knows what they are, and there is possible danger around the
grounds of Mr. Simpson's estate or any other place, you certainly
wouldn't have a police officer go into that area without being
accompanied by another police officer, would you?

A. Well, it depends on what the situation is, what the officer's state
of mind is.

Again, we weren't concerned with suspects at this time.

Q. Well, you don't know what Mr. Fuhrman was concerned with because
you don't know what information he heard from Kato Kaelin about
noises; isn't that true?

A. Not at that time. I wasn't concerned with him.

Q. If in fact there's concern that there have been thumps on the wall
and there are unexplained noises and this is a place where there is a
concern about it may be an extension of a crime scene at 875 South
Bundy over here at 360 North Rockingham, police regulations would
require at least two officers to investigate the grounds and have
their weapons drawn; isn't that true, sir?

A. No, that's not true. The thumps --

Q. There were no weapons drawn at all?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Your Honor, the witness was in the middle of
answering the question.

MR. BAKER: "No" is the only thing that's responsive to the question.

THE COURT: Finish your answer.

THE WITNESS: No, I haven't, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Finish it.

A. The thumps were many hours earlier. And we had no fear of suspects
being at the location.

We entered because we feared that there may be victims at that
location, and for no other reason.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have no idea on June 13 when the thumps were
'cause you never even heard about them; isn't that true?

A. I didn't hear about it until later, but if you're asking me to --

Q. I'm asking you about --

A. -- comment on what Detective Fuhrman felt at the time, that was it,
because I didn't see it, I didn't hear what went on.

Q. You don't know what Detective Fuhrman felt at the time, you don't
know if he was leaving the vicinity of every police officer, and every
person at that house to plant a glove, do you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, the question is argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know if Detective Fuhrman was leaving the
interior of the residence, and leaving Kato Kaelin that he
interrogated out in Kato's room so he would be alone by himself and
have the opportunity to plant a glove?

A. Fuhrman would have had to come through the kitchen area.

Q. Do you know? You can answer that yes or no.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, question's argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Calling for Mr. Fuhrman's intent.

Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So as far as you were aware, Fuhrman was out of any
sight that you had from approximately 5:40 to about 6:15, correct?

A. No, I can't say that.

Again, I didn't specifically keep a record of every movement of Mr.
Fuhrman. I recall seeing him from time to time. I can't give you an
accounting of what he did every minute he was there.

Q. I didn't ask you for an accounting, sir.

You've been on the stand, what, 3, 400 times?

A. It's probably a conservative estimate.

Q. And you've been interrogated by a lot of attorneys, have you not,
sir?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. And you understand that it's your job while you sit on the witness
stand, to answer questions, not to argue the case, do you not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That question's argumentative and
inappropriate.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So can you listen, be kind enough to listen to my
questions, and attempt to answer my questions, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative. Move to strike Mr. Baker's
comments.

THE COURT: Ask a question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The question is Fuhrman was out of your vision from
5:40 to 6:15, yes or no?

A. Again, I can't -- I don't know. He was in and out of my vision. I
can't tell you where he was every moment. That's my answer.

Q. So your answer is I don't know, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Objection, question has been asked and
answered. Mr. Baker is misstating the answer.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I do not know where Mr. Fuhrman was all the time he was there. I
was focused on other things.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let's go through in a minute here.

You arrived at about 5:06 after leaving Bundy around 5, correct?

A. Approximately.

Q. And you were outside the Rockingham property for approximately 30
minutes before you allowed Fuhrman to go over the wall, right?

A. Approximately.

Q. Fuhrman goes over the wall, you go to the front of the house, you
ring the doorbell, you go around up to the north side of the house,
and you go to the area, and you rapped on the glass doors that are at
the back of Mr. Simpson's house, which would be the east, really,
correct?

A. I don't know if -- recall rapping on them. I may have. I do recall
looking in the rear doors.

Q. Then you go down, Fuhrman is rapping on Kaelin's door, says
somebody's in there. Kaelin comes to the door, there's words of
identification exchanged, you and Phillips at least walk down to
Arnelle's room, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Arnelle gets dressed and -- and I guess she looked for a key, did
she not? Went back -- I think that she had to go back and get a key,
right?

A. She went back -- I believe she may have went back to get a key. I
--

Q. And then it's your testimony that after she may have gone back,
gotten a key, you all, that is, at least you, Phillips and Arnelle,
went up the stairs and in the southeast door with the key that Arnelle
Simpson got, right?

A. That's right.

Q. And all that took about what, 10 minutes?

A. I don't know how long it took.

We did enter that rear door, yes.

Q. Took about 10 minutes?

A. I don't know how long it took.

Q. Do you think it took more than that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. From the time we actually walked from Arnelle's to the rear door,
probably took less than a minute.

Q. Well, I was talking about, sir, and I thought that you understood,
was over the wall to going in the house about 10 minutes?

A. Apparently, I did not understand. I did not understand.

I think it was probably a little more than that.

Q. Okay. 15?

A. Possibly.

Q. Okay. It would be at the latest 5:45 when you go into Mr. Simpson's
residence, true?

A. You're trying to pin me down on minutes, and I'm kind of
uncomfortable with that because we didn't log in everything we did
every minute that we did it. I mean we had other things on our mind. I
just can't give you an accurate accounting of that time.

Q. You didn't log anything. You didn't log one thing, did you, at
Rockingham?

A. I didn't, no.

Q. You say we didn't log every minute.

You didn't log a minute, did you?

A. There was no reason for me to log anything at Rockingham.

Q. You didn't document your presence there at all, did you?

A. No, that's not true. It's documented in the chronological record.

Q. It's documented -- In fact, the record shows that you never left
875 South Bundy; isn't that true?

A. I don't know.

Q. The log at Bundy indicates you never left.

Didn't you ever look at that before you wrote the follow-up report?

A. That certainly wouldn't come into play when I'm writing my
follow-up report.

Q. So you never looked at it?

A. There was no reason to look at it.

Q. Now, by 5:45 you're in the house, you walk through the back, and
the next thing you see of Fuhrman is when he walks into the kitchen
nook at about 6:15, right?

A. I don't recall. I may have seen him earlier. Again, I wasn't
focused on Fuhrman.

I do recall seeing him in the nook area, yes.

Q. And -- And at that point in time, Fuhrman comes to you with a
revelation and he says, I want you to follow me, correct?

A. No. I think Phillips came up to me and mentioned that Fuhrman had
something he wanted to show me.

Q. Had Phillips already been out there when you were confronted with
Fuhrman saying he wanted to see the -- wanted you to go to the south
side of the house?

A. Phillips --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Phillips had been out there earlier, yes.

Q. And was it Fuhrman that asked you, or Phillips that asked you to go
out there?

A. My recollection is that Phillips approached me and said that
Fuhrman had found something on a back walkway and that he was going to
take me out and show it to me.

MR. P. BAKER: Number on the "Post-It" on the front.

MR. BAKER: Okay, thank you. 1174.

(The instrument herein described as an aerial view of 875 South Bundy
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1174.)

(Exhibit 1174 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, 1174 is an aerial view of 875 South Bundy or
the block of 875 South Bundy.

It's also an aerial view of Mr. Simpson's property, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. This would be the Ashford gate, right?

A. Right.

Q. This would be the area of the guest residences, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And this is the area of the kitchen nook, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. This is taken out in front?

A. Yes.

Q. And this is the area going into the front entrance of the house,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. And all of this is the shrubbery that is adjacent to the south side
of Mr. Simpson's property and along that Cyclone fence, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And the vehicle in front of the house appears to be a white Ford
Bronco, does it not?

A. Are you talking in the driveway there?

Q. Talking about right in front of the entrance.

A. In the driveway, yes.

Q. Yes.

Now, as I understand it, you had -- before you were informed of this
amazing find of evidence, you'd already been to Bundy and you'd seen a
glove, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, move to strike the argumentative language,
amazing find.

THE COURT: It's been asked. Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now -- and so Fuhrman brought you out of the kitchen
nook area, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Around the house, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you walked down the side of the house, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you walked past two doors that led into the garage and
residence, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you then stopped about 6 feet or so away from the glove,
correct?

A. 6, 8 feet, approximately.

Q. And that's as close as you ever got to the glove, was 6 to 8 feet,
right?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. And I take it as a detective, you have 20 plus years, you looked
for a blood trail, did you not?

A. No, not at that time.

Q. Well, you never went back to the glove while it was still there,
did you?

A. No.

Q. You didn't look to see if there was any blood on the ground, you
didn't look to see if there was any blood or any biological matter on
any leaves, you didn't look to see any of that, did you?

A. I wasn't concerned with that at that time at all.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question. I didn't ask your
concerns.

I asked if you looked, as a detective of 20 years, on a piece of
evidence that is found that may match a piece of evidence in a crime
scene where a double homicide occurred, you didn't even look to see if
there was blood around it, did you?

A. There was no reason for me to look. I'm not investigating that
crime scene. Certainly not.

Q. You didn't look at anything else, the shrubbery, the concrete,
whether there was insect activity there, whether there was dirt on the
glove, you looked at none of that?

A. The crime scene was none of my concern at all at that time.

Q. I didn't ask you what your concerns were. I asked you if you
looked.

A. Obviously, I didn't look because it was not a concern.

Q. And so this glove that was told to you had blood on it that may
match a glove a couple of miles away at a house where a double murder
had occurred of the estranged ex-wife of the owner of this house, it
didn't occur to you to look at the shrubbery, the glove, to see if
there was insect activity, to see if there was dirt, wasn't a concern
of yours, you just looked, turned, and went back and talked to your
partner, Vannatter, right?

A. No one told me it had blood on it. That's the first misstatement.

Q. Okay.

Could you see blood on it?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Your Honor, the witness was still answering, I
believe.

THE COURT: Finish your answer.

You may finish your answer if you want.

A. I saw nothing but what to me appeared to be a glove.

As far as the rest of your question goes, that crime scene was not my
concern at that time.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you told before you went out to the south side
of Mr. Simpson's property that there was a glove with blood on it?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you see any blood on the glove?

A. No.

Q. Did -- As I understand it then, Phillips had already told you that
there was a glove out there?

He was the one that told you that?

A. No. I believe what Phillips stated was that Fuhrman wants to show
you something. I don't even recall him saying the glove.

Q. After you saw the glove, you walked back to the front of the
location where you met your partner, Detective Vannatter, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And by the time you talked to Vannatter, he'd already sent Fuhrman
and Phillips back to 875 South Bundy, right?

A. I think they had just left, yes.

Q. And you then left 875 South -- or strike that.

You were -- heard Mark Fuhrman testify in the criminal trial that the
glove was moist, sticky and wet, did you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You didn't -- you didn't see anything on the glove
that looked moist, sticky or wet when you were out there viewing the
glove? You turned your flashlight on it, didn't you?

A. No. It was still fairly dark. It was beginning to get light. I
could see the outline of what appeared to me to be a glove. I did not
want to approach it. I didn't approach it. I was only there a matter
of seconds, and I returned to the front.

Q. You shined your light on the glove even though it was daylight,
didn't you?

A. I don't recall that -- whether I shined the light on it or not. It
seems to me it was beginning to get light.

Q. Were you the only detective that didn't see evidence of blood that
was moist, wet and sticky in your conversations subsequent to the time
--

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- you viewed the glove at 360 North Rockingham?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, question's argumentative and calls for
conclusion.

MR. PETROCELLI: Speculation.

MR. MEDVENE: Also speculation.

THE COURT: I'm sustaining the question as somewhat unintelligible, and
it's --

MR. BAKER: I guess it wasn't one of my better ones.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right.

You had conversations with the other detectives about this glove later
on the 13th, did you not?

A. That was a pretty busy day. The glove may have been alluded to. I
don't recall any specific mention about the glove.

Q. The glove was picked up by Fung and taken back to 875 South Bundy,
to the crime scene, when you were there, isn't that true?

A. Yes, he had it in the criminalist truck.

Q. He had it and brought it into the crime scene, didn't he?

A. No, not that I know of.

Q. Is it your testimony that you, who were in charge of 875 South
Bundy, that Dennis Fung didn't bring the glove that was found at
Rockingham back to 875 South Bundy and take it up to the area where
the glove had been moved at 875 South Bundy?

A. I don't recall him doing that. I did observe that glove in the
truck though, because I asked to see it.

Q. You asked to see it in the truck?

A. Yes.

Q. What time was that?

A. I don't know what time. I didn't log what time it was. It was
sometime probably within 10 or 15 minutes after Fung arrived at the
crime scene.

Q. Now, if Dennis Fung testified that it was at your request that he
brought the glove from Rockingham to 875 South Bundy, he would be
misrepresenting the truth, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. The question is argumentative and calls for
hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told Dennis Fung to bring the Rockingham glove
to 875 South Bundy, didn't you?

A. No.

He brought it there as part of his investigation. He completed his
work at Rockingham and brought the glove, as well as other evidence,
to 875 South Bundy. When he arrived I asked if I could see the glove.
I told him I wanted to see the glove, to get a look at it --

Q. Now --

A. -- We then went to the criminalist truck and I looked at the glove.

Q. There is a difference, you would agree, between looking at the
glove in the criminalist truck, taking the glove out of the
criminalist's truck, taking it into the area where the glove was
located at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Certainly.

Q. And it's your testimony, so we have it perfectly clear, that you
never requested Fung to take the glove found -- located by Fuhrman at
Rockingham, out of the criminalist truck while it was at 875 South
Bundy, and walk it to the area and -- and put it near or next to the
glove that was still on the ground at 875 South Bundy?

A. I would never do that.

And I told Fung that I wanted to see the glove. It may -- he may have
misinterpreted.

Q. And your testimony is that you, being the lead detective in charge
of 875 South Bundy, never saw Fung with that glove in the crime scene
area? And I'm talking about close to the closed-in area and by the
gate of 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. I don't recall him at all having that glove there.

Again, my testimony is the same. I recall seeing the glove in the
criminalist truck only.

Q. And did you see a moist, wet, tacky glove on the -- at the time --
well, strike that.

You didn't see it until after, what, at noon or thereafter?

A. It was sometime after Fung showed up. It may have been 15, 30
minutes. I don't recall exactly when it was. Sometime, obviously,
after Fung had been there for a bit.

Q. Now, the glove was discovered purportedly by Fuhrman at around
6:15, right?

A. I think so.

Q. And the earliest Fung and Mazzola ever got to 875 South Bundy was
10:10 in the morning, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And I take it that the first thing they did is have you into the
criminalist truck and show you the glove, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So you -- And you left 875 South Bundy to go down and interrogate
my client sometime around noon, true?

A. I believe it was about 12:30, somewhere in there.

Q. So sometime between 10:10 and 12:30, it's your testimony you went
into the criminalist truck and looked at the glove in the truck,
right?

A. I didn't go into the truck. The rear was opened, I peered in at the
glove in the rear of the truck. I didn't enter the truck.

Q. Was the truck parked on Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. And the rear door of the truck was open, and you walked up to the
rear door of the truck, right?

A. No. We walked up there together, he unlocked the door, opened the
door and showed me the glove.

Q. And when he showed you the glove, could you see blood on it, what
you perceived to be blood?

A. I don't recall. I don't recall. I just recall viewing the glove. I
was more interested in the inside. I was more interested in the
ribbing of the glove, to see if in fact it matched the one that we had
at the crime scene. I wasn't looking for blood.

Q. Now, there is, as I understand it from the pictures that we've
seen, blood all over the crime scene area at 875 South Bundy; you
would agree with that?

A. Certainly.

Q. And this glove was purportedly found at Rockingham, and you weren't
interested in whether or not there was blood on it?

A. Not at that time. I was interested in doing my job at the Bundy
crime scene. That piece of evidence had already been collected and was
going to be examined.

Q. Now, if -- if Fung had taken the glove and taken it into the crime
scene, you would have been upset with that and have reprimanded Fung
for moving the glove from the criminalist truck into the crime scene
'cause you didn't want it in the crime scene, did you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You did not want the Rockingham glove in the crime
scene for fear of contamination, isn't that true?

A. I would certainly have a fear of contamination if one was to bring
evidence from another crime scene, yes.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we're going to have a video. Is this a good
time to take a break?

THE COURT: 10 minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Due to my screw-up, not Phil's, I'm going to have to wait
for a new point on that video.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, when you were at the criminalist's van with
Fung inspecting the glove, did you inspect anything else that was in
the criminalist's van, from Rockingham, at that time?

A. No, I just recall looking at the glove.

Q. And the glove was in a bag, was it not?

A. He removed it from a bag, yes.

Q. So the glove was out of -- well, strike that.

Brown paper bag, plastic bag, which, or both?

A. Seems to me it was in a brown paper bag and it was -- he pulled it
out -- it was like half out of the bag when I looked at it.

Q. Okay.

So it wasn't contained, then, in any -- you know, one of those plastic
zip-lock type bags, that's your recollection, sir?

A. No, I recollect it was just a brown paper bag. I believe it may
have been in something earlier. I don't --

Q. It was pulled half out of the paper bag, you viewed it, Fung viewed
it, it was put back in the paper bag, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it never, to your knowledge, went from the criminalist's truck
into the area where the crimes had been committed, correct?

A. I never saw it in there, no.

Q. And you didn't see blood on the gloves and you didn't see any tears
in the -- or blood on that glove nor blood -- strike it. Again, I
apologize.

You didn't see any blood on that glove at that time, true?

A. I wasn't looking for any blood. I just looked at the inside of the
glove.

Q. The answer to the question is no, you didn't see any blood?

A. I don't recall seeing any blood.

Q. Second question, you see any tears in the glove at that time?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. Did you look for any tears in the glove?

A. No.

Q. Now, then, this was during the time between 7 -- approximately 7
o'clock in the morning when you were at 875 South Bundy on the 13th
and 12:30 when you left to go to Parker Center, right?

A. It was after Fung arrived, so possibly after 10 o'clock, sometime
between 10 and 12.

Q. And during the time after you had gone back to 875 South Bundy and
you did the documentation that we talked about when you were here
before, did you request a stride analysis to be done on the blood
drops in the walkway at 875 South Bundy?

A. No, they were requested of the shoe prints.

Q. There was a stride analysis that you became aware of, true?

A. As to the shoe prints, not the blood drops.

Q. There was no stride analysis done to the blood drops in the back of
-- the walkway, that's your testimony?

A. I don't know what a stride analysis is as it relates to a blood
drop. I do as it relates to a shoe print.

Q. Well, the blood drops -- have you ever heard of measuring the
distance between the blood drops and seeing, for example, how long a
normal 32 inch gait would take to go between the blood drops to see
what the time duration is between the drops?

A. No, a stride analysis would go to a shoe print, not the distances
between blood drops.

Q. Have you ever attempted in the 20 years that you've been a
detective, to determine, based upon the distance between blood drops
that you detectives call a blood trail?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, relevance to this case, asking about some
other experience, not this case.

THE COURT: I believe he's inquiring whether he's familiar with a
particular analysis.

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Particular analysis I'm talking about is did you
request or make any attempt to determine the distance between blood
drops on the north walkway at 875 South Bundy?

A. I don't recall specifically. That may have been discussed with the
criminalist.

Q. Do you recall ever making a determination as to a normal stride or
gait, how many seconds would elapse between blood drops?

A. Yes, there are basic -- there are several basic studies on that
from blood hitting from different angles at different heights and
different surfaces I'm aware of, yes.

Q. Did you try to analyze -- use those investigative techniques and
methodology in your analysis of this crime scene?

A. To some degree.

Q. And how long did you determine there was in seconds between the
blood drops on the north walkway at Bundy?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence. Witness
testified he didn't do that.

THE COURT: He said "to some degree."

Overruled.

A. No, that wasn't something I ever did.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you determined that the assailant had shoe
prints that went up the walkway and then turned left towards the
house, correct?

A. Up the walkway as in Bundy?

Q. Yeah, was going west on the walkway.

MR. BAKER: Let me get an exhibit.

(Pause for counsel to retrieve exhibit.)

(Exhibit 2057, entitled "875 South Bundy Walkway," is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now --

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me, Mr. Baker, does that have a number,
please.

MR. BAKER: I'm sure it does.

Sorry.

MR. LEONARD: I'll look.

I don't see any number.

MR. MEDVENE: It's 2057, I believe, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, your examination of the scene at 875 South
Bundy had the shoe prints going -- this is west, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then they turn and go towards the property, do they not?

A. They -- yeah, there was one point where they did, yeah.

Q. And then they -- there was another shoe print that was angled
towards the property, right?

A. I believe so.

Q. And did you ever try to do any type of gait analysis relative to
those shoe prints, sir?

A. Personally, no. I requested that of a criminalist.

Q. And you have never seen one document relative to a gait analysis,
correct?

A. Part of a gait analysis is the measurement -- toe to heel
measurement. I believe I've seen that somewhere, but it's been some
time.

Q. You would have seen nothing that would determine the elapsed time
based upon a normal gait from the front of the property on Bundy west
to the back of the property, correct?

A. I've never heard of such a study.

Q. Never heard of it in this case, right.

Now, in terms of the shoe prints on this particular exhibit, you will
agree based upon our analysis yesterday that there are shoe prints
missing from the area directly east of Nicole Brown Simpson's -- where
her body was found, true?

A. Missing shoe.

Q. They're not on that document -- that exhibit, rather?

(Witness approaches exhibit.)

A. As far as these little prints here you're talking about?

Q. There were at least four shoe prints in that area, were there not,
sir?

A. Seems to me there were a couple of partials. I do recall a partial
heel right in this area here that I don't see on there.

Q. And obviously, if the imprint that we were looking at yesterday is
a shoe print, that isn't on that exhibit that's been proposed by the
plaintiffs, 2038, (sic) either, is it?

A. No.

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

Q. I would like to direct your attention to this video. When it
concludes, I'm going to ask you whether or not this is Dennis Fung and
the glove, okay.

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order, Erin.

THE CLERK: 2258.

MR. P. BAKER: 2258.

(The instrument herein described as a videotape was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2258.)

(Videotape is played beginning at counter 1:18:10 to 1:18:39.)

MR. BAKER: If you can stop it, Phil.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was the brown bag that you saw Dennis Fung with --
Right there.

Go back.

Go forward.

(Videotape was rewound to 1:18:17.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was that the same type of brown bag that you say you
looked at the glove in, in the criminalist's truck in front of 875
South Bundy?

A. It was brown and paper. It seems to me it was smaller.

Q. If Dennis Fung indicated he was carrying that bag into the crime
scene pursuant to your request, you would disagree with that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I'd disagree he's walking away from the crime scene with that bag
of evidence. I don't recall, even, at all coming into the crime scene,
nor the bag of evidence, the glove or anything else.

Q. And it would be not -- certainly it would not be your request or
order that he bring the glove into the crime scene, correct?

A. I would not do that.

Q. All right. Thank you.

Now, I want to get back to this particular -- the stride analysis.

(Indicating to Exhibit 2057.)

Q. So that we're clear, there was no time estimation based upon shoe
prints from the front walkway to the back, as to any amount of time
that would have elapsed by the assailant or assailants walking from
the front to the back of the alley, true?

A. Yes.

I wouldn't know how one would go about doing that.

Q. Now, you indicated that you looked at the blood drops, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. And certainly you would agree, sir, that if blood drops form a
trail on them, that you can indicate not only the direction of travel
of the person who is dropping the blood, but if they fall in a round
or circular pattern, that would indicate that there's possibly a
normal gait, true?

A. To some degree. There are other factors depending on the height of
the source that the blood comes from, and depending on the substrate,
the ground, the cement or whatever it hits, so there are other
considerations.

Q. In this case we've seen closeup pictures of circular blood spots,
would you agree with that, on the north walkway, correct?

A. Generally circular, yes.

Q. This would indicate whoever is discharging this blood is not
running, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So we can assume, and in fact you -- the most you could assume in
terms of speed would be a fast gait, correct, based upon the blood
spot pattern, true?

A. I would -- probably wouldn't even say that.

Q. Normal walk?

A. Very possibly.

Q. And so in normal walking, and we can see some shoe prints, we could
do a stride analysis to determine, for example, a gait set forth by
the shoe print, what the stride of whoever is leaving those shoe
prints is?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, limited, previous ruling, stride analysis
wasn't done, similar to ruling on collection techniques.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: Similar to your previous ruling on collection techniques.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And we could even do a simulation of the assailant
turning because we have a shoe print that shows him turning into the
building. We can assume that the assailant was also in front of the
gate, and we can duplicate to some extent and reconstruct the amount
of time it would take for someone to leave the shoe prints or some,
more than one, can leave the shoe prints set forth on Exhibit 2038
(sic), true?

(Referring to Exhibit 2057.)

A. Could can be a very subjective thing. I mean we have the prints
facing inward. Someone could be standing there for a period of time
before they moved on. I would think that would be a very difficult
thing to do. You can, however, do a heel to toe measurement,
obviously, and -- to see if it's a normal stride.

Q. Yeah, and obviously it is somewhat subjective, because we see shoe
prints that go back into the -- into an area where bushes are in this
darkened area on 2038 (sic), correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the assailant could have backed into the bushes to avoid any
visual observations from Bundy, correct?

A. That may have been the reason, yes.

Q. But we can make some parameter ranges of time if care had been
taken, but none was done in this case; you will agree with that, sir?

A. I don't know how you would do that.

Q. Okay. Fair enough.

Now, in terms of after your being at 875 South Bundy until
approximately 12:30 and going through your investigation, you were
called by Phil Vannatter and requested to go to downtown LAPD,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. How were you communicated with at that time, telephone, radio,
what?

A. Believe it was telephone.

Q. Phil Vannatter actually phoned the house and requested you to go
down to Parker Center, correct?

A. No, it seems to me that I got a call from the office, I think I got
a call from the office telling me to meet him there.

Q. And it was on the phone that was in the 875 South Bundy residence,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you hadn't had any communications via the office, or Phil
Vannatter, on that phone before that time, had you?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. I mean he hadn't come over -- he'd come over to 875 South Bundy to
communicate with you, had he not?

A. Yes.

Q. And hadn't used the phone before then, huh?

A. I don't believe I did, no.

Q. He came over to tell you that he was going to try to get a search
warrant at about 7:30, right?

A. I believe so.

Q. When he came over about 7:30 to tell you that he was going to try
to get a search warrant, that was of course after you had both been at
Rockingham and Kathy Randa had communicated with Arnelle on the
telephone, and everyone at that scene knew exactly where O.J. Simpson
was, correct?

A. Well, I don't know if everyone knew exactly where he was.

Q. Well, I take it as lead detective, once the communication was made
with Kathy Randa, that you communicated that certainly to Phil
Vannatter and said there's no need to go upstairs, for example, and
see if O.J. Simpson is dying or bleeding to death, we know he's in
Chicago, and we know exactly what hotel he's at, and we know he's on a
Hertz outing? I assume you did that?

A. Well, no, Phillips told us that, certainly.

Q. Phillips told you and Vannatter that, right?

A. I believe Vannatter was there, yes.

Q. So Vannatter certainly knew that Mr. Simpson had gone on a
scheduled expected trip to Chicago before 7:30 when he came over to
see you and tell you that he was going to attempt to get a search
warrant to search Mr. Simpson's house, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for conclusion, Your Honor, what's in
Mr. Vannatter's mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, from the knowledge that you have of being at
Rockingham, you have no doubt in your mind, sir, that Vannatter knew
full well that O.J. Simpson was on an expected trip to Chicago at a
Hertz outing by the time he got to 875 South Bundy and told you he was
going to go to the West LA station to prepare a search warrant,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Calls for speculation.

A. I don't know whether or not he knows it was expected.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And unexpected, of course, is exactly the word that
is and does appear in the search warrant that you have looked at, that
is Mr. Phil Vannatter telling a magistrate, under penalty of perjury,
that O.J. Simpson was on an unexpected flight to Chicago. You
discussed that many times with him, haven't you?

A. No, you used the word "expected" and I'm repeating your word. And
no, I have not discussed it with him many times or hardly at all.

Q. Well, you've been on "Dateline" and talking about whether or not
Phil Vannatter lied in the search warrant, have you not?

A. I certainly may have, yes.

Q. You've been on the "Today" show discussing whether or not Phil
Vannatter lied in the search warrant, have you not?

A. I believe I have.

Q. You've been on "Larry King Live" discussing whether or not Phil
Vannatter lied in the search warrant, have you not?

A. I hope so, yes.

Q. Many times, right?

A. Many. The more that I could get, the happier I would be.

Q. And now -- so you went to -- from 875 South Bundy to Parker Center
to interrogate O.J. Simpson, right?

A. I did.

Q. And that interrogation started around 1:35 in the afternoon,
correct? That's what the transcript says. You wouldn't argue with
that?

A. I wouldn't call that an interrogation. I would call that an
interview. There's a difference between an interrogation and an
interview.

Q. Okay.

Let's talk about that for just a second.

As I understand your testimony, sir, you didn't even have a suspicion
that the ex-husband of one of the victims was in any way responsible
for the murder, when you allowed Fuhrman to go over the wall into his
property, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then he became, in your story, your version of the story, he
became the prime probable suspect when the glove was found at 360
North Rockingham, right?

A. He became, what I would term, a probable cause suspect.

Q. And so you, being an experienced detective, have got O.J. Simpson
down in the interrogation room at Parker Center and you have him
without any lawyers present, true?

A. No.

Q. It certainly isn't your testimony that the recorded statement from
13:35 hours to 14:07 hours on June 13, 1994 was made with lawyers for
Mr. Simpson present, is it, sir?

A. No. Mr. Simpson had counsel prior to that, and he was advised of
his rights and they went to lunch.

Q. So you -- so you had an opportunity to have your probable cause
suspect interrogated by you and your partner, Phil Vannatter, for as
long as you wanted to interrogate him, without anybody objecting to
any questions or instructing Mr. Simpson to answer or not to answer
any questions, true?

A. That's a little misleading once again.

Q. Can you answer that. Just answer it, no.

A. It was not an interrogation. It was an interview. And there's a
difference between the two.

Q. Well, the room you had him in, was it called an interview room?

A. Yes.

Q. And you certainly didn't want to inquire about anything that could
be used against him in the future, you just kind of wanted to
chit-chat with O.J. Simpson because you had two dead people at 875
South Bundy, right?

A. I don't --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argument, to form.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You wanted to interrogate O.J. Simpson, record the
statement, and get as much incriminating evidence as you could from
Mr. Simpson between the time that you had to question him, which was
virtually unlimited, true?

A. No, this was not an interrogation. This was an interview. I mean
you have to make that distinction.

With an interrogation, it's an accusatory form of an interview where
you have solid evidence that puts that suspect directly to the crime,
and you confront that suspect with that.

In an interview, it's more of an investigative process where you
attempt to glean inconsistencies.

That's what this was. Because we had no evidence, we had no blood back
or anything else that we could solidly connect to this suspect and
confront him with it.

Q. You wanted to get every bit of evidence you could out of O.J.
Simpson so you could find any inconsistencies?

A. We were certainly looking for inconsistencies, that's correct.

Q. So you didn't have any evidence that you thought was incriminating,
is that your testimony?

A. No, not at all.

Q. All right.

A. We had circumstantial evidence that we discussed with him. This
certainly -- it wasn't made to him at that time. We had blood evidence
we were interested in.

Q. Now, you were not told by his lawyers there was any time
limitations on your right to question Mr. Simpson, true?

A. No, I don't recall that.

Q. You felt when you walked into the interview room with Mr. Simpson,
that you could interview him as long as you felt was necessary,
correct?

A. Certainly.

Q. You were aware that Mr. Simpson volunteered to give you his answers
to any questions you asked, true?

A. I don't know if he'd give me the answers to any questions that I
asked.

Q. And all the questions in the minutes that you were in there, did
Mr. Simpson ever indicate to you he wouldn't answer a question?

A. He skirted around quite a few.

Q. Oh, so it's your version that he skirted around quite a few, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you -- like you're doing?

A. Is that a question?

Q. I guess it's a statement.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection to Mr. Baker's statement. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Let's get on with the witness.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you had the right, just as I have the right
here, to ask another question if you didn't feel that your question
was answered, true?

A. No, because Mr. Simpson could have invoked at any time, said I
refuse to speak to you anymore, and walk out of here. I don't think I
can do that.

Q. I hope not.

Now, you and your partner, Vannatter, questioned O.J. Simpson for
what, 35 minutes?

A. Something like that.

Q. And your primary concern was to get information out of him you
could use later against him, and that's why you read him the Miranda
rights, true?

A. We were required to read Miranda under those circumstances. My
primary concern was getting evidence back.

Q. And so you asked him about his whereabouts, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you asked him about the cut on his finger, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you told him that -- you and your partner, Vannatter, told him
he had blood all over the place, and it was a real problem, didn't
you?

A. I believe Vannatter mentioned that there was blood on the Bronco,
blood at his house, and they had a problem with it.

Q. He immediately said, give me a blood test, didn't he?

A. No.

Q. Let me read to you. Maybe this will refresh your recollection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Where are you reading from?

MR. BAKER: Page 22, line 19.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) (Reading:) Q. We've got some blood on

and in your car. We've got some blood

at your house. And it's sort of a

problem. Mr. Simpson: Well, take my blood

test and we'll see.

He immediately, on you telling him that there was blood on and in his
car, and some blood in his house, said, give me a blood test, didn't
he?

A. No. That I never seen or -- you just read it and it does not say,
give me a blood test.

I'd like to see that for myself.

Q. You think I misrepresented to you, Mr. Lange?

A. Stranger things have happened.

Q. Well, they have here.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, could the witness's attention be
directed also to page 16 with reference --

MR. BAKER: Mr. Medvene, why don't you let me do the examination.
You'll have your chance. Fair enough?

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court --

THE COURT: Excuse me. This is his examination. You want to examine
him, you can examine him after he examines him, okay.

A. Does not say, give me a blood test. It does say, well, we'll take
my blood test and we will see.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, didn't you think, Mr. Lange, that O.J. Simpson
was telling you that, I will submit to a blood test?

A. Yes.

Q. Didn't you think when you talked about -- well, strike that.

You have gone on various shows and you have demeaned Mr. Simpson by
saying that he never asked about what happened, have you not, sir?

A. I don't know about demeaning Mr. Simpson, but I probably did make
reference to that, because it's absolutely true.

Q. Would you -- you can go ahead and read what the transcript says
about Mr. Simpson requesting to know from you guys what happened, and
why don't you read down to "you wouldn't tell."

(Pause for witness to read portion of transcript.)

A. He didn't tell me to -- ask us to tell him anything. He says we
haven't told him anything. He doesn't make any requests.

Q. Okay.

"Every time I ask you guys, you say you're going to tell me in a bit."

That's what he says, correct?

A. I don't recall him ever asking me anything about any of this case.

Q. That's what he says, isn't it: "Every time I ask you guys, you say
you're going to tell me in a bit." Correct?

A. That's what is says.

Q. And that's what he said, because this is your transcript from the
D.A.'s office, isn't that true?

A. That's what he said at that time. But he did not request any
specifics about what happened.

Q. Well, your response then, "We don't know a lot of answers to those
questions yet ourself, O.J.," he'd certainly asked some questions, or
the response would be -- wouldn't be, "We don't know a lot of answers
to those questions yet ourself, O.J"; you would agree with that?

A. Not necessarily.

Q. Okay.

So as I understand it, first time you ever met O.J. Simpson was on the
afternoon of June 13, before this interview, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were with him about how long before you started this
interview?

A. I wasn't with him the entire time. I spoke with his attorney there,
Weitzman, for a short period of time.

Q. Maybe you don't understand my question, sir.

I didn't ask you about speaking with Mr. Weitzman, and I didn't ask
you where you were.

I said how long were you with him before you started the interview.
Can you answer that, sir?

A. Perhaps a few minutes.

Q. So you were with him a few minutes before the interview started,
and you never talked to this man, ever, before that time, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Then you were with him for the 35 minutes or so of your interview,
and he says, "You guys haven't told me anything, every time I ask you
guys, you tell me you're going to tell me in a bit."

And you say across this country, on every nationwide television show
you can get your mug on, that he has never asked about his kids or
anything about how the murders happened, isn't that true, sir?

A. That's exactly true and that is the truth.

Q. And of course he was with Vannatter and had to have asked Vannatter
or you guys would have jumped all over him, wouldn't you? You would
have said you never asked us a question about how the murders
happened, you would have corrected him, wouldn't you?

A. No, not in that particular case.

Q. No, you wouldn't, you'd just go on TV and talk about how Mr.
Simpson is such a bad guy because he never asked about the murders,
when you saw him a few minutes before a 35-minute interview, right?

A. No.

Q. And the reason you did that is because now you got a book deal for
$110,000; isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. Making money off of it, right, making money off of demeaning O.J.
Simpson, right?

A. Not at all. We've been vilified to unbelievable extremes in this
case. And it's about time we stood up and replied. We've been lied
about.

Q. You've been standing up at every television show you can, haven't
you?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. The witness was giving an answer. Mr. Baker
interrupted him.

MR. BAKER: It's nonresponsive.

A. And I will continue to do that.

THE COURT: Just a minute.

I'm going to let it stand because the witness's response is in
response to a question and there was no objection to the question.

MR. MEDVENE: We're not objecting. We're just saying he hadn't finished
his answer, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further of this witness.

THE CLERK: For the record, that exhibit is 2057, not 2038.

MR. BAKER: I do have one thing, a whole area that I got -- oh, pardon
me.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, just a minute.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) After you finished your 35 minutes, you went and had
Mr. Simpson photographed, right?

A. I don't know if we got his blood first or the photos -- I believe
it was the photograph, yes.

Q. At the time you took him to be photographed there at Parker Center,
you were aware of the following: One, that you had two people dead at
875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were aware that those two people who had perished at 875
South Bundy were murdered with a sharp object, correct?

A. Apparently, yes.

Q. And you were aware that O.J. Simpson had a cut on his left middle
finger, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you wanted to have that cut photographed, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. And of course you wanted to have any other cut or cuts
photographed, too, didn't you?

A. If I would have observed other cuts, certainly.

Q. You told Mr. Simpson how you wanted the photograph posed for that
so that you'd get the cut fully photographed, correct?

A. Actually, I believe the photographer did that.

Q. Well, it's after you directed him as to where the cut was and what
you wanted photographed, correct?

A. Well, I explained to the photographer that we in fact wanted --
actually, there's two cuts, by the way, on that finger. We wanted him
to take a photograph of the finger, and he as a consequence of that,
directed it.

Q. And I assume, sir, that you as a detective with many years
experience, wanted to and did inspect O.J. Simpson's hands, correct?

A. I looked at his hands. I certainly didn't look at them under any
kind of high intensity lighting. I didn't look -- lift them up or
anything else, but I looked at them.

Q. And I take it you asked him to spread his fingers to look at the
palmar, dorsal aspects of his hands, right?

A. I don't recall doing that.

Q. Well, I take it that you wanted to see whether there was more cuts
than this one cut on the outside of the middle knuckle, wouldn't you,
Detective Lange?

A. Well, I saw two cuts, and that was my focus. I did look at his
hands. Again, I didn't examine them under any high intensity lighting.
I didn't peel his finger back, I didn't check the creases of his
hands. I did look at the two cuts.

Q. I take it you looked at his adjoining fingers, did you not.

A. His adjoining fingers?

Q. Well, the ring finger is directly adjacent to the middle finger, is
it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you looked at the entire hand, did you not? I mean you couldn't
avoid it, it's kind of in your field of vision?

A. Not necessarily. When you have creases and hair on his hand and
all, I think one would have to really take a close look before you
could see, perhaps, some cuts. And again, I did a cursory -- what I
would call a cursory examination. I did not peel back his fingers and
check the creases of his hands.

Q. Well, let's see if I got this right.

You looked at the glove, didn't look close enough to see if there was
any blood or blood trail, right? This is Rockingham. True?

A. Yeah. It was not my concern at the time.

Q. You looked at the -- and you didn't look around the area to see
shrubbery or anything else?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: I take it you're going to ask a question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As a detective, I take it that you have, like most
of us, a field of vision, that is there's certain things that you can
see. If I put my hand in front of you, I take it that you could tell
whether or not I had a cut on the -- well, let's just say the interior
aspect of my fourth finger. Can you see that right where my hand was?

A. If I was looking for it, I might, sure.

Q. Even if you weren't looking for it, with my hand sitting like this,
you'd have to see it if it was right there, by the lower knuckle,
wouldn't you?

(Mr. Baker places his own hand on witness stand, palm down.)

A. It would depend on lighting, it would depend on how you had your
hand, it would depend on whether you had your fingers together or
spread.

MR. BAKER: Phil, we got that picture of the cut. Yeah. Let's show
that.

MR. P. BAKER: This is photograph 715.

(Photograph 715 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's a cut on Mr. Simpson's fourth finger, sir.

That picture was taken on the 15th of June, 1994.

Now, that cut would be, if his hands were spread, what, a quarter of
an inch away, maybe a half an inch away, from the cut on the middle
finger of his left hand?

A. Is there a question?

Q. Yeah.

A. What was the question?

Q. That cut that is depicted on the fourth finger of Mr. Simpson's
hand on a photograph taken June 15, and looking at Mr. Simpson's hand,
did he just hold his hand as I'm holding mine, just in the area I'm
holding mine, that cut would have been, what, a quarter, a half an
inch away from the cut on the middle finger knuckle of his left hand?

A. I suppose, depending on the positioning of the fingers, sure.

Q. And I'm sure that you, being a good detective of 20 years, you had
him at least spread his hands so you could see if he had any
additional cuts, right?

A. I recall me looking at his hands. I don't recall him specifically
spreading them out for me. I don't recall pulling his fingers back and
looking in there. I gave them a cursory examination.

Q. So you did look at them?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

And you didn't see the cut that's depicted in --

MR. BAKER: What's the photo?

MR. P. BAKER: 715.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- in 715, correct?

A. I don't recall seeing that cut.

Q. And of course, if you'd seen that cut, sir, you'd have taken a
picture of it, wouldn't you?

A. I would say yes.

Q. If you saw this, whatever this gouge mark is, or this
discoloration, or cut, or abrasion, or whatever that is, if you saw
that, you obviously would have taken a picture, had the photographer
take a picture of that, true?

A. Have to get a better look at that. There -- was the hands . . .

MR. BAKER: Zoom in on that.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

A. Yeah. There appear to be other discolorations across the hands and
the knuckles, appear to be.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) If you saw any discoloration that looked like a cut,
you'd have directed the photographer to take a picture of it so you
would have had evidence preserved, true or untrue, Mr. Lange?

A. Certainly.

Q. All right.

And the only picture that you directed the photographer to take is
this picture, correct?

MR. P. BAKER: 172.

(Exhibit 172 displayed.)

A. I did.

Q. And the cut that you were interested in was this cut on his
knuckle, at the middle knuckle of his middle finger, right?

A. I believe there are two cuts on there, and yes, I was interested.

Q. Are you saying that there is a cut in the area where my finger is
which would be above the -- about five -- between five and five and a
quarter on the ruler?

A. I think there was an additional cut in that area.

Q. Show it to us. There's a pointer there, if you'd like.

(Witness approaches Elmo screen.)

A. This is pretty grainy. If I could see a photograph or something.
Seems to me there was a photograph that depicts the cuts.

(Mr. Baker approaches the witness with an actual copy of a photo.)

A. I think there was another cut down in there, in the first knuckle
area. Seems to me there's another cut down in this area.

Q. Now, when you say down in this area -- let's do it by the ruler.

THE COURT: No, it's not that. It's the jury is just looking at your
backs.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you want to --

MR. PETROCELLI: Want to try this picture, Mr. Baker?

MR. P. BAKER: Here is a better photo.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You want to circle the area you say is a cut.

MR. PETROCELLI: Want to try this picture?

MR. BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Little more clear, same day.

This one also.

(Mr. Petrocelli hands Exhibits 171 and 172 to Mr. Baker.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You want to circle on that where you say the cut is.

Do you want to look at these before you make your decision where the
cut is.

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the exhibit numbers?

MR. FOSTER: 171, 172.

A. These two areas I'm circling here.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

A. This doesn't catch too well.

Q. Now, you've circled one area down by the distal joint of the middle
finger, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And is the cut going parallel or approximately parallel to the
ruler; is that where you believe the cut is?

A. It's kind of difficult to see because of the creases in the skin,
but it appears to be partially parallel.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, why don't you blow up that one on the screen.

MR. BAKER: All right. I'll be happy to.

THE REPORTER: What number is that, that he marked?

MR. BAKER: This is --

MR. P. BAKER: We have --

THE COURT: This is the one we marked.

MR. P. BAKER: We are to mark it with a new number now that it's
marked.

THE COURT: That's fine.

THE CLERK: 2259.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of Mr. Simpson's hand
with circle drawn by Mr. Lange was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2259.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is this line here, is that what you say is a cut?

A. I think it's down in this area, it's a little tough to tell with
the creases of the skin.

Q. Is it this area right here?

A. I think it is.

Q. That would be about -- above 4 and 7/8 and going from -- in an
upward direction above the ruler, correct?

A. That's where that area is, yes. Yes.

MR. BAKER: You want to zero in.

Let's just show this photo. Zero in on that. See if we can see if
there's any cut there whatsoever.

THE COURT REPORTER: What are we displaying, please?

MR. P. BAKER: This is back to 172.

MR. BAKER: Now, blow that up.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In your opinion it's a cut or dried blood?

A. Seems to me there was a cut in that area.

Q. Is it your opinion that's a cut or just dried blood?

A. Seems to me there was a cut in that area.

Q. You're telling this jury, by looking at that photo, you think
that's a cut, sir?

A. There was one in that area. This has been two and a half years.
That's my recollection, yes.

Q. Sir, that was the photo taken, sir, pursuant to your directions on
the 13th, is it not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And I take it that you probably agree with me to the extent that
the photo -- what's depicted in the photo is more accurate than your
memory of what occurred, true?

A. In this regard, certainly.

Q. Yes. In this regard, do you agree with that?

A. Certainly.

Q. And is it your testimony, are you telling the ladies and gentlemen
of this jury, that what you visualize in the area that we've now blown
up at about 4 and 7/8 on the ruler is a cut or isn't a cut?

A. I believe that's some type of nick. I believe it is a nick. I
believe it's some type of an injury, yes.

Q. And that nick --

MR. BAKER: Back it off, Phil. Please put the other with the circles on
it.

MR. P. BAKER: 2259.

(Exhibit 2259 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That purported nick and this cut are all of the
cuts, abrasions, nicks, scratches, or anything else you saw on Mr.
Simpson's hand, hands on June 13, 1994, true?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

THE CLERK: I believe we had two photographs that were marked with
Detective Lange, correct?

THE COURT: No, just one.

THE CLERK: Just one.

MR. P. BAKER: 2259.

THE COURT: What did he mark?

MR. P. BAKER: We marked 172 as 2259.

THE COURT: After it was marked?

MR. P. BAKER: Right.

MR. BAKER: We can substitute another 172.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: I'll put on the monitor, 715.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Mr. Lange, can you tell us, if you can, identify the cut that you
were just referring to when you talked to Mr. Baker?

A. Right here.

Q. Okay. And your --

MR. BAKER: That photo was taken June 15?

THE COURT: What?

MR. PETROCELLI: June 15, right.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And can you identify where it is just for the
record?

A. Well, it's on the left hand middle finger, what I call the first
joint towards the tip of the middle finger. Excuse me.

Q. Thank you. You can take it down now.

That day, on the 13th, did you ever hold Mr. Simpson's hands in yours
and inspect his left hand?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever ask him to spread his fingers so that you'd be able to
observe whether or not there were any scrapes, or nicks, or cuts
between his third and fourth finger on his left hand?

A. I don't recall doing that.

Q. Was your primary emphasis on the middle finger, and the left hand
where there was a band-aid on the finger?

MR. BAKER: Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Where was your primary focus?

A. Middle finger of the left hand.

Q. Why was that?

A. Because I observed what appeared to be fresh injuries to it.

Q. Now, you were asked earlier about a portion of the interview with
Mr. Simpson where he said in part, you guys have not told me anything,
and you told Mr. Baker in substance that --

MR. BAKER: Well, I would object to him summarizing what the testimony
is. That's argumentative, Your Honor. He can just ask him the
question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. And you said in substance that there were specifics that Mr.
Simpson had not asked you. That's the area I wanted to talk to you
about.

Had you spoken to --

MR. BAKER: Well, I object that that question assumes facts not in
evidence. He didn't say there were specifics Mr. Simpson hadn't asked
him.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Had you spoken to Mr. Simpson, among other times,
on the telephone from the Rockingham house in the early morning hours
of June 13?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Simpson, to the best of your knowledge, at the time was
where?

A. In Chicago.

Q. And that was the first time you spoke with him?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he not ask you about, among other things, with respect to
--

(Mr. Baker raised his hand.)

THE COURT: Sustained.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Mr. Simpson ask you at that time how his wife
was killed?

MR. BAKER: I object to him leading.

THE COURT: You may ask leading questions. It's objectionable to ask,
"what did he ask you?"

MR. BAKER: All right. Understood.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Mr. Simpson ask you any details of how his
wife was killed?

A. No.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you where the murders took place?

A. No.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you how she was killed?

A. No.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you what weapon was used?

A. No.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you any of the questions, that in your
experience, are ordinarily asked of a homicide investigator, when
there's a report of the death of a close one that's related?

A. No.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you, for example, how do you know that it was
his wife?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object. This is argumentative in the sense
that --

THE COURT: I think you went through it once. All right. I'll sustain
the objection unless . . .

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, there was also some questions by Mr. Baker
about during the interview, about blood, and whether Mr. Simpson
immediately had volunteered to have a blood test.

Earlier in your discussion with Mr. Simpson, prior to the portion Mr.
Baker had read you, had you discussed the fact with him that various
blood was found at Rockingham?

A. I believe so.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Mr. Simpson volunteer to take a blood test?

MR. BAKER: Mr. Medvene, I object to this. He's asking him to recall
what is in this. Let's go to the actual document, not his leading
question about what he believes was asked at the interview.

(Pause.)

THE COURT: I'm confused by the questions.

MR. MEDVENE: Let me do what Mr. Baker had suggested. With Your Honor's
permission, let's go to the specific interview.

THE COURT: And which interview are you talking about?

MR. MEDVENE: On June the 13th, when Mr. Simpson was speaking with
Detectives Lange and Vannatter.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Mr. Simpson say -- and I direct you to page
15, line 24. (Reading:)

I recall bleeding at my house,

and then I went to the Bronco. The last

thing before I did before I left, when I

was rushing was went and got my phone

out of the Bronco.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you recall Mr. Simpson telling you that?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he volunteer for any blood test at that time?

A. No.

Q. Do you recall --

MR. BAKER: You want to read the question from now on, so it appears
that Mr. Simpson is in fact answering their question.

MR. MEDVENE: Let me read from page 15 to accommodate Mr. Baker,
starting at line 22, I'll read through 26.

(Reading:) Q. That's okay. Do you

recall bleeding at all in the -- in your

truck, in the Bronco. Mr. Simpson: I recall bleeding

at my house, and then I went to the

Bronco. The last thing I did before I

left, I was rushing, was went and got my

phone out of the Bronco.

MR. MEDVENE: I direct you now, Mr. Baker, to page 16, line 11.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you or Mr. Vannatter say to Mr. Simpson:
(Reading:)

So do you recall bleeding at all?

Q. And Mr. Simpson said: (Reading:)

Yeah, I mean I -- I knew I was

bleeding, but it was no big deal, I

bleed all the time. I mean it's -- I'm

always -- I play golf and stuff so

there's always something, nicks and

stuff.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you remember that being asked of Mr. Simpson,
and Mr. Simpson giving you that answer?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he volunteer to give any blood at that time?

A. No.

Q. During the interview, before Mr. Simpson said whatever he said, did
you make reference to your recollection to any blood of Mr. Simpson's
being found at the Bundy location?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: I object to the question as vague, before he said whatever
he said.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Before -- later in the interview, when Mr. Simpson
said what Mr. Baker made reference to, about volunteering to give
blood, did you tell Mr. Simpson that his blood had been found at
Bundy?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object to that question. Move to strike.
There's no foundation they knew his blood had ever been found at Bundy
when they interviewed him.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you were also asked some questions, this
morning I believe, about the crime scene at Rockingham, and you
mentioned the crime scene at Rockingham, in effect, was not your
responsibility.

What did you mean by that?

A. I was to investigate the Bundy crime scene, and Vannatter would be
in charge of the Rockingham crime scene.

Q. Yesterday, Mr. Baker showed you something that he said might be a
shoe print and you were unable to identify it as a shoe print.

Why is that?

A. Well, I just -- I looked at it. I can't say that it's any kind of a
shoe print. I mean to me, if that were a shoe print, there would be
others around there.

I mean there's just the one pattern there referring to if in fact that
was a shoe print, you'd expect to find other shoe prints around it
because of the large amount of blood.

Q. Well, were there any other bloody shapes of any kind that were
going east on Bundy?

A. No.

Q. Is it true while there were no other bloody shapes that appeared to
be shoe prints going east on Bundy, you did observe certain paw prints
and blood?

A. There appeared to be animal paw prints, yes.

Q. Now, there was also a question yesterday regarding your ability to
reconstruct the murder in terms of who was attacked first, and who
died first; that series of questions.

Are you able, not having been present, to give any definite opinion as
to who was attacked first, or who died first, or who necessarily was
standing where?

A. I don't think there was anyway I can do that.

Q. And why is that?

A. Well, as you mentioned, part of it is I wasn't there. It was --- as
the investigator all I can do is go by the physical evidence at the
crime scene, and looking at that crime scene there are probably three
or four possible scenarios.

Q. Now, as a result of the fact that it's not possible to reconstruct
exactly what happened with respect to the two murders, is there any
evidence, to your knowledge, to indicate a second suspect?

A. No.

Q. And why do you say that?

A. I have one set of bloody shoe prints at the crime scene. The
victims were killed in a similar fashion, the wounds are similar.
There appears, in my mind, to be a common murder weapon because of the
mixture of blood found at the scene at the bottom of Mr. Goldman's
boot. There's just absolutely no evidence of a second suspect.

Q. What does that tell you -- by the way, when you say a common
weapon, why do you say that? By common weapon you mean used by one
person?

A. One weapon used by one person on both victims. Because of a mixture
of blood found on the boot, the form of a blood droplet, perhaps a
cast off, what I would term a common murder weapon that had the blood
of both victims on it.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further. Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATON BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Let me ask you this. You say you talked to O.J. Simpson from
Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. I thought you just testified the first time you talked to him was
five minutes before you started the interview at Parker Center?

A. In person.

Q. Oh, you just meant in person when you answered that question?

A. Well, that was the impression I got from you when you asked that
question.

Q. I asked the question, sir, have you ever talked to O.J. Simpson
before you were at Parker Center, and you answered that question, did
you not, in the negative?

A. I was under the impression that you meant face to face, in person.

Q. Did you ever talk to --

A. If I gave you the wrong impression, I did, I'm sorry.

Q. Did you ever talk to -- you mean in person?

A. It did when you mentioned that, yes.

Q. So it was -- you just failed to admit, you just omitted this
purported conversation you say you had with O.J. Simpson from the
Rockingham house?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you omit it or did you not?

A. I was just reminded of that conversation I had with Mr. Simpson
when Mr. Medvene brought it up. At that time I didn't recall it. I
thought you were alluding to an in-person type interview.

Q. You went out and talked to Mr. Medvene, and were reminded of a
conversation you now say you had with Mr. Simpson on June 13, 1994,
over the telephone, rights?

A. When he just asked that question, yes.

Q. And just -- there had been no, of course, communication with you
before he would have had to -- Strike that.

Just his questions just kind of brought it to your mind, right?

A. Refreshed my memory of the fact that I did indeed have a telephonic
conversation.

Q. And his other questions just refreshed your memory as to what Mr.
Simpson didn't ask, right?

A. I'm aware of what he didn't ask.

Q. Let me ask you this question:

Mr. Simpson called Rockingham and called Bundy from the airplane
multiple times; you're aware of that?

A. I'm aware.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, outside the scope of our examination.

THE COURT: Overruled?

A. I'm aware of the one call to Rockingham because I took it.

Q. Well, you were aware he talked to Phillips from Rockingham before
you ever talked to him, if you ever did?

A. Oh, I did. Phillips --

Q. You were aware of a phone call from Phillips, were you not?

A. Phillips called Simpson. Simpson didn't call Phillips.

Q. You were aware that Simpson called Rockingham at least three or
four more times that morning while he was on an airplane trying to get
back to his house, and to the murder scene of his ex-wife, correct?

A. He may have.

Q. And he called Bundy three or four more times trying to get
information relative to what had happened, and what had occurred, and
talked to police officers who picked up the phone at Bundy?

You're aware of that, are you not?

A. I don't recall that.

Q. Well, before you go on national television and excoriated Mr.
Simpson for not having inquired about what you thought was
appropriate, you'd sure want to find out who he talked to besides you,
wouldn't you, or do you just want to be one-sided?

A. No. I was probably more concerned with what Mr. Simpson asked me as
his interviewer, and my partner and this -- now that you brought it
up, none of those questions were asked.

Q. Now, you -- You say that you can't reconstruct the murder scene at
875 South Bundy, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. But you can reconstruct it enough, when Mr. Medvene asks you
questions, to determine that there is, in your view, a single murder
weapon, right?

A. I can interpret the evidence that I see at the scene. That doesn't
extend itself to knowing exactly what happened, how it happened, and
when it happened.

MR. BAKER: Get the board.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And we'll start talking about the -- the evidence at
the scene, Mr. Lange.

Now, at the scene there was, you say, a drop, or was it multiple
drops, or was it multiple smears and stains on -- of combined blood of
Nicole and Ron Goldman?

A. I was alluding to one drop which was a mixture of blood of Mr.
Goldman and Ms. Brown on the boot -- sole of the boot of Mr. Goldman.

Q. Now, was there, in your opinion, in your reconstruction slant
unreconstruction, did the bodies of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown
Simpson ever touch?

A. I'm sorry. You had your hand in front.

Did they touch?

Q. Sure. Did she ever -- they ever come in contact?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, previously asked and answered, outside the
copy of examination.

MR. BAKER: I think he opened this whole area up on reconstruction.

MR. MEDVENE: We just followed up.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't know if they touched or not.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you certainly didn't know, except from hearsay
information, whether or not a blood drop on the boot of Mr. Goldman
contains Nicole Brown Simpson's blood and Ron Goldman's blood, true?

A. I was made aware of that, obviously, subsequent to that
investigation, yes.

Q. And I take it that in terms of your reconstruction, you'd want to
get all of the serology results, not just one single drop of blood,
wouldn't you?

A. Well, it would depend on what you're looking for, certainly.

Q. We're looking for a reconstruction so that you can come into court,
under penalty of perjury, and tell this jury that you believe there's
one assailant because of a single drop of blood.

And that is the single drop of blood that is where? Why don't you come
over on the sole of Mr. Goldman's boot and point it out to us.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That misstates his testimony, Your Honor, one
set of bloody footprints and a number of other things --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Show us the blood that had blood drops --

THE COURT: Just a minute. Objection sustained.

With regard to the rest of it, you may go to the board and show where
the blood you referred to in your last answer is.

MR. P. BAKER: That's board 1342.

(Exhibit 1342 displayed.)

A. Referring to this blood drop here on the sole of the left boot.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury the
position of that boot when the blood drop was dropped on it?

A. I would have no idea, not being there.

Q. Well, don't you do any accident or murder reconstruction?

A. To that extent, no.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Not to that extent, no.

Q. Well, you described it as a blood drop, correct?

A. Blood drop, perhaps in the form of a cast off of a common murder
weapon.

Q. A blood drop and a cast off are not the same, are they?

A. In the form of a cast off, Counselor.

Q. You said there was a blood drop, and that gave you the impression
that there was a single weapon used, true?

A. I believe I mentioned in the form of a cast off. That -- I would
term that a blood drop, fine.

Q. You think this is a blood drop, correct?

A. To me a blood drop in the form of a cast off, correct.

Q. A cast off is a description that criminalists use to determine --
depict blood that has been flung from something, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you know whether his boot was up, down, sideways, how it was
when this blood drop dropped?

A. No, I couldn't.

Q. Now, did you in the sense of -- did you know that there were blood
transfers between the clothing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron
Goldman?

Apparently you didn't know from the look on your face?

A. Transfers?

Q. Blood transfers from clothing of Nicole Brown Simpson to Ron
Goldman.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, assumes facts, Your Honor.

THE COURT: What's the question. Overruled.

A. I don't know of any transfers of clothing, no.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, do you know that Ron Goldman's blood was found
on the clothing of Nicole --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You want to come here.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

MR. PETROCELLI: The --

THE COURT: In as much as this portion of the testimony was a long time
ago, there's an objection raised as to whether or not that is an item
that was not in evidence.

MR. BLASIER: It was -- it was Renee Montgomery's testimony where it
had the charts about the number of stains, transfers.

THE COURT: Who is Renee?

MR. BLASIER: She was from the Department of Justice. Renee Montgomery.
And she testified about 23 stains, 13 from Goldman to Brown, and I
think 6 the other way. Something -- I had the exact -- I don't have
the exact numbers. That was her testimony. There was blood from each
victim on the other person's clothing.

MR. PETROCELLI: She never testified there was transfer between the
victims. I have questions about the accuracy of that representation.
I'd have to go back and check the testimony, but if he just rephrases
his testimony (sic) instead of assumes it is a fact, just ask whether
or not he knows something, we can avoid the debate here.

THE COURT: I'm not -- if in fact that is true, he has a right to ask
the question.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't believe there's any evidence to that effect.
I'll have to check the record at lunch time. I can't probably do it in
the short time we have now.

MR. MEDVENE: In addition to that, Your Honor, it's not relevant to
what the question was on.

THE COURT: You could have stopped when -- but you opened it up, and so
we're going through a whole afternoon of examination apparently.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think that's --

MR. BAKER: That's true.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I don't think that's a fair comment at
all. We've been through Bundy extensively in the first examination. We
have a right to do some recross.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Lange were you aware that there was -- I
think it was 14 separate stains of Ron Goldman's blood on Nicole Brown
Simpson's, and I believe 6 or 8 stains of Nicole's blood on Ron
Goldman's clothes?

A. It's been sometime since I've reviewed serological reports. It may
well be. I don't recall that.

Q. That was of no significance to you?

A. It would have been of some significance back then certainly, but
again, I haven't seen those possibly in over two years.

Q. It's never mentioned in your follow-up report, is it?

A. I don't think we had those reports -- results when I did my
follow-up report.

Q. Now, if you have a cast off of the blood from a murder weapon, and
the boot is in an upright position as it is depicted here, you would
anticipate that the blood would run down the sole for half an inch,
three-quarter of an inch, right?

(Referring to board entitled "Blood stains from closed in area of
Bundy.")

A. I couldn't say. Not necessarily.

Q. To get a pattern as indicated in the photograph, in the lower
right-hand picture on the board, the boot has to be virtually in an
upright position, that is the sole facing upward, true?

A. The sole facing skyward.

Q. Skyward.

And that's impossible, isn't it?

A. Well, I would think so.

This here does appear to be somewhat elongated. Perhaps it struck as
the boot is there.

Q. So as the boot is there?

A. Only speculation.

Q. In your reconstruction of the murder scene, that boot in a cast off
pattern of a blood drop would only elongate, what, an eighth of an
inch, sixteenth of an inch?

A. I can't say for sure.

Q. Now, in your version of reconstruction, we had blood on the fence
-- that's the north fence, right?

A. Yes.

Q. We had blood pooling by the concrete walk, stone walk, correct?

A. Pooling?

Q. Pooling.

A. Blood drops. I don't know that it's pooling.

Q. Look over here.

Tell the jury, because you were at the scene and inspected the scene,
and you knew where the blood was, that was blood pooling behind --
north of the fence, was it not, sir?

A. Looks like several drops to me. I suppose, once again, we can make
a subjective call, where you would call it pooling and I might call it
drops of blood. I don't --

Q. This is a drop in this area here, and down here is just a couple of
drops?

A. No. I said it appears to be several drops of blood.

Q. This is in fact blood pooling, is it not, sir?

A. I think that's a subjective term.

Q. Well, let's see if we can define it for you.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 2166.

(Exhibit 2166 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I take it you believe that's just a couple of drops,
right?

A. Once again, counselor, I never said it was a couple of drops. I
said it looks to me to be several drops of blood.

Q. Well, how much is several? Is that five or is it 500?

A. I would -- I would have no way of knowing.

Q. Well, you were there and you looked at it.

And this is blood, this is blood, this is blood, this is blood, and
this is blood, all the way over to the stone area, correct?

(Indicating.)

A. Yes.

Q. And obviously, sir, that took some time to be deposited there, did
it not?

A. I don't think I can say that.

If that would be arterial bleeding it could be a couple of seconds.

Q. Now, the area where that blood is in your reconstruction, is behind
where the body of Ron Goldman was found, correct?

A. Behind and north of, yes.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry to do this, but let's put this photo up.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 88.

(Exhibit 88 displayed.)

Q. The area we're looking at is -- see that blood smear behind Mr.
Goldman?

A. Um-hum.

Q. See that blood smear?

(Indicating.)

A. Same blood smear, right.

Q. Appears to be.

(Indicating to board entitled "Blood stains from closed-in area at
Bundy."

MR. BAKER: Take it off, please.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. You were at the autopsy and looked at the autopsy report?

A. I did review it sometime later, yes.

Q. There was no external arterial bleeding at all, was there, from Mr.
Goldman?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Well --

A. There was a lot of blood, I know that.

Q. We've just shown you the picture, sir, showing his back to the area
where that blood pooled, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you know from being at the autopsy, and doing your own
reconstruction, that there was no wound on the back of his neck, and
no wound on the back.

There was a wound in his lower side which was the side that was
pointed upwards at the time that he was found, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And there is no wound on his body that would explain the blood
poolings that I have shown you, isn't that true, unless he was
standing upright and the blood was exiting his -- bleeding from his
neck, down his left side, down his left shoe?

A. Not necessarily. He had quite a bit of bleeding from his leg. There
was obviously a struggle that went on here. The blood could have been
deposited during the time of the struggle. It's -- again, it's
approximately, speculation.

Q. Well, obviously, the blood was deposited during the time of the
struggle, don't you think?

A. That's what I said.

Q. Well, you said could have been.

It's obvious that it, in fact, was deposited at that time, true?

A. I think we can assume that it probably was, in fact, deposited at
the time this occurred, yes.

Q. So at least in your scenario of events, Mr. Goldman was inside the
gate, then he was around on the east fence, and at some point therein
the keys were lost, correct?

A. I don't know if they were lost. There were keys found there, yes.

Q. These keys that are shown in the lower -- center lower picture are
the keys that were left at the crime scene, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, this whole area was gone into
extensively earlier.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, we can do it again.

Mr. Medvene, you asked this witness to reconstruct and state the basis
for his theory and --

MR. MEDVENE: No, we didn't.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker's entitled to cross-examine on that basis.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And these keys had no blood on them at the crime
scene, and had blood on them when they were returned to the owner;
isn't that true?

A. No. I think they were splattered at the crime scene.

Q. You see any blood on those keys whatsoever?

A. I don't think you can see both sides of the keys. I don't think you
can see everything there.

Q. Did you note anywhere in any LAPD document relative to the
investigation of this crime scene that there was blood on those keys,
sir?

A. No. I wouldn't have touched the keys. The criminalist collected
them.

Q. From your review of the documents in this case, have you ever seen
a document that indicates the keys had blood on them?

A. I don't recall seeing that.

Q. The keys were lost and they were underneath some foliage in the
caged or closed-in area, correct?

A. Partially.

Q. And then the struggle continued back to the area where the hole was
dug during the crime scene, during the struggle, correct?

A. I don't know that there's anyway that we can put that into a
sequence.

Q. Well, you said in your opinion, it was probable that it was done
during the -- during the struggle, did you not, sir?

A. Well, during the struggle, certainly. But I'm not going to tell you
that the keys were dropped, and the hole was dug, then the blood was
dropped. I can't tell you that.

Q. Well, so you don't know how the struggle took place, whether the --
the pager that was flung to the north of where the blood pooled, you
don't know what sequence that occurred in?

A. I don't think the evidence gives us that.

I think, as I testified, there are probably three or four scenarios
for the way this could have happened. I can't tell you exactly what
happened and when it happened.

Q. You don't know whether the envelope was dropped with the glasses in
it?

A. I can't tell you when, no.

Q. You don't know if that envelope was handed to Nicole Brown Simpson,
because the LAPD took absolutely no fingerprints off of it?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: That's argumentative. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was -- Was there any fingerprints taken off the
envelope that was found between the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson --

THE COURT: Sustained.

You know, I'm allowing you some latitude. I'm not going to go back and
redo the whole examination. You have -- you have latitude to examine
with respect to the basis for his theory that he testified to, and Mr.
Medvene's examination.

But beyond that I'm not going to revisit the original examination.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let's go back to the boot for a minute.

On the boot, did you notice the cut in the same boot where you say the
blood drop was a cast away -- you now say was a cast away drop?

A. Yes, I believe there was a slice in both boots.

Q. Slice in both boots?

A. I believe that's my recollection, yes.

Q. In fact, the LA Police Department -- you never noticed a slice in
both boots until that boot was examined by Henry Lee?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Is this a good point?

THE COURT: 1:30, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case, don't form or express any opinion.

(At 12:00 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11,1996
1:39 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. MEDVENE: Good afternoon, Your Honor.

At the break, Mr. Baker informed me he had no further questions of Mr.
Lange.

We have no questions.

I think, subject to Mr. Baker moving in some exhibits, Mr. Lange's
been released, pursuant to the agreement with Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I got the Court's message.

THE COURT: I didn't send one.

MR. BAKER: Relative to Exhibits 2257, 2258 and 2259.

Thank you.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2257 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2258 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2259 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, under 767, we recall Susan Brockbank.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I have a standing objection on these city
employees.

THE COURT: You have a standing ruling.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

And we can treat them, under cross, both ways, then, right?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. BAKER: I would object to them treating under cross.

I just place it on the record.

THE COURT: Okay.

SUSAN BROCKBANK was called as a witness on behalf of the defendants
pursuant Evidence Code 767, was previously duly sworn, and testified
further as follows:

THE CLERK: And you are still under oath. And would you please state
your name again, for the record.

THE WITNESS: Susan Brockbank.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Brockbank.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. You are a criminalist with the Police Department, SID division,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time that you worked on the Simpson case, you were
assigned to the hair and trace unit, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, previously, you testified -- and let me put on the Elmo 464,
the first page of 464.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 464, first page, displayed on the Elmo
screen.)

Q. You recall being asked questions by the plaintiffs and testifying
about the dates that you collected -- or that various items were
collected and the dates that they were sent to the FBI and what the
FBI numbers were, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then 464 is just a different part, basically saying the name
again, when items were collected and when they were sent to the FBI?

A. Yes.

Q. It's accurate you did far more work in this case than just that in
terms of analyzing evidence?

A. Than just what?

Q. Than just collecting them on one date and sending them to the FBI
on another date?

A. Yes, I did more than that.

Q. You are an expert trained in the analysis of hair and fiber, are
you not?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Okay.

Now, would you agree with me that comparing hair evidence with such
things as fingerprints, DNA conventional serology, that hair evidence
is the least discriminating of all of those types of evidence?

A. I don't know that it's the least discriminating. We don't generate
numbers like those other things do.

I mean, with a fingerprint, you can make a positive identification.

Q. Right.

A. With a hair exam, you can't.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. And with -- with your example of blood analysis, they give you
frequency numbers in the population, and with hair, we don't do that,
either.

Q. All you can say with hair is, it could have come from that person;
then again, it might not have?

A. Well, either it could have come from them, or it did not come from
them, yes.

Q. But when you say it could have come from them, you can't say that
conclusively, that it did come from a particular person, can you?

A. No.

Q. And you can't -- there are no -- no tables of data anywhere that
helps you narrow down how many other people it could possibly have
come from, either; isn't that correct?

A. No -- I mean, that's correct.

Q. And the same is true of fiber evidence, is it not?

It's not terribly discriminating, in that about the only thing you can
say is that two fibers could have had a common source, for the most
part?

A. Unless you have like a patch of fabric that you're piecing back
together, where you have a physical match, in that case, you could
say, you know, you have a positive identification.

But if you don't have a patch of fabric, if you're dealing with single
fibers, then yes, um-hum.

Q. And none of the fiber evidence in this case is like a patch of
cloth that you can exactly match up to a source, correct?

A. None that I'm aware of.

Q. Okay.

Now, would you agree that, with respect to hair and fiber evidence at
a crime scene, that one of the things that you would like to know, as
a criminalist or investigator, is whether or not the suspect was a
frequent visitor to the area where hair and fiber evidence might have
been found?

A. That would be an additional piece of information, sure.

Q. Okay.

The evidence would be of more value if you found someone's hair or
fiber when they'd never been to that location, supposedly, correct?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. I didn't ask that very well.

A. You mean -- more significant, you mean?

Q. Yes.

A. I think so, yes.

Q. And one of the reasons for that is that hair and fiber pretty much
stay around for a long time, don't they?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) They don't break down like blood tests?

A. Well, with time, they will break down, yes.

Q. A lot of time, right?

A. Well, it takes -- it takes a bit of time for them, yeah, to totally
disintegrate. But --

Q. I mean, you can have a fiber that you find in one location. That it
may have been there for months, and you have no way of knowing whether
it was put there this morning or was there five months ago, do you?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you have no way of knowing how many
intermediate places it might have been between where it originally
came from and where you found it, correct?

A. Not really, no.

Q. Okay.

And you never did an analysis of the soil area around 875 South Bundy
to determine how common hairs consistent with Mr. Simpson might be in
that area, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. And you didn't do any analysis like that to determine how common
carpet fibers, that might be consistent with his Bronco, were in that
area, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Now, hair and trace evidence, oftentimes, is very difficult to see
with the naked eye, is it not?

A. I guess it depends on what -- on what the surface is that the hair
is on, or what the circumstances are surrounding, you know, each
individual case.

Q. Okay.

Would you agree that you don't -- that's not the kind of assessment
that you made in the field; that is, when there's hair or fiber
evidence on a piece of evidence, it's something you determine in the
lab?

A. Not always, no.

Q. Primarily?

A. I don't know even primarily. It's, you know, really a case-by-case
basis. If you have, you know, you're out in the field and you have an
object like this (indicating to witness stand), where you see hairs
over to the side of it, you may collect it right then at the time.

Q. Okay.

Would you agree with this, as a general rule, that kind of analysis is
done in the laboratory under controlled conditions?

A. The analysis is performed in a -- in the lab, yes. But removal
isn't always, no.

Q. Okay.

In this, case are you aware of any single hair or fiber sample that
was picked up at the scene, as opposed to taken off of a piece of
evidence back at the lab?

A. I believe there might have been some hairs and fibers collected by
either Mr. Fung or Ms. Mazzola, like from a blood stain or something.

I'm just going on memory here.

Q. You --

A. So --

Q. -- you have a specific recollection of any such example like that
which was found at the scene as opposed to taken off a piece of
evidence later?

A. That's what I'm describing for you now.

Q. You think of one?

A. I think so. Yes.

Q. Any others?

A. Again, just going on my memory, none that I can think of.

Q. When you examine items of evidence in the lab, you do so under very
controlled conditions, do you not?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And you have a closed-in room that has no air currents in it?

There's minimal air current as possible, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's because hairs and fibers -- fibers in particular -- can
get moved from one thing to another just by waving at them in some
cases, correct?

A. Not -- not so much. I mean, it may be possible for something to
move from one place to another, but I don't know that it happens with
any frequency.

Q. Why do you avoid air currents in the room that you use to examine
items?

A. So that you don't lose evidence.

Q. Because the air current could cause you to lose it, huh?

A. Well, they could cause it to drop off of your working surface and
onto the floor, and then it's pretty much lost.

Q. You're very careful that you don't have other people walking around
in the same room that you're doing these kinds of analysis in; is that
fair to say?

A. Well, in our lab, we have one -- one room, mainly, in the trace
unit that is used for that type of analysis.

And there are generally other people working in the same room. They
may be walking around; they may not be.

Q. Now, with respect to hair analysis, we heard testimony from Agent
Deedrick about certain characteristics that you look at when you
examine a hair to see if it could have come from a particular person,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, it's accurate, is it not, that there is no uniform list of
characteristics that everybody uses; is that correct?

A. That everybody -- you mean -- what do you mean by "everybody,"
everybody?

Q. All examiners that --

A. Hair examiners?

Q. -- As you are?

A. From agency to agency, I think that will differ within a given
agency. There's usually some sort of -- of a form, or release of form
at describing hairs.

Q. In your work, you do have a form that you fill out in detail as to
what characteristics you think you've observed for a particular hair,
don't you?

A. We use a form, along with just written, verbal notes.

Q. And you're careful to write down all the things that you observe,
so if you have to reconstruct it later, you can do so from your
paperwork, correct?

A. Just to, you know, refresh your memory and what not, but an actual
comparison isn't done on paper.

Q. You write down -- I'm sorry.

You write down the findings, the characteristics of what you saw and
what you think is similar, correct?

A. Yeah, we see a particular hair, we write down the characteristics;
we write notes whether we believe it's similar to a known sample or
not.

Q. Special Agent Deedrick doesn't do any of that?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Calls for speculation.

MR. BLASIER: I'll try to lay the foundation

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You took a lot of this evidence back, and worked
with Doug Deedrick in the FBI lab; watched him work?

A. I watched him some of the time.

I was there not every minute.

Q. You had a chance to evaluate his paperwork compared to yourself,
haven't you?

A. Not all of it.

I did see some of his notes, but I don't know that I've seen
everything that he did.

Q. You know that he does not keep detailed notes about what he looks
at like you do?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. No foundation --

THE COURT: She watched him do his work.

MR. GELBLUM: -- in this case.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. GELBLUM: The question is overbroad.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. MR. BLASIER: In this case, your notes are much better than his,
aren't they?

A. I don't know that you'd say better. They're just different. He uses
--

Q. Yours has something in them; his doesn't, correct?

A. His --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Try another question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, on August 4 of 1994, you examined the socks
found at Rockingham for the first time; is that accurate?

A. Can I refer to my notes --

Q. Sure.

A. -- for that.

(Pause for witness to review notes in blue notebook, taken from her
briefcase.)

THE WITNESS: What was the date, again?

Q. August 4, 1994.

A. Take me just a minute to find it in my notes.

Yes, it was August 4.

(Witness reviews notes.)

Q. That was the first time, to your knowledge, that the socks were
examined for any fiber evidence; is that correct?

A. That was the only time I examined them for fiber evidence.

Q. And when they were given to you, both socks were contained in one
single bag, were they not?

A. Actually, I was called over to the serology unit, and the socks
were already out on the lab bench.

Q. So you don't know how they'd been preserved prior to that time,
whether they had been in separate bags or not?

A. No, I don't actually recall the packaging on them.

Q. Now, you also, as part of your work in the case, had measured
various gloves at various times, have you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you measured the Rockingham and the Bundy gloves shortly after
they were seized, correct?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. In June of '94?

A. Well, let's see.

The first time I examined them was on June 19.

Q. Of '94?

A. Oh, wait a minute. Hold on just one second.

Q. Sure.

A. I'm sorry.

It was June 21 of 1994.

Q. Okay.

You measured both gloves, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you measured them a second time, I think, almost a year later,
in the middle of criminal trial?

A. Yes. That was June 19, '95.

Q. Isn't it accurate that -- well, withdrawn.

You also measured a pair of new Aris leather lights, extra large,
produced by the prosecution in the criminal case, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And it's accurate, is it not, that the size of the Rockingham and
Bundy gloves that you measured, both times you measured them, in 1994
and 1995, were much smaller than the extra large Aris, the new ones
that were provided by the prosecution, correct?

A. Yes. The measurements actually were up to about an inch, I think,
and an eighth smaller.

Q. Substantially smaller?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. They were definitely smaller.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And the Rockingham glove, between June of '94 and
June of '95, at the time they were tried on by Mr. Simpson, actually
had gotten a little bigger, hadn't they?

A. The right glove, which was item number 9?

Q. Correct.

A. Measured slightly larger, my notes say, up to a quarter inch on
length of three of the five fingers.

So it was slightly larger than my original measurement.

Q. Larger in the criminal trial than when you measured them back in
June of '94, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, one of the items that you examined was a -- a sample of carpet
from the Bronco, correct?

A. Yes.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 419 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. And looking at 419, do you recognize the pictures in Exhibit 419 as
being the piece of carpet that you examined on various occasions?

A. That does appear to be it, yes.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. That does appear to be it.

Q. Okay.

And can you tell us -- these certainly aren't life-size pictures --
can you tell us the dimensions -- actually, we have a ruler here. The
piece of carpeting was -- appears to be almost three feet long, I
don't know, maybe two feet wide.

Does that sound about right?

A. That sounds about right.

Q. And this carpeting was actually cut out of the Bronco, the front
driver's side of the Bronco, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. To your knowledge?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you cut a piece of carpet, isn't it true that the carpet
fibers get very fragile along the edges, in the sense that you're
likely to get stuff falling off of that if you're not careful?

A. Yes. You usually get some yarns falling off.

Q. Okay.

And the carpet fibers that you had examined, or found, on other pieces
of evidence in this case, were all extremely small, weren't they?

A. Can you repeat that?

Q. Yeah.

The carpet fibers that you found on some pieces of evidence in this
case, were fairly small, weren't they?

A. I never measured any of the fibers that I removed on anything.

Q. Do you recall whether they were small?

A. No, I don't.

Q. When did you first examine that carpet?

A. Let me check again, my notes.

(Witness reviews notes from blue notebook binder.)

THE WITNESS: Sorry, my notebook isn't as organized as I thought it
was.

Okay.

Yeah, I examined the carpet on July 22 of 1994, along with Collin
Yamauchi and John Taggart (phonetic).

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And did you examine it at other times, as well?

A. That was really the only time I examined it. I did -- I think --
well, I don't even know if I was the one that did it, or I just
accompanied Bill Bodziak in looking at that one other time.

Q. Okay.

When you looked at it in -- what you said, July?

A. July 22.

Q. Now, it was contained in a box, was it not?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And that came to be known in the criminal trial as box number 2,
didn't it?

A. Yes, it did.

MR. BLASIER: And can we have the next in order.

THE CLERK: Going to be 2260, marked by reference to DR number
94-0-17431.

(The instrument herein referred to as A cardboard box with tape on it,
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2260 by
reference to DR number 94-0-17431.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you 2260.

Can you -- can you tell me if this is box number 2?

(Witness examines Defendants' Exhibit 2260.)

A. Yes, it appears to be.

Q. Okay.

And there's a label on the side, is there not, that describes the
contents of that box, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me put a copy of that on the Elmo.

MR. BLASIER: Maybe we can make this the next one 22 --

THE CLERK: 61.

MR. BLASIER: 61.

(The instrument herein referred to as A copy of a label describing the
contents of Defendants' Exhibit 2260 was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2261.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Would you agree that appears to be a copy of the
label that is on box number 2?

A. Yes, it appears to be.

Q. Now, that piece of carpet, when you examined it for the first time
in July, was too big to fit into a paper bag, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And it had -- had been rolled up into butcher paper, correct?

A. The carpet itself was kind of folded up.

Q. Um-hum?

A. That was wrapped in butcher paper.

Q. Okay.

And it was scotch-taped?

A. No. The brown tape that you see on the box --

Q. Um-hum?

A. -- it was taped with that.

Q. So it was taped up?

A. Yes.

Q. And isn't it accurate that, in that same box, in July, when you
examined the carpet, both Rockingham and Bundy gloves were in the same
box?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Is it also true that the knit cap that you examined was kept in
that very same box?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Now, is there -- you would agree that there was evidence from three
different scenes kept in that same box together, correct?

A. Yes, I guess there was.

Q. And each time you take something out, they were in bags of course,
in the box, correct except for the carpet?

A. Yeah. Each of the items were individually wrapped inside the box.

Q. Each time you open a bag that has an item like a glove, a cap, you
check the bag, because oftentimes, stuff falls off of it into the bag,
correct?

A. When I'm examining the item, I check inside the bag?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes.

Q. So -- because that's a frequent occurrence, stuff falling off?

A. Sure.

Q. And, in fact, if you would look closely in this box, you'll see --
why don't you take a look.

There's scotch tape in here. There appears to be some residual of
something stuck to the scotch-tape inside.

MR. GELBLUM: I object. There's been no chain of custody preserved on
this box.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. GELBLUM: There's been no chain of custody preserved on this box. I
don't know where it's been since last year.

THE COURT: Better approach. Approach the bench, then.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

THE COURT: You want chain of custody?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor --

THE COURT: You want chain of custody?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I examined the box. They've had the box at
their office.

Right?

MR. BLASIER: No. It's been here the whole time.

MR. GELBLUM: No, there's no physical evidence. There was physical
evidence at their office.

THE COURT: I'll give you chain of custody.

MR. GELBLUM: Good. I was told by them they took all defense exhibits
to their office. If that's not true, that's fine.

MR. BLASIER: No.

MR. GELBLUM: To come right from the courthouse to here. If it came
right from the courthouse here, even in the criminal courts building,
Your Honor, we had access to it; they had access to it.

I'm not challenging them to use the box. Just the debris in the box
doesn't prove anything at this late date. That's all I'm talking
about.

THE COURT: You want chain of custody, I'll give you what we have.

MR. GELBLUM: Before you got it, Your Honor, it was in the Criminal
Courts Building.

THE COURT: I'll give you what we have.

THE CLERK: I got it from the LAPD, from somebody at SID. I called --
initially, I called my supervisor to try to get him to do it. It took
him about a day and a half. He couldn't do anything.

So I called Hank Goldberg. I checked the transcript, and the D.A. that
was using the exhibit in the criminal trial is Hank Goldberg. He gave
me one number to call.

I called about three people, including Gregory Matheson.

And then I got Mr. Matheson on the phone. I recognized his name as a
witness in the case. So I told him I didn't want to talk to him; I had
to talk to counsel and to the Court first, that I was trying to locate
a box.

And he said, well, the correct person to call for the box is this
other person. He gave me the number.

So I called the person at the other number. I got -- I got -- gee,
what happened then.

MR. GELBLUM: Is the bottom line, it went from SID to the courthouse?

THE COURT: That's the bottom line?

THE CLERK: The bottom line is, LAPD contacted me.

THE COURT: Went through a lot of trouble just because of that
gentleman right there.

MR. P. BAKER: I'm sorry.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: I take it the objection is withdrawn.

MR. GELBLUM: Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you.

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: Ms. Brockbank, you would agree there are pieces of
scotch tape in there that appear to have something attached to them?

(Witness examines inside of Defendants' Exhibit 2260.)

A. I see two pieces of scotch tape and the -- well, they're stuck to
the side of the box.

Q. Okay.

Now, would you agree that when you opened that carpeting in July for
the first time, a lot of carpet fibers came off of it, flaked off of
the edges of it?

A. I don't recall if any flaked off or not, actually.

I examined the carpet. I was looking at the shoe print. And we kept
the carpet, you know, on the paper that actually it was wrapped in,
somewhat.

Q. Do you recall examining the paper to see whether anything came off
the carpet?

A. No, that wasn't the reason I was looking for the -- at the carpet
at the time; I was looking at the shoe print that was on it.

Q. Okay.

So you never examined it to see if fibers readily came off of it at
that time?

A. Never.

Q. Okay.

Now, you make it a practice to, if possible, only examine one item at
a time in the lab, correct?

A. Unless I'm making a comparison between two different items.

Q. Right. The purpose for that is to prevent items fiber evidence from
one item getting onto another piece of evidence, if possible, correct?

A. Just to prevent that potential, yes.

Q. And, of course, you have no control over what happens at a crime
scene, before the evidence gets to you, as to that possibly happening,
do you?

A. I have no control over the crime scene at all, no.

Q. Okay.

Now, is it accurate that on the various pieces of evidence that you
examined in this case, you found many animal fibers, dog fibers, dog
hairs?

A. On which?

Q. On the various items of physical evidence in this case.

A. There were animal hairs on a lot of the different items, yes.

Q. That was a fairly common finding for you, wasn't it?

A. Yes. And I didn't report it any more than that, just saying animal
hairs.

Q. Yeah.

And fibers can be trans -- and hair can be transported in a dog's
coat?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague. I didn't understand the question.

THE COURT: Sounds like a pretty simple question. Overruled.

A. If someone's head made contact with the dog's coat and left hairs
on it, is that what you're asking?

Q. If the dog picked up any hair or fiber at one location, it would be
a pretty good vehicle to move it to another location, wouldn't it?

A. It may. Or its hairs or whatever it is transporting may just fall
off after a few steps.

Q. And be found someplace, right?

A. Possibly on the ground.

Q. Now, the knit cap, how many times did you examine the knit cap in
this case?

A. Um, I believe twice. But just let me check.

Twice. Once on June 21 and once on June 23.

Q. And is it accurate that, on neither of those occasions, you
discovered a carpet fiber?

A. I don't know if I did or didn't.

I removed hairs and fibers from the hat on the first date, and all I
noted was fibers.

You don't make any notation as to whether it's a carpet fiber or any
other type of fiber, just that it is a fiber.

Q. Are you aware of Douglas Deedrick examining that hat yet a third
time at the FBI lab in your presence, correct?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. And it was then that -- that a fiber consistent with the Bronco
carpet's fiber was found, correct?

A. I believe so.

Q. Okay.

Now, the Bronco carpet fiber up there -- let me show you 1195.

Is it accurate, with respect to the Bronco, you didn't find any hair
consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson or Ronald Goldman?

A. I didn't perform any of the comparisons in this case. They were all
done by Doug Deedrick.

Q. You're aware of the results, are you not?

A. Of some of them, not all of them.

Q. Are you aware of any hair consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson or
Ronald Goldman being found in the Bronco?

MR. GELBLUM: I object. Mr. Deedrick was here; he testified.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: Did you find any hair from the Bronco consistent
with either two people?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered. She said she didn't --

THE COURT: You may answer.

A. Again, I didn't make any comparisons at all, so . . . I don't know.

Q. You examined the glove, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you found no hair on either of the gloves consistent with O.J.
Simpson's head hairs, did you?

MR. GELBLUM: Same objection. Witness said she didn't do any
comparisons.

MR. BLASIER: She just said she examined the gloves.

MR. GELBLUM: Not -- no comparisons.

THE COURT: She said she didn't do any comparison on the hat.

MR. GELBLUM: I thought she said --

THE COURT: I may be mistaken. She is going to say that. Let me hear
it.

A. I did not perform any comparisons in the case at all. They were all
done by Doug Deedrick.

THE COURT: All right. Then the objection is sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Ms. Brockbank, you never found, on any piece of
evidence in this case, a single blue, black or blue-black cashmere
fiber, did you?

A. Again, I don't know. When I removed fiber evidence, all I did was
describe it as fibers. I didn't go any further than that; so I may
have, I may not have.

Q. Check your notes and tell us if you found any blue, black, or
blue-black cashmere fibers.

A. On?

Q. Anything.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, Your Honor. She just said she doesn't have
that kind of information in her notes.

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain it. You want to lay more foundation,
you may inquire.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You were present when Doug Deedrick examined this
evidence, as well, weren't you?

A. I was present in the lab.

Q. You're aware what the findings are, aren't you?

A. Not all of them, no.

Q. Much of them?

A. Maybe some of them.

Q. Are you aware that -- did you find, or did anybody find, to your
knowledge, any blue, black, or blue-black cashmere fiber on any piece
of evidence from the Bundy crime scene?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Same objection. Mr. Deedrick testified to the
findings.

THE COURT: The question is overruled to the extent that it applies to
whatever she observed Mr. Deedrick discovered.

Do you understand the question? In your presence, whatever you
observed, if anything.

A. Well, Mr. Deedrick was performing the examinations and comparisons
of all the hair and fiber evidence. And occasionally, he would call
something to my attention. I would come and I would look.

I don't recall, off the top of my head, seeing a blue-black cashmere.
I don't know if he did. I don't recall that.

Q. He never called it to your attention, did he?

A. I don't recall what he called to my attention at this point in
time.

Q. You don't recall him ever bringing that to your attention, do you?

MR. GELBLUM: Hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: I have no further questions.

Wait a second.

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: Did you -- haven't you reviewed Doug Deedrick's
reports of all of his findings in this case?

A. No. I've never seen -- I saw his very first one that he put out.
That's the only one I've ever seen.

Q. That was at about what time?

A. That was shortly after my visit to the FBI lab.

Q. Okay.

After that time, you -- they no longer had you doing any work on the
case?

A. No. I actually, before that time --

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

That's all I have.

MR. GELBLUM: Just a couple, Your Honor. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.
GELBLUM:

Q. In box number 2, where the carpet fiber and the cap and the gloves
were found, were stored, were each of those items individually
wrapped?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. How were they wrapped?

A. The -- the caps and both of the gloves were each individually
wrapped in paper bags, which were folded over and taped closed. And
the piece of carpet was wrapped like I said earlier. It was actually
folded up, itself, and it was wrapped with butcher paper and sealed
with that brown tape that you did see on the box.

Q. Did you examine each of those wrappings during the course of your
work in this case?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Were the seals tight?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Did you see any gaps between the tape and the paper?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Is that taping, paper tape, and paper that hair and fiber can pass
through?

A. Not to my knowledge.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further, Your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. So you observed how tight the packages were, but you didn't see
much of anything else; is that right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, Mrs. Brockbank, in addition to both gloves,
the Bundy glove and the Rockingham glove, the knit cap, and the
carpeting from the Bronco, how many other items were in box number 2?

A. All the items you see on that number list there at the bottom.

Q. Count them up for me (indicating to copy of label, Defendants'
Exhibit 2261.)

A. Can I have a piece of paper and a pencil so I can kind of tally
them all up?

MR. GELBLUM: Speaks for itself, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Speaks for itself.

THE COURT: Be nice for the record to have a number.

MR. BLASIER: We have 9 here, 3. Here's 14. Here's 2 here.

THE WITNESS: No. Actually, you're off already. That's why --

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

(Laughter.)

(Witness performs calculation on a piece of a paper towel off of
witness stand.)

A. (Continuing.) Okay. 446 by, my count.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is there a shortage of boxes at SID?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

THE COURT: You may answer.

A. No.

Q. Is it common practice to store items from multiple crime scenes in
the same box?

A. It does happen pretty often.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing.

THE COURT: You are excused.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: I would move in 2260 and 61.

MR. GELBLUM: Is that the box and the label?

MR. BLASIER: Yes.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2260 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2261 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

MR. LEONARD: Call Stephen Valerie.

STEPHEN VALERIE, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated.

Would you please state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Stephen Valerie, S-t-e-p-h-e-n V-a-l-e-r-i-e.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Valerie.

Can you tell us where do you reside, sir?

A. I currently live in San Francisco.

Q. And what do you for a living?

A. I'm a consultant with Arthur Andersen.

Q. How long have you had that position?

A. About a year and a quarter.

Q. Directing your attention to June 12, 1994, in particular around
11:30 that evening, where were you?

A. 11:30, I would have been standing at a phone booth outside the
American Airlines gate prior to boarding flight 667 -- flight 668.

Q. Standing outside -- you were about to board flight 668 to Chicago?

A. Yeah, in the departure area. I was using a pay phone.

Q. Did you see anyone you recognize?

A. No, not at that time.

Q. Later on, when you got -- you entered the plane?

A. I entered the plane -- I asked the gate agent to signal me over at
the last possible moment to enter the plane. I was making phone calls.
And so I think it was possibly around 11:40 when they waved me over
and I entered the plane then.

Q. Now, when you entered the plane, where did you sit?

If you can -- if you need to, you can step down and refer to the
diagram that's marked as --

MR. P. BAKER: 1180.

(The instrument herein described as a seating diagram of airplane
cabin was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1180.)

Q. You can step down.

A. I think this is fine.

Q. Or you can do it from there.

A. Right. Thanks.

The seat I originally was assigned, I believe, was 5B or something.
When I entered the flight, Gary Adelson was sitting in that row, and I
noticed that seats 4A and 4B were free, so since I was the last one on
board, I already knew that -- or expected I would be the last one on
board, I took the seat 4A, which is --

Q. Is this 4A here?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, it indicates here that a fellow named Gary Adelson, on this
diagram, was sitting next to you.

A. That's inaccurate. That's inaccurate. He was sitting in the seat
right behind.

Q. He was sitting right behind you, right here?

A. That's correct.

The other thing I want to point out about that diagram, the seats look
like they're not parallel to each other, they look diagonal or
shifted. That's not the case. They were actually pretty flush with one
another, so the view I had --

Q. Okay.

A. -- across the aisle was straight.

Q. Now, after you entered the plane and sat down, did you see anybody
that you recognized?

A. As I was preparing to sit down, I took my carry-on bag and was
putting it in the overhead, I noticed some commotion at the front of
the plane, and someone was about to board, and that person was who I
recognized to be O.J. Simpson.

Q. Okay.

You were -- you were seated at the time or actually you were standing
up putting some bags away; is that right?

A. Right, when he entered the plane, and then I sat down, and then he
came on board and dropped his bags on his seat for the moment, because
he recognized Gary Adelson, and they shook hands at that moment, so he
was standing right above me, if you will.

Q. Were you able to get a pretty good look at him?

A. Yeah. Both then -- I mean I observed him.

Q. I'm talking about at that point when you first saw him?

A. Sure. No, I looked at him, obviously, very enthusiastically, just
for the fact that I recognized him from his sports fame and was
wondering where he was going to sit, actually, at that moment.

Q. Okay.

Describe his demeanor, what his appearance was when you saw him --
when you first saw him?

A. I remember him coming on, and I think he was pretty excited to
catch the flight, obviously. We were pretty close to taking off.

He was jovial. He came on board, he greeted the crew, they pointed to
his seat. He came back.

Like I said, next thing, Gary Adelson said, hey, O.J., or something,
hey, how you doing. And they shook hands. There was mention of a golf
game at that moment, that they'd see each other at, or something to
that effect.

And then he took his garment bag and put that in the overhead
compartment and he had his -- a black duffel bag or a black leather
bag on the seat next to him. He then took his seat. And he took the
window seat, which would have been 4D, and sat down. The bag remained
on the seat.

Q. Let me stop you right there.

Did you notice how he was dressed? Can you describe that for us?

A. Yes. He was wearing a dark button-down type of shirt, it wasn't
denim, but it looked like a cotton, dark shirt with a white T-shirt
underneath and had khaki cotton -- brushed cotton pants. He had
leather loafers on. I won't say what country they're from. I don't
know. But they were -- had -- I distinctly remember them. They were
black or dark blue, they had mesh in the front, kind of a knit mesh in
the front panel and -- leather shoes, and he was wearing no socks that
evening.

Q. Okay.

Now, where did Mr. Simpson see -- sit in relation to you, Mr. Valerie?
And let me --

A. Do you want me to get up?

Q. Yeah, if you could. It may be easier for the jury if you just point
it out.

Step back just a little bit, sir, so everybody can see.

A. Right.

(Witness approaches board.)

A. This diagram isn't factual. I mean I sat in one window seat, he sat
in the other, and they were directly parallel to each other.

Q. So he would -- as you were sitting facing towards the front of the
plane, he was to your right?

A. That's right.

Q. Across the aisle; is that right?

A. Correct. I was on -- looking forward, I was on the left-hand side;
he was on the right-hand side.

Q. So when you looked over at Mr. Simpson, you could see his -- the
first thing you could see -- the closest thing you could see of him
was his left shoulder, his left arm?

A. Correct.

Q. And of course the rest of his body, too, you could see that?

A. Correct.

Q. You can retake your seat.

MR. PETROCELLI: I ask that he not lead, Your Honor.

THE COURT: All right.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you notice anything unusual at all about Mr.
Simpson's appearance?

A. Unusual, no. I mean the only thing that might be unusual is that he
seemed quite approachable that evening, and someone of his fame, I may
think, would really not be looking around as much as he did, sort of
smiling and just being seemingly pleasant in that case. It was the
only unusual thing I may have noticed.

Q. Did you -- did you get an opportunity to take a look at Mr.
Simpson's hands?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Let me stop you for a second.

When you looked at Mr. Simpson's hands did you notice any bleeding,
any cuts, anything like that on his hands?

A. I did not notice in the moment that I viewed his hand any
abnormalities, cuts or blood or anything.

Q. Why were you looking at his hands?

A. I'll give you the long answer.

My knowledge of Mr. Simpson's professional career is pretty limited,
and -- however, I did know he was a famous football player, and I was
trying to find a way to maybe strike up a conversation with him, and
so as I was looking over him in great detail, trying to find something
about him that I could maybe talk about, I thought maybe he'd won a
Super Bowl, and so I specifically looked at his hands, looking for a
Super Bowl ring, and did not see one.

And that was the motivation for looking at his hands at this moment.

Q. And when you did that, when you looked at his hands, you didn't see
anything unusual; is that right, sir?

A. Right.

Q. Now, at some point, were you -- why don't you tell us what you
observed Mr. Simpson do in general during that flight, until you
stopped observing him?

A. Okay.

We -- I guess he was still standing, and the flight attendant motioned
for him to take a seat 'cause we were ready to -- to embark, and so he
did that. And, like I said, his -- the black leather bag, smaller bag
was on his seat, and he moved it underneath the seat, not in front of
him, but in the seat next to him, underneath that seat.

We then took off, and it was relatively uneventful. I think he looked
over and smiled on a couple of occasions. And once we took off --
actually, before we took off, he was asked if he wanted anything to
drink, and he had asked for some water, but they actually didn't bring
it until after we took off. A glass of ice water.

Q. Did you see Mr. Simpson doing anything during the flight?

A. Sure. Can't really describe exactly when, but within the first half
an hour after takeoff, he opened his bag -- he brought his bag up to
the seat -- empty seat next to him, he opened it and pulled out a
manila folder which had -- looked like a document in it, and -- as
well as brought a book out of the bag and put that on the seat next to
him, then put the bag back underneath the seat.

Then he -- you know -- at some point afterwards, he opened up that
document. And that's probably what I remember most about any actions
he had on board. He was reading this eight and a half by eleven
loose-leaf document which was on white paper, and the typing on it was
double-spaced, so it appeared like it was some sort of contract is
what I thought it looked like, some legal document. And he proceeded
to read that. I think -- I think he even had a pen in his hand and
maybe was making notations.

Q. Now, at some point after you made those observations, you fell
asleep; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then at some point, you obviously woke up and -- you know, you
might want to lean back a little bit 'cause you might --

MR. PETROCELLI: You might want to stop leading also. Objection.

THE COURT: You're leading a little bit.

MR. LEONARD: Only trying to get through it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I know. Appreciate it.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: Try not to eat the microphone.

MR. LEONARD: Yeah, that bothers him.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) After you woke up at some point, what happened
next, after you woke up?

A. Basically -- the flight was about a three and a half hour flight. I
was awake for about the first hour and that's when I noticed most of
the things that I have described, and will describe to you this
afternoon.

But I did, on occasion, wake up intermittently throughout the flight
and just noticed little details.

Again, he seemed to look over a couple times. I mean I thought I -- I
think I was possibly staring, possibly more than I would have for any
other passenger. He would kind of glance over and he smiled and didn't
seem too worried about my observations.

And he read that document. He had it out, from my memory, most of the
time throughout the flight. I never saw him read the other book that
was out.

Q. Okay.

Now, directing your attention to after you woke up, you ultimately
deplaned, is that -- or you exited the plane?

A. That's right. We arrived in Chicago at what's been said to me about
4:30, 5:00 in the morning. I did -- wasn't paying attention. I know it
was quite early.

Q. At that point did you observe Mr. Simpson?

A. Yeah. We --

Q. Okay.

What did you observe at that point about Mr. Simpson? For instance,
did you have any exchange with him, just tell us what your interaction
was, if any, with Mr. Simpson at any point when you were exiting the
plane?

A. Sure. Well, we both got up and grabbed our belongings.

And I guess generally I noticed he looked pretty groggy. As well as I
did. I noticed his eyes were red, at least compared to how he looked
when I noticed him when he got on board.

I probably didn't look any better.

We got up, moved to the aisle, and he was ahead of me, and we got to
the front by the main exit door in the front of the plane, and he was
standing in front of me.

His right shoulder had his duffle -- his garment bag over his
shoulder, and his left hand had his black leather bag, and it was
thrown over -- sort of thrown over his shoulder.

He was facing diagonally, waiting to exit the plane, so I had sometime
to look at him at that moment.

And I then made my only comments to him of the evening. I said, you
better be careful, someone might think you're going to be doing
another Hertz commercial. And he kind of, you know, grinned at that
moment and said, well, I happen to be here in Chicago with Hertz
anyway, or something like that.

And at that moment the door flew open and we both exited, like
everyone else, pretty quickly off that plane.

Q. And that's the last you saw of Mr. Simpson?

A. I had some observations as well, out in the -- in the Chicago
terminal. We both exited. He was met by a gentleman. At the time, I
didn't know who he was or where he was from. But he had kind of
strawberry blond hair, larger gentleman, he was also wearing khaki
pants and a button-down shirt. And they exchanged -- they shook hands
there. And we all walked out of the -- walked down the Chicago
terminal.

And the last I saw of him, he went toward baggage claim.

I was connecting to a flight to Washington, D.C.

That was the last I saw of him.

Q. Now, you said earlier something about that you were surprised at
the way Mr. Simpson was acting.

You had never met Mr. Simpson before, right?

A. That's correct; never had.

Q. Okay.

And you said that you had -- you had been staring at Mr. Simpson?

A. Yeah. I was, again, trying to get some connection to him, whether
that be, you know, a ring or a brand of clothing that I may wear, just
something where I could strike up a conversation with him. And he --
in those observations, he certainly looked over and smiled over and,
you know, seemed approachable.

Q. You never got the courage to walk up to him until you walked out of
the plane?

A. No.

And I can't believe the dumb thing I said to him at the end.

MR. LEONARD: Nothing further. Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Valerie.

You never met O.J. Simpson before, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. So you have -- you have no idea as you're sitting there in the
airplane, how he behaved when he was under times of great stress,
correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And nor would you have had any idea how O.J. Simpson would conduct
himself if he were under severe distress, correct?

A. That -- that is absolutely correct.

Q. And you had seen his smiling face on television before, right?

A. The only time I've ever seen Mr. Simpson was on television, that's
correct.

Q. And you were aware of his public persona as a person with a smiling
face, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. In the observations I had of him over his career, he did definitely
seem a friendly, approachable person.

Q. And what you're really saying to this jury is how O.J. Simpson
projected himself on that airplane on that evening, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection.

THE COURT: That's sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Well, you're testifying as to observations
based on how Mr. Simpson appeared in a public setting, correct, on an
airplane?

A. My observations of him were frankly only my observations of him. I
guess the only commentary would be what my expectation of him would
have been in that he smiled over and seemed approachable, that fit
with the public image that I have of him, yes.

Q. Okay.

And, of course, you didn't have any clue what he was thinking during
that airplane flight, right?

MR. LEONARD: Argumentative, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) In other words, you didn't know what was on his
mind?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) He didn't tell you anything about what was on
his mind, right?

A. He did not.

Q. And you only had observations of him during that -- the first hour
of the flight, right?

A. That is correct, and a couple brief interludes where I -- in the
middle of the flight.

Q. So --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, that misstates his testimony. He also
testified --

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

MR. LEONARD: Well, he's misstating the testimony. He just got done
testifying --

MR. PETROCELLI: He can answer the questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let's talk about the time that you're on the
airplane together, sitting down, okay.

You only made some observations of him in the first hour of the
flight, right?

A. In terms of describing most of what I saw --

Q. Yes.

A. -- that was in the first hour.

I guess my commentary, to add on, is that I woke up a couple times and
noticed pretty much the same viewpoint. I mean you're on a plane,
you're sitting in a seat that -- usually you have a seat belt on, so
the scenario didn't really change a lot. And so I saw him a couple
times. He didn't seem like anything had changed.

Q. You slept for a couple hours of that flight?

A. That's correct.

Q. And all the times that you managed to look at Mr. Simpson, whether
it be during that first hour or a few times in the ensuing hours, you
never once saw him sleeping, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you, of course, are not aware of all the things that he did
when you were not looking at him, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, that's inane.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) For example, did you see the pilot, Wayne
Stanfield, approach Mr. Simpson?

A. I did not observe the pilot have any contact with Mr. Simpson.

Q. You saw Mr. Simpson go to the restroom how many times?

A. One time.

Q. And that's all, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And if -- and most of your observations that you testified to are
based on that first hour, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you said that you saw him reading a document, in your direct
examination.

Do you recall that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. In fact, you don't know what he was reading, do you?

A. I do not.

Q. Okay.

A. Just how I described it.

Q. You do not know if he was reading anything, do you?

A. I smile, because it reminds me of the criminal trial.

But he was glancing at the document and his eyes were going over it,
so -- I don't, in fact, know if he was reading, but it appeared -- I
would be reading if I were gazing at a document in that way.

Q. In other words, what you saw was him looking at paper?

A. That's correct.

Q. You don't know whether he was focusing, reading, concentrating or
what?

A. That's correct.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Okay.

Now, the -- let's focus on some of your other observations regarding
his hands.

These observations that you gave in your direct testimony about his
hands and whether he had cuts and so forth, were based in that -- were
made in that one-hour period of time when, from time to time, you
looked at him, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. When he got on the plane, you did not really have a good view or
clear view of his hands, right?

A. When he got on the plane, I wasn't looking at his hands at all.

Q. When he got off the plane, you were not looking at his hands also,
correct?

A. That is also correct.

Q. Okay.

So all of your observations regarding his hands were made while you
are sitting in seat 4A and he is sitting in seat 4D, right?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, in the criminal trial, you testified that you were able to
rotate yourself in your seat, in 4A, sort of against the window, in
order to get a good look at him, right?

A. Well, I rotated myself in order to be more comfortable in the seat,
to use the back of -- the wall of the plane as a headrest. That also
gave me a direct view of Mr. Simpson.

Q. And you also testified in the criminal trial that in order to
facilitate that position, you elevated the seat rest and put your legs
out on the seat rest, correct?

A. I mentioned that -- in the criminal trial, that I lifted the leg
rest in the seat next to me. But in fact that is not the case. There
was no leg rest.

To give you a little background --

Q. Let me do this question by question.

A. All right.

Q. And we'll get there. Just want to make sure that your answers are
clear.

A. Yes.

Q. In the criminal trial, when you -- first time you testified to
these observations that you're now testifying to were in the criminal
trial, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And in the criminal trial, you testified that you were able to get
a very clear view of Mr. Simpson because you rotated yourself in the
position that you have just described and you -- and you put your foot
up on the foot rest that comes out from under the seats of that
airplane, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative, misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: Doesn't sound like it. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Correct, sir?

Just answer yes or no and then I'll ask you the follow-up question.

MR. LEONARD: Also compound as phrased.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Answer.

A. I don't know what I'm answering yes to specifically. If you could
restate the question. If you're going to use yes or no for me, please
make the statement a statement.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) In the criminal trial, did you not testify that
you rotated -- leaned in an angle, had your feet up elevated on the
leg rest of the other seat as well as your own leg rest, so that you
could have just a little bit more leg room, so in that position you
could have a pretty clear view of Mr. Simpson throughout the flight?

Did you give that testimony, sir, under oath, in the criminal trial?

A. I don't believe those were my exact words but you may be reading
those.

Q. Well, do you -- page --

MR. PETROCELLI: 36704, put it on the Elmo, Steve.

(Transcript displayed on the Elmo.)

MR. BAKER: What line?

MR. PETROCELLI: Line -- I guess 15, 16, in that area.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you see that testimony, sir?

THE COURT: If you hold it still.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you hold it still?

Thank you.

(Referring to Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) In the criminal trial you gave that testimony,
correct?

A. That's what appears here.

Q. Let me follow up.

And then you also gave testimony further on in your criminal trial
testimony, page 36744, line 1.

MR. LEONARD: 744.

MR. PETROCELLI: 36744.

MR. LEONARD: Hold on.

MR. PETROCELLI: Sure.

Put it on.

THE COURT: Wait a minute. Let Mr. Leonard see it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry. Tell me when you're ready.

MR. LEONARD: Which line are we at?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you gave this answer as well -- "Well,
prior to that was take off and the foot rest isn't allowed to be up,
so my feet were placed on the floor in front of me."

Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, in fact, sir, that testimony that I just showed you in both
places was wrong, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. There is -- is no --

A. It was wrong.

Q. Excuse me.

There is no foot rest on that plane, correct?

A. Yes. In fact, there was no leg rest.

Q. So you were not able to put your leg out, and extend it, and sit in
that position as you watched Mr. Simpson who was directly across from
you, because there was no leg rest, right?

A. That's not correct. I did sit in that position. And that's what I
want to explain. I've flown on American Airlines, documented over
470,000 miles, so -- my normal position in first class is to raise the
leg rest, so when I described it that evening -- I remember distinctly
leaning over and leaning back and putting my legs over.

And in most cases I would put up a leg rest. So I misspoke. I said
there was a leg rest. In fact, I put my leg -- one foot on the seat,
the other laying down. You know, this wasn't a constant position, by
the way, this was -- this was a position to get more comfortable in
those confined seats.

But that was the general direction I was facing and --

Q. Just so we get the story straight now, there was no leg rest and
you didn't put your leg on a leg rest, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. What you said about your observations in the criminal trial was
wrong, correct?

A. Regarding the leg rest?

Q. Correct.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, vague. Which observations?

MR. PETROCELLI: The ones I just put on the TV monitor, that everybody
in the courtroom knows we're talking about.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Specifically regarding the leg rest, I state here today that I
misspoke, that there was no leg rest on there, and I only used that
commentary to describe the position, and that was based upon my long
and number of flights with that airline.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Well, in fact, as your testimony showed, you
mentioned the leg rest in order to support your testimony that you
were able to get a straight view of Mr. Simpson, because he was right
opposite you in the next seat across the aisle, and you turned
yourself, and had your leg up, and you were able to sit there in sort
of a prolonged period of time.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that true, sir?

MR. LEONARD: Compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, you also said that that chart is wrong,
correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: What is it?

MR. FOSTER: 1160.

MR. P. BAKER: 1180.

THE CLERK: 1180.

MR. FOSTER: 1180.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You said it's wrong because it's not staggered
as depicted on that -- on that chart, correct?

That was your testimony in response to Mr. Leonard's questions,
correct?

A. Yeah, it's inaccurate. The chart is inaccurate.

Q. Okay.

And the reason it's inaccurate is 'cause you said Mr. Simpson's seat
in 4 -- in 4A was right opposite your seat across the aisle, right?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, misstates.

Q. Or 4D. Whatever it was. You're in 4A, he's in 4D?

A. Correct.

Q. Your testimony is you were actually opposite one another, not
staggered like that?

A. Yeah, my testimony is --

Q. Okay?

A. -- that this is a diagram from American Airlines and that is a
standard -- or even from Boeing, potentially, and basically it is a
standard configuration, but each airline can modify those seats in
their own way.

Q. Why don't we look at this picture, sir.

MR. LEONARD: May I see that?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

What exhibit?

MR. FOSTER: Next in order.

THE CLERK: Next 2262. The photograph.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me show you this photograph, sir, of the
first class cabin.

MR. BAKER: I object. He can show him the photograph, not his
representations of what it is.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(Witness views photograph.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) That look like the cabin that you sat in that
night?

A. I have no way to tell.

Q. You would agree, sir, that these seats are staggered?

A. Yeah, I would say in that photo they look staggered.

Q. You would agree that the seats in row 4 are staggered, and are not
opposite one another, sir?

A. Yeah. I would say they look staggered.

I mean this is a two-dimensional illustration. I'd say it looks
staggered by maybe 8 or 10 inches in that photo.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object -- object.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, no foundation.

THE COURT: Well, receive it subject to motion to strike.

I presume you are going to be able to lay a foundation.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: Hold on.

MR. PETROCELLI: The ensuing witnesses in the criminal trial testified
as to these photographs.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I object.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let's approach.

THE COURT: Okay. Bring the transcript.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

MR. PETROCELLI: Right outside the courtroom we have Howard Bingham,
another passenger on the flight. We also have Captain Wayne Stanfield.
And from their criminal testimony I believe they've identified these
exhibits and Mike Brewer has constituting --

MR. LEONARD: Save your breath. I don't have any objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: You stipulate that this is the cabin?

MR. LEONARD: No. You can establish it through the witness if you want.
Just --

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to have --

THE COURT: He's withdrawn his objection.

MR. LEONARD: Ask him whatever questions you want.

THE COURT: Why do I have to go through this exercise?

MR. PETROCELLI: You don't.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. LEONARD: I withdraw that objection.

THE COURT: How long you going to be?

MR. PETROCELLI: About 10 minutes. Do you want to take a break now?

THE COURT: 10-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case, don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Before the break, we were talking about your
prior testimony on direct that the -- your seat and Mr. Simpson's seat
were just opposite each other across the aisle, and I showed you an
exhibit.

MR. FOSTER: Marked as the exhibit when we marked next in order.

MR. LEONARD: What number is that?

MR. PETROCELLI: Actually, Your Honor, it's been marked as 537. We'll
withdraw the last number and refer to it as 537.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of airplane cabin was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 537.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Looking at 537, you would agree that the seats
are in fact not directly opposite one another, but are indeed
staggered, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you put this on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) While's he doing that, there are four seats
down one aisle and three down the other, right, sir?

A. That's what I observe, yes.

Q. And you were sitting in seat 4A, which is this seat here?

(Pointing to the exhibit on the monitor.)

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

And Mr. Simpson was sitting in the window seat, seat 4D, as you
indicated, correct?

A. Again, between the diagrams and the seat numbers I'm not sure Mr.
Simpson was sitting -- I'll point to it.

Q. Okay.

A. He was sitting in this seat here.

Q. Now, you indicated on the chart, when you were shown that chart,
that he sat in the seat in the aisle 4, correct?

A. No, I indicated that he sat across from me. That's why I said it's
not -- it's not --

Q. It's designated on the chart that Mr. Leonard showed you as aisle
4, correct?

A. Yes, it is designated there as aisle 4.

Q. Sir, you also testified in the criminal trial, page 36700, that Mr.
Simpson in fact sat in seat 4D, correct, sir?

A. I stated 4D relative to this incorrect chart, when I also stated in
the criminal trial --

Q. The -- well, let me read what you --

A. But I want to point out that I did not see -- have any photos, so
--

Q. Let me read what you testified to.

MR. PETROCELLI: Starting at page 36999, Mr. Leonard, line 15.
Actually, at line 10.

Q. What row did you occupy that night in first class?

A. I sat in what they number row 4. In fact, it was the second row on
that side of the plane and the third row from Mr. Simpson's side.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that correct?

A. That's absolutely correct.

Q. And then, when you were asked what seat number you said 4A,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, your answer 4A was incorrect?

A. No.

Q. It's not seat 4A. You're now saying it's seat 5A based on the
chart?

A. No. You're talking about my seat. I don't think that's --

Q. Excuse me. Mr. Simpson's your right. You then were asked what was
Mr. Simpson's seat and you answered at line 1, seat 4D?

A. I did answer that, and I assumed it because he was sitting across
from me.

Q. Now, you're saying that your trial testimony in which you
identified Mr. Simpson's seat as seat 4D was incorrect?

A. It's absolutely incorrect based on this photo and my recollection
now, I did point out that that diagram has always been wrong.

Q. So now you're saying that Mr. Simpson sat in seat 5D?

A. If that's what is 5D. He sat in that seat.

Q. And you said you sat in seat 4A?

A. Correct.

Q. And you will agree that seat 4A is ahead of seat 5D, correct?
They're not opposite one another, correct?

A. No. I mean they're offset a little bit by that -- by that
photograph, yes.

Q. Well, let's take a look at this photograph, which is Exhibit 504,
another photograph of the same --

MR. LEONARD: Can I see?

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, Civil Exhibit 538.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of airplane cabin
seats was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 538.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Put this on, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Using this photograph, could you point out
where you sat?

A. No, I cannot.

Q. Why is that, sir?

A. Because I don't see the third or the fourth row of seats on -- I
don't see the fourth row of seats on the right-hand side.

Q. We'll show where you were.

A. Again, let me -- let me stop.

Q. You want to just point to where you were sitting, sir?

A. No, I won't until I know first off -- we haven't even ascertained
whether or not this is the actual equipment that was being used that
evening, to start with.

Q. We'll represent to you that it was, sir, based on testimony --

A. Okay.

Q. -- of other witnesses.

A. I want to be careful as we're pointing to charts. You're saying
where did I sit. I don't know in fact that I sat there unless this is
the actual equipment. I want this to -- I want to be very, very clear
here because I want the truth to be told here.

Q. So do we.

A. Again, I don't know if this is --

Q. Let me show you another picture, picture 539. All three were
identified as being the flight that Mr. Simpson took to Chicago.

A. That's much more representative. I can see the last row of seats
there.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of airplane cabin
seats was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 539.)

Q. Does that help you now?

A. Yes, this one does.

(Indicating to Exhibit 539.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Let's put this one up.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And then point out where you were sitting, and
where Mr. Simpson was sitting, if you would.

(Indicating to Exhibit 539.)

THE COURT REPORTER: This is 539?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 539's on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you can go up there and point to it?

A. Great.

This is the seat that Mr. Simpson sat in. And you cannot see my -- the
seat I actually sat in.

Q. Mr. Simpson was three back, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. He had the window seat?

A. That's correct.

Q. You're two back and you're in the window seat?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you will agree then that you're not opposite one another,
correct?

A. I would say that I am very close to opposite in that -- in that
configuration.

Q. If we look at this photograph, which shows us a close-up of the
seats being staggered, would you agree that you're not opposite one
another, but are considerably staggered?

A. Again --

MR. LEONARD: Objection vague, considerably.

A. From this angle it has the appearance of being staggered, but
appears much more exaggerated in that photo let's say.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is Exhibit 538 for the record.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, sir, the lights went out very early on in
that flight?

A. That's correct.

Q. And --

A. The main cabin lights.

Q. And the lights were out almost from the moment the flight took off,
right?

A. Yeah.

Q. So for that first hour when you made your observations, the lights
were out, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, vague as to lights.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) The main cabin lights were out, sir; is that
correct?

A. The main cabin lights were out, yes.

Q. And your light over -- that illuminates your seat was out also,
right?

A. I had it on for a little bit at the beginning of the flight or --
well, while I was awake for that period.

Q. And Mr. Simpson's light was what?

A. His light was illuminated. In fact --

Q. Now, would you agree then that you really couldn't get a pretty --
you couldn't get a close look at him to form any opinions about what
was, or what was not on his hands?

Would you agree with that, sir, given you're sitting in a staggered
position, you didn't have your foot up on a foot rest 'cause there is
no foot rest, and that the cabin lights are off?

MR. LEONARD: Compound, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: And misstates as far as the lights being off and on.

THE COURT: Cabin lights were off.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Would you agree, in light of those
circumstances, you really didn't have a close look at his hands,
right?

A. I looked at his hands and --

Q. No. My question is you didn't have a close look at his hands?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, vague as to close.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Again, I don't know what close means by your definition or my
definition.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Well, sir, you were no -- you were at least
five or six feet away from him, if not more, at all times, while he
was sitting in his seat and you were sitting in your seat, correct?

A. I would say about seven feet, yes.

Q. Seven feet. Right.

And you never saw his hands -- you testified previously that you
didn't get a look at his hands going on the plane or off the plane,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So the only time that you made observations of his hands, is when
you and he were seven feet apart at a somewhat diagonal position
relative to each other, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And the lights, sir, the main cabin lights are out, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you really don't know whether he had any cuts on his hand or
not, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

And at no time did he, for example, did you ever see between his
fingers, right?

A. I did not have a detailed study of his fingers.

Q. I didn't ask you about a detailed study.

I just said, at no time did you ever see the area in between his
fingers, correct?

A. Again, Mr. Petrocelli --

Q. Can you answer that yes or no, please?

A. I looked at his fingers. I saw his fingers. I didn't see any cuts.

Q. Okay.

A. And I saw it from seven feet away, if we can agree to that
distance, and --

Q. In a diagonal line, right?

A. Somewhat diagonal line.

Q. No foot rest.

If Mr. Simpson had a cut inside his fourth finger, cut facing the
middle finger, you were never in a position to see the inside of that
fourth finger, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

And if Mr. Simpson had a fresh cut on the middle finger that had been
washed and was cleaned and not bleeding, you wouldn't have really been
able to see that either, correct.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: Fact not in evidence.

Q. Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

Now, finally, you have made some observations about clothing. You said
Mr. Simpson was wearing cocky pants?

THE COURT: Khaki.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry. Khaki pants, for the record.

A. I said -- and I also described and I knew they were cotton type
pants. I wasn't sure, definitely, if they were the actual color of
khaki, but light colored, tan.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) As you testified in the criminal trial, they
were not jeans, correct?

A. Correct, not jeans.

Q. They were not stone washed jeans?

A. Correct.

Q. And his shirt was what color, did you say?

A. A darker color. I believe blue or black.

Q. Okay.

And finally, you said that he had on European loafers, correct?

A. On the stand I said European. And to the police investigators the
week after, I used the term Italian loafers. Neither of them I know to
be factual. They were just used to describe a style.

Q. Now, if Mr. Simpson testified that he had on stone washed denim
jeans and a light shirt going onto that airplane that night, and --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I object. That misstates the evidence.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) -- you would be mistaken?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, that misstates the evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Mr. Simpson said he had on some kind of blue
jean outfit.

That's not what you saw; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have nothing further.

MR. LEONARD: Finished?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

REDIRECT EXAMINATON BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Mr. Petrocelli asked you some questions that were premised upon the
fact about the cabin lights being out when you were observing Mr.
Simpson.

Do you remember that?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. The overhead light above Mr. Simpson's seat was illuminated every
time you saw him?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Is that right?

A. The overhead cabin light was on and I would even -- I don't know to
be sure, but even -- I think the other light was on, too. I think it
was very well illuminated over his seat.

Q. When the overhead cabin lights went off, the light -- the reading
light, or the light over Mr. Simpson's seat remained on?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

A. Throughout the flight.

Q. You could see his hands at that point?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. You just testified that the overhead cabin lights were on, it was
very well illuminated; is that what you just said?

A. No. The lights over Mr. Simpson's head. Same words broken apart.

Q. So to make this absolutely clear, the cabin is dark except for the
light over Mr. Simpson's seat?

MR. LEONARD: Vague as to time, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I don't think so.

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) During the one hour in the beginning of the
flight when you made your so-called observations, correct?

A. During -- throughout the flight, when I made the observations both
in the intense hour and in the moment that I woke up and gazed over,
the lights, his overhead cabin light, reading lamp, was on.

Q. And all the other lights were off?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

A. Except for the --

Q. You said it was very well illuminated. You meant just the area over
Mr. Simpson's seat was very well illuminated; is that what you meant
to say?

A. The area over Mr. Simpson's seat, which included his person in the
seat, so he was well illuminated. And his items, his document and his
book, his bag.

Q. Okay.

And again, you as you sit here now, thinking back, getting a better
picture of all the circumstances, you could not tell this jury, one
way or the other, whether or not he actually had cuts on his hand,
correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative; asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

THE COURT: You're excused.

MR. P. BAKER: Defense calls Willie Ford.

WILLIE FORD, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Sir, would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Willie Ford, Jr. W-i-l-l-i-e B-i-l-l F-o-r-g -- F-o-r-d.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. P. BAKER:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Ford.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. How long you been working with the police department?

A. Going on 15 years.

Q. And you've worked with SID; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And what does SID stand for?

A. Scientific Investigation Division.

Q. I want to take you back to the date of June 13, 1994. Do you recall
that date?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you, at some point, receive a call to go to 360 North
Rockingham?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And how did you get to 360 North Rockingham?

A. We drove our SID van up there.

Q. And who did you drive with?

A. My boss, David Atkins.

Q. And what time did you arrive at 360 North Rockingham?

A. I think approximately around 3 o'clock.

Q. Okay.

And the Rockingham log shows 3:10.

Would you agree that was about the time that you arrived there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And what was your purpose in going to 360 North Rockingham?

A. To videotape all of Mr. Simpson's personal effects that were out in
the open, not to open up any drawers or any doors, to videotape
anything else. Everything that was out.

Q. And what was the reason -- did you ever come to an understanding as
to the reason you were supposed to videotape the residence?

A. Yes, sir. Detective, I think, Haro, says they were getting ready to
lock up his place, and I was to videotape everything that was left in
the room.

Q. And as I understand it, you had an RCA VHS camcorder?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And what did you first -- or strike that.

On the bottom of the videotape is a time counter; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the time counter shows the time that the videotape was
recorded; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And as I understand it, you later learned that that time counter
was off; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And, for example, just to be clear, the time counter on your
videotape shows that you were in Mr. Simpson's bedroom at
approximately 3:13 p.m.; is that correct?

A. The -- on the videotape it shows that?

Q. Right.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you understand that that's not correct, true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And by the way, what time did you leave 360 North Rockingham?

A. I would say about 4:30, I think.

Q. Okay.

And when were you in Mr. Simpson's bedroom, in relation to the time
you left Rockingham?

A. I would say within about 10 minutes before that, 4:30.

Q. So if the videotape shows that you're in the Rockingham -- O.J.
Simpson's master bedroom at 3:13, and that it's your understanding
that you were there at about 4:20, you would agree that the time is
about off -- is off about an hour and 10 minutes, true?

A. The time in the video camera was really not a factor, never
established whether it was the correct time or not.

Q. But if the -- if the clock says 3:13 when you're in Mr. Simpson's
bedroom, you have an independent recollection of being there around
4:15 to 4:20, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So the time counter, would be your assumption, is off by about an
hour and five minutes, right?

A. I would say so.

Q. Where did you first videotape -- where did you first record when
you went to Mr. Simpson's residence?

A. The criminalist hadn't finished collecting anything from inside the
house as of yet, so -- so they told me to start outside with the
Bronco, and cover all the vehicles on the property, and the children's
play toys, lawn furniture, statuary, that sort of thing. Cover
everything on the outside first, and then come to the house.

Q. So you videotaped the Bronco first?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you videotaped up the Rockingham driveway?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then you walked around to the northern side of the residence?

A. Exactly.

Q. Did anyone ever ask you to videotape the southern walkway at 360
Rockingham?

A. No, sir.

Q. After you videotaped the north side of the residence, where did you
go next?

A. To the rear of the residence.

Q. And what did you do there?

A. The pool area, patio, and the tennis court area.

Q. Okay. After you videotaped the -- I guess that would be the
northeastern portion of the property, where did you go next?

A. Into the house.

Q. And how did you get into the house?

Which door?

A. I walked around on the north side, back towards the front, where I
came into the foyer.

Q. You walked into the main doorway --

A. Yes, sir.

Q. -- of the residence?

Did you videotape the foyer?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you receive any instructions from Officer Haro about where he
wanted you to videotape?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You receive any orders from Officer Haro about
where he wanted you to videotape?

A. Yes. He wanted me to start in the foyer, and make sure that I move
slow enough on the videotape to identify items everywhere on the
table, on the walls, cover it thoroughly before I moved to the next
room.

Q. He wanted you to do a thorough job to record, so you'd have an
inventory of what was in the house?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You tried to do that, didn't you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you went into the kitchen of Mr. Simpson's residence and
videotaped the kitchen?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you videotaped the wall and what was on the the shelves, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you walked into the living room, or the I guess it would
be the den, where the televisions were?

A. I think it was the office area next.

Q. And did you videotape what was inside the office?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you open up the closet and videotape everything that was in the
closet?

A. We didn't open -- we just went into the closet.

Q. The door was already opened. And then where did you go next?

A. To the living room, I think it was.

Q. Okay.

And then after the living room, where did you --

A. Family room, where the television, I guess, was, and the bar and
the game room.

Q. And you attempted to videotape everything you observed that was out
in the open?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Pursuant to Officer Haro's orders, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And did you understand that your purpose there was to basically
protect the police department if anything was broken or stolen, you'd
have a video cassette showing what was there --

A. Yes.

Q. -- on June 13?

Now, eventually you went upstairs at the Rockingham address?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. An did you notice any blood stains on the carpet going upstairs?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you notice any blood stains on the carpet, walking into the
master bedroom?

A. No, sir.

Q. Where did you go first when you got upstairs?

A. As I can recall, there were cabinets of linen right there in the
hallway, and then there was -- a first bedroom. Went into that room --
I think it was a child's room.

And I came out of there and videotaped some photographs that were on
the walls, and went into the next bedroom.

Q. Did you encounter Dennis Fung at any point while you were upstairs?

A. Not directly. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed he was just
going back and forth as he was collecting the evidence.

Q. Did you have a conversation with Dennis Fung as you were walking
down the hallway towards the master bedroom?

A. Yes, sir. To the point where my video light was shining toward the
master bedroom. He thought I was coming in. He said "I'm not ready for
you yet."

Well, I said okay and continued into the next bedroom.

Q. So as you're walking into the master bedroom, Mr. Fung says, "we're
not ready for you yet?"

A. No. I'm not walking into the master bedroom at this point. I'm
videotaping photographs on the hallway wall.

He thought I was coming into the master bedroom when he said, I'm not
ready for you.

Q. And then at that point, you didn't go in the master bedroom?

A. No, I didn't. I turned into the next bedroom.

Q. And you walked into the second children's room?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And after you videotaped that, where did you go?

Where did you go?

A. I don't recall exactly. But there was a small area where there was
a huge closet that I went into. I don't know if that was right after
that bedroom or not.

But basically, after that was the master bedroom.

Q. Okay.

And when you walked into the master bedroom, did you videotape as much
-- or everything that was out in the open in the master bedroom?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you were in the master bedroom at approximately 4:15 to 4:20 in
the afternoon?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And did you see a fireplace on the far side of the master bedroom?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you try to videotape that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you see, as you walk into the master bedroom, a couch to the
left of you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you try to videotape that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you see kind of a reclining or, I don't know, LaZ-Boy-type
chair to the left when you walked in?

A. I don't recall right now.

Q. But as I understand it, you tried to tape everything that was out
in the open, when you walked into that master bedroom, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And by the way, you were there for a little bit over an hour,
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the tape's only 20 to 30 minutes. Why is that?

A. Well, I'm not filming for the entire time. I'm filming just slow
enough so you can see the image, and then I go on to something else.

Q. Okay.

Did you videotape any suspenders on Mr. Simpson's bed?

A. I think I did.

Q. Did you ever see any socks on the carpet in front of Mr. Simpson's
bed?

A. No, sir.

Q. As I understand it, you videotaped -- there's actually two portions
on that videotape when you're videotaping Mr. Simpson bedroom; is that
correct?

In other words -- my question is not very good.

You walked in on the first occasion; you're standing in the room, and
you videotaped from the doorway?

A. Yes.

Q. Kind of back of the room?

A. Right.

Q. At some point, you stop the tape after that. True?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you walk over to the front of the bed and videotape the left
side of the room, and pan back towards the bed?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you never pointed the videotape at the carpet laying in front
of the bed, right?

A. Not at the carpet, no, sir.

Q. Why was that?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. Did you see anything open, or out, or any socks on the carpet?

A. No, sir.

MR. P. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm only going to play the portions of Mr.
--

MR. KELLY: Ford.

MR. P. BAKER: I think it's Exhibit 901 -- of Mr. Ford's videotape of
the master bedroom.

When you're lowest on the totem pole, you have you to work the
videotape, also.

(The instrument herein referred to as Videotape taken by Willie Ford
of the residence at 360 North Rockingham on June 13, 1994, was marked
for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 901.)

(Defendant's Exhibit 901, videotape, being displayed on the Elmo
screen.)

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) That's when you were walking into the master
bedroom?

A. Yes.

Q. To the couch, to the left of Mr. Simpson's bed.

(Videotape notes the time as. 3:13 p.m.)

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) That was the chair I was trying to describe
earlier; is that true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That's the fireplace and there's another carpet, right?

A. Yes.

Q. That's Mr. Simpson's bed, true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Mr. Simpson's bed from behind?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's his vanity?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you proceed into his closet, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. During the time you were filming that videotape, you never saw any
socks on that carpet, true?

A. No, sir.

Q. You never saw any blood stains on that carpet, correct?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. After you walked out of the master bedroom, you walked and filmed
Mr. Simpson's closet?

A. Yes.

Q. After you went to the vanity, or I guess if you're from Louisiana,
they call it a bureau.

MR. PETROCELLI: In New Jersey.

MR. LEONARD: In New Jersey, too.

MR. P. BAKER: We're very sheik in California.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You filmed his closet next?

A. Yes.

Q. Then you filmed his bathroom next?

A. Yes.

Q. Then you eventually left the bedroom, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And what time would this be around when you were leaving the
bedroom?

A. I would say approximately 4:20.

Q. Okay.

Did you see any socks when you left the bedroom at 4:20?

A. No.

Q. And if Mr. Fung sat on that stand and said he collected two socks
from that carpet between 4:30 and 4:40, someone must have put them
there after you were there, true.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Calls for hearsay, speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained. Jury to disregard that question.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) There were no socks there when you left that
room, true?

A. No, sir.

Yes, sir; there was no socks.

Q. You don't have a book deal, do you, Mr. Ford?

A. No, sir.

Q. You just came here to tell the truth?

A. Yes, sir.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Ford.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. There were no socks there when you left the room?

A. That's right.

Q. There were no socks when you went in the room?

A. That's right.

Q. You never saw any socks on the floor?

A. Right.

Q. Mr. Fung wasn't there when you were in the room?

A. No. He had just left.

Q. He had just left because he just finished collecting the evidence
right?

A. Right.

Q. That, in fact, was your role there that day, was to film after the
evidence had been collected, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That was your whole purpose for being there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. In fact, you started outside because somebody told you they were
still working inside, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you started downstairs because you said they're still working
upstairs, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you didn't go in the master bedroom because Dennis said, I'm
still working in here, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So the socks weren't there because they had already been picked up,
right?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Calls for speculation and argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Now, you've said you work in the photo unit?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you sometimes take photographs instead of videotape?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And when you take photographs, do you put photo I.D. cards next to
the evidence you're photographing?

A. We don't, but the criminalist or the detective does.

Q. Okay.

Have you seen photographs of the socks in this case with the -- with
the little number 13 card next to them?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Objection. Outside the scope, Judge.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, this is about the collection of the socks,
which is exactly what this --

THE COURT: No, it's about videotaping.

MR. GELBLUM: I'll tie it up, exactly what it's about.

THE COURT: This witness is not competent on that.

MR. GELBLUM: He did it himself, Your Honor. He just said that.

THE COURT: You may call him as your own witness on rebuttal.

MR. GELBLUM: It's very brief, Your Honor; very very, brief. Few more
questions about the photographing of the socks. I beg your indulgence
for a few minutes.

THE COURT: All right. Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) And when the card, numbered card, is put next to
the piece of evidence to photograph, is that generally just before
it's collected?

A. Yes.

Q. And then it's collected and the card taken away?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. GELBLUM: Can you put on 728, please.

MR. P. BAKER: I'd like to see it first.

MR. GELBLUM: Sure.

(Mr. P. Baker reviews photograph.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) While he's looking, you know a photographer at
LAPD named Will Song?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Was he in the house that day?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object.

MR. P. BAKER: I'd like to approach, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I don't think you have to approach. I'm going to sustain
the objection.

MR. GELBLUM: What's the objection?

MR. P. BAKER: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Yeah.

You're going have to have to lay some foundation before I'm going to
allow any questioning on this photograph.

THE COURT: You want to call Mr. Ford back? He's a city employee. I'm
sure he's around.

MR. GELBLUM: That's fine. We'll move on.

We'll move on.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Now, is it true, Mr. Ford that the only -- you
have no independent recollection, as you sit here today, what time you
were there, what time you left; is that right?

A. No, sir.

Q. You're basing it entirely on the crime-scene log; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you fill out the crime-scene log?

A. No, sir.

Q. How does that get -- how does that work?

A. You always report in to the officer that has control of the
crime-scene log.

Q. When you come and when you go?

A. When you come and when you go.

Q. When you left that day, did you tell the officer that you were
leaving?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

Did you see him write down what time it was?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Can you put up Exhibit 200, the Rockingham log,

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 200, Rockingham Crime-Scene Log, displayed on the
Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Have you ever kept a crime-scene log yourself?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you said, when you first got on the stand, you thought you got
there around 3:00. And, in fact, the log shows -- do you know what
time the log shows you got there?

A. I think somebody told me 3:10.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Back it out a little bit so you can see the times.

Okay.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Is that your name, Mr. Ford?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And Atkins is your boss. And you came and went with him?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that shows you got there at 3:10 on the log. It shows 1630 as
departure?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, there was a Detective Haro and Detective Harbor (phonetic) there,
as well, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you actually told us something about Detective Haro. You know
who he is?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you leave with them?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Did you see them leaving with you?

A. No.

Q. At the same time as you?

A. No.

Q. You see anything on the log they left exactly the same time as you
did, 1630?

A. Yes.

Q. But you didn't leave with them, right?

A. No. We were parked up on the hill, so I walked one way, they might
have walked another.

Q. You didn't see them walking out?

A. No.

Q. As far as you know, this log could go -- it could be off 10, 15
minutes?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Are you friends with Dennis Fung or Andrea
Mazzola?

A. Not friends, coworkers.

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing further, Your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. P. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Ford, when you were in that room, the master bedroom, the
suspenders or the straps were hanging off the side of the bed,
correct?

A. I would have to look the at videotape again to recall.

MR. P. BAKER: Can you cue it up real quick?

A. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

(Videotape displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Straps are hanging over the edge of the bed,
correct?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: I've got nothing further.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Do you know whether those straps were collected as evidence?

A. No, I don't.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

MR. P. BAKER: Nothing. Thank you.

THE COURT: Your're excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. P. BAKER: Defense --

THE COURT: How long is your next witness?

MR. P. BAKER: Pretty short.

MR. LEONARD: Ten minutes, from our point of view.

THE COURT: How many more do you have.

MR. P. BAKER: We have two.

THE COURT: Two. Okay.

Take a short ten and bring them back in ten.

(Recess.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

WAYNE STANFIELD, called as a witness by the Defendants, was sworn and
testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole

THE WITNESS: Wayne Stanfield, W-a-y-n-e S-t-a-n-f-i-e-l-d.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon captain Stanfield. Good afternoon, sir.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Could you tell us what your occupation is.

A. I'm a commercial airline pilot.

Q. Who you do work for?

A. American Airlines.

Q. What is your rank at American?

A. I'm a captain.

Q. How long have you been a captain?

A. Starting six years.

Q. And how long have you been with American as a pilot?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Okay.

And have you just recently retired?

A. I retired in August.

Q. And what was your rank at retirement?

A. Navy captain.

Q. Now, directing your attention to June 12, 1994, were you the pilot
in charge and captain of flight 668 to Chicago from Los Angeles?

A. Yes.

Q. That flight departed at what time?

A. 11:45 p.m.

Q. At some point, did you leave the cockpit and walk back into the
first-class cabin?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. I take it the co-pilot was controlling the aircraft at that time.

A. The autopilot was controlling the aircraft. The co-pilot was
monitoring the autopilot.

Q. Thank you.

What was your purpose for going back into the first-class cabin, sir?

A. Well, I'd been in the seat for three hours. To stretch, to use the
bathroom.

Q. Any other reason you went back there?

A. In conjunction with that, I knew that Mr. Simpson was on board, and
I briefly talked to him.

Q. Okay. How did you learn that Mr. Simpson was on board?

A. The number one flight attendant -- the first-class flight attendant
had indicated that he had boarded.

Q. And that was early on when you first -- just before you took off?

A. Yes, in Los Angeles.

Q. Now, why did you want to talk to Mr. Simpson?

A. The short reason or the long reason?

Q. Let's stick with the short reason, since we don't have that much
time.

A. He's an admired sports figure and a person that I had admired.

Q. Okay.

And you got -- and was it your intention to have him do anything?

You just wanted to engage in conversation with him, or did you bring
something back with you to have him autograph?

A. I briefly wanted to explain to him how important it was to me that
he represented a -- represented positively athletics, and how
important that was to me.

And then I took my logbook back to get an autograph, as well.

Q. Okay.

By the way, do you have a -- do you have a copy of the page of your
logbook that Mr. Simpson ultimately autographed?

A. Yes I, do.

Q. Can you show it to me?

A. Yes. This is the logbook.

These are the copies.

Q. May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

THE WITNESS: Now, the --

MR. LEONARD: Can we mark this next?

THE CLERK: 2263.

MR. LEONARD: 2263.

MR. P. BAKER: It's been pre-marked as 1177.

THE CLERK: Then we'll take 1177.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you, Mr. Baker.

MR. P. BAKER: That was Mr. Foster.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you, Mr. Foster.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of a page from Captain
Stanfield's logbook for June 12, 1996, autographed by O.J. Simpson,
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1177.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Showing you what's been marked as 1177, just for
the record, can you identify that that is a copy of a portion of your
logbook; is that right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And so tell us what you did. You walked back to where Mr. Simpson
was sitting, correct?

A. I left the cockpit, used the forward lavatory. Upon completion and
exiting the lavatory, there's a half right turn looking to the aft of
the aircraft. He was seated on the right side of the aircraft, and I
made eye contact. I got his attention.

Q. And as you approached Mr. Simpson, did he do anything?

Did he get up?

Did he do anything?

A. No, not initially.

When I made eye contact, I asked if it would be an imposition to talk
to him.

He said no, and he sort of came up to a half crouch.

Q. What did he do at that point?

A. We both extended our hands mutually, and shook hands.

Q. At that point, did you sit down next to him?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what was the reason for sitting down next to him, sir?

A. It's easier to conduct a conversation sitting next to somebody,
than standing over them.

Q. So he was -- you sat down on his left side, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. In other words, he was in the seat next to the window; is that
right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you sat down on the aisle seat?

A. That is correct.

Q. So his left side was to your right, correct?

A. That's a true statement.

Q. How long was your conversation with Mr. Simpson?

A. Several minutes. Three minutes or so.

Q. Three minutes?

A. Yes.

Q. And tell -- tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what Mr.
Simpson's demeanor was during the conversation.

A. It was very warm, congenial, calm, cool, and collected.

Q. Now, at some point during this discussion, you passed your logbook
to Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And he took it from you?

A. I'd asked him if it wouldn't be an imposition that I get his
autograph.

He said no, that it wouldn't.

And I had my logbook, and I extended it to him, to an open page. And
then he didn't have a pen, and he sort of made a gesture, well, I
don't have a pen, so I loaned him my pen.

And then he signed it, as you can see.

Q. So he took the logbook in his hands like this, something like that;
is that right, sir?

Why don't you show us how he took it, if you recall.

A. I can.

Q. Do you have a specific recollection of how he actually took the
book in his hands from you?

A. No, I wouldn't say that I -- that I directly do, no.

Q. But in any event, he held the book in both hands at some point; is
that correct?

A. He accepted it. I don't know if he accepted it with one or two
hands. But he obviously was holding it with one hand while he wrote
the autograph.

Q. He was holding it with his left hand while he signed with his
right?

A. Yes.

Q. You were able to observe both hands at that point, sir?

A. Yes, I saw both hands.

Q. Did you see any cuts of any kind on his hands?

A. I have no recollection of any injuries or cuts, no.

Q. Any blood, any bandages, anything like that?

A. No, sir.

Q. Now, just just one final question.

What did Mr. Simpson write in the autograph?

He wrote "O.J. Simpson," his autograph, obviously, "Peace to you."

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is it Captain Stanfield?

A. You can call me Wayne.

MR. LEONARD: Do you want this? (Indicating to logbook.)

MR. PETROCELLI: That's all right.

(Logbook handed back to the witness.)

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) When you first encountered Mr. Simpson, this is
about three hours into the flight?

A. Yes.

Q. And folks in first class were sleeping?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Simpson was awake when you approached him, right?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. And at the time that you approached him, he appeared to you to be
pensive, deep in thought, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that correct, sir?

A. That is correct.

Q. That he was pensive, pensive, deep in thought?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

Now, when you --

By the way, the flight attendant, her name is Beverly Deteresa?

A. That is correct.

Q. She's a person that you worked with for a number of years?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. She was the one who attended to first-class passengers that
evening?

A. Yes.

Q. D-e-t-e-r-e-s-a; Is that right, sir?

A. I believe so. Pretty close.

Q. Okay.

Now, when you were with Mr. Simpson for the three minutes, next --

And by the way, that's the only time that you interacted with Mr.
Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you had never met him before, right?

A. Yes; I had never met him before.

Q. And you have no knowledge as to how Mr. Simpson reacts or conducts
himself under stress or distress, right?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. That calls for speculation. It's also
argumentative.

MR. PETROCELLI: I asked him if he knows.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That is?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You have no knowledge of that?

A. That is true.

Q. Okay.

And you -- and you had no knowledge of what Mr. Simpson was doing at
all that evening, prior to when you saw him sitting in his chair on
the airplane?

A. That is true.

Q. Now, for the three minutes, then, that you sat down next to him, at
no time did you examine his hands, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. At no time during the three minutes were you ever looking at his
hands for the purpose of seeing cuts, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

And, for example, if Mr. Simpson had a cut on the inside of the fourth
finger of his left hand, you would not have been able to observe that
cut, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. You did not see the inside part of his fourth finger on his left
hand, correct?

A. I don't recall looking at the inside of his fingers, no.

Q. Okay.

So you wouldn't know, as you sit here now, what the condition of that
part of the finger was that evening?

A. That's a true statement.

Q. Okay.

And you didn't see any blood or anything like that?

A. I did not see any blood.

Q. And therefore, if Mr. Simpson had a fresh cut on -- on the front of
his middle finger that was washed and was not bleeding, you can't say
that he did not have that cut that evening, can you?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation; argumentative.

THE COURT: I'll sustain it.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You can't say definitively whether or not he
had any cuts on his middle finger, correct?

A. That is correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing else.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, can we approach just for a second?

(A bench conference was held, which was not reported.)

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. By the way, you didn't see any blood on the logbook, correct, when
Mr. Simpson was done signing it?

A. No, there was no blood.

Q. What was Mr. Simpson wearing?

A. Denim-type trousers and athletic colored polo-type shirt.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Petrocelli?

MR. PETROCELLI: If I start trying to pronounce the types of clothing,
Your Honor I may embarrass myself, so I don't think I'm going to ask
my more questions.

THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.

(Witness excused.)

MR. LEONARD: call Howard Bingham.

HOWARD BINGHAM, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: And, sir, please state and spell your name for the record.

world's greatest photographer?

A. I do.

Q. Thank you.

A. Being around events, media events like football games and things I

Q. Okay.

Over the years, you photographed him?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you become an acquaintance of his?

A. I knew him, he knew me. But not, you know . . .

Q. Did you ever socialize with Mr. Simpson?

A. No, I did not.

having a drink, or something like that?

A. Not really having a drink. But just talking for minutes and things.

Q. Do you have a speech impediment?

A. I do.

Q. Do you have any difficulty in relating to the jury because of that?

A. No.

Maybe they may have a hassle with me relating to them.

THE WITNESS: Do you?

JURORS: No.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, directing your attention to June 12, 1994,
were you on an American Airlines flight to Chicago from Los Angeles?

A. When was this, you say?

Q. June 12 --

A. Yes.

Q. -- 1994 were you on an American Airlines flight to Chicago from Los
Angeles, that left approximately 11:45 p.m.?

A. I was.

Q. Did you have an occasion to see Mr. Simpson on that flight?

A. I did.

Q. Can you relate to us how you saw Mr. Simpson, and your interaction
with him?

A. I was in my seat, in coach.

Yes, coach.

(Laughter.)

A. (Continuing.) And I saw him come on the plane right before I was
going to lay down and go to sleep.

Q. Okay.

And you were able to see him from your seat back in coach, up in the
first-class cabin?

A. I did.

Q. And at some point did you approach Mr. Simpson?

A. I did.

Q. And describe for us, for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what
you did, what exchange or interchange you had with Mr. Simpson when
you went up to the first-class cabin.

A. I got up out of my seat, went to go and say hello to him, and I
talked with him a couple minutes, and then went back to the seat. And
the hostess told me it was time to go.

Q. Exchanged some pleasantries?

A. Yes.

Q. Describe Mr. Simpson's demeanor during those exchanges or that
exchange.

A. He said, Hi, Bingham. Where you going? You know, how's Ali, things
like that.

Q. What you do mean by "How's Ali?" Who are you referring to?

A. Mohammed Ali.

Q. Is Mohammed Ali a close personal friend of yours?

A. Yes, he is.

Q. And Mr. Simpson had met Mohammed Ali through you, at some point?

A. He did not meet him through me; he was working with the media and
everybody.

Q. He was aware of your relationship?

A. He was aware of my relationship with Ali.

Q. Now, can you describe with regard to Mr. Simpson's demeanor during
that exchange; that is, whether he was tired, happy, sad, or something
in between?

MR. BREWER: Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled. He asked for demeanor and gave examples.

THE WITNESS: His demeanor?

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Yeah.

A. Like I always, you know, he said, "Hi, Bingham. How you doing?"
Things like that.

Q. So his demeanor was as it had been other times?

MR. PETROCELLI: That's leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, you --

How long was your discussion with Mr. Simpson?

A. Couple minutes, maybe, or less, you know, here, there.

Q. During -- okay.

And during the discussion with him, did you notice anything unusual
about him?

Did you notice any cuts, any kinds of injuries to him, bruises?

MR. BREWER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I did not.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You notice any cuts or injuries to his hands?

A. I did not.

Q. Or bandages?

A. I did not.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BREWER:

Q. Mr. Bingham, you've never had occasion during the periods you've
known Mr. Simpson to go over to his house, for example, and visit?

A. No, I have not.

Q. He hasn't gone over to your house?

A. No, he has not.

Q. The vast majority of your contact with Mr. Simpson over the years
has been through media events; is that correct?

A. It has.

Q. It's been you photographing Mr. Simpson and other athletes; is that
true?

A. Yes. And being around other events with Ali, and things like that.

Q. Okay.

And directing your attention to June 12, 1994, Mr. Simpson was one of
the last individuals to get on the flight; is that correct?

A. I think so.

Q. And when you say that you spoke with him, he walked up -- you
walked up to first class and spoke with him, you spoke with him for
anywhere from half a minute to a minute and a half; is that a fair
estimate?

A. Yeah, fair estimate.

Q. We're talking about 30 seconds to a minute and a half, max, right?

A. Yeah.

Q. And in the course of that discussion, you were told to return to
your seat because the plane was going to take off; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And during that same discussion, you had an opportunity to look at
Mr. Simpson's hands because he was doing something with some money or
something; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Do you know whether he, in fact, had any money in his hands?

A. It wasn't -- it was change, I think, in his left hand. I think he
was taking something out of his pockets. I do not know exactly what.

Q. When you went up to first class to say hello to Mr. Simpson, did
you tap him on the shoulder?

A. I don't know now.

Q. Did he seem a bit jumpy when you first approached him?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Did he appear to jump when you approached him, or appeared to be
edgy?

A. I don't know.

Q. Have you ever told that to anyone?

A. Not that I know of, no.

Q. Are you certain of that?

A. I'm sure.

Q. Okay.

And when you spoke with Mr. Simpson, he was -- he had not taken a seat
at that point, had he? He was in the -- at the point where he was
getting situated in a seat?

A. He was in the middle on the arm rest there, sitting, not in the --
in his seat.

Q. He had not yet seated himself; is that true?

Is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And the observations -- the entire observations that you made with
Mr. Simpson, just so we're clear, occurred within 30 seconds at a
minimum, to a minute and a half, maximum?

A. Minute and a half. I'd say it was more than 30 seconds, because I
went up. He was --

MR. BREWER: Okay. Thank you, sir. Nothing further.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. You're excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

(Witness excused.)

MR. BAKER: That's it for today.

THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, you're excused until tomorrow,
8:30.

Don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinions.

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli.

THE BAILIFF: Can we have it quiet in the courtroom. The Judge is still
on the bench. Quiet in the courtroom.

Thank you.

(Jurors exit the courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. The Court has another motion filed by somebody.

THE CLERK: No, that's tomorrow at 1:30.

THE COURT: Oh, that's tomorrow?

THE CLERK: Yeah.

Oh, wait. Sorry.

THE COURT: As I was saying, the Court has another motion filed by --
by plaintiff with regards to request of plaintiff Goldman for
permission to take deposition of Rolf D. Rokahr.

Actually, it's a motion in the alternative. The alternative is to take
-- to take the deposition or to have the Court accept additional
corrections to the deposition transcript.

Had a chance to look at it?

MR. BAKER: I had a chance to look at it, and we've got more on that,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: As this Court is probably aware, Rolf Rokahr was a
photographer. And he testified in the criminal trial, and he testified
at his deposition in May, that Mark Fuhrman, pictures of him pointing
at the glove, was taken at night.

That would have been, obviously, before Mark Fuhrman went to
Rockingham.

He reiterated that testimony in his deposition in this case.

Then, Mr. Gelblum, after the deposition, contacts him -- discovery is
totally cut off -- and talks to him and attempts to persuade him to
change his testimony.

And he did this, and we have a recorded conversation with Rolf
Rokahr's daughter relative to the actions of Mr. Gelblum. And he
attempted to get him to change his testimony and to make the changes
that he now seeks, after discovery has been closed, after that
deposition has been signed.

And we think it's outrageous conduct. He had no right to contact this
witness. He had no right to attempt to get him to change his
testimony, to say that those photographs were taken at -- at a time
other than was testified to by a witness, under penalty of perjury on
two occasions.

I think it's outrageous. I think the whole motion's outrageous.

In fact, I think it ought to be referred to the State Bar of
California.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, the only thing outrageous is Mr. Baker's
outrageous and scurrilous allegations. I did not try to convince
anybody to change any testimony.

If you want to look at the pictures, Your Honor, dawn is breaking long
before those pictures were taken. It's obvious to anybody who looks at
the pictures. Mr. Rokahr agrees, without any kind of persuasive
attempt by me.

I sent him the pictures. I said, "What do you think?"

He agreed. He said yep.

His daughter was on the phone the entire time. His daughter's husband
is there. They're there.

There's nothing wrong with -- I can't contact a witness? Where did
that outrageous statement come from?

Everyone who looks at these pictures can agree that dawn is breaking.

That was never called to his attention during his previous testimony,
during his deposition whatsoever.

It's real obvious what Mr. Baker wants to do, is hide the truth from
the jury. The truth is in the pictures. Dawn has broken long before
Mr. Fuhrman's picture is taken.

THE COURT: Who was there at the deposition?

MR. GELBLUM: Mr. Medvene.

THE COURT: Why didn't he catch it?

MR. GELBLUM: I don't know why he didn't do it.

It doesn't matter. What matters is the truth; what matters is the
pictures show dawn breaking.

THE COURT: What matters is the witness had the opportunity to look at
the transcript and make corrections, and then sign it off.

MR. BAKER: All that has been -- has been accomplished.

THE COURT: I'm -- Excuse me. I thought I was talking.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

MR. GELBLUM: I did not know until after I had these conversations with
Mr. Rokahr that he had signed the deposition already, because he had
sent the signature to Mr. -- to Art Walsh of the City Attorney's
office.

Mr. Walsh didn't notify anybody until I inquired of these people a
couple days ago, when it had been signed. They contacted Mr. Walsh and
found out that it had.

THE COURT: I think maybe your team ought to communicate with one
another.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, no.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, the bottom line here --

THE COURT: The bottom line is this: This is not a deposition that was
taken yesterday. It was a deposition --

MR. GELBLUM: Agreement; that's correct

THE COURT: It was a deposition taken in April of this year, if I read
the declaration correctly.

MR. GELBLUM: That's correct.

THE COURT: All this time you had --

MR. GELBLUM: That's correct.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor --

THE COURT: Too late.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, let the jury make up their minds what the
truth is?

That is, they want to hide the truth from the jury. Let them see the
pictures and then let them decide.

THE COURT: You want to bring him down, bring him down.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, he's too ill to travel.

THE COURT: I'm not going to, at this late stage, get involved in this.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, a witness is able to change and correct his
deposition. He's making additional changes to his deposition.

THE COURT: You had ample opportunity to prepare. April -- it is now
December. The year is almost gone.

MR. GELBLUM: What's another --

THE COURT: One trial is gone; one deposition is gone. And the year is
almost gone.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, the way it -- he was originally contacted,
Your Honor --

THE COURT: Motion is denied.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Your Honor, for the record, I want to say I
think the comments of Mr. Baker were not warranted.

THE COURT: I'm not concerned with Mr. Baker's comment.

MR. PETROCELLI: This a public proceeding. I don't think he has any
right making those comments and talking about referring matters to the
State Bar.

Maybe we ought to talk about Mr. Taft, his colleague.

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, Mr. Baker, as you know, I'm not influenced
by any of this personality interchange.

I've always wanted counsel to desist from that. I will continue to ask
counsel to desist from that.

I made no complaints about whatever things you want to say about me. I
could only make a record.

And I'm going to deny the motion because I think it's untimely. I
think you had ample opportunity to make the effort to make the
correction, and it's too late.

MR. GELBLUM: I'll try to bring him down so the jury knows the truth,
Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Thursday, December 12,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. KELLY: Morning.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. BAKER: I have a couple more questions just because I had a whole
night to think of it.

THE COURT: I knew I shouldn't have let you go home.

MR. KELLY: Based on -- on that, I object to any more questions by Mr.
Baker.

THE CLERK: You're still under oath.

Would you state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Phillip Vannatter.

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Vannatter, good morning.

A. Good morning.

Q. Now, did you meet with Mr. Kelly last night?

A. For about five minutes, yes.

Q. In terms of the June 28, 1994 search warrant that you signed the
affidavit for, that was to obtain permission to search Mr. Simpson's
house to get a knife, clothes, shoes, and any murder weapon that you
could find, right?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And the people that carried out that search warrant,
one of them was David Martin, correct?

A. Detective Dave Martin, yes.

Q. And it's your understanding that he searched in the area behind the
vanity mirrors, where there's a medicine chest in Mr. Simpson's -- in
Mr. Simpson's house, because it was a very thorough search, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation, hearsay also, unless he
was there and made the observations, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained unless it's a percipient observation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You testified yesterday that this was a very
thorough search of Mr. Simpson's house; do you recall that?

A. I believe it was.

Q. And I take it that you came to that conclusion, because you talked
to the individuals that did that, and came to your own independent
assessment before you tell this jury, under penalty of perjury, that
that was a very thorough search, true?

A. I believe it was a very thorough search.

Q. To include a very thorough search in looking for the item, namely a
knife that had been reported that Mr. Simpson bought downtown while
doing a film?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay. Already injecting it in his
question, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: I'll lay the foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You had heard subsequent to the arrest of Mr.
Simpson that he had purchased, sometime previously downtown while
filming, a single-edged knife, correct?

MR. KELLY: Same objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And part of the -- part of the search warrant of
June 28 was to in fact see if that knife was in his house, correct?

A. It was to search for it, yes.

Q. And when you had Detective Dave Martin -- and by the way, Detective
Fuhrman was in on that search, too, wasn't he?

A. He was there, yes.

Q. Were you there?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony, sir, that in the vanity upstairs where
the medicine chest is or behind the vanity, that David Martin searched
there and found no knife?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay unless he's a percipient
witness.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: Also irrelevant, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you present at the hearing on 9/22/94 for the
criminal case when David Martin testified?

MR. PETROCELLI: We're going to get into what's in that hearing.

MR. KELLY: I would object, scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It's your testimony that certainly, to do a thorough
search, you'd have to look in medicine chests, isn't that true?

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. I think we went over this yesterday.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, one other thing, Otis Marlow is a pal of yours?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. A pal of mine?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yeah, he's a friend of yours?

A. Yeah, he's a friend, and a man that I worked with for a number of
years.

Q. And Otis Marlow was the fellow that you sent out into the streets
between Bundy and Rockingham and into the sewers to see if there could
be found any bloody clothes, any murder weapon, any shoes, true?

A. There were a number of detectives that did that.

Q. How many?

A. I can't tell you exactly. It was -- it was an organized search
between the two locations.

Q. And how long did it take to search between the two locations?

A. I believe it took an entire day.

Q. And there were -- in addition to a number of detectives, there were
a number of other people, including Boy Scouts, were there not?

THE COURT: Number -- not Boy Scouts, Explorer Scouts.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And they searched the shrubs, trash, into the
sewers, all of that, to find any bloody clothes, shoes, murder weapon,
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance, based on hearsay unless these were
his own observations.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That's what I was told, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And absolutely nothing was found, isn't that true?

A. Nothing to my knowledge.

Q. And you also directed people to take apart plumbing in Mr.
Simpson's home to see if blood could be found, isn't that true?

A. I didn't direct that, no.

Q. You were aware that it had occurred, and not one thing was found,
isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was aware that it occurred.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you were aware that, for example, they took
apart the plumbing relative to the washing machine to see if there was
any blood in the -- whatever those pipes are called, the drain pipes,
right?

A. I don't know that I was aware of that. I was aware that they
checked the plumbing in the bathroom.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mr. Vannatter, when you left Bundy the first time at approximately
5 a.m. that morning on June 13 to go to Rockingham, how long did you
expect to be gone for?

A. Probably 10 or 15 minutes.

Q. Okay.

And upon your return to Bundy in 10 or 15 minutes, would that be when
you called a criminalist?

MR. BAKER: Calls for speculation on the part of this witness, Your
Honor, and leading.

THE COURT: Leading. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) What did you intend to do, upon your arrival back at
Bundy in 10 or 15 minutes?

A. I would have notified all the support people to respond to the
location.

Q. Would that have included the criminalist?

A. That would have included the criminalist.

Q. Now, you indicated upon your observation of what appeared to you to
be a blood drop on the Bronco at Rockingham, you called the
criminalist at that time; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the purpose of calling the criminalist?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the purpose of calling the criminalist to Rockingham at
that time?

A. I wanted to personally be there when he tested that. I believed it
was blood, and I wanted to be there when -- personally when he tested
it.

Q. And was there anything you intended for him to do after he tested
that blood also?

MR. BAKER: Objection, calls to speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Absolutely. I would have had him -- if it would have turned out not
to be blood, or there were no other evidence, I would have then
accompanied him to Bundy.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

And you indicated in that search warrant affidavit that day, that that
appeared to be human blood on the Ford Bronco door handle, correct,
and that in fact it was tested and turned out to be human blood?

A. It turned out.

Q. Do you recall that?

A. It was tested positive for blood, yes.

Q. Okay.

So you actually were there at Rockingham when Criminalist Fung
conducted the phenolphthalein test on the Bronco door spot?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Assumes facts not in evidence.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And were the results of that phenolphthalein test
conveyed to you at Rockingham, before you left for the search warrant?

A. Yes.

Q. And was the result of that test that it was presumptively blood on
the door handle?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And would it be fair to say, that based on that
presumptive test, the location of the blood, you concluded it was
human blood?

A. I believed it was, yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, another thing --

A. I believed it was, yes.

Q. When you were in Rockingham that first morning, you indicated that
Detective Fuhrman was out of your sight of vision for a period of
time?

A. Yeah, I didn't watch him the whole time, yes.

Q. Were there times you weren't able to see Detective Lange also?

A. Certainly.

Q. And Detective Phillips?

A. Certainly.

Q. Were there times that you were out of their sight also?

A. I'm sure I was, yes.

Q. Now, going to the south side of the Rockingham residence, back when
you first observed the glove with Detective Fuhrman, you indicated
that there was no evidence of anyone coming over the fence, correct?

A. I didn't see any evidence of it.

Q. Okay.

You didn't see any torn clothing on the fence?

A. No.

Q. Didn't see any blood drops near you, immediately around the glove,
did you?

A. No. No.

Q. I believe you also indicated you never went closer than four feet
west of where the glove was; is that correct also?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. That means you stopped four feet short of that glove?

A. Yes.

Q. And I believe you indicated the foliage along the fence appeared to
be heavy?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, do you know, back along that fence, here in the vicinity where
the glove was found, whether or not there was an area large enough for
someone to have come through the foliage and over the fence?

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor, there's no foundation for that.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you observe any area in the foliage, around the
glove, large enough where someone could have come through the foliage
and over the fence?

A. I wasn't looking for anything like that. I -- I don't know.

Q. Okay.

So you didn't observe anything one way or the other?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

As you recall, was the glove found just short of that air conditioner
in the wall back there?

A. Yeah, I believe it was west -- slightly west of the air
conditioner.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can we see the video.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to any video.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BAKER: Can I be heard on that, Your Honor.

THE COURT: No.

MR. BAKER: We don't know what video this is.

THE COURT: Which video is this?

MR. KELLY: It's June of --

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. KELLY: It's a --

THE COURT: Turn it off for a minute. What --

MR. KELLY: It's a video taken of the south walkway, by the son of Mr.
Simpson's personal secretary on June 18, 1994.

MR. BAKER: Can we approach.

MR. PETROCELLI: They produced it.

THE COURT: Okay, approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter.)

THE COURT: Whose video is it?

MR. KELLY: It was made by Gary Randa, who is the son of Kathy Randa,
Mr. Simpson's personal secretary/administrative assistant for 20-odd
years, Your Honor. It was made in June, 1994, shortly after Mr.
Simpson's arrest, depicting the south walkway, the fence, the bushes
and conditions.

THE COURT: How did you get it?

MR. KELLY: Pursuant to --

MR. PETROCELLI: Court order. Your court order.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: And here's --

THE COURT: Is that who he is --

MR. PETROCELLI: Gary Randa's under his control.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BAKER: Wait. Wait a minute. I want to make a record.

This witness has never seen this tape, unless they played it to him.
This witness has testified as to his percipient knowledge. They can
not now put on a tape as affirmative evidence, without any foundation
that it was played on June 28.

I'd like the rules of evidence in this courtroom to be equal to both
sides. I'd like it to start now.

And I think this is ridiculous, that you can allow them to play a
videotape without any -- without one bit of foundation, and put it on
to a witness who says I didn't -- I didn't see this. This videotape
was done on June 28, and for you to put this on -- on this witness
without the witness's -- after they've rested their case is absolutely
ridiculous.

You wouldn't even let me have a jury view. Now you're saying they can
put on a tape when their case has rested, and a guy that says I didn't
see it, I didn't even look.

I think it's ridiculous. I think there ought to be some -- some --

MR. PETROCELLI: Keep your voice down.

Let me explain.

THE COURT: How are you going to connect up the videotape with this
witness?

MR. PETROCELLI: If you go back and look in the record, through his
leading questions yesterday, he got this witness to say that he didn't
see anything on a heavy wooded area down the south side, that he
observed no evidence that anybody could -- could come over the fence,
and that he looked all the way down as far as he can look. He went
through this in some detail yesterday on his examination.

This is the area right where the glove was found.

Okay, Your Honor.

And we're going to ask him whether he saw or didn't see that opening
in the fence. Mr. Baker elicited testimony suggesting that he saw the
area and did not see any evidence, any opening, any holes in the
foliage, and he opened this matter wide open. We're allowed to
cross-examine this witness on this point.

MR. BAKER: The witness just testified --

MR. PETROCELLI: He can't have it both ways.

And for the record, I want to object to these outrageous comments
about the rules of evidence not applying evenhandedly. This is out of
line.

MR. BAKER: I don't care what you like, I'll tell you that, number one.

Number two, this witness has just testified that he didn't look. Now
they're going to say look at this after I've got change of
circumstances. It is change of circumstances --

MR. PETROCELLI: A week or two --

MR. BAKER: Let me finish.

MR. PETROCELLI: Keep your voice down, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: On June 12 -- these murders occurred on June 13. The
morning of June 13 is when -- the evening of June 12, morning of June
13 is when somebody would have to have gone over that fence. This
video was taken on 6/28/94. They opposed, and you upheld the fact that
we can't have a jury view because of change of circumstances. They had
detectives traipsing all through there between the 12th and the 28th.

And I object to it. I think there's no foundation for it.

You can stop a hummingbird's wings in flight --

MR. PETROCELLI: This is right where the glove was found, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: It's a photo taken to accentuate exactly what he wants to
show, and with a Nikkon, I can stop a hummingbird's wings flapping, I
can't see them.

MR. PETROCELLI: You can see the top -- top of the fence posts are bent
down. I asked Mr. Simpson at his -- his examination. He denied all
this. He specifically went in with this witness, he asked four, five,
six questions, you can go back and ask, yesterday he led him to say
there's no evidence that anybody could come over that fence. He said
it was heavy, thick, wooden, he used all these words to suggest that
-- that Mr. Vannatter was able to definitively demonstrate that there
was no break.

THE COURT: When was this photograph made?

MR. PETROCELLI: This photograph was taken -- and it's even better on
the video. This was taken when we viewed the property about, when was
it, in September or August of this year.

But the video is like two weeks after the murders. It's even better
than this.

THE COURT: Okay.

Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. BAKER: Judge, I take it we're not going to have any audio on this
tape.

MR. PETROCELLI: There's no audio.

MR. FOSTER: There is audio.

MR. PETROCELLI: Turn the audio down.

MR. KELLY: This is Exhibit 821, by the way, Your Honor.

THE COURT: 8 what?

MR. KELLY: 821.

(The instrument herein described as a videotape of side of fence was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 821.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Detective, do you recognize this as this south
walkway?

A. Yes, I do.

THE COURT: Is that the best quality the tape is?

MR. PETROCELLI: Steve?

MR. FOSTER: Yes.

MR. KELLY: That's the way it was produced, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Phil's focusing it, Your Honor.

(Tape is played.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Detective Vannatter, did you observe, first of all,
the air conditioner on the left-hand side of the screen there?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony that the glove was a couple of feet, or
just short west of that air conditioner when you observed it?

A. It was slightly west. I don't know exactly how far because I never
went all the way up there.

Q. Okay.

Now, that night when you stopped four, five feet short of the glove,
did you observe this opening in the foliage right next to the air
conditioner that night?

MR. BAKER: I object, that's an opening, I object to him leading this
witness.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you observe that area above the fence depicted
in the video that night when you were there, Detective?

MR. BAKER: And the point is to lead.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I did not.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And with regard to these --

MR. BAKER: Then I move -- in view of that answer, I move that the
testimony of this witness, any further testimony relative to this be
stricken and that the tape -- the jury be admonished not to take into
account anything they just saw on the tape.

THE COURT: The jury is admonished that pending any further
foundational evidence that must be produced, you will hold your
judgment of this photograph in abeyance. I'll give you instructions if
and when we get, or don't get foundation.

MR. BAKER: Can we take that off the monitor?

THE COURT: Yes, we may.

MR. PETROCELLI: We will have foundation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Just a couple other things.

Mr. Vannatter, when you arrived at Parker Center early afternoon on
the 13th with Mr. Simpson, you had testified that he road down with
you in your car; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did anybody else arrive there for Mr. Simpson, shortly after you
arrived down there at Parker Center?

A. Yes.

Q. Who did that happen to be?

A. His two attorneys, Howard Weitzman and Skip Taft.

Q. And what, if anything, did Mr. Simpson do with his two attorneys,
Howard Weitzman and Skip Taft, after their arrival down there at
Parker Center?

A. They had a closed-door meeting, out of our presence, for 20 to 30
minutes.

Q. Okay.

Just the three of them?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you provide them a room?

A. Yes.

Q. The door was closed?

A. Yes.

Q. You weren't privy to that discussion, were you?

A. No.

Q. That was prior to your interview of Mr. Simpson that day?

A. That's correct.

Q. Last thing. Your arrival at Rockingham at about 5:15 the night of
June 13, you were asked a number of questions by Mr. Baker regarding
that?

A. Yes.

Q. And what, if anything, did you have Mr. Simpson's specimen of blood
in at that time, upon your arrival at Rockingham?

A. In an analyzed evidence envelope.

Q. Was that a gray evidence envelope?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Okay.

Where in the car was it upon your arrival there?

A. The front seat beside me.

Q. And what did you do with that envelope when you exited the car?

A. I hand carried it to Dennis Fung.

Q. Was there -- what -- would it be fair to say there was a large
number of media there when you arrived at Rockingham?

A. There was a large number, yes.

Q. People with still cameras?

A. Yes.

Q. Video equipment?

A. Yes.

Q. Number of other uniform police officers there?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Can I play one other video.

MR. FOSTER: 228.

MR. KELLY: 228 would be the same time frame of Mr. Vannatter's arrival
at Rockingham.

(Tape played from 17:16:29 to 17:18:52.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) That's the envelope in your right hand, Detective?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

That's you exiting -- entering the Rockingham foyer at that time?

A. I really can't see from here.

Q. Okay.

Can you step up and -- by the way, was that Mr. Simpson's black grip
you were returning?

A. Yes, it was.

MR. KELLY: And if you could stop that for a second.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You able to see Dennis Fung in there at that time?

MR. KELLY: If you back up a second, Steve.

A. Yes, I see Mr. Fung.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Is that where you handed him the evidence envelope?

A. Yes, sir.

(Video tape reference is 17:18:59.)

Q. You can have a seat.

One other thing, Mr. Vannatter, going back to Rockingham early that
morning, you indicated after you viewed the glove that -- that after
-- Detective Fuhrman had gone back to Bundy to make an observation of
the first glove there; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And did you make any observations in the driveway area of
Rockingham, after he had left the scene?

A. I did.

Q. What was that?

A. I discovered a number of blood drops leading from the rear of the
Bronco to the front door of the residence.

Q. Okay.

And upon Mr. Fung's arrival there, the criminalist, did you point
those blood drops out?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. This is all beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Let me show you -- I'll show you next in order.

THE CLERK: 2251.

(The instrument herein described as an analyzed evidence envelope was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2251.)

MR. BAKER: 2251.

Q. Mr. Vannatter, that is an analyzed evidence envelope like the one
that you say you got from your desk and put into -- put the vial that
you got from Thano Peratis in, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, beyond the scope.

MR. BAKER: He went into the blood vial on the tape.

MR. KELLY: Just asked an observation on the video that Mr. Baker had
played portions of yesterday, Your Honor. I didn't go into the content
or the writings.

THE COURT: You did point out the envelope.

Overruled.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's like the one that you say that you had gotten
from your desk in -- or from -- or handed to Thano Peratis and had him
sign it, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And --

A. Yes.

Q. And the instructions on that analyzed evidence envelope are of --
that that is supposed to be sealed, right, as soon as the blood vial
is placed in it?

MR. BAKER: Can I have my picture back.

(Mr. Petrocelli hands photo to Mr. Baker.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) See where it says under the officer requesting
withdrawal?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

It's supposed to be sealed, is it not?

A. It says when the affidavit is completed, sign below as a witnessing
officer and seal the envelope, yes.

Q. And was, in fact, the envelope with the -- strike that.

I take it that you followed these instructions, and once there was an
affidavit of the person withdrawing blood, you sealed that envelope,
right? Very important, isn't it?

A. No, I didn't seal the envelope and the reason I didn't was Mr. Fung
was going to book the evidence, and he needed to see what he was going
to book. I couldn't seal it and ask him to book it without seeing what
was in it.

Q. You testified in this courtroom last month that you in fact sealed
the envelope, did you, sir?

A. No, sir. No, sir. I never sealed this envelope. The other envelopes
I got were sealed.

Q. So let me see if I've got this straight.

Play the video.

(Videotape played at 171659.)

MR. P. BAKER: 228. Tape played at 171659.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you agree that that envelope in your left hand is
not sealed, correct?

(Referring to videotape.)

A. I don't recall sealing the envelope, and the reason I don't was it
was not -- it could not have been booked at that point.

(Videotape stops playing at 17:19.)

Q. Detective Vannatter, you agree that that envelope you had in your
left hand just shown in the videotape was not sealed, true?

A. I believe it was not sealed, yes.

Q. And so --

MR. BAKER: Put this on the Elmo.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 225 (sic).

MR. BAKER: I think it's 17.

Okay. Sorry.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of the actual
analyzed evidence envelope was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2252)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) This is a photograph of the envelope that was
actually used, is it not, can you see it?

A. I would guess it is.

Q. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Now, Phil, take it down to the bottom, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Thano Peratis signed, under penalty of perjury,
that he drew the blood on 6/13 at 2:30, and apparently executed the
declaration that says 5/19/94. That has to be an error, correct?

A. Yeah.

Q. He obviously didn't withdraw the blood a month before?

A. The murder hadn't occurred yet. That's obviously an error.

Q. Now -- Now, Mr. Vannatter, there is a set procedure after blood is
drawn from an individual relative to sealing the envelope, relative to
initialing the envelope, every time the seal is broken, and dating and
time go on the back of the envelope to ensure that there is a chain of
custody, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, beyond the scope, Your Honor, irrelevant what
the procedure is.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The policy on it is you book it as soon as practical. Once it's
booked, then every time it's reopened, it's initialed, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Detective Vannatter, if this is such an important
piece of evidence that you drove an hour and 20 minutes, because chain
of custody was important, you sure wanted to have that envelope sealed
with the blood in it, so that the chain of custody was protected if
you weren't going to take any blood out of that vial, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The rules require you to seal the envelope and you
didn't do it; isn't that correct, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, beyond the scope, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Just a minute.

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order.

THE COURT: This is 225 --

MR. P. BAKER: I think --

THE CLERK: What's up on the screen?

MR. P. BAKER: The blood vial envelope, next in order. Didn't I say
that, Judge?

THE COURT REPORTER: What is the number then?

THE COURT: I don't know. We'll find out in a minute.

THE CLERK: The evidence envelope 2251.

THE COURT: That makes that 52.

THE CLERK: 2252.

THE COURT: Okay.

Read me the question.

THE REPORTER: (Reading:)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The rules

require you to seal the envelope and you

didn't do it; isn't that correct, sir?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I testified I didn't seal the envelope.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And under the instructions, number 4, it was after
the affidavit was completed around 4:30 (sic), long before 5:15,
before you took the vial and it'd been in your automobile, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Sign below as witnessing officer and seal the vial in this envelope
using completed sealed evidence labels. None of that complied with it,
true?

A. That's true.

Q. So the envelope with Mr. Simpson's blood in it was in your
possession from 2:30 to 5:16, or 5:19, or whenever it was unsealed
with only you in possession of that vial of Mr. Simpson's reference
blood, correct?

A. That's correct.

It was part of my job, Mr. Baker.

Q. Yeah. And part of your job was to follow the instructions; to A,
book evidence immediately, B, seal the envelope, none of which you
did. That was part of your job too, wasn't it?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, one other thing, when you as a detective on
this particular case went back to the southside of Mr. Simpson's
house, looked at the glove, you were four feet away, what -- from
about me to you, four feet away, you looked at the glove, you looked
down at the shrubbery, and you found absolutely not one bit of
evidence that anyone came over the fence and disturbed any shrubbery
whatsoever, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation given that he was unable to see
down the entire length of the fence, as Mr. Baker pointed out.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was not really looking to see if anybody came over the fence. I
didn't see any evidence of anybody coming over the fence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Vannatter, you're a detective of 23 years. You
find a piece of evidence, you've just been to Bundy where there's a
glove underneath a fence within 3 feet of two bodies, and you are
informed by Detective Fuhrman that there is a glove there, and there
is a hedge going over on the right side as you view the glove, there
is no blood trail, there is not one drop of blood around any leaf on
the ground, and you're telling this jury --

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, this is closing argument.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You had an obligation to look, didn't you?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As a detective, are you telling this jury you didn't
look to see whether or not there was an area or destruction of broken
branches or anything; is that what you're telling me?

A. I'm telling you I didn't observe any evidence of anything coming
over the fence.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, sir. Nothing further.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mr. Vannatter, when you left Parker Center with that evidence
envelope with the blood vial in it, did you drive directly to the
Rockingham residence and hand that to Mr. Fung?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Nothing.

THE COURT: Your're excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE COURT: Call your next witness.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, under 776 we call Andrea Mazzola.

MR. PETROCELLI: Object to 776.

MR. BAKER: 767.

MR. PETROCELLI: Object to that also.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Wait a minute. Approach the bench a minute.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

THE COURT: He did what?

MR. PETROCELLI: We object. These witnesses are not hostile witnesses.
They're city employees. They're not aligning with the plaintiffs.
There's no showing that they are hostile. Mr. Vannatter indicated he
came back on his own volition. These people are not hostile.

MR. BLASIER: Well, Your Honor --

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor --

THE COURT: I'm going to permit the defense to examine by way of
cross-examination.

MR. PETROCELLI: Then let us lead as well then, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I don't think so. I think this situation is such that these
witnesses have testified previously adversely to Mr. Simpson. A
certain amount of latitude should be allowed to the defense in
examining these witnesses.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you.

ANDREA MAZZOLA, called as a witness by Defendants, was sworn and
testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, while Mr. Blasier is getting the material, I'd
like to move into evidence 1797, 2250, 2251 and 2252.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 1797.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2250.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2251.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2252.)

THE COURT: Hearing no objection, they're received.

THE CLERK: Please state and spell both your first and your last names
for the record.

THE WITNESS: Andrea Mazzola, A-n-d-r-e-a M-a-z-z-o-l-a.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Ms. Mazzola, can you please tell the jury your occupation.

A. I'm a criminalist employed with the City of Los Angeles.

Q. And you're with the Scientific Investigation Division of the police
department?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, could you tell us since the verdict in the criminal case
acquitting Mr. Simpson in October of 1995, have you spent any time
working with the plaintiffs' attorneys or other representatives in
this case?

A. I've only had one meeting with the plaintiffs' attorneys.

Q. When was that?

A. This past Saturday.

Q. How much time did you spend with them?

A. An hour and a half.

Q. Who did you spend that time with?

A. Mr. Lambert.

Q. Now, in preparation for your testimony, did you review the work
that you had done on the Simpson criminal case?

A. I looked at some of the paperwork, yes.

Q. Now, as of June 13 of 1994, the time that you went to the various
crime scenes in this case, had you received any training whatsoever in
the collection of evidence for possible DNA testing?

A. I received the training that we get for the collection of
biological fluids at a scene.

Q. Had you received any specific training with respect to DNA testing?

A. With respect?

Q. And particular problems that might relate to biological evidence
with DNA testing?

A. No.

Q. Now, as of that date, June 13 of 1994, how long had you been a
criminalist?

A. Approximately six months.

Q. And prior to the time that you were a criminalist at LAPD, you
didn't have any experience of processing crime scenes; is that
accurate?

A. That's correct.

Q. And at the time that you processed the scenes in this case, how
long had you been -- how long had you been in training, shall I say,
to process crime scenes?

A. In training as --

Q. In learning how to process a crime scene.

A. We were given in-house instruction on how to process crime scenes,
plus as criminalists, once we went out with the more experienced
criminalists during the day calls, and also we volunteered to go out
with them at night and on the weekends.

Q. As of June 13 you were -- you were still a trainee, were you not?

A. I was a Criminalist 1.

Q. You considered yourself a trainee, didn't you?

A. I was a Criminalist 1. There is no designation as trainee.

Q. Do you remember testifying in August of 1994 at a hearing
concerning what procedures were used to collect evidence in this case?

A. I remember testifying in '94, yes.

Q. And you testified at that time that you considered yourself a
trainee; isn't that correct?

A. That, I do not remember.

Q. Referring to testimony of August 23, 1994, page 689, line 20.

Do you recall being asked this question and giving this answer?
(Reading:)

Q. And I take it currently,

as of right now, today, this being

August of '94, you are still a trainee

in crime scene collection; is that

correct? A. I would go out with the

Criminalist 3 to a crime scene, so yes,

I guess you would classify me as a crime

scene trainee.

Q. Do you recall giving that testimony?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Would it refresh your memory to look at it?

A. I doubt it. I might have. I don't remember exactly what happened in
'94.

Q. Now, at the time that you went to the crime scenes in this case,
that was only the third crime scene that you had worked on; is that
correct?

A. I think it was about the third, yes.

Q. And at the two crime scenes that you worked on prior to this one,
you weren't the primary person in charge of collecting evidence, were
you?

A. I was not the primary criminalist. That is correct.

Q. So, would it be fair to say that the Simpson crime scene, and
Simpson case in June of '94 was the first scene where you were given
the principal responsibility for actually collecting the evidence from
the ground and various other places?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant, in limine order No. 11.

THE COURT: Read that question again.

THE COURT REPORTER: (Reading:)

Q. So, would it be fair to say

that the Simpson crime scene and Simpson

case in June of '94, was the first scene

where you were given the principal

responsibility for actually collecting

the evidence from the ground and various

other places?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. At the other two scenes, I worked as part of a team with the other
criminalists. I collected biological samples from those scenes as well
as the Simpson scene.

Q. (BY MR BLASIER) You collected most of the biological samples in the
Simpson case, did you not?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, in fact, when you got the call -- By the way, what time did
you get called out to a location in the Simpson case?

A. I received a call at home at approximately 5:26 to 5:30, somewhere
in there.

Q. In the morning?

A. In the morning.

Q. And where were you told to go?

A. Rockingham.

Q. Now, at that time, you were -- it was specified that you were going
to be the officer in charge; isn't that correct?

A. That's what was written on the form.

Q. And that's what you were to be, correct?

A. Officer in charge. The fact that I was the primary criminalist on
call, I was the one that received the call.

Q. But what -- Is that all that being the officer in charge means?

A. As being the primary, yes.

Q. It doesn't have anything to do with what your responsibility is at
the crime scene?

A. Well, in this case, after we got to Rockingham and learned more of
what had happened, then the Criminalist 3, Mr. Fung, became in charge.
He -- He became more of the person who made the decisions on what
would happen.

Q. So then being the officer in charge, that does have a certain
meaning beyond just the fact that you're on call, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And now let me show you what's been marked as Civil Exhibit 943.

Do these appear to be your crime-scene notes from the Rockingham
location from June 13,1994?

(The instrument herein described as copy Mazzola crime-scene
investigation checklist was marked for identification as Defendants
Exhibit No. 943.)

A. Yes.

Q. You would agree that document lists you as the officer in charge,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And is it accurate that most of that document is in your
handwriting, that you prepared that?

A. Most of it appears to be in my handwriting, yes.

Q. Incidentally, at that time, were you the least experienced
criminalist at SID in processing crime scenes?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The least experienced as in?

Q. Processing crime scenes?

A. I was hired with other people, we were all Crim 1's.

Q. Was there anybody with less experience than you?

A. I don't know how many calls the other people had gone out on.

Q. Is it accurate that you collected -- at the Bundy crime scene you
collected every biological stain, with the exception of two stains
from -- from bloody shoe prints?

A. That is not correct.

Q. What stains -- Now, the two stains that I'm referring to is stain
Nos.' 55 and 56.

Does that sound familiar to you?

A. From the two bloody shoe prints?

Q. Those were collected by Dennis Fung, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Is it your testimony that he collected other biological samples
from the Bundy crime scene other than those two?

A. Only one stain -- he collected a little more blood and he collected
maybe one or two stains from the caged area that were on the -- actual
fence.

Q. Do you remember testifying at the criminal trial in this case, with
respect to who collected blood stains at what location?

A. I remember testifying, yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: What page?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Referring to -- I'm sorry, this would be the
August -- August 23 of 1994, the hearing that we talked about a little
while ago, page 735, line 16.

You remember being asked this question and giving this answer -- this
series of answers.

(Reading:)

Q. Would you please look at

your notes and tell me which numbers

those are, and when you say that you say

he collected the actual shoe prints or

he collected alleged drops that were

near the shoe prints. A. He, meaning Dennis Fung,

if I remember correctly, took swatches

of the red stains that were constituting

the footprint itself. Q. Can you tell us which ones

those were, please. A. Property Items 55 and 56. Q. And is that it? A.
Yes. Q. All other blood stains at

the Bundy crime scene were collected by

you? A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember that testimony?

A. Not really, no.

Q. You do recall testifying in August?

A. Yes, I do recall testifying in August.

Q. You have any reason to think that your testimony was anything other
than that?

A. No, not if it's there.

Q. Now, with respect to the Rockingham scene, is it accurate to say
that Dennis Fung collected a stain or two on the street, but you
collected every other biological stain at that scene?

A. For the most part, yes.

Q. And for some of those stains you collected, Dennis Fung wasn't even
supervising you, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Was there at any time any discussion that perhaps someone with more
experience should be processing these crime scenes?

A. Not that I remember, no.

Q. Now, when you were at the Bundy scene -- what time did you get to
the Bundy scene?

A. May I look at the note?

Q. Sure.

A. We arrived at Bundy approximately quarter after 10.

Q. And what time had you arrived at Rockingham?

A. Approximately 10 minutes after 7.

Q. So you had been at Rockingham for approximately 3 hours before you
went to Bundy, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. When you got to the Bundy scene, did you observe a blanket covering
the body of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. I do not recall seeing Nicole Simpson when we arrived.

Q. Do you recall seeing a blanket on the ground?

A. Yes, I recall seeing a blanket.

Q. Did you ever examine that blanket for any possible trace evidence?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever examine it for anything?

A. No.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant under in limine order No. 11.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And that blanket was left on the ground, after
that crime scene was released, correct?

A. I do not know what the detectives did with the blanket.

Q. You and Dennis Fung never collected it, did you?

A. We never collected it.

Q. Now, at the Bundy scene, is it accurate that you are the one who
collected both the knit cap and the Bundy glove?

A. Correct.

Q. And which one did you collect first?

A. Offhand, I can't remember which was collected first.

MR. BLASIER: Do we have the video?

MR. P. BAKER: This is Civil 918.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Ms. Mazzola, can you turn and look at the video
here. See if this refreshes your recollection.

(Exhibit 918, videotape, played at CTC 135143.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recognize that as you collecting the knit
cap?

A. Yes.

Q. And you are wearing gloves, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now you're collecting the glove, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: You can turn it off.

(Videotape stopped at 17:52:30.)

Q. Now, you would agree that you did not change your gloves between
collecting the knit cap and the glove; is that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Correct.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You did not examine your hands between collecting
the knit cap and the glove for any biological material that may have
gotten on your hands from the knit cap, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you didn't examine your gloves for any possible trace evidence
that might have come off the knit cap onto your gloves before you
picked up the glove, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, do you know -- do you have any independent recollection at all
as to when you had changed your gloves prior to the time that you
picked up the knit cap?

MR. LAMBERT: From when? Vague question, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) From the time you got there?

A. That day? I can't begin to tell you how many times I changed my
gloves. I don't remember when I changed them. I know I changed them
many times that day.

Q. Can you tell me prior to the time that you picked up the knit cap,
when you changed your gloves?

A. No, I cannot.

Q. And your reason for not changing your gloves between the knit cap
and the glove was what?

A. They're both in extreme close proximity to each other. When they
are picked up, as you pick up any piece of evidence, if you're going
to use your hands, you pick them up securely within the smallest area
possible, you would not pick up a hat just by grabbing it, you pick it
up in the smallest area possible, touch it as least as possible.

Q. You're saying that you did that because the hat and the glove were
in close proximity to each other?

A. That I did what?

Q. That's why you didn't change your gloves?

A. That was one of the reasons.

Q. Do you remember testifying at the criminal trial, page 23746, line
1, when you were asked with respect to why you didn't change your
gloves. (Reading:)

A. The hat and the glove at

Bundy were touching each other.

Q. Do you remember that testimony?

(Reading:)

They were not in two completely

separate areas. They were in physical

contact with each other.

Q. Remember that testimony?

A. I think so, yes.

Q. And that's not accurate, is it?

MR. LAMBERT: That wasn't impeachment, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: I'll withdraw that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Was there a time when they were touching each
other, prior to the time that you collected them?

A. At the time that I testified to that, I believed, to the best of my
recollection, that the two items were touching each other.

Q. Had you seen them touching each other prior to the time you
collected them?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Prior to the time that you collected the Bundy glove, had you seen
anyone pick it up and replace it on the ground?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Prior to the time -- Now, you collected the envelope with the
glasses as well, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Prior to the time that you collected the envelope with the glasses,
did you see anyone pick it up and replace it on the ground in a
different location?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Now, could we have.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you Exhibit 1532.

Ms. Mazzola, when you arrived at the Bundy scene at approximately 10,
10:15 on the morning of the 13th, was there a piece of paper, as
depicted in this photograph, on the ground between the bodies of
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman?

A. Right now, I don't remember seeing a piece of paper.

Q. Did -- in your presence, did Detective Lange of -- did you ever see
him examine a piece of paper like that at the scene -- at the Bundy
scene?

A. In my presence, no.

Q. And you never collected that piece of paper, did you?

A. Does not look familiar.

Q. It doesn't show up anywhere in your checklist, either, as anything
that you collected on that day, correct?

A. If it's not on the checklist, we did not pick it up.

Q. You want to verify that it's not there.

(Witness reviews documents in a blue notebook binder.)

Q. That's correct, you did not collect that?

A. (Nods affirmatively.)

Q. Let me show you People 92 -- I apologize for the picture -- to help
situate the location of that piece of paper.

And your testimony is that you never saw that there, correct?

A. That?

(Indicating to photograph of paper.)

A. I honestly don't remember seeing it.

Q. Okay.

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, let's take a break.

MR. BLASIER: Sure.

THE COURT: 10 minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Ms. Mazzola, one of your responsibilities with
Dennis Fung, at the Bundy scene, was to examine the entire scene for
possible evidence to collect, correct?

A. Usually you have a walk-through at the beginning, yes.

Q. And it's your responsibility, yours and Mr. Fung's, to identify all
evidence that might be -- have some probative value and collect that
evidence, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And that involves the careful examination of the scene itself,
doesn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were at the Bundy scene from about 10:00 or 10:15 in the
morning until when?

A. Can I check?

Q. Sure.

(Witness reviews documents in blue notebook binder.)

A. Approximately quarter after 3:00.

Q. All right. So about six -- five hours, a little more than five
hours?

A. Somewhere around there, yes.

Q. You had plenty of time to examine that scene, did you not?

A. We had the walk-through, yes, and we started work.

Q. And when you left that area, you felt you were done and you had
completely processed the scene, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, the so-called Bundy drops, these were drops that where are on
the walkway, going out on the side of Nicole Brown Simpson's
condominium, correct?

A. There were drops on the walkway, yes.

Q. Okay.

(Referring to exhibit No. 67 entitled Blood Drops at Bundy, June 13,
1994.)

MR. BLASIER: You want to take a look at this and orient yourself, if
you could.

Can you see it from there?

MR. P. BAKER: The board is exhibit 67.

MR. BLASIER: 67.

(Exhibit 67 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, one of the things that you do when you
collect evidence is to document the evidence as you collect it,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the notes that you have in front of you -- I forget what number
that is. 923?

MR. P. BAKER: 943.

MR. BLASIER: 943.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do those particular documents have a list of items
that you collected from Bundy, or is that on a different checklist?

A. That was on a different checklist.

Q. Did you bring that other checklist with you?

A. Did I?

My copy, yes.

Q. And why don't you pull that out, because I'm going to ask you some
questions about it.

The numbers on the drops in this chart 112, 13, 14, 15, and 17, those
are photo I.D. numbers, are they not?

A. Correct.

Q. And they were later given different item numbers after they -- at
the time they were brought in to be booked, I suppose, correct?

A. They were assigned property numbers before final booking.

Q. Okay.

Now, could you look at your records and tell me now --

Incidentally, were these numbers assigned in sequence as to -- as you
identified things?

A. That is what you normally try to do, is to keep things sequential,
if at all possible.

Q. Okay.

So 112 would be the first thing that you documented of this series?

(Witness reviews documents in blue notebook binder.)

A. It appears that 112 was the beginning -- the beginning of the
drops.

Q. That represents a drop found up here on the chart, indicating near
-- the closest one to the front gate area?

A. Correct.

Q. Then the next one you did was 113, which was a little further, I
guess, west down the walkway, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Then 114, yet further down. Actually, this was on the way, on the
steps, going down into this depressed area, or maybe this is going up,
I guess, correct? 114?

A. It was back further, yes.

Q. Okay.

And 115 is back by the back gate, correct?

A. That would be further back, yes.

Q. Tell me what you did after you did 115.

Check your notes.

(The witness complies.)

A. It's number photo I.D. 116, indicates the stain that was taken off
the front gate.

Q. So you went from 115, near the back gate, back up to the front gate
and did 116, correct?

A. No.

When the numbers were laid out, if another stain was identified up
near the front, the next photo I.D. number could have been taken up
and given to that stain.

Once you start processing, you're ready to collect; you've done your
measurements; you've done your numbers. The photographer takes his
pictures; you do the sketches. Then you start collecting it, the last
thing do you.

Q. When were those cards put down there? Were they put down there in
sequence?

A. Mr. Fung started laying out the numbers on the walkway, as I
started working at the front end.

Q. Okay.

Now, there was a stain out in the driveway area that got the number
117, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, when did 116 on the front gate -- when was this number
assigned?

A. Probably before Mr. Fung laid out 117 at the back.

Q. All right.

And did you collect these in the same order?

A. Once we started working on the trail blood drops in the back, they
were picked up going back.

Q. So you didn't process -- you didn't collect them in order of the
photo I.D. numbers?

A. You wouldn't go down to 115, stop what you're doing back there,
walk up to the front, collect 116, and then walk all the way to the
back to get 117.

Q. Do you have any recollection at all as to what you did after 115?

A. After I collected 115, I would collect 117.

Q. You have a specific recollection that that's what you did?

A. I would work my way back. That's what I've always done.

Q. My question was, do you have a specific recollection that after
115, you went to 117?

(Brief pause.)

A. At this point, I mean, knowing what I do -- but as you say, an
independent recollection, I can't say that.

Q. And your notes, when you do those, your -- your notes, you do those
sequentially as you process items, as you're supposed to, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in your notes, it shows that after 115, you did 116 on the
front gate, correct?

A. That's when it was measured. Just --

Q. Now, you did not notice anything of evidentiary value whatsoever on
the back gate; isn't that correct?

A. To the best of my recollection, I do not recall seeing a back gate.

Q. My question is, you observed nothing of evidentiary value on the
back gate, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. She just said she didn't see.

THE COURT: She said she didn't see a back gate. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) How many times did you walk along this pathway
during the five hours that you were there?

A. I can't tell you how many times.

Q. Did you examine any areas that were above the ground for stains,
for blood splatter?

A. Mr. Fung had gone back there and had done the walk-through with the
detectives, and he had identified what needed to be picked up. I
personally did not.

Q. So you didn't do any examination of the scene at all to determine
what should be picked up?

A. Along that back area, no.

Q. And you don't even know if there was a gate there?

MR. LAMBERT: Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer.

A. At that time, I did not recall seeing a back gate.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay.

Now, incidentally, the proper way -- the correct way, under your
procedures to document evidence such as these drops, is to take
pictures with this -- these cards, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And this is before collection, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And isn't it also one of the requirements that you have a ruler in
here so that you can tell what the size of the stain is?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant. Evidence-collection techniques in
limine ruling.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You can ask her if she had one or not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) None of these pictures has a ruler in it to
establish the size of any of the Bundy drops; isn't that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That's correct; there was no ruler.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Tell me how big 112 was.

A. Other than the relationship of the size of the cards, of the drop,
that's the only way to tell.

Q. You never measured the size of any of these drops, did you?

A. No.

Q. You can't tell whether 117 is bigger than 114 or smaller than 112,
can you?

A. No.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, I want to ask you some questions about item
number one 1 at the Rockingham scene.

Why don't you pull those notes there, so you can refresh your
recollection.

(Witness reviews documents.)

Q. Tell me what item 11 is from the Rockingham scene.

A. It is a red stain.

Q. Let me put 2137 on the Elmo.

(Defendants' Exhibit 2137 is displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. And tell us, is that the redish stain that you just testified
about?

A. From that angle and distance, you can't.

Q. Can you see the card?

A. Yes. I can't see the stains from that picture.

Q. Okay.

But you recognize the area from where take stain was collected?

A. I recognize the back area, yes.

Q. And that was on a wire on the back walkway of Mr. Simpson's,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Describe that stain for me.

A. It was more of a very light smear than like a blood drop, more of a
very light --

Q. Redish in color?

A. Reddish-brown, yes.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, next in order, please.

THE CLERK: 2253.

(The instrument herein referred to as document regarding stains and
item numbers was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2253.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you did a presumptive blood test on that
stain, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. It came back positive, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: 2253 please.

(Defendants' Exhibit 2253 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. We're talking about item 11, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you collected that stain on June the 13th, 1994, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You did a presumptive test and it came back positive, correct?

A. Preliminary positive, yes.

MR. BLASIER: Why don't you put a plus there for positive.

MR. P. BAKER: (Mr. P. Baker complies.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, your testimony here is that it -- that was a
redish stain, correct?

A. A very light redish-brown, very hard to see.

Q. Incidentally, when you collected that, you were all by yourself,
weren't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Dennis Fung was not there supervising you at all, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Did you use the same level of care in collecting that stain as you
did all the other ones?

A. Yes.

Q. Who told you about there being a stain in that area?

A. I believe it was Mr. Fung.

Q. Remember testifying on April 26, 1995, that you couldn't remember
whether it was Mr. Fung or a detective?

A. As I said, I believe it was Mr. Fung.

MR. BLASIER: Do we have -- 24501, line 10.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember being asked the question starting
at line 10: "And who was it that brought that to your attention?",
meaning item 11.

"Answer: I can't remember if it was Mr. Fung or a detective."

Remember giving that answer?

A. I -- maybe. I don't quite remember.

Q. Okay.

Now, Detective Fuhrman was one of the detectives at the scene at
Rockingham, was he not?

A. At that time, on that day, I was not introduced to any of the
detectives. I didn't know which one was which.

Q. Okay.

Now, do you remember testifying at page 24502, right below that --

MR. P. BAKER: What line?

MR. BLASIER: Line 2.

MR. PETROCELLI: 20 what?

MR. P. BAKER: 24502.

MR. LAMBERT: Line what?

MR. BLASIER: Line 2.

This is testimony from the criminal trial on April 26, 1995.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember testifying in April?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. This isn't inconsistent with anything.

MR. PETROCELLI: He has no right just to read it this.

MR. BLASIER: It is --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. BLASIER: It is inconsistent.

THE COURT: What's the inconsistency?

MR. BLASIER: They -- she testified she didn't see a redish stain.

THE COURT: Go ahead. No harm; no foul.

MR. BLASIER: She testified it was a redish stain.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. BLASIER: 24502, please.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You remember being asked these questions and
giving these answers?

(Reading:)

"Q. And just like the other

stains that you collected that day, you

swatched the redish area, did you not? "A. I swatched the area that

came up, you know, positive. I had trouble seeing

exactly the red mark it itself. "Q. Ms. Mazzola you saw a

redish discoloration on the wire? "A. It was pointed out to me,

but I still couldn't quite make it out."

Do you recall that now?

A. Possibly, yes.

Q. So as of your testimony in April, you didn't see a redish stain,
correct?

A. I said there --

MR. KELLY: Wait.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You couldn't see a redish area; that's what you
testified to?

A. I had -- I said I had trouble making it out.

Q. So you saw a redish area?

A. As I said, there was very slight discoloration.

That's why you do a presumptive test.

Q. Now, you're aware, are you not, that that stain that you collected
was later tested and found -- did not have blood on it, aren't you?

A. I do not know any of the serology results on that.

Q. And that didn't look like a drop, did it?

A. No.

Q. It didn't look like any of the drops on the driveway, did it?

A. No.

Q. Didn't look like any of the drops at Bundy, did it?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Take that off.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, I want to ask you some questions about the
Bundy and the Rockingham drops, in terms of your collection of those
items.

As of June 13 of '94, had you received any training whatsoever, with
respect to the effect of moisture on the degradation of DNA?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you collected the Rockingham drops first,
before you went to Bundy, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the way you do that is, you take the small cotton swatches and
you put distilled water on them. Then you swipe as much of the blood
as you can get off of the ground, right?

A. You don't swipe the blood; you let it sort of blot up, and you keep
turning the swatch.

Q. And you do as many swatches as you can.

You get as much of the blood off as possible, correct?

A. As much of the concentrated blood, yes.

Q. And sometimes you can get four swatches, sometimes five, sometimes
maybe only a couple, correct?

A. It depends on the drop itself.

Q. Now, each of those swatches that you did for the Rockingham drops,
as well as the Bundy drops later that morning, were put into -- while
they were wet, into plastic bags, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the plastic bags that had the red swatches, where were they put
after you put them in the plastic bags?

A. The individual bags were placed in small -- we call them coin
envelopes, small manila envelopes that have the photo I.D. number of
each item on it.

Q. And where were they taken from there?

A. They were put in a paper bag to keep everything together, and put
in the trunk.

Q. They were put in the back of the crime-scene truck?

A. Correct.

Q. I think it's a black truck. I think we may have seen that truck.

A. Actually, it's navy blue, yes.

Q. Dark in color?

A. Dark.

Q. They're dark.

There's a refrigerator in the back of the truck?

A. There's a small refrigerator, yes.

Q. They're for preserving biological samples that are collected.
That's one of the purposes, correct?

A. Well, it's also to hold chemicals that are used out in the field.

Q. One of the reasons it's there is to preserve biological stains,
correct?

A. I was never told that. I -- I don't know.

Q. The swatches from Rockingham and Bundy in the plastic bags, were
put in the back of the crime-scene truck, but not in the refrigerator,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And what temperature was it, let's say, at about noon on the 13th,
approximately?

A. I have no way of knowing.

I don't know.

Q. There was -- you had concern, did you not, about how hot the
crime-scene truck was getting that day, with those swatches in the
back of it, didn't you?

A. I, at that time, never really thought about it.

Q. Did Dennis -- did you or Dennis Fung, at any time, go back to check
to see how hot they were getting in the back of the crime-scene truck?

A. No.

Q. How long were those stains from Rockingham kept in the back of that
crime-scene truck, unrefrigerated, until you took them out?

A. Until we got back to the lab that evening.

Q. And that would be about what time?

A. Oh, let's see.

I think maybe after 6:00.

Q. And -- I'm sorry; were you done?

A. (Nods affirmatively.)

Q. And the Rockingham drops were collected at approximately what time?

A. Oh, probably 9:00 or so.

Q. So they were kept in the back of the truck about ten hours before
they were taken out, correct?

A. I assume so.

Q. And the Bundy drops were collected at approximately what time, what
regular time?

A. Oh, probably 12:00, probably started collecting them maybe 45
minutes to an hour after the -- after we arrived at Bundy.

Q. So that would be before 11:00?

A. Before 11:00.

Q. And so those items, those swatches in the plastic bags, were kept
in the back of the truck for approximately six hours before they were
taken out, correct?

A. Well, the ones at Bundy were not placed in the truck until we got
ready to move everything back out.

Q. Okay.

What was done with them prior to the time they were put in the truck?

A. They were kept up front in the bags, where we were working outside.

Q. In the sun?

A. I -- I don't know if they were in the sun or the shade.

Q. And then they were put in the truck, and kept there until about
6:00 or after, when you got back to the lab?

A. Right.

Q. Now, I want to ask you questions about the Bronco.

On June 14, you and Dennis Fung processed the Bronco for blood stains,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And where did that occur, and about what time?

A. That occurred at the LAPD print shed, which is near Parker Center,
and if I can check my notes, I believe --

Q. Sure.

A. -- we arrived at the print shed a little after 7:00 that morning.

Q. And is it accurate that --

And how long were you there, approximately?

A. Oh, a little over three hours.

Q. You had plenty of time to examine the Bronco and collect all the
stains, correct?

A. Well, first of all, you do not collect every stain that you see;
you take a representative sample. And we collected what we saw.

Q. So you didn't collect every stain that you saw?

A. If you have several stains right together, you're not going to pick
up every single stain; you're going to take a representative sample of
that group.

Q. My question was, so you did not collect every stain that you saw on
the 14th?

A. We did not collect every stain.

Q. Did you collect as much of a stain -- of the stains that you saw as
possible?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me -- do you recall testifying at page 24208, line 7 --

MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on. That's the wrong citation. It has nothing to
do with this point.

MR. P. BAKER: Check 24207.

MR. BLASIER: Yeah, 24207. I'm sorry. Starting at line 7. You guys have
that?

Can we show that, please.

(Page 24207 of the criminal trial transcript displayed on the Elmo
screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember testifying on April 25, 1995 in
the criminal trial, the following questions and answers:

(Reading:) "Q. Now, on June 14, it was

yours and Dennis Fung's job to collect

every single blood stain on the outside

and inside of the Bronco that was

visible to you; isn't that right? "A. Yes, I believe so. "Q. And each
time that you

set out to collect blood stains in this

case, for each stain that you collected,

Ms. Mazzola, weren't you instructed to

collect as much of the stain as you

possibly could collect? "A. Yes."

And going down a little bit: "Q. In fact, you were

supposed to collect the entire visible

stain; isn't that right? "A. I believe so, yes. "Q. And it would be,
and you

were taught, ma'am, to keep swatching

that blood stain until the blood was

completely collected; isn't that

correct? "A. To get as much as

possible, yes." Do you remember that testimony?

A. I believe so.

Q. Did you make any notation, on any document whatsoever that you had
left blood in the Bronco?

A. No.

Q. Incidentally, did you observe any blood stains on the bottom seal
area, on the outside of the Bronco door?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, "which was observed."

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LAMBERT: It's irrelevant; it's observed and not collected.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I do not remember seeing a stain or not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Well, let's look at 24211, line 1.

MR. P. BAKER: 24211?

MR. BLASIER: Yeah.

MR. LAMBERT: Object, Your Honor. It's not inconsistent with what she
just said.

MR. BLASIER: She testified now that she didn't remember one way or the
other.

THE COURT: That's what she says in that transcript.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

THE COURT: It is sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) No stains were pointed out to you on the seal
outside of the Bronco, correct?

A. I can't remember.

Q. Now, the only blood that you observed on the outside of the Bronco
was a speck by the door handle, that was pointed out by Detective
Fuhrman; isn't that correct?

A. As I said, I don't remember which detective pointed it out, but at
that point, I did not know their names.

Q. But a detective --

A. A detective.

Q. -- pointed it out. That's all you observed on the outside of the
Bronco, all the blood?

A. I believe so. I'm not positive. I believe so.

Q. Okay.

Now, I want to ask you some questions about Mr. Simpson's reference
blood vial.

You know what a reference blood sample is, do you not?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. That's blood from the suspect that is then compared to any
biological stains that you might collect, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. That's an extremely important piece of evidence, is it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, as of 5 o'clock on the 13th, you were still at Rockingham,
correct?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. And that was during the execution of the search warrant that day,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And -- and you can refer to your notes, if you like. Do you have
your notes of what you collected on the afternoon?

A. Yes.

Q. You collected -- as of 5 o'clock, you had collected 16 items at
Rockingham that afternoon, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, after 5 o'clock --

By the way, what time did you leave Rockingham after 5:00

A. Let's see. It doesn't have the time that we left.

It wasn't too much later.

Q. Now, I'm not sure. Did you answer my question, you collected 16
items up to that point?

A. Okay.

Q. And the last item, item 16, was just what, in general?

A. Two airline luggage tickets.

Q. Now, you were with Dennis Fung from 5 o'clock until the two of you
left in the crime-scene truck to go back to the lab; isn't that
correct?

A. We were inside Mr. Simpson's house.

Q. And you were with Dennis Fung during that time period, were you
not?

A. Not by his side the whole time, no.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Not by his side the whole time, no.

Q. Do you remember testifying on August 23 of 1994, at page 762, line
24 --

MR. BLASIER: You got that?

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

(Transcript is displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Do you remember being asked this question and giving this answer:
"Q. Were you with Mr. Fung

the entire time after you picked up that

last item at 1700 hours until you

departed for your next designation? "A. I believe I was, yes."

Isn't that what you testified to in August of '94?

A. Apparently, so.

Q. Now, at some time after this testimony in August, and prior to your
testimony in the criminal trial, you became aware that there was an
issue with respect to Mr. Simpson's reference blood being given to
Dennis Fung around that time, correct?

A. I do not recall, no.

Q. At the time of your testimony at the criminal trial in this case,
were you aware that there was an issue with respect to Mr. Simpson's
reference blood and whether it was turned over?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for hearsay; argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I believe hearing something about that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And is it accurate that at the time you testified
at the criminal trial in April of '95, your testimony was that that
you were not with Mr. Fung; that you had your eyes closed when that
happened when the blood vial was transferred from Vannatter to Fung?

A. I was sitting in the living room with the photographer, with the
detectives, and Mr. Fung. When I left them, they were in the kitchen.

Q. Do you remember testifying at page 23970, line 5, when you were
sitting on the couch at the Rockingham location before you left -- I
guess this would have been after 5:11. You answer uh-huh. "Q. Were
your eyes opened or

closed? "A. I believe they were

closed. "Q. At what point did you

close your eyes? "A. Probably the second I sat

down. "Q. Did you fall asleep? "A. No, I wasn't asleep."

Do you remember giving that testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. You have a specific recollection of having your eyes closed in Mr.
Simpson's house, and not seeing Detective Vannatter hand him -- hand
him Mr. Simpson's reference blood.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I do not remember seeing Detective Vannatter give a gray envelope
containing the reference vial to Mr. Fung.

Q. Now, when you left --

MR. BLASIER: Do we have the video?

Q. Now, you said that you were back with a photographer in the living
room on the couch?

A. I might have been in a chair. I don't remember where I was sitting.

Q. Okay.

And the photographer you mean is Mr. Rokahr?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Can we play the video.

MR. P. BAKER: This is Exhibit 939.

MR. BLASIER: 939.

Can you please watch this video.

(The instrument herein referred to as a videotape was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 939.)

(Defendants' Exhibit 939 was played in open court.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That is you and Dennis Fung leaving Rockingham,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And in your right hand, you are carrying a trash bag, correct?

A. Correct.

(Tape concludes playing.)

Q. Did you have any knowledge, at that time, about the content of that
trash bag?

A. It contained the two airline tickets that I believe were in there,
and that was it. I didn't know if anything else was in there.

Q. No one told that you Mr. Simpson's reference blood was in that
trash bag, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you carried it from there to the crime lab?

A. It was unloaded at the crime lab, yes.

Q. What happened to the trash bag after you got to the crime lab?

A. It was placed in the evidence processing room with the rest of the
evidence.

Q. Where in the evidence processing room?

A. On one of the examination tables.

Q. Was the bag still essentially closed?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there anything taken out of the bag that evening?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. So, to your knowledge, whatever was in that bag stayed there that
entire evening while you and Dennis Fung were working on the evidence
samples, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Did you record anything whatsoever on your crime-scene notes on the
13th, indicating that Mr. Simpson's reference blood had been collected
that afternoon?

A. Not -- I don't believe I did on the 13th.

Q. Now, is it accurate that -- that one of the things that you and
Dennis Fung did when you got back to the crime lab, was to process the
various swatches that you had collected here to dry it?

A. Correct.

Q. And where did you do that?

A. In the evidence processing room.

Q. The same room where the plastic bag was?

A. Correct.

Q. And the process that you go through -- why don't you describe the
steps that you go through to convert a swatch or to dry it.

A. Well, -- several criminalists have their own particular technique.
Mr. Fung uses individual glass test tubes, small test tubes, which are
labeled with the item number and the -- for the control, is given its
item number and the letter C, the control swatches.

One item at a time is opened. The individual swatches are put into the
test tubes with their item number on them. They are placed in racks.
They are put in a cabinet to dry overnight.

Q. Is it accurate to say in the test tubes -- there's no top on the
test tube, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Is it accurate to say that all of the stains that you had
collected, both from Rockingham and Bundy, were put into glass vials
in that drying cabinet together, and left there overnight?

A. They were placed in separate areas of the cabinet because -- but
they were placed in the same cabinet.

Q. Now, that night --

By the way, did you process some of those, as well?

A. I believe I started helping, but I ended up labeling the test
tubes.

Q. Okay.

Neither you nor Mr. Fung counted the number of swatches for each stain
that night, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No we did not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You did not sketch the swatches showing their
size, so that you could later look at them to determine whether the
swatches were the same as you had put in the drying tubes, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative and -- argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, we did not measure each swatch.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you didn't take any photographs of any of the
swatches, did you?

A. No, we did not.

Q. It's accurate, is it not, there's no way to tell one swatch from
the other, just by looking at the swatch?

A. That is accurate, yes.

Q. So when you left the crime lab --

What time did you leave that night, the night of the 13th?

A. Oh it's probably close to 8 o'clock.

Q. Okay.

All of the swatches were in open test tubes in the cabinet, in the
same room as the trash bag, presumably with Mr. Simpson's reference
blood, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, the next --

By the way, what's the reason why you dry them?

A. They're dried for final packaging. And after the packaging, they
are processed.

Q. They're dried -- isn't one of the reasons they're dried is, that
preserves them?

A. That, along with the freezing, yes.

Q. All right. And preserves whatever DNA might be in there, correct?

A. DNA and just the stain itself.

Q. Now, the next morning, you and Dennis Fung came into the lab,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And at some point that morning, you became aware of Mr. Simpson's
reference blood being there at the lab, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. By about what time was that?

A. I wouldn't know.

Q. And it was then that you created the first record showing -- from
your crime-scene checklist showing Mr. Simpson's reference blood,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And in your crime-scene checklist, you attempt to enter items
sequentially in the order in which they're collected, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you indicated on the back of your checklist that item 17 was a
pair of tennis shoes, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: And let me put this on the Elmo.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 943 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And item 17, the tennis shoes, those were a pair
of shoes that Detective Lange brought in the morning of the 14th,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. They hadn't been turned in to you?

They weren't turned in to you by Detective Lange the night before,
when you were all at Rockingham, were they?

A. No, they were not.

Q. And you agree that by the time you left, from that period of 5
o'clock, until you guys left, Detectives Lange and Vannatter were both
there, weren't they?

A. There were detectives there. I -- I don't know who was there or
not.

MR. BLASIER: Okay. Can you back up a little.

(Mr. P. Baker complies.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And then you entered in your notes item 18 as the
reference vial, coming after 17, the tennis shoes that weren't turned
in until the 14th, correct?

A. Correct.

THE COURT REPORTER: Does that have a number? Did you mention it?

MR. BLASIER: That's part of --

MR. P. BAKER: 943.

MR. BLASIER: 943.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, the next morning, you had further processing
to do of the various swatches that had come from Rockingham and Bundy,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. The idea of leaving them in there overnight was so they could
completely dry out, so they could be packaged for testing or whatever,
whatever was supposed to be done with them afterwards, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Incidentally, did -- can you look at the screen again.

MR. BLASIER: Do you have the video?

MR. P. BAKER: 228.

MR. BLASIER: 228.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you take a look at this, at that video, tell
us if that's Detective Vannatter walking into Rockingham at about
5:18.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 228 displayed on the Elmo screen starting at
17:17:59, ending at 17:19:23.)

Q. Do you see the people in the background there?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you see Mr. Rokahr there?

A. I -- if I could see his face. I've only seen this today -- first
today, I mean.

MR. BLASIER: Can we see it better?

(Videotape, Plaintiff's Exhibit 228, was rewound, began playing at
17:17:09, and stopped at 17:18:55.)

Q. Do you recognize the bald-headed gentleman there?

A. Actually, there were two there that day.

Q. Mr. Rokahr had a camera with him with a strap over his shoulder?

A. And he usually wore his hat.

Q. Okay.

(Videotape, Defendants' Exhibit 943, was rewound, began playing at
17:18:58, and stopped at 17:19:02.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) There you see the strap over his shoulder?

A. It's a strap, yes, sir.

Q. Mr. Rokahr, if that's Mr. Rokahr, at the time of video, wasn't with
you when your eyes closed in the living room, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, getting back to the morning of the 14th, you and Dennis Fung
retrieved all of the open vials that had the swatches in them from the
drying cabinet, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Incidentally, that cabinet isn't locked, is it?

A. No, it is not.

Q. It's just a cabinet on the wall, isn't it?

A. Correct.

Q. And describe the procedure by which you removed the swatches from
the tubes?

A. Mr. Fung employed just a tapping on the test tube and the swatches
would come out. I used individual disposable glass pipettes to take --
loosen and remove the swatches.

Q. And that was because some of them had dried against the glass of
the tube, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. There was blood on the tube as well as on the swatches?

A. Where they had stuck together, yes.

Q. So when you amudate (sic) the swatches from the vials, you scraped
it with a pipe -- disposable pipette?

A. Not scrape. Just -- you had to touch them and they would.

Q. To get them off of the side of the vial?

A. Correct.

Q. That morning, you still did not count any of the swatches, did you?

A. Correct.

Q. You did not sketch any of the swatches, did you?

A. Correct.

Q. You did not photograph any of the swatches, did you?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, after you -- they were taken out of tubes and you certified
they were dried, they are put in what are called bindles, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And a bindle is like a piece of scratch pad that is folded over, to
contain the swatches from a particular stain, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the bindles that you prepared that morning from the Bundy drops
and the Rockingham drops had your initials on them, according to -- as
required by your procedure, correct?

A. I do not believe there is any procedure about what is put on the
bindles.

Q. The bindles that morning, you put your initials on them, didn't
you?

A. I believed that I had, yes.

Q. And you testified that you had in August of '94 at the hearing that
was held before the trial, correct?

A. I believed that I had my initials on them, yes.

Q. And you found out at some time after that hearing, but before the
criminal trial, that the bindles that were later examined didn't have
your initials on it, didn't you?

A. Correct.

Q. And you then changed your testimony at the criminal trial and said,
maybe you didn't put your initials on it, correct?

A. At the point of the first hearing, I could not remember if I had
put my initials on them or what. I believed that I had at that time.

Q. And that was your best recollection at the time you testified in
August, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Which was less -- we're about months after you had actually done
this, correct?

A. Correct.

THE COURT: Okay. Let's take a ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

I want the jury brought back in ten.

Thank you.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Ms. Mazzola, if you initialed the bindles that you
processed on the morning of the 14th, and later on those bindles did
not have your initials on them, that would indicate that they weren't
the same bindles, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained. You can argue that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you are sure you made sure that those
swatches were all dry at the time that you put them in bindles, on the
morning of the 14th, correct?

A. The ones that I had control over, yes.

Q. And you learned later, that at least one of the bindles, when it
was opened later on showed evidence of a wet transfer on the paper
itself?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you aware of that?

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you ever look at these bindles after they were
prepared on the morning of the 15th?

A. No, I did not.

Q. So you don't have any independent knowledge that the bindles that
were later examined were the same ones that you guys fixed on the
morning of the 14th?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Prepared?

MR. LAMBERT: Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: You can rephrase that, maybe.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You have no personal knowledge that the bindles
that you and Dennis Fung prepared on the morning of the 14th were the
same ones that were later examined by Collin Yamauchi?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection, still argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I do not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, going back to Mr. Simpson's reference blood,
you were ordered at some point to change your paperwork to show that
Mr. Simpson's reference blood should be item 17 rather than 18; isn't
that correct?

A. Mr. Fung told me the tennis shoes had been brought in by Detective
Lange on the 14th, and that they should be given the number later down
the blood vial, what he received the day before.

Q. Is the answer to my question yes, at some point you were directed
to change the number for Mr. Simpson's reference blood from 18 to 17?

A. Correct.

Q. And that was to eliminate the appearance that the blood had been
kept overnight by Detective Vannatter; isn't that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The tennis shoes were brought in after the blood; therefore, they
should have gotten a later number.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Of all of the items that you collected on the 13th
and 14th, was there any other item that you were directed to change
the number on, other than Mr. Simpson's reference blood?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you. That's all I have.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Ms. Mazzola, you were asked a number of questions by Mr. Blasier
about your testimony in August, 1994.

Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. That testimony wasn't during the actual criminal trial, was it?

A. No, it was not.

Q. Was that during some preliminary hearing of some sort?

A. Yes.

Q. And on that occasion, had you had an opportunity to prepare at all
for that testimony?

A. No.

Q. Had you had an opportunity to review your notes?

A. No.

Q. Did you even have your notes with you?

A. No.

Q. So you testified on that occasion without any preparation, and
without any notes; is that right?

A. I did not have any personal notes. I borrowed Mr. Matheson's.

Q. He didn't have all the same things that you have in your notes, did
he?

MR. BAKER: Leading.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did he have all the same things in his notes that
you had in your notes?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: Excuse me. There's an objection.

Foundation. Sustained.

Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did you look at Mr. Matheson's notes a little bit
on the stand that day?

A. On the stand, yes.

Q. Were his notes identical to your notes?

A. He was lacking one sketch.

Q. And were you able, during your testimony to completely review his
set of notes to refresh your recollection about the events during the
evidence collection?

A. Not while I was testifying, no.

Q. Did you later discover that you had made some mistakes during your
testimony, because of your lack of preparation?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Now, in regard to the collection of the evidence
at Rockingham, Mr. Blasier asked some questions about whether Mr. Fung
was supervising you during every swatching of every piece of evidence
that you swatched.

He was present on the premises throughout the time you were working,
wasn't he?

A. Yes, he was present.

Q. And was there also another supervisor from SID present?

A. Towards the end, yes.

Q. That was who?

A. Mr. Steve Johnson.

Q. And what's his position at SID?

A. Assistant laboratory director.

Q. And did he also supervise you, some of the work that you were
doing, or observed?

A. He watched me do one or two towards the end, yes.

Q. And the actual swatching method that you used, using the little
cotton swatches and distilled water and -- and clean tweezers and so
on, is that the same method that you're still using today?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you changed it at all, in any way, since the time you
collected the evidence at Bundy and Rockingham?

A. No.

Q. You're now what level criminalist?

A. Criminalist 2.

Q. And how many crime scenes have you processed since Bundy and
Rockingham?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) The technique -- the swatching technique that you
used in that case, were you careful throughout the time that you did
it?

A. Yes.

Q. Same level of care that you've used on crime scenes since then?

A. Yes.

Q. The -- the -- questions were asked of you about whether you could
specifically remember precisely when you changed your gloves when you
were processing the Bundy crime scene.

Is it your recollection that you changed your gloves more than one
time during that crime scene processing?

A. I know it was more than one time but I can't give you a specific
number.

Q. Do you have a custom or habit of changing gloves often during crime
scene processing?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, leading, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled. You asked on direct exam.

A. You change your gloves so often in the lab, especially where I work
in, we are in gloves almost the entire day. To us, changing gloves is
the same as blinking. We do it, we don't think about doing it, we
don't remember how many times we do it.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And it was your -- was that your custom when you
were doing -- at the time you were doing the blood collection in this
case?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in regard to the blood in the Bronco, there was some questions
about the -- the blood collection on June 14.

Who actually did the swatching on that occasion?

A. Mr. Fung.

Q. So you were just assisting Mr. Fung?

A. Yes.

Q. And was Mr. Fung able to literally swatch up all of the blood that
was visible?

A. No, not all of the blood.

Q. So there was some blood left over after the swatching was done?

A. Yes.

Q. You were also asked some questions about this cabinet in the
evidence processing room that is not locked. That room itself, is it
locked or unlocked?

A. It is locked.

Q. And who has access to it?

A. After hours, the criminalist 2's and above, only, have access.

Q. And other than criminalists within the scientific investigation
division, can any other person get inside that evidence processing
room?

A. No.

Q. Can police officers go in there?

A. No.

Q. So the blood was left overnight in this locked room that only --
only SID personnel, criminalists 2 or above would have access to?

A. Correct.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Finally, you were asked some questions about
whether you took any photographs of the swatches during the time that
you were processing them.

Have you ever, on any of your cases, taken photographs of any of the
swatches?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

Q. Would --

THE COURT: Just a minute.

Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Have you ever taken a photograph of a swatch
during the evidence collection process?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: That's overruled.

A. No, I have never.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Would the failure to take a photograph turn the
swatch from one person's blood into another?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, argumentative.

I'll withdraw it.

THE COURT: Okay.

A. No, it would not.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Have you ever sketched one of the swatches when
you're in the process of doing this evidence collection?

A. No.

Q. Would the failure to sketch one of the swatches turn the blood from
one person's blood into another?

A. No.

Q. And finally, this question about the bindles, whether the swatches
were dry or not, did you do any test to determine if swatches were dry
before you put them into the bindles?

A. No.

Q. Did you see Mr. Fung doing any tests?

A. No.

Q. You just looked at them, if they looked dry, you put them in the
bindles?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Correct.

MR. LAMBERT: No further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Redirect.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Ms. Mazzola, apparently you didn't blink between the knit cap and
the glove, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Now, is it your testimony that since your work in the criminal
case, you still don't sketch swatches?

A. That is correct.

Q. You still don't take pictures of swatches?

A. That is correct.

Q. You haven't changed your technique at all?

A. Not in the collection, no.

Q. And isn't one of the reasons you take pictures, and draw sketches,
so you can demonstrate later that the swatches haven't been tampered
with?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LAMBERT: Says she didn't do it.

THE COURT: Jury to disregard that question. It's argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, let me see if I understand your testimony in
August, two months after you did the work in this case.

You're saying that you've made mistakes because you weren't prepared?

A. I did not refresh my memory at the time, yes.

Q. All right.

Now, you said that you had Greg Matheson's notes, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you looked at them carefully enough to know that they were the
same as yours except one sketch was missing, correct?

A. There were photocopies of the original except the sketch was on the
back of one of the pages and he did not have that.

Q. So you had everything in front of you except one sketch, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you knew that from looking at the notes, that you had
everything there except one sketch, didn't you?

A. As I was being asked the questions and I was trying to answer them,
yes.

Q. What mistakes did you make in August?

A. I didn't have a chance to look at the crime scene photos. Sit down,
go through the notes beforehand to refresh my memory. I was trying to
do that as I was being asked questions by the defense.

MR. BLASIER: Move to strike, nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Denied.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) What mistakes did you make in August?

A. Just whether or not -- where Mr. Fung was at certain times, or if
he picked up one thing and I picked up another.

Q. Any other mistakes?

A. I do not know.

Q. So your testimony that you signed -- that you initialed the
bindles, that was correct, wasn't it?

A. No, it is not.

Q. Oh, it's not correct.

When did you learn that you didn't initial the bindles?

A. After I saw photos and I was told by serology that the bindles did
not have my initials or Mr. Fung's.

Q. So they weren't the same bindles, were they, that you initialed
when you made them?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative, misstates the evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So your reason for thinking that your under-oath
testimony from August was a mistake is because the bindles that were
later examined didn't have your initials on them; is that what you're
saying?

A. That was one of the things.

Q. And now you know for sure that was a mistake, because you saw the
pictures that don't have your initials on them; is that what you're
saying?

A. The bindles that we prepared with the blood swatches did not have
my initials. Initially, I thought that they did. They do not.

Q. And that's all the information you have to conclude that you made a
mistake when you testified under oath in August, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, when you testified in April that Mr. Fung and you collected
all of the blood from the Bronco, had you had plenty of time to
prepare your testimony that time?

A. Yes.

Q. You spent a lot of time with the prosecutors in preparing for your
testimony in April of '95, did you not?

A. Actually not a lot of time, no.

Q. When you testified under oath that you collected the entire visible
stain of every stain that you saw in the Bronco in April, that was the
truth, wasn't it?

A. After you pick up a stain, there's going to be a little bit left
from the water from the swatch. You will not pick up -- it's -- you
will not pick up a stain so it is so clean. You cannot tell if there
was something there before.

Q. Your testimony in April of '95 was the truth, wasn't it?

A. In some parts I was not mistaken; in others I was.

Q. Now -- okay.

So you're saying now that your testimony in April of '95 was a
mistake, the part about you collected everything from the Bronco,
right?

A. We collected representative stains, samples from what we saw.

Q. How did you find out that was a mistake?

A. Perhaps the mistake was saying the word "all."

Q. You thought that was a mistake, because in August of '94 they found
a lot more blood in the Bronco, didn't they?

A. Apparently after they tore the seats out, yes.

Q. That blood wasn't there when you processed that car on the 14th,
was it? MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. We did not tear the seats out of the Bronco. We collected the
stains from what we saw.

Q. The blood -- you did not see any blood consistent with what was
later found in August when you processed that car on the 14th of June
--

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

Q. -- 1994, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER No further questions.

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute.

MR. BLASIER: Oops, wait a minute.

Let me show you 1420.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1420.)

(Exhibit 1420 displayed on the Elmo.)

MR. BLASIER: Can you zoom in on that better.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Ms. Mazzola, when you were done processing the
Bronco on the 14th, and as you testified in April of '95, that blood
was no longer there, was it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection as to foundation of this photograph, Your
Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Well, let's look at what you see here and here was
not there at -- after you finished with the Bronco on the 14th of
June, was it?

A. I do not know.

Q. Did you take any pictures on the 14th?

A. Photos were taken, yes.

Q. Are there any pictures after you were done on the 14th, to your
knowledge, that show the presence of those two stains?

A. Photos were taken before collection, not after.

Q. Oh, so we don't have any pictures after you were done, right?

A. That is correct.

MR. BLASIER: No further questions.

RECROSS-EXAMINATON BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Ms. Mazzola, do you ever take photographs after you finish doing
the evidence collection?

A. No, never.

Q. You take the photographs before the collection?

A. Before, yes.

Q. And one more time, in regard to this Bronco, when you tried to
swatch up the blood, is it -- is it physically possible to clean it
all up just using the swatch technique or does some always remain
left?

A. Some will remain just from the fact that the swatch is damp with
water. You will collect as much as you can on the swatches because
serology needs a lot of sample. There's going to be a little water
mixed with the blood that is left on the surface.

Q. And this collection that you did on the Bronco, this took place
inside the print shed?

A. Yes.

Q. Was it easy to see inside the print shed?

A. No, it was not.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. No further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Let me see if I understand it.

You spent 3 hours on the Bronco, in the print shed, where you couldn't
see it very well; is that your testimony?

A. Flashlights were used by Mr. Fung to go over and identify the
stains that he wanted to collect. Those were the stains that were
numbered, photographed and collected.

Q. No. My question was, is it your testimony, that you just told Mr.
Lambert, that when you processed the Bronco on the 14th for 3 hours,
you couldn't see it very well?

A. We saw it well enough.

Q. Okay.

And you haven't changed a single procedure that you testified to, that
you used in this case, since the Simpson criminal case, have you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: He asked a question about photographs.

THE COURT: You already asked the first time and she said no.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You haven't learned anything from the criminal
case, have you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Who's next?

MR. BLASIER: Under 776 we would call Thano Peratis.

MR. PETROCELLI: 776 is inapplicable.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You may call him as a witness. You may examine him as if he's not in
cross, as if in cross examination. It's not a 776.

MR. BLASIER: 767.

MR. PETROCELLI: We also object to 767.

THE COURT: You may examine as if in cross-examination. You may do the
same.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: Somebody call Mr. Peratis.

(Indicating to bailiff.)

THANO PERATIS, called as a witness on behalf of the Defendants, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be --

THE BAILIFF: Please be seated, sir.

THE CLERK: And, sir, would you please state and spell your name for
the record.

THE WITNESS: Thano Peratis, T-h-a-n-o P-e-r-a-t-i-s.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Peratis, you have some heart problems, do you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

If you need to take a break just say the word, okay?

A. (Nodded affirmatively.)

Q. Can you please tell the folks on the jury what your occupation is?

A. Registered nurse.

Q. And by whom are you employed?

A. City of Los Angeles.

Q. Now, where did you work for the city?

A. Parker Center Jail.

Q. Now, you are a nurse in the county jail, correct?

A. In the city jail.

Q. In the city jail.

How long have you been a nurse overall?

A. Overall, since I was in the navy, I would say approximately 40
years.

Q. All right. You've been a nurse for 40 years approximately?

A. Approximately.

Q. And you went through the required nurses school that allowed you to
become a registered nurse?

A. Yes.

Q. And you did very well at your courses to become a registered nurse,
did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. You were a good student?

A. I should hope so.

Q. Okay.

And of your 40 years as a nurse, how much of that has been with the
city jail?

A. I just completed 33 years.

Q. Okay.

So you have 33 years with the city. Seven years presumably prior to
that you had nursing experience at some other location?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, your job in the jail is a very important one, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. You have a fair amount of responsibility with respect to the
inmates that might be ill or other responsibilities that you have;
isn't that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, during the course of your training, as well as your
experiences as a nurse for 40 years, one of your main responsibilities
as a nurse is measuring things, correct, like medications?

A. Yes.

Q. And it's very important that when you measure a medication for an
inmate or whoever, that you do it precisely, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you pride yourself on being very good at that, don't you?

A. In many occasions, yes.

Q. Now, on June 13 of 1994, you were working in the infirmary, were
you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the afternoon, at approximately 1:30, Mr. Simpson was
brought into the jail infirmary, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And do I have the time right, about 1:30?

You can refer to anything you need to.

A. Brought in 2:25.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. 2:25.

Q. 2:25.

Is it accurate that he was brought into the infirmary for you to do
basically two things: One, draw his blood, and two, examine his
finger, examine the cut on his finger?

A. My first understanding was he was brought in for me to draw some
blood. After I drew the blood, I was asked to treat his finger.

Q. You were asked to examine his finger after you did the blood?

A. To treat it.

Q. Now, prior to the time that you drew Mr. Simpson's blood, you
checked his vital signs, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What did that consist of?

A. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature.

Q. Was his blood pressure a little high?

A. 130 over 90.

Q. That a little bit high?

A. Slightly.

Q. Now, I want to ask you about -- before I ask you about the blood, I
want to ask you about examining his finger.

Detective Vannatter asked you to examine Mr. Simpson's finger,
correct, or his hand?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was asked to check a cut on his finger.

Q. Well, were you asked to check his hand?

A. No.

Q. Do you remember testifying in a deposition in this case?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Page and line?

MR. BLASIER: 86, line 25.

MR. P. BAKER: Which is the depo.

MR. BLASIER: Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Here it is.

MR. BLASIER: Page 86, at the bottom.

MR. PETROCELLI: Through where?

MR. MEDVENE: From where to where, Mr. Blasier?

MR. BLASIER: I'm checking.

Starting at page -- I'm sorry. Line 24 on 86. And I'll read as far as
you want me to.

Where do you want me to stop?

MR. MEDVENE: I want you to go -- pick up 87, line 16, and over on page
89, question 1 through --

MR. BLASIER: I'll to go 16 and then you can do the rest if you want.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recall in the deposition that we took, I
was present? Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Can we have that bigger so we can see it. I can't see it.

Okay. Let's try.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Starting at 86.

Do you remember they -- by the way, you were under oath at that time,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And prior to your testimony in that deposition, you had spent some
time with the plaintiffs' attorneys, had you not? Mr. Medvene?

A. Are you talking about the day of the deposition?

Q. Any time before that.

A. I don't --

Q. I'm sorry?

A. I don't believe so. I can't remember.

Q. Okay.

A. Did I spend any time with them though --

Q. Incidentally, one of the side effects of the heart problems that
you've had is memory loss; isn't that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall being asked by myself,

(Reading:)

Q. At some point you examined

Mr. Simpson's hand, left hand, do you

recall that? A. Yes. Q. Why did you do that? A. Because I was asked
to. Q. Who asked you to? A. I believe it was

Vannatter.

Q. Then there was an objection.

And at line 14 I ask: (Reading:)

At some point were you asked to

do something with respect to

Mr. Simpson's hand or hands?

Q. And then you answered: (Reading:)

Not hand. I may have heard from

Mr. Vannatter -- I put the dressing -- I

went to put a dressing on Mr. Simpson's

arm and he said I don't need that.

Q. Remember that testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Read the next question and answer.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you say that during that deposition?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me.

MR. PETROCELLI: Next question and answer shown on the screen.

MR. BLASIER: You said to 16.

(Reading:)

Q. Who said that? A. Mr. Simpson.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Were you aware at the time of the deposition being
taken, that it was a significant issue with respect to whether you
examined Mr. Simpson hands?

A. I didn't hear you.

MR. MEDVENE: You didn't read the next line.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, you told him line 16 and he read to line 16.
Now you want to do something on your own examination, save it for
there.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Your Honor. He stopped in the middle. It says,
at some point were you asked to do something with respect to Mr.
Simpson's hand or hands, and he said not hand.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, do it on your examination.

MR. MEDVENE: All right.

MR. BLASIER: I thought I read that.

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, commence your examination.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, is it your testimony here today -- well, tell
us what it is you recall today, about what you were asked to do with
respect to Mr. Simpson's hand or finger?

A. I -- After I drew the blood, I heard -- I think it was Mr.
Vannatter, I don't know which one it was, request you take a look at
Mr. Simpson's finger, or words to that effect.

Q. Okay.

A. Would you take a look at his finger.

Q. Okay. All right.

A. Which I did.

Q. And you did that by -- how did you do it?

A. Picking up his hand, looking at his finger, cleaning it off with
some Aqueous Zephrin -- I'm sorry, some Betadine, then I put a
dressing on it, a band-aid.

Q. And you're trained to identify injuries as a nurse, correct?

A. Yeah. Yes.

Q. And the only injury on his hand was the cut on the middle finger,
correct?

A. That's the only place I looked 'cause it was -- that was
specifically mentioned to me.

Q. Okay.

Were you told don't look at his other fingers? I mean his fingers were
attached to the rest of his hand, weren't they?

A. No, I was asked could you please look at that finger, and that's
all. I didn't do any full examination. Mr. Simpson was not under
arrest. I had no doctor there. All I did was just clean off that one
finger, and that was it. I didn't look to see if there was anything
else.

Q. You didn't see anything -- any other --

A. That's all I looked at was that one finger.

Q. Detective Lange was there as well, was he not?

A. Yes.

Q. Neither Detective Vannatter nor Detective Lange directed your
attention to any other injury; is that correct?

A. No, not that I remember.

Q. That's correct?

A. That's correct. I do not remember that happening.

Q. Okay.

Now, I want to ask you some questions about the blood that you drew.

Certainly, would you agree that the security of a reference blood
sample is very important?

A. Yes.

Q. And you know what a reference blood sample is, do you not?

A. A reference blood sample?

Q. That's taken from a suspect.

A. You mean the blood I drew?

Q. Yeah.

And you brought to me yesterday an envelope --

MR. BAKER: It's 2251 I believe.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) A gray envelope that's called an analyzed evidence
envelope, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that envelope sets forth the procedure that's to be used in
drawing somebody's blood, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me show you this first, and we'll put it on the Elmo.

This is one of those envelopes, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And this is 2251 -- let's start at the top.

Now, at the top of this envelope it says analyzed evidence to be
refrigerated.

That is the correct procedure with respect to blood, that it should be
refrigerated, correct?

A. I have nothing to do with that.

Q. Well, I'm asking you if that's the correct procedure, or do you
know?

A. Blood should be refrigerated, yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, foundation.

THE COURT: Excuse me. There's been an objection, lack of foundation.
Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Stricken.

MR. MEDVENE: We'd move to strike the answer.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is blood supposed to be refrigerated?

THE COURT: What was his foundation?

MR. BLASIER: He's a nurse.

THE COURT: So, he's a nurse.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Peratis --

THE COURT: Lay some foundation with regard to, if you're going do
something, about what he's supposed to do or evidence preservation.
There's been no foundation other than he drew blood.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Part of your training as a nurse is to know how to
preserve blood?

A. Nurses don't preserve the blood. We take it to the lab in a general
hospital. We would take it to the laboratory. They would do what they
do with it. We don't keep it.

Q. Okay.

My question is was part of your training as a nurse about
refrigerating blood, that blood should be refrigerated?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Blood to be refrigerated?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: It's a general question, blood should be refrigerated?

MR. BLASIER: Yeah. And he said as he's trained, yes.

THE COURT: What kind of blood?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Blood such as blood drawn that you drew from Mr.
Simpson?

A. Any blood drawn that has to be examined is to be refrigerated.

Q. Okay. Thank you. That wasn't too hard.

Now, it's also required procedure that the person drawing the blood,
meaning you, is to completely fill up the vial, correct?

MR. BLASIER: We're looking at B. Excuse me.

(Exhibit 2251 displayed.)

MR. MEDVENE: That doesn't say that, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) It says the officer requesting withdrawing of the
blood is to tell you to fill up the vial, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, that document speaks for itself, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: It's foundational.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The vial is supposed to be filled up, correct?

A. The vial is supposed to be. Good luck if you can fill the vial up
all the time.

Q. According to procedure on the envelope?

A. According to that, it's supposed to be filled up.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. Does that have a number?

MR. P. BAKER: 2251.

(Exhibit 2251 displayed.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, this might be a good time.

THE COURT: Okay. 1:30, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case, don't form or express any opinion.

(At 12:00 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

THANO PERATIS the witness on the stand at the time of the luncheon
recess, having been previously sworn, was examined and testified
further as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Peratis, at the break, we were talking about
the analyzed evidence envelope. And this appears --

THE WITNESS: I can't hear you.

MR. BLASIER: You can't hear me?

MR. P. BAKER: 2251.

(Exhibit 2251 displayed.)

MR. BLASIER: Can you hear me now, Mr. Peratis?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) At the bottom of this analyzed evidence envelope
is an affidavit, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's to be filled out by the officer, and signed under
penalty of perjury by you, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. At the time the blood is drawn, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the required procedure is that, you fill this out at the time
the blood is drawn, sign it, and put the blood in the envelope and
seal it, correct?

A. I don't put the blood in the envelope; the officer does.

Q. It's required, though, to be sealed when this envelope is filled
out, correct?

A. I fill it out and hand it to the officer.

Q. Okay.

But you see number 4 down here?

"When the affidavit is completed, sign below it as a witnessing
officer and seal the vial in this envelope . . ." so the officer
taking the blood is supposed to do what?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation. The witness said what he
did.

THE COURT: You may inquire as to what he does.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You just -- in this case, did you fill out
affidavit below?

A. What?

Q. Did you fill out the affidavit on the front of the envelope?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you fill it out at the time that the blood was drawn?

A. Just after I drew the blood.

Q. Let's look at 2252. See if you -- can you look back at the TV, Mr.
Peratis, see if you recognize this as --

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, I don't know if the witness can see
from there.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show it to you.

A. I can see it.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So we're sure, let me help you -- show you 2252
that is a photograph of the front of the envelope with Mr. Simpson's
reference -- Mr. Simpson's reference vial was put into, correct?

A. Yes.

(Witness reviews Defendants' Exhibit 2252.)

Q. Mr. Peratis, is it your testimony that -- Withdrawn.

Where did that envelope come from?

A. We have some in the dispensary. And I think that one came from the
dispensary. I'm not sure if it was brought in, or if I had it in the
office. We have them, and some of them were brought in.

Q. Did you ever sign the affidavits in blank?

A. Pardon?

Q. Did you ever -- do you ever sign the affidavits in blank before you
collect the blood?

A. Never.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: You may ask him whether he signed this one in blank.

THE WITNESS: You mean before blood is drawn?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Yeah.

A. No.

Q. Let me show you this one on the Elmo.

You see at the bottom where it's dated, by your signature?

And it's dated.

A. I believe they had the wrong date, the wrong month.

Okay.

Q. Did you fill out the top part where it says Thano Peratis?

A. This is all my writing. That's my printing. This is my printing.
That's my signature. (Indicating.)

Q. You got the correct date in the body of the affidavit, correct
6-13-94?

A. Yes. That's -- I believe that this is the wrong date, put the wrong
one down.

Q. Okay.

Did you fill this all out at one time?

A. Yes.

THE REPORTER: What number is this one?

MR. P. BAKER: 2252.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 2252 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Detective Vannatter did not bring an envelope with
him, did he?

A. That, I can't remember.

Q. Now, the procedure that you used with Mr. Simpson, to draw blood,
was to use a syringe, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And a 10-cc syringe?

A. Yes.

Q. Can we have this as an exhibit by reference?

THE CLERK: By reference?

MR. BLASIER: A number, actually, we can use.

THE CLERK: That would be fine. 2254.

MR. BLASIER: 2254.

(The instrument herein referred to as a syringe was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2254.)

Q. Mr. Elmo [sic], I'm going to put it on the Elmo.

Does this appear to be the type of syringe that you used to draw Mr.
Simpson's blood?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Why don't you zoom in a little.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) It's calibrated, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. It's quite easy to read the quantity of blood in that syringe, is
it not?

A. Yes.

Q. It's calibrated down to -- looks like about two-tenths of a
milliliter, correct?

A. Calibrated down to ten cc's.

Q. But I mean, between one cc and the next cc, it's broken down into
two-tenths of a cc?

A. Two-tenths.

Q. Okay.

And after you drew Mr. Simpson's blood on the 13th, and it was in this
syringe, you transferred it to --

MR. BLASIER: And I need another number, Erin.

THE CLERK: 2255.

(The instrument herein referred to as An EDTA tube with a purple top
on it was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2255.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) 2255, which is called a purple-top EDTA tube?

A. Correct.

Q. That's what we have here on the Elmo, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's a vial that has a preservative in it known as EDTA,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The purpose of putting it in that kind of tube is to keep the blood
from coagulating, right?

A. It preserves it.

Q. Okay.

Incidentally, you provided me with the syringe and the vacutainer
yesterday?

A. Yes.

Q. It's called a --

A. I'm sorry. I provided you with about three syringes there.

Q. Okay.

But the one we have up here is the size that you used, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it's called a vacutainer because there's actually a vacuum in
that purple-top vial, is there not?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: You can take it down.

(Referring to Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, when you drew Mr. Simpson's blood on the
13th, isn't it accurate that you drew between 7.9 and 8.1 cc's of
blood?

A. At the time I drew the blood, that's what I thought I had drawn.

Q. Okay.

A. At that time.

Q. Now, you were asked to testify at the grand jury hearing in this
case, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that took place sometime within a couple weeks of your drawing
Mr. Simpson's blood, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you testified in front of the grand jury, Marcia Clark was
asking you questions, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were answering those questions to the best of your ability?

A. Yes.

Q. And you testified, did you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality. It's not inconsistent,
to the best of my knowledge, what they're going to read. It's hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is it your testimony today that you withdrew 7.9
to 8.1 cc's of blood?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

That the grand jury -- do you recall being asked the following
questions and giving the following answers:

I'm referring to page 370, line 23. Start at line 26.

Do you recall being asked this question at the grand jury: "Q. Can you
describe for us

what is the method by which you removed

blood from Mr. Simpson. "A. I put a tourniquet on his

forearm, cleaned the site with aqueous

zephrin and put a 10-cc syringe with

about a number 20 needle in the vein in

his arm. And I withdrew about 8 cc's of

blood."

Is that what you testified to?

A. I don't remember it, but if it's on there, I must have.

Q. And do you also recall testifying, starting at line 10, you were
asked again by Marcia Clark: "Approximately how much blood did you
remove?"

And you answered, "approximately 8 cc's," correct?

A. Again, I don't remember that.

It had to be there. I had to have done it, but I don't remember that.

Q. And there was only about a two- or three-week period of time from
the time you drew the blood, until you testified about the size of the
needle, the size of the syringe, and how much you withdrew at the
grand jury, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Then shortly after that -- shortly after that, you testified at the
preliminary hearing in the Simpson case, did you not?

You remember testifying at the preliminary hearing?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Shapiro was asking you questions at that time, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that, too, was in early July of 1994, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Within just a couple of weeks of your drawing Mr. Simpson's blood,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And incidentally, you didn't have any heart problems between the
13th, when you drew his blood, and when you testified at the grand
jury and at the preliminary hearing, did you?

A. Oh, I have been having heart problems for 20 years.

Q. Now, I'm saying between those two periods of time, you didn't have
a heart attack, did you?

A. No.

Q. And how long had it been prior to June 13th that you had a heart
attack?

A. June 13.

Q. 1994?

A. 1994.

I had the heart attack in 1995, June.

Q. But I'm talking about prior to June of '94.

A. No.

Q. You hadn't had one for a while, had you?

A. No.

Q. Now, do you remember being asked the following question: Question
by Mr. Shapiro and giving the following answer that I'm referring to
page 25 line 8. By Mr. Shapiro, "Q. How much blood did

you withdraw from Mr. Simpson. "A. Approximately 8

cc's.

MR. BLASIER: Can you put this on the Elmo, please.

"Q. When you say

approximately, you did not measure the

amount. "A. Where well it

could have been 7.9 or it could have

been 8.1. I just looked at the syringe

and it looked at about 8 cc's I withdraw

the needle from his arm.

Do you remember testifying that way in the preliminary hearing?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was the state of your recollection, when you testified
under oath, about three weeks after drawing Mr. Simpson's blood,
correct?

A. At that time.

Q. That you had looked at the syringe. The calibrated syringe,
correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection?

A. I never looked at the calibrations of the syringe.

Q. You remember testifying that I just looked at the syringe?

A. I -- Well, I looked at the syringe I didn't look at the
calibrations.

Q. Okay. And your best recollection at that time, your experience as a
nurse when you drew between 7.9 and 8.1 cc's correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. Now at some point after your sworn testimony at the
grand jury and the preliminary hearing, you became aware of an issue
with respect to whether blood was missing from that vial, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was about the time of the opening argument in the criminal
case, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you found out that Mr. Cochran had stated in his opening
statement that there was about 1.5 to 2 cc's of blood missing from Mr.
Simpson's reference vial, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And by the way, how did you find that out?

A. A friend of mine called me, told me.

Q. Did you watch that opening statement on television?

A. I didn't watch any of the trial.

Q. You didn't watch any of the trial at all?

A. None of it except --

Q. Did you have a TV set up in your infirmary to watch the trial?

A. There was a TV set up. I never watched it.

Q. Now, after you found out that there was an issue about missing
blood, you became very concerned, did you not --

A. Yes.

Q. -- about whether that had been a screw-up on your part?

A. Yes.

Q. Correct.

So you set about to determine whether or not you had made a mistake
about how much blood you drew, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you tried to recreate what you did when?

A. About two or three days later.

Q. After the opening statements?

A. Yes.

Q. And you changed your testimony, did you not, or you changed your
position and gave a different amount that you drew, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Gave where?

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. After you found out that that was an important issue, you changed
your story, didn't you?

A. When I found out I was wrong, I changed my story.

Q. And you told someone at the D.A.'s office, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And to your knowledge, they told us, right?

A. I -- What?

Q. They told us?

A. I told you.

Q. You remember myself and Mr. Neufeld and Joe Ellen Dimitri, us
coming over to your infirmary to talk to you about that?

A. Yes.

Q. We made an appointment in advance, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Peratis, don't you remember, as we walked in, you had a big
television set there, with the trial on, and you made a comment, "Gee,
I just saw you guys on television."

MR. MEDVENE: Relevancy, immaterial.

THE WITNESS: The television was on.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember that?

A. The --

Q. You can answer.

A. The television was on. I may have seen you there.

I was never -- I wasn't watching the trial. Maybe I would glance up
once in a while. When I'm at work, I'm too busy to watch television.

Q. I'm sorry. Are you done?

A. I said when I'm at work, I'm too busy to watch television.

Q. When you were testifying at the preliminary hearing, that was on
television, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you made it a point to videotape your own testimony, did you
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you showed it to a bunch of your friends, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. At any time you viewed that videotape prior to the time that you
found out there was an issue about missing blood, did you ever tell
any of your friends or anybody, "Gee, I made a mistake; I really
didn't draw 7.9 to 8.1 cc's of blood."?

A. The minute I heard about it. And I --

Q. I'm talking --

A. Maybe I misunderstood your question.

Q. Before you found out that that was an important issue in the
criminal case, did you tell anyone, after reviewing your videotape
with your friends, or at any other time, "Gee, I made a mistake; I
really didn't draw approximately 8 cc's."?

A. I think the only people I told were you, and Mr. Neufeld and the
D.A.

Q. Okay.

So prior to learning from Mr. Cochran's opening statement, you didn't
tell anybody that you'd made a mistake, did you?

A. No.

I didn't know I had made a mistake.

Q. Now, at some time in 1995, you did have a heart attack, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was when?

A. About June 1 -- 1st of June.

Q. And you were not actually called as a witness to testify at the
criminal case, correct?

A. Yes; I had a subpoena.

Q. You were -- you weren't called to testify as a witness, though,
were you?

A. No.

Q. Now, after your heart attack in June of 1995, you experienced
problems with memory loss, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was after that time that you had an interview with Mr.
Goldberg, where you tried to recreate how much blood of Mr. Simpson
you'd actually drawn, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And your recollection of those events, when you made that -- did
that interview with Mr. Goldberg, was not nearly as fresh as they had
been two and three weeks after you actually drew the blood; isn't that
correct?

A. I would say so.

Q. So certainly, your best recollection of how much blood you drew was
from two and three weeks after you drew the blood, as opposed to after
you had your heart attack; isn't that correct?

A. I didn't quite understand the question.

Q. Your best recollection of how much blood you drew, would have been
two or three weeks after you drew it, when you testified twice under
oath that it was about 8 cc's, correct?

A. Well, I -- I remember drawing the blood. That's -- the 8 cc's, I
know I was wrong. I can't say that -- I mean, you've got me all
confused now.

Q. Okay.

After your heart attack, and after you had an interview with Mr.
Goldberg, what was your statement as to how much blood you had
actually drawn?

A. Approximately six and a half cc's, after I found out, and I told
Mr. Goldberg.

Q. It was six to six and a half, wasn't it?

A. Six to six and a half.

Q. And it accounted exactly for the amounts that Mr. Cochran had
described as being missing from Mr. Simpson's reference vial during
his opening statement in the criminal trial; isn't that correct?

A. I guess so.

Q. Incidentally, Mr. Goldberg was a prosecutor in the criminal case,
was he not?

A. Pardon?

Q. Mr. Goldberg was a deputy D.A. in the criminal case, was he not?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

THE COURT: Cross. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Peratis.

Were you told how much blood to draw on June 13, by Detective
Vannatter?

A. No.

Q. By Detective Lange?

A. No.

Q. By anyone?

A. No.

Q. Were you told to take any particular amount for dosage purposes?

A. No.

Q. Were you trying, at the time, to draw a specific amount, a specific
number of cc's?

A. Not really.

Q. Now, on June 13, immediately after drawing Mr. Simpson's blood, did
you measure the amount that you drew?

A. No.

Q. Did you write down any amounts that you drew?

A. No.

Q. Do you have any general practice, in drawing blood, to write down
the amount that you draw?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Now, when you drew the blood from Mr. Simpson, can you explain to
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how you inserted the needle and
where the calibration was when you inserted the needle and drew the
blood.

A. Insert -- inserting the needle, you have a bevel. You want the
bevel up, so you can see where you're going.

Okay. Now, as I inserted, when I had the bevel up, the calibration is
on the bottom. So when I inserted the needle, I couldn't see what I
was drawing.

And then when I was -- I was drawing the blood back, at a certain
point, it -- it -- the blood stopped, which means that the wall of the
vein hit the bevel of the needle.

You can turn the syringe and draw more, which, in my opinion, could
cause damage to the vein, so I didn't do that.

I just looked -- it looked like it was enough blood to test. I said,
"Officers, is this enough?"

I heard a yes. I withdrew the needle, and immediately put a sponge on
Mr. Simpson. Immediately, I took the syringe and put it in a
vacutainer, and it sucked in the blood.

I threw out the syringe in a place -- in a decontaminated spot, where
we throw all our syringes.

Q. So are you saying, as you were drawing the blood, before you filled
the vial, the blood stopped going into the vial because it hit the
vein?

A. The blood --

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. (Continuing.) The blood was coming into the syringe, but at a
certain point, apparently the wall of the vein hit the needle.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Move to strike.

A. (Continuing.) The blood stopped --

MR. BLAZIER: He's speculating.

THE COURT: Overruled.

That seems to be one of the things he does for a living.

A. (Continuing.) The blood stopped --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) The blood stopped while you were drawing?

A. -- coming into the syringe. I could have possibly pulled more by
turning the syringe. That can cause trauma to the vein. We don't want
to do that.

We had enough blood, so I withdrew the needle, put a sponge on Mr. --
put a sponge on Mr. Simpson's arm, and taped it, took the syringe, and
immediately stuck the needle into the tube. The tube sucked the blood.

Q. Let me --

A. I -- can I demonstrate that? It would be a lot easier than saying
it.

I'm not going to do any sticking; I'll just show you what I did.

Q. I understand. He's only going to put before you what's been marked
2254 --

MR. PETROCELLI: And 55.

Q. -- Which is the syringe.

MR. PETROCELLI: 55.

Q. And 2255, which has the purple top. And ask, with the Court's
permission, if you might stand. If you feel up to that, and show the
jury exactly what you did, and explain to them, let's say, with my
arm, if you want, where the calibration was.

A. May I take this off?

Q. Yes, sir.

(Witness removes purple top.)

Q. Can you show this to the jury?

A. Yes, sir.

Here, when I talk about the bevel of the needle -- (indicating to the
jury) -- being up so I can see it --

Q. You have to speak up.

A. So I could see the bevel.

See how the bevel is there? You always want to watch that.
(Indicating.)

THE COURT: Show the jurors at the other end, too.

THE WITNESS: You see the calibrations were at the end, too.

THE COURT: I don't think all the jurors can see a bevel that size.

MR. MEDVENE: You want to stand that close.

THE COURT: Unless you want to put it on the Elmo.

THE WITNESS: We draw the blood.

THE COURT: Just show them the bevel first.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, okay.

Here's the bevel.

MR. MEDVENE: Show the other jurors the bevel.

Everybody see?

(Witness approaches the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. Don't talk to the jury; just show them the bevel.

Can all the jurors at the far end, can you see the bevel that the
witness referred to as the bevel?

JURORS: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, would you now describe what you did. You
describe the bevel.

A. I inject it into the arm.

Q. You injected it into the arm, and then what did you do?

A. I put the needle in the arm. When I knew I was in the vein, I
started pulling the blood out.

Q. And then what happened?

A. At about this point (indicating) somewhere around this point, it
stopped.

I could have done this. (Indicating.)

Q. You could have turned to the right?

A. Yes, which might have hurt, harmed a vein. We had enough blood, so.
. .

Q. You had enough blood. How did you know you had enough?

A. You have enough blood when you have that much? (Indicating.)

Q. Did you ask the officers if you had enough blood?

A. I asked the officer, does it look like we've got enough blood that
you guys want?

Yes. You can do DNA in that small amount. (Indicating)

Q. So the officer said yes.

Then what did you do?

A. So I withdraw the syringe, put a band-aid on Mr. Simpson's arm, and
then took -- put this back on (indicating to purple cap.) Took this.

Q. By "taking this," you mean?

A. Took the vacutainer and stuck the needle -- I'm not going to stick
it in there, but I jabbed it right in there. There's a vacuum in
there, and it sucks the blood right in.

As soon as I did that, without looking at this anymore, I took the
syringe and deposited it into a receptacle we have for contaminated
syringes, handed this to the officer -- that's the vacutainer I handed
to the officer.

Q. Mr. Peratis, or Nurse Peratis, I want to ask you one other
question.

Could you show the jury the position of the calibration as you were
putting the needle into Mr. Simpson's arm.

A. The calibrations are here. (Indicating to syringe.)

Q. You're pointing to the top, or where the calibrations are?

A. Okay. I was putting the needle in Mr. Simpson arm in this way.
(Indicating.)

Q. By the way, were the calibrations down?

A. The calibrations were down, because the bevel was up, you have to
watch the bevel when -- when you go into a vein.

Q. And then when you removed the needle, did you turn the syringe over
to look at the calibrations?

A. No.

Q. Did anybody ask you to?

A. No.

Q. Now, incidentally, do you ordinarily use a syringe?

A. No.

Q. What did you ordinarily use to take blood at the dispensary?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled?

A. I use a vacutainer, which they have over there.

Q. Excuse me?

MR. BLASIER: Irrelevant. He didn't do it this time.

THE COURT: Just show him what a vacutainer is.

A. No, this is the vacutainer, too. The vacutainer is that -- that
thing that it goes into.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

A. (Continuing.) I believe I gave you one. It's in that little pile.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant. He didn't use it.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, if you're going to go into this, I'm going to
let them go into collection techniques.

MR. MEDVENE: If we ask about the vacutainer?

MR. BLASIER: Withdrawn.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: You're the judge.

(Laughter.)

MR. BAKER: Go ahead, Ed, go ahead.

(Laughter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: No thanks.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Why did you use the syringe in this case?

A. On certain people, I make an evaluation on an arm, and when certain
people are pretty muscular, the veins are a little hard to get, and
it's a little hard to control with the vacutainer, and it's easier to
control with the syringe.

Q. Is it -- is it correct, sir, that you use the syringe very
infrequently to draw blood?

A. That's correct.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And is it accurate that you don't and haven't
measured how much blood you draw when you do -- presently use the
syringe?

A. We never measure blood.

Q. Now, let's go to the experiment that you discussed with Mr.
Blasier.

Did anyone from the District Attorney's office ask you to do any
experiment of any kind to see how much blood you drew to get an exact
amount?

A. At my home, yes.

Q. Prior to that?

A. No.

Q. Did you do the experiment, yourself, prior to seeing anyone from
the D.A.'s office?

A. Yes; I did one, did it myself first.

Q. Okay.

A. Then --

Q. Let's start there.

Did anyone ask you to do that experiment that you say you did first?

A. No. I just took it on my own to do it.

Q. Why?

A. Well, after I heard -- after I heard what I heard about the blood
missing, I put 8 cc's in one of these things to see what it looked
like, and it was more than what it looked like I had -- I handed to
them.

So I withdraw some blood until it looked like what I had I handed to
them, and it came out within -- between that six and six and a half
cc's, which I just measured. I was just drawing one cc at a time out,
until it looked like what it was.

But it was still an estimation.

Q. And how did you do the measurements?

What did you physically do?

Did you take a cc and drop it in a certain amount at a time?

A. Okay.

I pulled up 8 cc's of water. I squirted it into that. Like, it was too
much. I pulled out one cc, dumped it out. Pulled out another cc,
dumped it out. And it looked like between there.

After I took it out, the 2 cc's, it looked like a little bit more than
6 cc's. I estimated about six and a half cc's, and that was it.

Q. Now, when you gave the testimony that was read to you at the
preliminary hearing about the 8 cc's, you also said at that time that
nobody asked you to take a precise amount of blood; isn't that
correct.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Improper impeachment.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BLASIER: It's not impeaching; it's improper.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. You also said at that time when you talked about how much blood you
thought you withdraw, that nobody had asked you to take out a precise
amount of blood; isn't that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that you didn't record the amount of blood you withdrew; isn't
that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, why -- why did you give that estimate, then, that you gave
about the 8 cc's, and tell us now you think it was six, six and a
half, did you ever measure before, for example, to see if it was 8
cc's?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Have you ever, prior to the time you testified at
the preliminary hearing and the grand jury, had you ever measured the
amount of blood that you would withdraw from someone's arm?

A. No.

Q. Never?

A. Never.

Q. Why did you say the amount that you said?

A. Up to this time, I think that anyone that would draw blood, if they
were asked that question, think of 8 cc's as about the amount that we
draw. And that is about the first thing they think. And that was the
first thing that came out of my mouth. The correct answer at that time
should have been, "I don't know how much I drew."

Q. Why would that have been the correct answer? Because you didn't
know?

A. No, I didn't, really; didn't really know; it was a guess. It was an
educated guess, you might say. I happened to be wrong in that case.
Many times I would have been right.

Q. Because sometimes it's one amount and sometimes it's another?

A. Yes.

Q. And after -- And so that the record's clear, you went through and
performed the test, and for the first time, actually measured, or
attempted to measure how much blood you withdrew, and you did that on
your own?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was after that, that you shared this information with Mr.
Blasier and another defense counsel, Mr. Neufeld, and Ms. Joanne
Dimitri; they're jury consultants. You did that?

A. Yes.

Q. You told them exactly?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also then had occasion, for the first time, to tell Mr.
Goldberg, the District Attorney?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: That's a question. Overruled.

I take it that's a question.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You then told Mr. Goldberg?

A. I had told Mr. Goldberg, but I hadn't shown him before I showed it
to Mr. -- Mr. Goldberg at my home. [sic]

Q. Okay. Let me move then, if I can, to the cut on the middle finger,
the left hand.

Mr. Blasier had read you certain portions of the transcript. And if I
might, Your Honor, I'd just like to read three brief portions to put
that portion in context, if I might, from the deposition transcript,
the questioning by Mr. Blasier.

THE COURT: Okay, go ahead.

MR. BLASIER: What page?

MR. MEDVENE: At page 87, I'm going to read from line 14, through page
88, line 1. I believe Mr. Blasier read up to line 19, but to put it in
context, I'll read that whole section.

At some point -- A question by Mr. Blasier: "Q. At some point, were
you

asked to do something with respect to

Mr. Simpson's hand or hands? "A. Not hand. I -- I may

have heard from Mr. Vannatter. I put

the dressing -- I went to put a dressing

on Mr. Simpson's arm and he said, I

don't need that. So . . . "Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Who

said that? "A. Mr. Simpson. I wanted to

put a pressure dressing. He said he

didn't need it. So I heard a voice -- I

thought it was Phil, but it may not have

been -- 'do you mind checking his

finger,' or words to that effect."

At page 89 lines -- line 1, through page 90, I believe, line 4. "Q.
(BY MR. BLASIER)

Somebody said do you mind checking his

finger? What's your best recollection of

the exact words that were used? "A. 'Could you take a look at

the finger,' something like that. "I can't -- You know, it

was just in passing. And I said 'sure.'

All I did was take a look at it and kind

of, like a courtesy I'd give to any

officer that's cut or something, just

gave it a -- cleaned it off and dressed

it. "Q. When you heard someone

say, 'will you take a look at his

finger,' did you say anything? "A. I think I said yes. "Q. Did anyone
tell you which

finger to look at? "A. Not that I know. I

think -- Which finger are -- are -- are

we talking about? I don't know how it

got that -- Maybe Mr. Simpson had me

look at his finger or whatever. I just

looked at it. I mean, it was there. I

looked at it. "Q. Did you look at his hand? "A. No. "Q. How did you
know which

finger to look at, if you know. "A. It was obvious. You

could see it was obvious. "Q. How was it obvious? "A. It was a -- it
was a --

looked like a kind of older -- an old

scratch or old cut, looked like a little

skin had been kind of scraped off." And

then "(Indicating.)"

And then counsel makes reference or says, "The witness is pointing to
the middle finger of the left hand when he was describing the finger
Mr. Simpson showed him. " "Q. Now, when you said it

looked like an old cut, what did you

mean? "A. It could have been

something about 12, 24 hours old. It's

a little hard to judge those things.

And then two other quick portions at page 94, lines 15 through 18. "Q.
Were you looking --

MR. BLASIER: Mr. Medvene, can I have a chance to look?

MR. MEDVENE: Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

MR. BLASIER: 15 to when?

MR. MEDVENE: 15 to 18.

MR. BLASIER: I would object. It's not impeaching.

MR. MEDVENE: The question is, were you looking at his hand?

MR. BAKER: Wait. We object.

THE COURT: Just a minute.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

MR. BLASIER: I'd object. It's not impeaching.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's rehab.

MR. MEDVENE: It's rehabilitation for what Mr. Blasier said. It's
putting in context what Mr. Blasier read.

THE COURT: Go ahead and read it.

MR. MEDVENE: (Reading:) "Q. Were you looking at his

hand when you cleaned the finger? "A. Only the finger that I

was cleaning."

And the last portion, at page 94, line -- looks like 25 through page
96, line 1. "Q. Because you didn't

observe anything else that required any

kind of medical attention; is that

right? "A. I -- I didn't look."

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further. Thank you very much, Mr. Peratis.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Peratis, when you were looking at Mr. Simpson's middle finger,
where were his other fingers?

A. Pardon?

MR. MEDVENE: Asked and answered.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Where were the other fingers?

A. On his hand.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. MEDVENE: What we did, Your Honor, was just read in other sections
of the deposition. We didn't ask him specific questions to put what
Mr. Blasier read in context.

Mr. Blasier, I believe, asked his question in substance on his direct
examination. We didn't ask any questions; what we did was just read in
portions of the deposition.

MR. LEONARD: Move to strike.

THE COURT: What are you doing?

MR. LEONARD: Move to strike.

THE COURT: Motion is denied.

What do you want?

MR. MEDVENE: We're objecting on the basis that it's improper redirect,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Go ahead and examine him, Mr. Blasier.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you make a conscious effort not to look the at
fingers right next to the one you were examining?

A. No.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

Now, is it your testimony that 10 cc syringes always comes with a
bevel facing away from the calibration?

A. No.

Q. They come all different ways, don't they?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, by the way, the little demonstration you did with the jurors,
had you practiced that with Mr. Medvene?

A. With who?

Q. Mr. Medvene.

A. No.

Q. Or anyone else?

A. No.

Q. Have you tried to be completely fair and impartial to both sides
here?

A. I am very much trying to be impartial.

Q. Okay.

Now, are you telling us that now, two and a half years later, you have
a specific recollection of which side the bevel on the needle was when
you withdrew Mr. Simpson's blood?

A. All -- the only reason I have the -- that recollection is that the
bevel -- had the calibrations been facing up to the bevel, I would
have seen it. I was seeing how much blood I had drawn, I would have
noticed it. But it's like this (indicating to syringe.)

Q. My question is, two and a half years after you drew this blood, are
you saying you have a specific recollection as to which side the bevel
on the needle was?

A. No, I'm not. I'm just saying that I had the bevel up. All right?

Q. Okay.

A. Now that's --

Q. That's because you always do it that way?

A. All right.

Now, if the bevel were up and the calibrations were up where the bevel
was, I would have seen it.

Q. You would have seen how much blood you drew, correct?

A. Yes. But it wasn't that way; otherwise, I would have seen it.

Q. And when you testified just a couple weeks later that it was 7.9 to
8.1, that was based on your looking at the calibrations, wasn't it?

A. No. That was based on a guess, just a guess that was it.

Q. Do you recall in your deposition, page 67, line 13, being asked the
following questions: And this was under oath, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. Just a few months ago, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. (Reading.) "Q. Did you look at where the

bevel was when you took Mr. Simpson's

blood? "A. Yes. "Q. Where was it in relation

to the calibrations? "A. I don't know.

Were you telling the truth when you said that?

A. I don't know.

Q. Okay.

But that's the truth?

A. I'm surmising that it was the other way, because otherwise, I would
have seen the blood.

Q. And the reason you said it was 7.9 to 8.1 cc's under oath, was
because that's what you all think you draw; was that your testimony?

A. That's about what everyone thinks they have drawn, and it's wrong.

And I believe I told you at the deposition I was wrong; I should not
have made that statement, that's on the deposition.

Q. Now, I think you just said to Mr. Medvene that sometimes you draw
one amount and sometimes you draw a different amount?

A. We do. The ideal amount that we think we draw is about 8 cc's.

Now, that is wrong.

And I don't think any nurse in their right mind will ever say that
again, when they say see what I'm going through;

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) This was the most memorable blood you had ever
drawn in your career; isn't that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you testified at the preliminary hearing, you told the
truth, didn't you?

A. Well, I told what I thought was the truth at that time.

Q. And that was your best recollection of the truth at that time,
correct?

A. That's right.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. MEDVENE: Just one question, Mr. Peratis.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. When you say the ideal amount is whatever it is in this case, prior
to drawing out the ideal amount, isn't it correct that the blood
stopped coming in because the needle hit the vein?

A. I'm surmising that's the reason. It could have been a clot, too.

Q. Right. But the blood stopped coming?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you stopped taking any more blood from Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you. Nothing further.

MR. BLASIER: Wait a second.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Are you saying now that you remember the bevel causing the vein to
collapse to the point where you couldn't get any more blood?

Do you remember that now?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Misstates -- he didn't say the vein collapsed.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Go ahead and inquire.

A. The bevel, when you're pulling blood, the bevel can suck a portion
of the vein into it, and it stops the blood.

Q. Are you saying that now you have a specific recollection of that
happening?

A. I don't know if that's what caused it. I know the blood stopped.
I'm surmising it was either that or a clot.

Q. Incidentally, you weren't the one that told -- you didn't call the
defense when you realized that your testimony under oath was
incorrect, did you?

A. I called the -- I called the --

Q. The D.A.?

A. The prosecution.

Q. And they called us because they had to, right?

A. I don't know if they called you.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation.

A. I talked to you. You're the ones that called me.

Q. To set up an appointment, after you told the D.A., right?

A. Yes, I told the D.A. first.

Q. That's all I ask.

THE COURT: Last volley.

MR. MEDVENE: Last question, Your Honor.

FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. And your explanation that the blood stopped coming at Mr. Simpson's
arm and your explanation of why you gave, under oath, to Mr. Blasier,
prior to this date; isn't that true?

A. I didn't understand the question.

Q. You told Mr. Blasier exactly what you told this jury about the
blood stopping when you were drawing it from Mr. Simpson, in the
middle of your drawing it; isn't that true?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you. Nothing further.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. When you were testifying in your deposition, you were surmising?

A. Pardon?

Q. When you were testifying in your deposition you were just
surmising?

MR. MEDVENE: Surmising what? Vague, ambiguous.

MR. BLASIER: That the blood stopped.

A. Surmising.

MR. BLASIER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Okay, you're excused.

MR. PETROCELLI: You're excused,

MR. PETROCELLI: You're excused. Thank you.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I would move in 2251, 2252, 2254 and 2255.

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2251 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2252 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2254 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

(The document previously marked Defendants' Exhibit 2255 for
identification, was received in evidence.)

THE COURT: Just a minute.

MR. KELLY: I wanted to move in 821.

THE CLERK: Wait. Wait. Hold on.

Sorry. Go ahead.

MR. KELLY: 821, the video from Mr. Vannatter's testimony.

MR. BAKER: Which one is that?

I object to that, Your Honor. There's no foundation for that video.

THE COURT: I said I'll wait until you lay a foundation.

Okay. 1:30 -- ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case.

(Recess.)

MR. BLASIER: Thank you.

Under 767, we would recall Gregory Matheson.

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

Can you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Gregory Matheson. GREGORY MATHESON, called as a witness
on behalf of the Defendants, having been previously sworn, testified
as follows: DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Matheson, you have, during the course of your work in this case
examined business records of the police department SID division with
respect to withdrawals of blood from Mr. Simpson's reference vial,
have you not?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And you testified, I think already, that on June 14th or 13th,
approximately 1 milliliter was withdrawn by Colin Yamauchi to prepare
a Fitzco card, correct? Do you remember that?

A. Either the 13th or the 14th.

Q. And by the way, 1 milliliter is the same as 1 cc, is it not?

A. Basically, yes. There's some slight difference, depending on what
the liquid is. They're basically the same.

Q. And you have also reviewed records of the SID division indicating
that as of June 20, when Mr. Simpson's reference vial went to
toxicology, there was 5.5 milliliters left in it?

A. According to their record, yes.

Q. And there are no records of any other withdrawals between when the
blood was taken by Thano Peratis and when it went to toxicology on the
20th other than Mr. Yamauchi taking 1 milliliter, correct?

A. I believe that's correct, yes.

Q. Let me show you what's previously been marked as 259.

(The instrument herein described as a stack of photocopies of a report
and worksheets prepared by Gregory Matheson was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 259.)

Q. And what -- why don't you tell us what that is.

A. This is a stack of photocopies with the top three pages being
photocopies of an analyzed evidence report that I prepared associated
with this case, and the remaining pages being a variety of serology
case summary sheets, worksheets electrophoresis worksheets, that type
of thing.

Q. And the sheets following the third one are basically the worksheets
that led to the conclusions that you stated in the top three pages; is
that fair to say?

A. That's correct.

Q. And looking at the board over here, this is simply a blow-up of the
first page of that document, correct?

A. It's a blow-up of the page, but there's some additional writing
that appears on my copy that does not appear on the blow-up. That's
been crossed off.

Q. Okay.

As to this, what appears to be a post-it on it, it says "problem, no
match to anyone," that is on the paperwork that's already been
introduced, correct?

A. That, yes, it's on the photocopy that I have in front of me.

Q. And what this note relates -- what this note relates to is finding
blood type, or an EAP type under Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernails
that did not match Mr. Simpson, Ms. Brown Simpson or Mr. Goldman,
correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, calls for speculation, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, this particular note, I don't recognize the handwriting and I
didn't place it on there.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay.

Did you -- it's on your lab's records. Do you have any idea who put
that there?

A. There's been many copies of the records that have gone to a lot of
other places. I don't know when this was photocopied.

Q. Okay.

Would you agree that the results that you found for the EAP marker
reveal an EAP type under Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernails that is
not consistent with either her, Ron Goldman or O.J. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. And if we look at the second page of that -- this document, that's
represented by items 84A and B, correct?

A. It's -- 84A and B are the right and left fingernail scrapings. The
page that's on the video monitor up here shows the results columns of
the analysis.

Q. Okay.

And in 4A and B, those are the fingernail scrapings from Nicole Brown
Simpson. I'll represent that to you. The type of that you've indicated
here by a B that is the EAP genetic marker, is it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And Nicole Brown Simpson is what type?

A. Either -- if you can either go to -- or if I can refer to my notes
or the --

Q. Sure.

A. -- the one that you gave me.

Q. Go ahead and refer to your notes.

A. Okay.

According to my notes, the EAP type for Nicole Brown is EAP type BA.

Q. And for Mr. Simpson?

A. He is also a type BA.

Q. And Mr. Goldman?

A. An EAP type A.

Q. Now, you also found an EAP type B for an item 118A, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that was a knife found sometime after the murders, that had
blood on it with that EAP type, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, you testified fairly extensively about these typing results at
the criminal trial, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you indicated on the third page of your results with respect to
the fingernails, 84A and B, and 118A, the knife, that -- back out a
little bit more -- that they could not have come from Nicole Brown
Simpson, Ronald Goldman or O.J. Simpson, correct?

A. That's the first part of that paragraph, that's correct.

Q. We'll get to the rest of it.

Then you also say, however, Nicole Brown Simpson cannot be excluded as
a source of the stain in the EAP type B observed on the item, as it
could be degraded from a type BA, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

Now, you testified extensively at the criminal trial about the
differences between a BA and a B, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And I'd like you to grab a marker there. I think there's a blue
marker on the table. Come down here, if you will.

(Witness complies approaches board.)

Q. Now, we don't really have to understand the whole process of EAP
typing to understand the difference between a BA and a B, do we?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

What I'd like you to do on the left side of that -- first of all,
write at the top, BA.

(Witness complies, writes on large board.)

Q. On the right side, B.

(Witness complies, writes on large board.)

Q. Now, could you draw to enhance with other conventional serological
testing and DNA testing the ultimate results are an X-ray type item
with bands on it, right?

A. In this case it's not what you're describing as an X-ray type item.
It's a gel that the bands that show up to give you an indication of
what type. It kind of glows. In this case -- particular case, it's not
a darker -- you do it in the dark under ultraviolet light and the
bands show up as a glow.

Q. The BA consists of 4 bands?

A. That's correct.

Q. Why don't you draw those 4 bands in the general position of where
they would be on your gel if you had a sample that had BA?

A. Okay, just to give a reference point, when you're running an
electrophoresis gel you have an origin. That's just where -- where the
sample starts from. You put a thread with your gel at a point called
the origin. And in the case of the EAP system, each of the types
breaks down to a couple of different bands for EAP. We have 4 bands,
one a heavy band, a lighter band and a lighter band and a lighter
band.

Q. Those are given names. Why don't you write the names next to them.

A. They're given letter designations.

Trying to remember which direction they go.

It's like a -- well --

Q. B2?

A. This is an indication of the B band. This 29, this is one of the A
bands. And this could also be a B band.

Q. I think the bottom one is A1, the bottom B is B1, and then it's A2
and B2, correct?

A. That's one of the ways of doing these.

Q. Okay.

And the B2 bands and the A2 bands are referred to as the faster bands
because they move farther on the gel, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. But once the test is done, if you were testing a BA that had 4
bands, that's what it would look like, correct?

A. Basically, yes.

Q. Now, over on the column for the B, why don't you draw what a two
banded B pattern looks like?

A. Again, you have the origin point and then you just have the two
bands in the B regions.

Q. And why don't you label those B, B1 and B2, correct?

Now, would you agree that the results that you found for the
fingernails and the knife, number 118, looked like the B with the two
bands, B1 and B2?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And your statement, or your testimony that -- that what you saw might
be a degraded BA was based on the fact that there is scientific
literature that indicates that under some circumstances you can have a
BA that degrades down to a B, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you can go ahead and have a seat.

(Witness complies, resumes witness stand.)

Q. Now, sometimes you can have a B that just has the B1 band, correct?
That's sometimes called a B as well, is it not?

A. Well, I wouldn't call it a B without having both bands being
present.

Q. Okay.

Now, during your preparation for the criminal trial, and during your
testimony, we reviewed carefully all the scientific literature that
there is that talks about a BA degrading to a B, did we not?

MR. LAMBERT: Only hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

A. Yes, we did.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you're familiar with that literature, are you
not?

A. With some of it, yes.

Q. Okay.

And would you agree that the literature that talks about a BA
degrading to a B that describes how that process takes place,
describes it as bands as it degrades disappearing from the top down?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. It does indicate, the literature does, that the direction of
degradation does tend to be from either top or bottom. At this point,
I don't specifically remember which one it is, but yes, it is -- it
tends to be in one direction.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay.

From the top, which is what the literature says, what this means is as
the stain degrades, first you lose B2, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you wind up with three bands, which still would be called a BA
because you have two A bands and 1 B band?

A. According to the literature, they do talk about that as being one
of the main degradation groups. I wouldn't call a BA or a B without
having both B bands present.

Q. Would you agree that the literature -- according to the literature,
the degradation path, after you lose the B2, the next thing you lose
is A2?

A. It does talk about that as one of the routes of degradation.

Q. Then the next one you lose is B1, and finally, when it's all gone,
you can't get a type, you lose A1, correct?

A. No, I believe the A bands are going to be gone first. It does not
specifically mention an A band being the last one left.

Q. Okay.

But you would agree that the literature that talks about this, has the
B2 bands disappearing first and then the A2 band disappearing?

A. The literature does reference one of the B bands disappearing
first, that's correct.

Q. Would you agree that, according to the literature that talks about
this, you would never have a pattern -- a two banded B pattern from a
degraded BA given the pattern that is described in the literature?

A. The literature that I've seen does not specifically say that that
can occur. It describes the other situation we've been talking about.

Q. Well, it didn't say that it can't occur either, did it?

A. There are references there that do leave it open to that
possibility, and mention that the A bands disappear first. However,
the majority of the pictures and the experimentation shown does show
the route that you're talking about in the degradation of the -- one
of the B bands prior to both A bands.

Q. Well, there -- some of the literature says that you can have a B
degraded from a BA but it doesn't tell you how it gets from a BA to a
B, does it?

A. That's correct.

Q. All the articles that tell you how to get from a BA to a B describe
it as you lose B2, then you lose A2, correct, you lose it from the top
down?

A. You do lose a B band along with one of the A's, that's correct.

Q. So there is no specific scientific support in the literature for a
two banded B pattern actually being degraded from a BA, correct?

A. Showing you the photographs and stuff, you're correct.

Q. And if you have typed Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernails --
scrapings under her fingernails correctly, that is consistent with
blood from an unknown person being under her fingernails, correct?

A. If the sample is strong enough and not degraded, that is correct.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. First, Mr. Matheson, on this question of the amount of blood taken
from the reference sample, were the figures that you were discussing
with Mr. Blasier just estimates of the amount of blood that was taken
out?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. When criminalists would draw the blood at SID to use it, did they
actually measure it or did they estimate how much they were taking?

A. I'm sorry, when you say when we withdraw it.

Q. Yeah, when you take blood out of the blood vial for testing, do you
measure it or do you estimate the amount you're taking?

A. No, it's all just estimations.

Q. In your experience, can those estimations be pretty far off?

A. Yes, they can.

Q. In fact, in connection with this case, didn't you once make an
estimate and then go back and do a precise measurement to see how
close your measurement was?

A. Even the second one wasn't a precise measurement. Yes, I did first
an eyeball guess of how much blood was in the blood vial. Later on I
did what I thought was a more precise way of measuring it and was
significantly off.

Q. What was your guess of how much was in it?

A. On the day we did the inventory of the evidence, I eyeballed it and
concluded in the chart there was approximately 2 milliliters of blood
in that vial.

Q. And then when you later went back and did the more precise
measurement efforts, what did you come up with?

A. 3.8, or almost twice as much.

Q. In regard to this issue of the blood under Nicole's fingernails, is
part of your opinion that -- well, first let me start off with your
opinion to what's the most likely, and as to the correct EAP type for
that blood?

A. Well, given that particular sample, looking at all of the other
information associated with the -- where the sample was taken from, I
-- and not just looking totally at the analytical information, the
most likely conclusion is that it's a degraded BA, and that it came
from Nicole Brown.

Q. Can you tell the jury some of the -- of the circumstances that you
took into account in reaching that conclusion?

A. Well, having done a number of fingernail scrapings type of
analysis, particularly when there is a lot of blood involved, the most
common source of blood under the nails is the victim's own blood.

As a matter of fact, it's very rare to finds somebody else's blood
under a victim's fingernails. It does happen occasionally, but it's
fairly rare.

In this particular case, having seen some of the crime scene
photographs and her hands, there was blood present on it, and along
with the known fact that EAP can degrade to a B, that I've seen in
other tests that I've performed, I feel the most likely explanation,
though I can't rule out the other possibility, most likely is that the
blood that's there is from Ms. Brown.

Q. And that's just based on your own conventional serology expertise?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. Now, in addition to that, Mr. Matheson, you -- we have heard in the
courtroom the testimony of Gary Sims and Dr. Robin Cotton, both of
whom independently performed PCR tests, different PCR tests on the
blood under Nicole's fingernails, both of which concluded that that
blood had DNA type that was consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson and
did not show a mixture containing any other person's blood.

Would those test results confirm your conventional serology opinion
that this is Nicole's blood under the fingernails?

A. I think it confirms that the most likely answer is that it's her
own blood.

Q. And as to all of the other blood that was at the crime scene that
you did conventional serology tests on, was all of that typing
consistent with coming from either one of the victims or Mr. Simpson?

A. Of the stuff from the crime scene, that's correct.

Q. Yes.

This knife that Mr. Blasier was asking about, do you know where that
knife came from?

A. Right now, no. I'd -- I'd have to look at a property report. I
don't believe it came from the crime scene.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. I have no further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. When you found -- when a knife was found with the same type of EAP
type, that wasn't really pursued by LAPD, was it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you're aware of how much blood it takes to
prepare a Fitzco card, aren't you, it takes 1 cc, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the card is designed so you -- it takes -- it makes four
different sections, each one 250 microliters, I guess?

A. That's correct.

Q. So you're pretty certain about the fact that when Mr. Yamauchi made
his Fitzco card, he took out 1 cc?

A. I'd say pretty close to that. I don't know if he specifically used
a measuring pipette to do it, but he prepares a lot of those.

Q. There's only that one withdrawal between when Thano Peratis
collected the blood, and it went to toxicology where they said it had
5.5 cc's?

A. That's my understanding.

Q. If those numbers are correct, and Thano Peratis withdrew 8 cc's,
that would indicate that between the time the blood was drawn and it
went to toxicology on June 20, there was approximately one and a half
cc's missing, if those numbers are correct?

A. If what he drew is correct, that's true.

Q. Now, did I understand your testimony about the fingernails is that
you said if you don't look closely at the analytical information, that
means disregard the test results?

A. No, not at all. That's why I don't totally eliminate the
possibility of a different type being present. I also understand the
limitations of the EAP system and I can take other information into
account.

Q. Okay.

Now, you would expect to find a person's own DNA under their
fingernails, wouldn't you?

A. I would.

Q. From skin cells or whatever?

A. Yes, I would.

Q. It's not unusual if you did a DNA test under Nicole Brown Simpson's
fingernails, you're going to find cellular material consistent with
her, correct?

A. I would think so, if they scraped some of it out.

Q. Okay.

Now, the EAP test doesn't look at the same part of the blood as the
DNA test, correct?

A. That's correct. The EAP is on the red blood cells. There's no DNA
in the red blood cells.

Q. You're talking about comparing PCR with EAP, you're comparing
apples and oranges, you're looking at different things, aren't you?

A. You're looking at different things. You're not going to necessarily
discount that information.

Q. You would agree it would be unusual if you didn't find Nicole Brown
Simpson's DNA under her fingernails?

A. I would expect to see hers along with the mixture, if there was
another sample under there.

Q. Now, you said you have seen in tests you've performed, a BA degrade
to a B, like you found in this case?

A. That's correct.

Q. How many times?

A. Well, I believe I saw it in one other instance in this case, and I
can specifically remember a couple other instances. I don't -- beyond
that, I'm not sure.

Q. You remember testifying at the criminal trial that you had one
other situation where you thought you had seen that?

A. There was one that I very specifically remember because I testified
to it down in Compton Court. I believe I've seen it other times.

Q. Are you aware since you testified in the criminal trial, of there
being any additional scientific literature that supports at all your
position that the B that you saw under the fingernails could have been
a degraded BA?

A. No, I haven't.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Mr. Matheson, I don't want to show the jury the picture again, but
where were Nicole's hands in relationship to the pool of blood that
she was found in?

A. Oh, I don't specifically remember this. They were either in it or
very close.

Q. And is that one of the reasons why you think it's more likely that
that blood under the fingernails is her own blood?

A. That, along with my experience in running fingernail scrapings and
the subsequent DNA work that was done.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you.

MR. BLASIER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

(Pause)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I would ask to have the board that Mr.
Matheson marked, marked as an exhibit and introduced.

THE CLERK: That would be 2256.

MR. BAKER: 50?

THE CLERK: 56.

MR. BAKER: Fine.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

(The instrument herein described as a poster board marked by Mr.
Matheson was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2256.)

MR. BAKER: We will recall to the stand under 676 --

MR. KELLY: 767.

MR. BAKER: 767.

THE COURT: One of those.

MR. BAKER: I want to see Tom Lange again.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object to 767.

THE COURT: Objection overruled.

THE CLERK: Have a seat.

You've already been sworn.

TOM LANGE called as a witness on behalf of the Defendants, having been
previously sworn, testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

Would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange, L-a-n-g-e.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Lange, how much time did you spend before the time you left the
stand and today with the plaintiffs' attorneys?

A. Spoke with Mr. Medvene this afternoon for about 10 minutes. Saw him
briefly last night. That's about it.

Q. How much time did you spend talking to Mr. Vannatter before you got
on the witness stand here this afternoon?

A. None.

Q. Now, let me ask you, sir, when you were at 675 (sic) South Bundy,
did you -- did you see any shoe prints --

MR. KELLY: 875.

MR. BAKER: Strike that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) 875 South Bundy, did you see any shoe prints between
the body of Nicole Brown Simpson and Bundy?

A. Bundy Drive?

Q. Yes, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, the Bundy crime scene, there was thorough
cross-examination on it.

THE COURT: I'll allow some.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

Vague, then, as to time, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You may answer.

THE COURT: No. Sustained as to time.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How many times were you at 875 South Bundy before
the crime scene was released?

A. I was there for the one time on the 13th before it was released.

Q. You were actually there from 4:20 to 5, and then you went back
about quarter to 7 in the morning and were there until approximately
noon, right?

A. Yes, approximately.

Q. So you were there at least two times on the 13th, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was the last time that you were there that you did a
thorough investigation of the evidence that was at the crime scene,
true?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. I'm permitting this witness to be examined as a
defense witness and I assume we're not going to go over the same
thing.

MR. BAKER: We're not.

THE COURT: Okay. Please don't.

A. May I have the question again, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It was the second time when you went back to 875
South Bundy that you did a thorough examination of the evidence of the
crime scene, right?

A. No, I did not examine the evidence at that time.

Q. You were looking for evidence, attempting to recognize evidence,
document evidence, and preserve evidence, correct?

A. That would go more to the criminalist, that would be a concern that
-- the criminalist is the one who documents and collects the evidence.

Q. I see.

In all of the 12 pages of your notes that you documented at the crime
scene, 875 South Bundy, that was also to document the crime scene
after you recognized what you thought may have been evidence, true?

A. Yes, various aspects of the crime scene.

Q. And then I want to go back to my original question then, Detective
Lange, and that was did you see any shoe prints between the body of
Nicole Brown Simpson and Bundy Drive that were consistent with the
shoe prints that were on the stairs and going to the west?

A. I observed some partial shoe prints near the body on the walkway,
yes.

Q. Did you observe the shoe prints as far as four feet away from
Nicole Brown Simpson on the walkway towards Bundy?

A. I don't recall that.

MR. P. BAKER: Next in order.

THE CLERK: 2257.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, the shoe prints on Bundy were -- were
relatively unique, weren't they? I mean the pattern?

(The instrument herein described as Photograph of crime scene was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2257.)

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, vague, which shoe prints, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you --

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you see this shoe print that's over four feet
down the walkway towards Bundy at the crime scene at 875 South Bundy,
Mr. Lange?

A. It's hard for me to orient where exactly.

Q. Pull it back so we can orient it?

A. Yeah.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. Now, at the top of this Exhibit No. --

MR. BAKER: Again, please. I'm sorry.

MR. P. BAKER: 2257.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- 2257, is the body of Nicole Brown Simpson,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the tiles with the grouting are basically one foot, true?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. And did you see shoe prints in the area where my finger is pointing
a foot or so away, that is towards the east and Bundy Drive?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you see shoe prints as far down as four feet away from the
body of Nicole Brown Simpson towards Bundy Drive?

A. I don't recall seeing shoe prints down in this area, if that's what
you're referring to.

Q. Now, that shoe print is four tiles away from the body of Nicole
Brown Simpson, is it not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence that that is a
shoe print, Your Honor. There's been no evidence of that.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. MEDVENE: Assumes a fact not in evidence that Mr. Baker is saying
something in particular is a shoe print, there's been no evidence to
that.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, that shoe print is over four feet away from
Nicole Brown Simpson, right?

A. Which shoe print?

Q. That shoe print.

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, can you indicate where you were
pointing, Mr. Baker?

A. I don't know that it is a shoe print. It doesn't appear to be a
shoe print to me.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's not a shoe print to you?

A. I don't know. It doesn't appear to be one to me.

MR. BAKER: Put on the other ones that are south of or west of the
body.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 2214.

(Exhibit 2214 displayed.)

Q. Now, I take it that you couldn't recognize that as a shoe print
either, right?

A. Where are you looking?

Q. Right there.

A. Yeah, that appears to be a partial shoe print.

Q. But you can't make out the other one that has --

MR. BAKER: Let's put it back up now, Phil, the first one.

(Exhibit 2257 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Does that look like a shoe print to you, from the
very same type of sole that made the shoe print in the last
photograph?

A. No.

Q. Doesn't look like it to you?

A. No.

Q. All right.

Now, that would be significant, wouldn't it, if there was a shoe print
four feet to the west of Nicole Brown Simpson, correct?

A. Well, there was shoe prints to the west of Nicole Brown Simpson.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

That would be significant if there was a shoe print four feet to the
west of Nicole Brown Simpson, correct?

A. Certainly.

Q. And the reason it would be significant is because it would indicate
that the assailant, after he killed Nicole Brown Simpson, had walked
in the blood and then walked west, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And it would also indicate to you -- strike that.

There are other shoe prints indicating that the assailant walked in
the area after Nicole Brown Simpson had been killed, true?

A. I don't know if we can say after. The shoe prints appeared between
both victims.

MR. BAKER: Put back that shoe print, the last one.

MR. P. BAKER: Coming up is Exhibit 92.

(Exhibit 92 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you see any shoe prints in that photograph? And
it's hard. If you want to come back here.

A. Yeah, that might help a little bit.

I believe there was some up in the left -- upper left quarter of the
quadrant, up here on this area, right in here, you see a partial heel
print.

(Indicating to Exhibit No. 92.)

MR. BAKER: Now put --

Q. While you're back away from the TV monitor --

MR. BAKER: Put back the one that's four feet west on the path toward
Bundy.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) See if you, from the vantage point that you
presently have, if you agree that's a shoe print?

MR. P. BAKER: 2257.

(Exhibit 2257 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, still doesn't look like it to you? Not to you,
anyway?

A. I can see what you're referring to, this area in here, this
section, little area, but --

Q. Well --

A. I can't say that that's a shoe print.

Q. Well, you may resume the stand, sir.

Mr. Lange, that indentation has a similar sole pattern to the
indentations that you saw up next to the body, does it not, sir?

A. No, I think the ones at the body are sectioned much smaller than
that.

Q. Oh, do you?

Okay.

That had to be a shoe print made by somebody?

A. This had to be?

Q. Yes.

A. I'm not saying it's a shoe print.

Q. Let me ask you this.

(Indicating to the exhibit displayed.)

Q. The LAPD certainly wouldn't have walked in that area before the
crime scene was released, would they?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, calls for conclusion, lack of foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) No one from the LAPD would have infringed and
tampered with the crime scene and walked in pools of blood before the
crime scene was released?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection. It's also argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was care taken, Mr. Lange, to keep the feet of LAPD
officers out of blood pools on the walkway between the time that the
bodies were discovered at 12:10 and the crime scene was released at 3
o'clock the following -- the same afternoon?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, lack of foundation, Your Honor. And certainly,
in part, on the time the witness is not present.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection as to that form.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At -- all the time you were there, did you see
anybody walk in the area where blood was pooling?

A. At the time the bodies were removed, yes.

Q. Well, the pictures were taken before the bodies were removed. We
can see that because Nicole Brown Simpson's body is in the picture,
right?

A. Correct.

Q. Before the bodies were removed -- what time were they removed?

A. I believe it was approximately 10 AM, right in that area.

Q. Before 10 AM, did you see anybody walk in the blood area on the
walkway, sir?

A. I saw no one walk in the blood.

Q. That would certainly be improper procedure if anybody walked in the
blood, you would agree with that?

A. Yes, I wouldn't want to see that.

Q. And you would agree, sir, that this pool of blood over to the right
of the photograph, and the pool of blood in the middle lower portion
of the photograph, right above what I have referred to as a shoe
print, is simply pooled blood, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you would agree that the area that I've been pointing to that
you do not agree is a shoe print, was an imprint made by something
after the blood had pooled, correct, sir?

A. There was a dog that ran through that area and there are paw prints
throughout. I suppose it could have been a dog slipping through there.
I don't know.

Q. Now, in your multiple years as a detective, are you trying to
intimate to this jury that that print is caused by a dog?

A. I don't know what it was caused by. I don't even know if it's a
print.

Q. Well, it certainly isn't blood pooling, is it?

A. It doesn't look like it's pooling in that one specific area that
you mentioned. I don't know what kind of a print it is.

Q. Now, Detective Lange, isn't it true that that impression indicates
to you as a detective of 20 plus years that something other than a dog
stepped in it?

A. I think it would be irresponsible for me to make that kind of a
decision.

Q. I see.

It wasn't -- never mind.

Now, you don't think that that is the same shoe print that's up in the
-- by the bodies that you've identified, correct?

A. From looking at that photo, it doesn't appear to be the same to me.

Q. All right.

Now, you would agree that there were no shoe prints in the -- in front
of Nicole Brown Simpson's body that was consistent with the shoes worn
by Ronald Goldman the night of the murders, correct?

A. I don't believe there were.

Q. And that indicates to you that Ronald Goldman was already in the
caged or closed-in area before Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered,
correct?

A. I think that's a probability, yes.

Q. And that indicates to you, then, that, in your view, somebody was
in front of Nicole Brown Simpson and then behind Nicole Brown Simpson
before Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, correct?

A. Certainly that's a possibility, yes.

Q. And all of that would be at the same time Ronald Goldman would be
in a closed-in area, because once the throat was cut of Nicole Brown
Simpson, blood gushed onto the walkway, isn't that true, sir?

A. Can you repeat the first part of that again. I don't think I quite
understood.

Q. That indicates to you that during the process of Nicole Brown
Simpson being murdered, Ronald Goldman had to be in the closed-in area
while somebody was first in front of her, then behind her, and slashed
her throat, and blood spurted all over the walkway, right?

A. Not necessarily.

Q. Well, not necessarily?

And if in fact Ronald Goldman was in the closed-in area at the same
time an assailant was in front of Nicole Brown Simpson and then behind
Nicole Brown Simpson, there had to have been a second assailant
occupying Ronald Goldman, isn't that true, sir?

A. No.

Q. You would have in your reconstruction just stood there --

A. Stood there?

Q. -- stood there while the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson was taking
place? That didn't happen in your reconstruction, did it?

A. I don't think -- could you repeat that, please.

Q. When you left 875 South Bundy at approximately 5 o'clock, it was
after you had a conversation with Phil Vannatter, Ron Phillips and
Mark Fuhrman, true?

A. No, I didn't speak to Fuhrman. It was a brief conversation with
Vannatter and Phillips.

Q. And in the -- In the brief conversation with Vannatter and
Phillips, Phillips indicated to Vannatter that O.J. Simpson had a
previous incident of domestic violence with his ex-wife, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, hearsay, and this was specifically gone into.
This question was specifically asked. The topic was gone into.

THE COURT: Hearsay, sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you -- well, you participated in the
decision-making process to leave 875 South Bundy and go to 360 North
Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time that you participated in the decision to leave 875
South Bundy, you were aware that, obviously, there were two victims at
875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there was evidence that included a hat at 875
South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there was at least a glove at 875 South Bundy
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there was a pager at 875 South Bundy, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Keys, apparently, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. There were blood spatterings at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. There were shoe prints at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. There were blood drops on the back of Nicole Brown Simpson at 875
South Bundy, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. There were blood drops going on the north walkway, leading west to
east or east to west, at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And there was a well of evidence at that crime scene at 875 South
Bundy that you were aware, at 5 o'clock, had been processed by no one,
true?

A. That's correct.

Q. You were -- you were always aware at 5 o'clock, when you made this
decision to notify Mr. Simpson of the death of his ex-wife, that no
coroner had been called and no criminalist had been called, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And, in fact, you could have called a criminalist, if you were just
going to go to be over there for a few minutes to meet a few of them,
so the criminalists would be back at 875 South Bundy when you got
back; isn't that true?

A. I suppose so.

Q. Well, in other words, is it your testimony, Mr. Lange, that you
were just going to go over there a few minutes, notify O.J. Simpson,
get a little rapport with him, and then come right back to 875 South
Bundy, and then start and investigate that crime scene and process it?

A. It's my impression, at the time we left Bundy, that a criminalist
had, in fact, been notified.

Q. I see.

A. We found out later, at Rockingham, that they had not.

Q. Who gave you the impression that a criminalist had been notified?

A. The original officers that arrived shortly after midnight.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

It asked for the identification of the human being who told you that
the criminalist had been notified?

A. I never said anyone told me. I said I was under the impression that
they had been -- the photographer was there; detective headquarters
had been notified. West Los Angeles was there. And I was under the
impression that they, possibly, had been notified.

I didn't need them at that time, so there was no specific request at
that time.

Q. You were co-lead detective, once you arrived at that scene, were
you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the police department's view of things, once your division,
robbery/homicide is notified, basically everything stops until
robbery/homicide gets there and takes over, right?

A. Generally, yes.

Q. And so there is, at least in this case, had you not gone to Bundy,
there would have been at least a two-hour and 15-minute delay for --
of absolutely no investigation on the scene because of LAPD rules
that, once robbery/homicide is notified, everything stops, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Materiality, relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't know how long it had been.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, let's assume that robbery/homicide was
notified at 2:45 to take over the crime, and you arrived and there
sometime -- at 4:20; so you got an hour and what, 35 minutes --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- additional delay, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you'd have four hours' delay because of robbery/homicide
being -- from the time that the crime scene was, in fact, discovered,
and there is still absolutely no processing of the crime scene going
on because it's robbery/homicide, right?

A. Well, that's a decision that's made by administration of the police
department.

Yeah, that's basically true.

Q. Did you ever tell anybody he -- well, strike that.

Isn't the time of death in every homicide important?

A. It certainly is a factor that could be important, yes.

Q. Isn't it also true, sir, that the time of death can be determined,
if you call the coroner, by taking a liver temperature?

A. It is one of the aids that can be used in determining an
approximate time of death, but generally not much under two and a
half, three hours.

Q. Well, as a matter of fact, Detective Lange, in your 20 plus years,
you're aware that if the temperature of the liver is taken in a close
proximity after death, the estimate of time can be within an hour;
isn't that true?

A. Absolutely not. I have never heard that. And I've heard just the
contrary in all my years.

Q. Well, in fact, in the John Belushi case, the liver temperature was
taken quickly. And that solved the crime, did it not, sir?

A. I don't --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) One and a half degrees an hour, the liver -- in the
first four hours, the liver temperature drops, correct?

A. That's a general rule. 1.5 degrees per hour is a very general rule,
yes.

Q. In this case, the variance becomes greater because the liver
temperature wasn't taken until after 10 o'clock in the morning; isn't
that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so the liver temperature becomes basically meaningless after
the bodies are discovered. And you and your other co-lead Detective
don't call the coroner and don't get any liver temperature taken for
ten hours, correct?

A. No, not at all. The same formula exists. It's 1.5 degrees per hour.

Q. Exactly. After four hours, the liver temperature decreases one
degree an hour; isn't that true?

A. There are many factors, and I've always been told and advised by
various pathologists that it's generally 1.5 degrees per hour.

I don't -- never been instructed, or told, or taught that it was
anything less. And that's a general -- very general, 1.5.

Q. You've never heard that after four hours, the liver temperature
goes down to a degree an hour, then it becomes, after six or seven
hours, exceedingly variable? That's never been --

A. I've always --

Q. Okay.

A. -- been told 1.5 degrees, generally, per hour.

Q. So the liver temperature, in this case at -- was taken at different
times from both victims, correct?

A. I believe it was within a few minutes.

Q. Well, one was -- Well, strike that.

The liver temperature was 82 degrees, was it not?

A. I haven't looked at that in perhaps a couple years.

Q. Let me show you your notes.

(Counsel approaches witness stand.)

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

MR. BAKER: Right at bottom of the page.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I wrote, a liver temperature of 82 degrees at 10:50 a.m..

Q. 10:50 a.m. Liver temperature 82 degrees, right?

A. That's what it says.

Q. And what -- while we're on that page, what's the other ambient
temperature?

A. 70 degrees, same time.

Q. So the outside temperature at just the ambient temperature was 70
degrees on June 13 at 10:50?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, the coroner certainly, in this case, that you were aware --
and you did attend the autopsy on the 14th -- could not place the time
of death anywhere between 9:00 and 12:00, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation and calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled, if it's in the coroner's report.

A. Well, go --

MR. MEDVENE: It's not in the coroner's report, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may inquire whether it's in the coroner's report.

Q. Well, let me ask you this:

You went to the autopsy, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Both you and Vannatter went to the autopsy, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you wrote the follow-up report, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you put in your follow-up report, did you not, that the coroner
couldn't determine with any more accuracy, that it was between 9:00
and 12:00, the time of death?

A. I believe I wrote the coroner said it was between 9:00 and 12:00,
closer to 9:00.

Q. And, in fact, the coroner never said one thing about it being
closer to 9:00; isn't that true?

A. My recollection is that the coroner said probably closer to 9:00.

Q. The coroner never has testified in any court that it was closer to
9:00. Is that true or untrue, to your knowledge, sir?

A. I have no idea what he testified to.

Q. Now, in terms, sir, of you making the decision to go over to Mr.
Simpson's property, you had knowledge of all of the evidence at 875
South Bundy, as we just discussed, and you had knowledge that not one
of the other people; that is, the coroner or criminalist, had been
called.

And you decided, along with Vannatter, that you were going to go and
notify O.J. Simpson and develop a little rapport with him, right.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative; asked and answered several
times today.

Also prior testimony.

THE COURT: I think this is the asked area. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You, at the time you made this decision to leave
this crime scene rich in evidence, were of the opinion that O.J.
Simpson was a probable suspect for the murders of his wife and the
unidentified victim at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. No, not at all.

Q. You had knowledge of a previous domestic violence and you had
knowledge that they were estranged, true?

A. No, I did not.

Q. You are -- it's your testimony you didn't have knowledge that they
were divorced at the time you went over to Rockingham?

A. It wasn't clear to me whether it was a separation or a divorce.

Q. Is that crucial in terms of determining whether or not Mr. Simpson,
in your mind, was a possible suspect for the murders?

A. No.

Q. In fact, what you wanted to do, Detective Lange, is: You knew that
the LAPD had been under great pressure in high-profile cases for not
getting any arrests and not getting any convictions, and you wanted to
get Mr. Simpson arrested. Isn't that true, sir?

A. Sir, that's nonsense.

Q. You went over there, leaving everything behind at 875 South Bundy,
not calling a criminalist, not calling a coroner, because you wanted
to get to Mr. Simpson and see if you could develop a crime scene at
360 North Rockingham. True?

A. That's not true.

Q. Now, after you got to 360 North Rockingham, you and your colleague,
Mr. Vannatter, were outside the Ashford gate, and you rang the
intercom buzzer, right?

A. I didn't ring the buzzer; I believe Fuhrman was over there, and
perhaps Phillips.

Q. So it was Phillips and Fuhrman who rang the buzzer, right?

A. And Vannatter may have. I never rang the buzzer; it was one of
them.

Q. You think it was Phillips and Fuhrman that rang the buzzer, right?

A. Again, I'm not sure, but I believe so, yes.

Q. And you -- Your car was parked now --

MR. BAKER: Phil, can we get that?

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were where when the buzzer was being rung?

A. Well, it was rung several times over a period of time, when I was,
for a while, in the street, in front of the Ashford gate.

Subsequent to that, I was up closer in the intersection of Rockingham
and Ashford. At one point, I walked down to the white Bronco and
looked at the white Bronco, then back up towards the gate.

Q. Now, how long was Fuhrman out of your sight at Rockingham?

MR. MEDVENE: Vague as to time, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At any time before you and Vannatter decided to go
over the wall.

A. I don't know that he was ever out of my sight during that time.

Q. Well, did you keep him in your sight?

A. Well, not on purpose. But for the most part, he was.

When he walked away from the Ashford gate, initially, I kind of
trailed behind him and walked, as I said to the intersection area. I
observed him walking down towards the Bronco and I saw him looking at
the Bronco.

Q. Your police vehicle was parked on Ashford, just to the west of the
Ashford gate, was it not?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Phil, that's civil 116.

(Defendants' Exhibit 116 was displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And the Bronco was south on Rockingham right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was 5 o'clock in the morning, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was dark?

A. Yes.

Q. And the only streetlight in the area is across the street on
Ashford, right?

A. I believe there is a light up there, yes.

Q. No street lamps down here at all?

A. I don't recall.

Q. And so it's your testimony, of course, that you had walked out onto
Rockingham and watched Mark Fuhrman go down to the Bronco, right?

A. Well, I had walked out to the area of Rockingham and Ashford to see
if I could get a better look inside -- inside the property.

Q. When you came out to go to Mr. Simpson's house, did you come up
Sunset and go down Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. At that time, there were no barriers on Rockingham, and you could
go up Sunset, take a right on Rockingham, and come down Rockingham
towards Ashford, which would be -- or I'm guessing -- up, 'cause it's
north, correct?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you had -- were you driving at the time, or Vannatter?

A. Vannatter.

Q. And I take it that you were looking to see where Mr. Simpson's
house was, were you not?

A. No.

Q. Did you notice that this is a solid wall all the way around his
property?

A. We didn't know they were at Mr. Simpson's house until the vehicle
stopped and we pulled in behind Phillips. They were leading us to that
location.

Q. So as I understand your testimony now, you came out to the
Ashford-Rockingham intersection to look to see if you could get a
better view in his property?

A. I was trying to get a better view into the property, yes.

Q. And you never walked to the Rockingham gate, did you?

A. Yes, I did. I walked down towards the Bronco, which was at the
gate.

Q. After, Fuhrman came back and told you there was a mark that he had
found over the left door handle, right?

A. It was about that time, yes.

MR. BAKER: And you want to put that up again, Phil?

(Defendants' Exhibit 109 was displayed on the Elmo screen.)

MR. P. BAKER: 109.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's the mark that you saw on the morning of June
13 at approximately 5:15, 5:30, in that area?

A. Yes.

Q. And you could see it real good, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Not on this.

THE COURT: I can't see it very well.

A. I see the mark.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And we already determined it's about three-eighths
of an inch long?

A. I don't know.

Q. Well, there's a ruler.

A. I can look real close, if you want, I suppose.

Q. Well let me represent to you it's three-eights of an inch long.

THE COURT: We have another photograph?

MR. FOSTER: It's the same one.

THE COURT: That's clear. Now I can see it.

A. That's possibly half an inch.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Half an inch?

A. Actually --

Q. Your measurements --

A. It's approximate, okay, according to this.

Q. Okay. That's the way you read that ruler.

This is three inches (indicating); this is three and a quarter;
(indicating); this is three and a half (indicating); this is three and
three-quarters?

A. No. I'm looking from this line to this line.

Q. That's a quarter of an inch.

A. Oh, I'm sorry; I thought that was half an inch.

Q. Okay. So that's?

A. Say about a quarter of an inch.

Q. That was a -- was -- was of great significance to you, wasn't it?

A. There was some significance at that time.

Later on, it became greater.

Q. Before you made the decision to go over the wall, your group
decision with Vannatter, that was of great significance to you, wasn't
it, that quarter-of-an-inch mark that's on the monitor?

A. I can't say "great significance." It was of some significance.

Q. And you believed that the vehicle was parked -- that is, the Bronco
-- the vehicle was parked at an angle to the curb, with the rear end
jutting out into the roadway. That was of significance to you, too,
wasn't it?

A. Somewhat, yes.

MR. BAKER: Put that photo on, Phil, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In your words, sir, in your follow-up murder --
follow-up report, why don't you read exactly what you said about the
Bronco and jutting out into the roadway.

(Pause for the witness to read document handed to him by Mr. Baker.)

THE WITNESS: Would you like me to read it aloud?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yeah, that would be fine.

A. Detectives -- you want me to read the whole paragraph?

Q. Just read the sentence that relates to the angle of the Bronco on
Rockingham.

A. Having parked at an angle to the curb with the rear end jutting out
into the roadway.

Q. Now, as a matter of fact, the vehicle wasn't jutting out into the
roadway at all, was it?

A. The rear end appeared to me to be jutted out slightly in the
roadway, yes.

Q. Well --

MR. P. BAKER: 2036 [sic] on the screen.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 2038 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. There is about four inches' difference between, or the front tire
being close to the curb and the rear tire, it being close to the curb;
you would agree with that?

A. I never measured it. I couldn't say.

Q. Let's take a look at the photo and see if we can make some
determinations. This area, the white area, again, is an apron, is it
not, a concrete apron that leads to the asphalt on Rockingham, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And the tires on the vehicle, you would agree, probably aren't any
wider than eight inches?

A. They're probably a little wider than that. Again, I didn't measure
it.

Q. You want to go ten? Would you believe eleven?

A. I don't know.

Q. You think ten is a good estimate?

A. I have no idea.

Q. Well, do you have tires on your car, Mr. Lange?

A. Yes, but I've never measured them.

Q. You estimate the width of them; they're not like to here, a foot
wide?

A. I never had any reason to measure the width of my tires or any
other tires.

Q. In any event, you would agree that the rear tire is almost adjacent
to the concrete apron, would you not?

A. It's certainly adjacent, but it is apart from, and sticking out as
compared to the front. The car's at an angle.

Q. And the roadway there is about what, 24 feet across?

A. I don't know.

Q. Difference in the two, in the front tire and the back tire be more
than four, five inches? You would agree with that?

A. It's a little hard to tell from that angle. That front tire is up
on that apron and --

Q. Sure it is?

A. And the rear tire of course, is out on the street, so that's how I
had formed my impression.

Q. So based upon you being there for the south side of the gate and
walking down and looking at the Bronco, and from -- was it the front
view that gave you the idea that the vehicle was jutting out into the
street?

A. No. When we initially approached, I observed the vehicle. It was
the only one on the street, for one. And if one hadn't been paying
attention to where they were going, they might have even run into it,
because it is a fairly narrow street.

Q. Rockingham is a fairly narrow street?

A. Comparatively, yes.

Q. Compared to Santa Monica Freeway?

A. When there are vehicles parked on it, I think one would have to
probably exercise more care.

THE COURT: Can you get to a -- when you get to a point, we're going to
take ten, okay?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The location of the Bronco was one of the factors
that led you to the decision that there may be a heinous crime going
on inside Mr. Simpson's estate, right?

A. No, I don't think so.

Q. Had no significance whatsoever?

A. I can say no significance. It wasn't one of the things that I
looked at -- it wasn't one of the things that I looked at to compel us
to go in.

THE COURT: Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

THE CLERK: For the record, that's not Exhibit 2036, it's 2038.
(Recess.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At break, I got in better pictures that I want to
see if we can compare relative to that shoe print on the walkway and
go on to something else, because want to get back here. If you can see
--

MR. P. BAKER: 2214.

MR. BAKER: Please feel free.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 2214 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On the area on the tile -- let me get a pointer
here. Excuse me, sir.

That, you would agree, is a shoe print, correct?

A. That appears to be a partial, yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Phil, next one.

Take it back up.

Well, good.

Come back to it.

MR. P. BAKER: 887.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 887 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) These are all paw prints in blood, right?

A. They appear to be, yes.

Q. Next one.

By the way, those paw prints went 60 feet south to Dorothy, didn't
they?

A. Something like that.

MR. BAKER: This is 2257.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 2257 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And with that other picture that we had, the first
one, in your view, shoe print? No shoe print? Can't tell?

A. Well, I don't think I can tell from that.

Q. It's got these spaces in it, lines across, right?

MR. BAKER: Okay. Put the other one back up.

MR. P. BAKER: 2214.

(Defendant's Exhibit No. 2214 displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Spaces in it, lines across. You don't have any
problem telling me that's a shoe print?

A. That appears to be a partial shoe print.

MR. BAKER: Phil, back it off over to that last one.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I want you to tell me if Nicole Brown Simpson's hand
is in blood.

MR. BAKER: Back it off, Phil.

A. If her hand is in blood, from the hand that you see depicted there.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which hand?

MR. KELLY: Which hand?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Looks like the left.

Is the right hand in blood and left not in blood?

A. Looks to be in blood, yes.

Q. And the left is not, correct?

A. You -- if you could pull that out a little bit so I could get a
better look. I haven't seen these in some time.

Well, they both appear to be -- this is in blood if you call this pool
blood. But this is in blood, also. It's got blood on it.

(Indicating.)

Q. The question was, the left one is not in blood; the right one is,
in your opinion; is that not correct, sir?

A. Well, it's --

Q. Well, is it or isn't it? Just say yes or no.

A. It's kind of a subjective call because this is partially in blood,
and I guess this is in more blood.

Q. Fair enough. Fine. You may resume your seat.

(Witness complies and resumes witness stand.)

MR. BAKER: Now, you want to take those off.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At Rockingham, after it was --

It was Fuhrman, by the way, was it not, that pointed out that
quarter-inch spot over the left door handle in the dark of night on
the morning of June 13,1994?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was Fuhrman who brought it to your attention, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was Fuhrman who told you that the -- the vehicle was parked
jutting out into the street, right?

A. No.

Q. And by the way, before you had observed -- well, strike that.

Is it your opinion that the -- the vehicle and the blood on the --
purported blood on the vehicle had nothing to do with your decision to
go over the wall and enter Mr. Simpson's house?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. State of mind is not relevant. What he saw and
heard?

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry, sir.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On state of mind?

THE COURT: State of mind is not relevant in that regard.

MR. BAKER: It goes to his bias; it goes to his credibility.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. If Mr. Baker wants to argue. We can go to side
bar.

MR. BAKER: I do want to argue; it goes to this witness's credibility.

THE COURT: I've sustained the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you feel, based on your viewing of the purported
mark on the door, and based upon the angle the vehicle was parked,
that someone inside the house may be a victim of a crime, may be
bleeding, or worse?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection, Your Honor. And also number 15 of your
prior ruling.

THE COURT: Sustained. Probable cause is not an issue. I've already
ruled on that.

MR. BAKER: I'm not talking about probable cause.

THE COURT: I'm not going to visit that issue again.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You would agree you had no reason to order Fuhrman
over the wall, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did Furman tell you, I can go over the wall, or
words to that effect, and you said, okay, go?

MR. MEDVENE: Hearsay, Your Honor. Object on that basis.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Something like that, yes.

MR. BAKER: Page 15490, February 21, 1995, questions by Marcia Clark.

MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on, Mr. Baker one second. His trial testimony?

MR. BAKER: Yes. It is -- it's 22195.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. BAKER: (Reading:) "Q. What happened next? "A. I looked at the
gate,

appeared to be a hydraulic gate.

Fuhrman was standing closest to the left

side of the gate. He said, I can go over the

wall. And I said okay, go. He at this time went over

the wall, stepped to his right, and

manually pulled the hydraulic gate open.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's what you said to Fuhrman; isn't that true?

A. Yes, that's my testimony.

Q. And so then you, Vannatter, Phillips, and Fuhrman go to the front
door of the house, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you ring the doorbell, right?

A. We banged on the door.

Q. You knew nobody was going to answer that door because you'd already
heard the telephone ring inside the house and nobody answered; isn't
that true?

A. I didn't know that for sure.

Q. Didn't you hear the phone?

You testified that you heard the phone ring outside the Ashford gate
when they called the residence phone of Mr. Simpson; isn't that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So you knew nobody's going to answer that, didn't you?

A. No. I think we were trying to make every effort to arouse anyone
that might be in the house. And I think that included knocking on the
door.

Q. So then you and your three colleagues go down the driveway to the
north path, and go around to the back of Mr. Simpson's house, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it is Fuhrman that knocks on the door relative to Kato Kaelin,
with you standing behind him, right?

A. Something like that.

Q. And it's Fuhrman that is the first one, and he turns and he says, I
think somebody's inside, after he knocks on that door; isn't that
true?

A. I believe he may have, yes.

Q. And then it's Fuhrman that interrogates Kato Kaelin after the door
is open, isn't it?

A. For the most part, yes.

Q. And you leave Fuhrman and you go to Arnelle Simpson's room after
you hear that she is still on the premises, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And every one of you leave Kato Kaelin with Fuhrman, and go to
Arnelle Simpson's room, right?

A. No. I believe I went to Arnelle's room with Phillips. I don't
recall exactly where Vannatter was.

Q. Is it your testimony, as you sit here today, that Vannatter stayed
with Fuhrman in the area of the front door of the guest room of Kato
Kaelin?

A. No. It's my testimony that I don't recall where he was.

Q. Do you have a recollection of him walking down the pathway with
him?

A. He may have.

Q. Do you have a recollection, after Arnelle got clothes on, that
Vannatter walked back towards Kato Kaelin's room with you?

A. I recall, if I'm not mistaken, there's a couple of steps that go up
towards the rear patio. And at the time, Vannatter was near Arnelle
and myself, and the rest as we walked towards the rear door.

I don't specifically recall Vannatter being on the walkway, but I
don't know. He may have. My attention wasn't on Vannatter.

Q. So what was your attention on?

A. The other occupants of the bungalows.

Q. So your attention was on Arnelle and Kato Kaelin?

A. Yes.

Q. Where were they relative to you?

A. Kaelin had answered his door, so he was on one side of the
threshold, and I was on the outside.

Once he told us that Arnelle was there, I walked to Arnelle's door,
which was adjacent to Kato's bungalow, with Phillips. And Phillips
knocked on the door and Arnelle answered. And she came out a short
time later.

Q. Now, so we can get this in chronological sequence, when -- when
Kato Kaelin came to the door, Mark Fuhrman identified the four of you
as LAPD officers, did he not?

A. He may have. I don't know if he did that initially.

Q. Well, you obviously have to identify yourselves as Los Angeles
Police Officers, wouldn't you --

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

Q. -- when you knock on the door of somebody's room?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. It's an argumentative question.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you or did you not identify yourselves?

A. Again, I don't specifically recall whether that happened initially
or later. I just have no recollection of that.

Q. You do recall, do you not, sir, the first words out of Kato
Kaelin's mouth were, "Did O.J.'s plane go down," don't you?

A. I never heard that.

Q. You've never heard Kato Kaelin say, did O.J.'s plane go down, while
you were standing virtually in front of the door of Mr. Kaelin's room?

A. I don't recall ever hearing that.

Q. So if he said --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

Q. -- that --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Let me finish the question.

MR. MEDVENE: It's hearsay. No need to.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Can I get an objection --

Never mind.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, during the entire time that you're at the
Simpson house --

MR. PETROCELLI: There was on objection on the record, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I sustained it --

MR. PETROCELLI: I understand.

THE COURT: -- Mr. Petrocelli, on the grounds that he said he didn't
hear anything.

MR. PETROCELLI: I understand. Mr. Baker indicated there was no --

THE COURT: Let's go on.

MR. PETROCELLI: -- objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, Mr. Lange, so that I'm clear, is it your
testimony that at no time while you were at O.J. Simpson's house,
between 5 o'clock and 6:45 in the morning of June 13, 1994, did you
know that Mr. Simpson had gone on a scheduled trip to Chicago the
evening before?

A. No. We found out later, once we were inside, once Kathy Randa was
contacted.

Q. And -- okay.

So that once -- well, let me go in sequence, and we'll come back to
that.

So it's your testimony that you have no recollection of the four of
you hearing anything about whether Mr. Simpson's plane went down, and
you left as soon as Kato Kaelin indicated to you that Arnelle Simpson
was on the property, and went to her bungalow, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection calls for conclusion, lack of foundation. The
question is the four of you hearing. He can just testify to himself,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Let's get some questions asked and answered.

A. I'm not saying he didn't say it; I'm saying I don't recall hearing
it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Maybe you didn't understand my question.

But in any event, you, the other three go down; you get Arnelle, and
come back and pick up Kato Kaelin and Mark Fuhrman on the way back
after Ms. Simpson had gotten some clothes on, correct?

A. No, I don't think Vannatter went to Arnelle's room. I think it was
Phillips and myself. We came back. At that time, I believe Fuhrman was
inside Kato's bungalow, speaking with him, and that Arnelle,
Vannatter, Phillips, and myself walked toward the rear door.

Q. Okay. You just don't have any recollection where Vannatter was in
this?

A. Not specifically.

Q. All right.

Now, after you got -- you walked back from Arnelle's room, and Mark
Fuhrman was in Kato Kaelin's room, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see him in that room?

A. Yes. It seems to me I did glance as we walked by it; he was inside
the room.

Q. Did you see him in the bathroom of Mr. Kaelin's guest area?

A. I don't recall that.

Q. Did you walk, then, up the stairs to the patio area?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you then go back in -- strike that.

Did you ask Ms. Arnelle Simpson, when you were out to her bungalow, to
get a key to get into the house?

A. I don't recall asking her. Vannatter may have asked her. I don't
recollect.

Q. Vannatter wasn't even there. You don't have any recollection of him
being there?

A. No. And I -- I testified that -- that Vannatter, Phillips, myself,
and Arnelle walked to the rear door.

Q. No, no, no.

I take it that once the three of you -- well, the two of you; that is,
the two LAPD types and Arnelle, walked down the walkway, which is
what, two and a half, three feet below this patio area here, is it
not?

A. Somewhat.

Q. And at some point in time, Vannatter joins you, right, and then you
walk up the steps. And you had -- you or Phillips had asked Arnelle to
get a key to the house, hadn't you?

A. I don't recall asking her. Phillips may have, Vannatter may have. I
don't recall.

Q. Well if Vannatter wasn't there, he obviously didn't.

A. Well, I --

I don't know where Vannatter was.

Q. Now, you then had a clear recollection of Arnelle Simpson opening,
with the key, the southeast door that is indicated on whatever exhibit
this is.

MR. P. BAKER: 116.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's the door you went in?

A. I believe so.

Q. And Arnelle Simpson hit the pad and de-alarmed the house?

A. I believe so.

Q. As a matter of fact, Mr. Lange, there's absolutely no alarm pad
back there, is there?

A. I don't know.

Q. As a matter of fact, Detective Lange, there's absolutely no key
that can go in that door; it locks only from the inside; isn't that
true?

A. My recollection is that she keyed our way in from --

Q. Isn't it true, sir, that what really occurred is, you walked all
the way around the north and went up the driveway, and went into the
entrance?

(Indicating to exhibit 116.)

A. That's absolutely false.

Q. Now, by the way, sir, was there a black and white at the -- in the
area of Ashford and Rockingham when you requested Fuhrman, or gave him
permission to go over the wall?

A. There was a black and white that showed up around that time. I
don't recall specifically when.

Q. There were two other officers that were present when you directed
Fuhrman to go over the wall, and they were still in their black and
white; isn't that true?

A. I don't recall that.

Q. Well, you recall a black and white being there between the time of
your arrival just after 5:00 and before you left at 6:45, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, so, is it your testimony, then, that you walked in the door,
the southeast door, and walked into the kitchen area?

A. Well, towards the kitchen area, yes.

Q. Nobody turned on any lights in the den area, did they?

A. I don't recall anyone doing that, no.

Q. In other words, now, the first person that goes in this house is
Arnelle, right?

A. I don't recall who stepped through the doorway first.

Q. Now, you had believed prior to this entering this house, that this
house -- someone inside the house may be a victim of crime, correct?

A. That was my concern; that's correct.

Q. And of course, all four of you LAPD officers carried side arms that
night, June 13, 1994, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Not one of you drew a side arm before entering that house, correct?

A. I don't think we need it for a victim.

Q. Not one of you drew a side arm before you entered that house,
right?

A. No, there was no reason to draw a side arm.

Q. Not one.

In fact, you thought that somebody may be in the house bleeding, or
worse, that a crime was taking place, before you sent Fuhrman over the
wall; isn't that true, sir?

A. I thought there may be one or two victims inside, yes.

Q. You thought a crime may be taking place inside the house, didn't
you, sir?

A. No, not at all.

Q. Not at all?

You thought that that probably had already taken place, correct?

A. It wouldn't have been five hours since the bodies had been found.
It was starting to get light. That was not a major concern of mine,
no.

Q. Then why didn't you go get a search warrant?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Probable cause not an issue. Objection sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So as I understand it, then, you thought somebody
could be inside the house bleeding or dying, and the first person that
goes through the door is Arnelle Simpson, right?

A. I don't recall her going through the door first. That's not to say
she didn't. I don't recall who went through the door first.

Q. Well, you certainly would want, if there was somebody bleeding or
dying inside that residence, you would want to be the first person in
that house, as a detective of 20-plus years, and make sure that you
discovered and assisted a victim if there, in fact, there was a
victim, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Question is argumentative compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you ever, after you got in the house, go
upstairs, Mr. Lange?

A. No.

Q. You never went upstairs to look to see if a victim was dying or
bleeding upstairs?

A. No. Once we contacted Kathy Randa, we got an explanation. There was
no evidence of any kind of a struggle in the house. Everything was in
place. The maid's quarters was immaculate.

We later found out that the maid wasn't even there over the weekend,
so there was no reason to go upstairs.

Q. Well, so, it was after you contacted Kathy Randa that you knew
everything was in order, right?

A. No. The first thing I did upon entering is --

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, your honor. The witness is answering a
question.

MR. BAKER: The witness is being nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT: The witness is not responding.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You just testified that after you contacted Kathy
Randa, you knew everything was okay in the house, and so there was no
need to go upstairs, correct?

A. That was my impression, yes.

Q. An so from the time you got inside the house until you contacted
Kathy Randa, woke her up and found out where O.J. Simpson was, was
what, five, seven, ten minutes?

A. Oh, I don't know how long it was.

Q. But during that whole period of time, you never went upstairs and
viewed anything upstairs to see if there was any victim that you
thought may be dying or bleeding, as before you authorized Fuhrman to
go over the wall, correct.

MR. MEDVENE: The question is argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Move to strike the answer.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) During the time periods that you were in the house
-- you say you walked back in and there was no -- you walked through
the bar/den area towards the dining room and the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. And the area from, I guess it would be the south, there's a pool
table right where my finger is, in this area here. Is there not?

(Indicating.)

A. Yes.

Q. And that's below the area that is where the bar and the den are,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And this whole area from where my finger is, where this room
indicates, where this room is on the southeast side of the main house,
that is all open, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And the bar area is right adjacent to where the pool area -- pool
table is, correct?

A. It's up and over to the left, yes.

Q. And then there's sofas around here, and TV sets embedded into this
wall in here, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And this is a pretty good size area, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. Beyond that is a dining room, a formal dining room?

A. Yes.

Q. Beyond that, you enter the kitchen and then go -- which is a
good-sized kitchen, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. Then you go into a kitchen nook area, true?

A. If you were to continue walking in that direction, yes.

Q. And if you continue to walk in that direction, you can walk right
out onto the driveway of Mr. Simpson's place, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, is it your testimony that you walked in the southeast entrance
and didn't turn on any lights, and you walked through the bar/den
area, through the dining room area, and into the kitchen, without
anybody turning any lights on?

A. There was a light on inside the house. And I -- my testimony was, I
didn't recall anyone turning the lights on. There appeared to be
enough light inside for me to move around.

Q. So we were worried about a possible victim in the house. There is
an entire panel of light switches by the door that you say you came
in, and no one turned them on.

MR. MEDVENE: The question is argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you tell Arnelle, don't turn any lights
on; we wouldn't want to go through the den and kitchen -- of the
kitchen with just our flashlights?

A. No, I don't recall asking her where -- I recall asking her where
the housekeeper's quarters were.

Q. In fact, was it you or Vannatter that went with Arnelle to the
housekeeper's room?

A. I think we both did.

Q. And you are LAPD detectives of over 40 years' experience, let her
go in first, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Question is argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: You did have her go in first, didn't you?

A. I don't recall who went in first.

Q. Now --

A. Certainly when we got in, he walked by there. I don't recall her
leading the way into the house at all.

Q. Do you recall --

THE COURT: 8:30 tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the
case. Don't form or express any opinion.

(At 4:35 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, December 11,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)
