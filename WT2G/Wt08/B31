</CENTER>
After its second year in existence, the Somerset Parent's Auxiliary has truly become a worthwhile body, due to the strong support of parents, staff and friends.  As with its inaugural year in 1995, the numbers attending meetings in 1996 were around 50 at each meeting, with the 'special' get-togethers such as champagne breakfasts attracting 70 plus.  The attendance though of 140 people at the Auxiliary's Melbourne Cup Lunch, was a resounding indication of the eagerness of parents to support Auxiliary functions.<BR>
Committee members Sharon Hunter, Kerry Watts, Jenny Blyth, Mary Warren, Susie Goldstein and Denise Benjamin feel proud of what the Auxiliary and its supporters have achieved.  "Compiling and publishing Somerset's first edition of the family directory in 1995, and then the second edition in 1996 has been one of the highlights," said the committee.  "The fact that many more families took part in 1996 tells us that the directory has become a very handy and helpful publication to the families taking part, which they do on a strictly voluntary basis."<BR>
The opportunity for parents to meet with various members of staff and guest speakers from outside organisations is another pleasing aspect the Auxiliary offers.  "Although some of the topics this year have been serious and ones which many parents are keen to hear about, others have been light-hearted and very entertaining," reports the committee.  "The guest speaker Graham Hyman had everyone intoxicated on laughter with his very humorous address on the pressures facing today's teenagers and their parents."<BR>
The question now facing Sharon, Kerry, Jenny, Mary, Susie and Denise is whether there is life after the Auxiliary.  After a very successful two years the reins have now been handed over to a very motivated group of ladies - Diann Eadeh, Fiona Spencer, Carol Burow, Jacki Hendy and Karen Ramsay.  From what we've heard so far 1997 is going to be an even better year of Auxiliary events!  See you in 1997.

</CENTER>
Slim lines of text fire fantastic pictures in the mind, conjured in works from Aristotle to Zeno. What defines these and pictures, dance, sculpture, music, wine et al as art rather than decoration is that it is necessary to comprehend in order to gain satisfactory perception: there is personal work required.  The rules are dynamic;  the parameters of appreciation vary between experiences. 
<P>
The right and duty to peers and audience of an author is to play words and rules of words against ideas.  Correctness of expression is subjective, adverbs become verbs for purpose of colour, words change pronunciation and spelling, "centre" begets "center" by popular use.  Strict adherence to the letter of grammar and spelling is subtle illiteracy;  it assumes permanence against a paradigm of change, misunderstanding the concept, function and history of language. 
<P>
In contrast to the requirements of art, advertising for instance often relies on effortless attraction, drawing attention without perception so as not to distract from focus on the object "to be desired".  The purpose is to redirect then suspend the thinking of a being long enough to get money from it.  Competition between comparable concepts and products is what market forces are:  agents for evolving the concept of "best", and thus defining it, within a mix of similarities... the truly novel stirs the pot, generating undeserved praise for such action without direction.  Compliments for the arrangement of the deck chairs on a new ship.
<P>
So it is with modern prose via word processors and web, concentration on the floss on the top.  Multiple fonts, colours, pictures and style-conforming documents convey content but the electronic effort is in the decoration.  It can be changed willy nilly by subtle currents within silicon chips.  The content, the intelligence, the imagination presented with such devices cannot be short circuited into existence; it requires personal attention to make and to appreciate....and so delightful designs gain currency as the whirl of market forces mindlessly manufacture a premium for presentations.  There is no particular font  of all knowledge, any one would do.
<P>
The economy that could be made!  So many web pages have text-only options because of the size of the accompanying decoration.  So much time is spent, paper wasted and megabytes occupied by attempts to make the perfect document, altered and reprinted as files or on paper for the principal principle of presentation.  A comma is left out, a reprint is made;  a wurd is misspelt, a reprint is made;  the backwash of colour for a poem is not quite right, a reprint is made; a document does not conform to institution style rules, a reprint is made (in triplicate).
<P>
The managing director of a multi-national computer hardware and software company has banned the use of Microsoft "Power Point" from his organisation after a survey estimated that thousands of man-years  had been spent on making "perfect" overhead projector slides.  He also considers modern word processers to be information encryption programs and wonders why people need sound in their spreadsheets.  The internet fathers bemoan the advent of the web, plain text being the lowest common denominator for transferring ideas, even colourful ones.  Text is simple, small and at least capable of being  made succinct. 
<P>
Xerox started it in the 1970's, but didn't know what to do with it.  Steve Jobs marketed it in the Macintosh with the support of Microsoft.  In the mid 80's  the "Gates" of hell opened windows onto our world,  unleashing the Hannibal Lecter of the information age, ripping off the Graphical User (inter)face, loading all PC users with the need for color (no, it is most definitely not "colour" anywhere in computing), faster processors, megabytes of RAM which a pundit of five years ago would have thought large for a hard disc, er disk... and disks bigger than many CD's to store it all.  Things are changing - smaller, simpler, cheaper - but there is still another generation of gargantuan PC's to come... although as Niels Bohr said  "Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future".
<P>
Rally against complexity and against slavish adherence to rules of form, use a spell wrecker by choice and revel in typographic ambivalence.  Email is our great saviour, tersely tossed messages with transposed and missed letters, the value is still there and is seen to be so. Spell phonetically.  Where would 'enry 'iggins be without writing that reflected speaking? Mark Twain said, "I respect a man who knows how to spell a word more than one way".  Do not get off a train of thought for the baggage of convention, for convention is a passing thing, and it is passing ever faster.  Abraham Lincoln said, "The best thing about the future is that it only comes one day at a time", but these days, each day holds more. 
<P>
I do not advocate anarchy.  It would be a pity to die of a misprint after reading a health book. Recognise that "convention" is  fuzzy and in flux and should be treated with  more verve and less respect.   Tradition is essentially habit which has lost its purpose.  "Omnia mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis." (All things are subject to change and we change with them). Change involves personal action.  Will Rogers said, "Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there".
<P>
The Network computer is coming, under $1000 next year, free with your breakfast cereal a little later, it will be very small, portable and connectable.  One of the problems of miniaturisation, apart from how to spell the word , is fitting those massive finger tips on one small key at a time.  With mobile phones it's bad enough but a full keyboard is a real challenge.  Give a thought to those whose alphabets are larger than ours.   
<P>
I leave you with a potential educational solution for the problem of spelling and number of keys on a keyboard, again from Mark Twain:
<P>
...For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replaced either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all. Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez "c", "y" and "x" -- bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez -- tu riplais "ch", "sh", and "th" rispektivli.<BR>

</CENTER>
Greetings everyone,
<P>
Well, unfortunately not a lot of notice was given for Old Students' Day and we were a little concerned over the number of you that may not have received information in time.  However, it looks as if we underestimated the power of word-of-mouth as it turned out to be one of the most successful days yet, both in terms of the number of different sports played and the number of former students who just turned up to see what was happening.<BR>
The Bill Kerezsi Memorial Shield for the soccer match was awarded to both the present and the former students as a dubious decision by the referee resulted in a 3-3 draw!<BR>
The <A HREF="mailto:csayer@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Richardson</A> Shield for rugby was introduced for the first time this year and was won by the former students in a close match that saw a couple of lead changes during the game.<BR>
The soccer, rugby, mixed softball, mixed hockey and netball game that was organised on the day were all played with an exceptional amount of skill considering that a number of us haven't participated in these sports since leaving school.<BR>
All these sports plus men's and women's basketball will be included in next year's programme and hopefully we will have a shield or trophy for every sport by that time.  If you know of anyone who would be interested in donating a perpetual shield please contact the Old Students' Association.<BR>
Next year, Old Students' Day will undergo a spot of reformatting and will be known as 'Back to Somerset Weekend'.  The idea behind this is that we will be able to incorporate our usual sports and social events in a school Open Day concept that will give everyone the opportunity to see the sort of activities that Somerset undertakes these days.<BR>
Also, 1997 will be the tenth year since the first group of Year 12s left and to mark this special occasion there will be the inaugural  '10th Year Reunion Dinner' held on the Saturday evening of the Back to Somerset Weekend.  More information to the Class of '87 leavers will be forthcoming.<BR>
The annual Christmas Dinner was held on Friday 13th December at the Hog's Breath Cafe, Marina Mirage.  As usual a great night was had by all!<BR>
For those of you with internet access, the former students have a homepage on Somerset's server.  Go to http://somerset.qld.edu.au/alumni.html, leave your own details and check out who else has been through in the last couple of months.<BR>
On a final note, we spend a considerable amount of time trying to keep track of the whereabouts of former students.  If you have moved in the last couple of years or know of someone who has, please forward the details to the school so that you can be kept informed on what's happening with the Old Students' Association.<BR>
If you have any queries please call Jane Ryan on 5530 3777 or myself on 5593 3547 or email Jane at jryan@somerset.qld.edu.au or myself at clintdb@post1.com.
<P>
All the best for a Merry Christmas and prosperous new year!

When Ben Cartwright graduated from Somerset College in 1994 he had his sights set firmly on a career in the Royal Australian Air Force.  What most attracted Ben about this career was the fact that he would be provided with a University Degree through the Australian Defence Force Academy thus fulfilling his desire to become a pilot in the RAAF.<BR>
Over the past three years not only has Ben been learning the necessary skills to become a pilot but he has also been trained in leadership and will be able to apply this knowledge when he becomes a Senior Flight Lieutenant.<BR>
A pleasant surprise for Ben has been the extensive travel throughout Australia he has had to undertake for his training.   The Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne, RAAF bases in Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane, Newcastle, Tindal and Townsville are just a few of the places at which Ben has been stationed.<BR>
"The training is both interesting and challenging," says Ben who had never even considered picking up a gun before and is now quite comfortable using a F-988 Steyer and 9mm Browning.<BR>
An RAAF Combat Survival Course conducted in Townsville had Ben escaping, evading and surviving a hostile environment after having had to eject from his plane!  Not only were the survival skills extremely valuable, the holiday at the end of the course had Ben taking in the sights of Townsville and Magnetic Island!<BR>
Next year Ben will study Honours in Physics to add to his degree.<BR>
"I now plan to commence a Pilot's Course early in 1998.  I would like to go to FA-18s (Hornets) and this will take an extra two years at Williamstown for conversion training to jets," says an enthusiastic Ben.<BR>
In 1995 he was fortunate enough to get a ride in the 'basic' jet trainer used by the RAAF, the 'Macchi'.<BR>
"This was one of the most exciting experiences of my life and words cannot express the elation I felt."<BR>
Later in his career Ben would like to go to the Australian Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at Adelaide to become a Test Pilot.<BR>
For anyone considering a career in the Australian Defence Force, particularly the RAAF, it can be a very challenging and rewarding career.<BR>
The Australian Defence Force Academy offers degrees in Arts, Science and Engineering.  Training, meals, accommodation and wages are provided.<BR>
"The mateship is outstanding, some of the friendships I've formed here will stay with me for life," Ben says.<BR>
Information about the Academy can be obtained through Recruiting in Brisbane or through Student Guidance Counsellor <A HREF="mailto:nscott@somerset.qld.edu.au">Noel Scott</A> at Somerset College.<BR>
"Finally I would just like to finish off with five words," says Ben. "Air Force - Way to Go!!"

</CENTER>
1996 has seen many changes to our sports structure and while we anticipated many teething problems those fears were largely unfounded as we have sailed through with solid results and increased opportunities for our students.<BR>
Our inter-school sports association was reduced to five participating schools this year - AB Paterson College, All Saints' Anglican School, Emmanuel College, Trinity Lutheran College and Somerset College.<BR>
The schools involved were all supportive of using our sporting afternoons more productively and this meant that some teams were able to finish after school time.  This fortunately has been a rare occurrence and the occasional inconvenience has been more than compensated for by our sports people being engaged in meaningful competition where games are no longer halted at half time in order to meet buses.<BR>
*We have also committed to our winter and summer sports and will no longer have to justify the inclusion of sport each year.  With this consistent approach we have begun the process of developing all our sports through from the junior school to Year 12.<BR>
The positive aspects of this have already flowed through with coaches being more committed to upgrading their own expertise, realising it can be used each year.<BR>
The reduced size of the new sports association has also allowed us to offer our development sports in school time.  This year was our first trial for the formal inclusion of rowing, sailing, golf, kayaking, equestrian, middle distance running and cycling into the regular inter-school time slots.  Our development sports, through talent identification programmes, have already reaped some excellent results with Jamie Williams, Darren Tonna, Bridget Woodman and Nicholas Crilly being selected in the Australian Junior Kayak Team and Sara Carrigan and Natalie Aitken representing Queensland in cycling after being identified at school only 18 months ago.<BR>
While many of our young athletes chose to train for development sport, just as many remained committed to our inter-school sports competition with our 1st XV Rugby, 13 years Rugby, 1st XI Soccer (boys), 1st XI Hockey (boys and girls), Junior Hockey (boys) - all winning premierships.  Our 1st XI Hockey girls went on to place 4th in the state wide Telstra Cup - a tremendous effort.<BR>
Our summer sport teams have achieved similar success particularly our cricket and tennis teams who have remained on top of the ladder so far this season.<BR>
With so many students striving towards elite performance the school saw a real need to help the students combine the strenuous academic load at Somerset with their sporting commitments.  The new sports development support program co-ordinated by <A HREF="mailto:bnewell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Brendan Newell</A> will give the necessary support to all students involved in elite sport from Years 8-12.  This programme however will focus primarily on the growing number of students choosing to study their senior certificate over 3 years thus enabling them to pursue sporting excellence while maintaining their best academic performance.<BR>
The culmination of a busy year in sport is the Sports Awards Dinner that is so well supported by students and parents.  In this Olympic year we were lucky to be joined by David Weightman and Robert Scott who won silver in Atlanta in the double sculls - rowing.  Congratulations to all those who were presented with awards on the night.<BR>
Finally, I would like to thank all the staff who give so freely of their time to coach and support our young students in their endeavours.<BR>
I look forward to 1997 now with its new challenges in sport.

<BR>
With the cross country season complete it was straight into athletics and this rather diverse sport saw many students exploring their potential whilst using the 5 star award programme in PE, and training with <A HREF="mailto:tmcdonald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Tony McDonald</A> and <A HREF="mailto:ahalloran@somerset.qld.edu.au">Andrew Halloran</A> during lunch times and before or after school.<BR>
The Years 1-3 children busily prepared their 'Mini Olympic Opening Ceremony' and refined their running and jumping techniques,  whilst the Year 4-7 students began their inter-house competitions that lead up to the House Carnival.  Thirteen school records were broken on House Athletics day and this was a record of its own.  Veivers House won the shield and Starkey were certainly the most 'spirited' (vocally) on the day.  <BR>
The District Carnival was extremely successful with Somerset gaining a second place and ten students being selected for Regionals.  This year, five students travelled to Townsville for the State Championships:  Marc Llewellyn, David McIntosh, Nathan Keilar, Craig Hembrow and Cappi Lonnquist, all Year 7 students and all potential champions.  <BR>
The S.E.A.T. Carnival was hosted by Somerset with over 100 students competing.  It was certainly a spectacular event.  The team gained second place and set nine new S.E.A.T. records.  The highlight, if you could pick only one of many, would be the final race of the day, in the all age school relay 10 x 100m event.  Somerset won this event and re-set the S.E.A.T. record that Somerset has held for four years.<BR>
A new venture for the five S.E.A.T schools - Trinity, All Saints, Emmanuel, AB Paterson and Somerset - was a summer sports competition which included sports such as cricket, touch football, softball and basketball for all students from Years 4-7.  Our venues were chosen, the teams set, which only left staff and children to prepare for a competition that would be aiming for the development of primary sport with an emphasis on skill development, as opposed to championship points, and also to build friendships among the children from the S.E.A.T. schools.<BR>
After-school training began on Wednesdays in term 4 and with the assistance of many parents and staff the season has been very rewarding for all.  Somerset has hosted the basketball and softball,  Emmanuel the touch football and All Saints the cricket.  Trinity Primary School joined the inter-school sports programme for the first time as have all the Year 4s of our schools.<BR>
Nineteen ninety-six has been a very successful and enjoyable year for both students and staff of Somerset and I am very grateful to all who have given so much time and enthusiastic support to ensure that our sporting and Physical Education programmes are rewarding experiences.

</CENTER>
Somerset College has come of age in the hockey arena.  After years of battling through competitions on the Gold Coast, Somerset's girls hockey team finally realised their potential in this year's state wide 'Telstra Cup'.<BR>
The seventeen member squad started their assault in round one back in June.  Among their conquests was last year's zone winners Palm Beach-Currumbin High.  Somerset went through the first four rounds undefeated.<BR>
"It was a tremendous effort," says skills coach Karen Crowley.  "The school had never progressed past the first round in previous years, but the girls played really well and grew in confidence with each win."<BR>
That was evident in the zone final against Ipswich Girls Grammar.  The Somerset girls thrashed their opposition 5 goals to nil.<BR>
The semi-finals of the 'Telstra Cup' were held in late October at the State Hockey Centre in conjunction with the Australian State Finals.<BR>
"Our team was the only one to make the finals that had never played on artificial turf.  Normally they play on grass, so they were up against the odds right from the start," says Karen.<BR>
But that wasn't going to deter the Somerset squad.  Their dedication and determination never more evident than in the lead up to the finals.<BR>
Centre forward, Monique Fox, a real leader and talker amongst the squad, sprained her ankle the week before the finals, but her determination saw her take the field heavily strapped.  She wasn't able to play a full game but her presence helped the team's performance.<BR>
Somerset College finished fourth overall.  A great effort considering ninety schools took part in the 'Telstra Cup', and according to Karen Crowley, the future looks promising.<BR>
"This year's squad was made up of only three Year 12 students, the rest of the team came from Years 11, 10 and 9 so if we can keep it together the girls can only keep improving," says Karen.<BR>
Keeping the squad together shouldn't be a problem.  Success breeds success and already a number of new players have voiced their intentions of trying to make the team.<BR>
They'll need to be dedicated.  This year's squad put in four to five training sessions each week.<BR>
"It was tough on them at the end of the season," says Karen.  "They had to train early mornings and at lunch time because they'd already started training for their summer sports."<BR>
The infectious team spirit has seen a special bond develop amongst the girls.  Player Kate Clements recently wrote on behalf of the team: "Over the year we have bonded together, not as individuals playing on a team but as a unit working together to become one.  We have found that by working as a team you can exceed your own individual ability levels;  all you need is determination and a confidence in yourself and your team mates."<BR>
The squad uses the adage "a champion team is better than a team of champions" as its motto.  Who knows, next year they may have it both ways.

<BR>
Cycling is a relatively new sport at Somerset College and yet the school has established itself as the best on the Gold Coast and in the top four in Australia.<BR>
Two years ago, Somerset teachers <A HREF="mailto:gwand@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graham Wand</A> and <A HREF="mailto:rjackson@somerset.qld.edu.au">Ray Jackson</A> set about establishing a cycling programme for the school.<BR>
A talent identification programme selected a dozen Year 8 students who showed both the physical attributes and a keenness to the sport.<BR>
"We kicked it off with four mornings a week over the Christmas holidays just to give the kids a moderate feel of handling skills and road riding experience," says <A HREF="mailto:gwand@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graham Wand</A>.<BR>
The students started riding around velodromes and car parks before advancing to road training.<BR>
Graham says, "Logistically it's a difficult sport to get organised mainly for safety reasons.  We have a strong student/staff ratio when we're road training, usually say around four to one."<BR>
Along with staff involvement a number of cyclists from the Gold Coast 'Cats' Club dedicate their time to assisting the students.<BR>
Some of their fellow riders are former world champions.<BR>
"These guys ride alongside the students.  For the kids it's a great learning experience.  Usually they'd look at these old cyclists and think they'd be better off at home in the garden or watching TV; afterall what would they know?  But when they're out on the road, setting the pace and talking race riding tactics, the kids get a real buzz and realise these old blokes can teach them a thing or two," says Graham.<BR>
The squad has come a long way from riding borrowed bikes 20 to 30 kilometres around car parks.<BR>
These days the female-dominated squad trains 120 to 130 kilometres a session.  A dawn ride to Murwillumbah or up to Sanctuary Cove is not unusual.  The cyclists train around four times a week and compete on weekends.<BR>
"The students have surprised themselves.  If you'd told them when they started they'd be able to ride from Mudgeeraba to Springwood they would have laughed at you, but that is one of our training runs," said Graham.<BR>
The training is paying off.  Somerset College established itself as the best on the Coast at the annual inter-school championships, and things will only get better.  Next year the cyclists will introduce gym work into their training schedules.<BR>
Not surprisingly, the cyclists' physical prowess has been matched in the class room with a number of students performing well above their former academic levels.  <A HREF="mailto:gwand@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graham Wand</A> isn't surprised.<BR>
"The commitment, discipline and organisation needed to put in the work on the bike has to overflow to other areas of their lives."

</CENTER>
The ancient art of swordsmanship is being kept well and truly alive in these modern times at Somerset College, courtesy of our very own swordsman Jesse Braid.<BR>
The Year 8 student took up the sport only four years ago, and earlier this year became the Under 13 National Champion, a title he won in Brisbane.<BR>
While swords were well established in the Bronze Age, modern fencing is practised with three weapons, the foil, the epee and the sabre.<BR>
Jesse has displayed an expertise with the foil well beyond his years.  The thirteen year old was one of fifty competitors at the Nationals and won his age title taking on the best the country has to offer.<BR>
"There were both left-handers and right-handers competing so it really tested my skills and ability," said Jesse.<BR>
The National Champion was decided by the swordsman with the most victories over the scheduled programme.<BR>
"There are five points in each bout, a point is won by hitting a target on the body between the chest and stomach," explains Jesse.<BR>
Fencing is only one sport that Jesse participates in, but it takes up most of his spare time.<BR>
"I do a little bit of rowing and play touch football but I train three times a week for my fencing.  My coach is Commonwealth Games swordsman Michael O'Brien - he's trained a few Olympians so who knows where it will end with me," said Jesse.<BR>
Jesse trains at Southport and the Broadbeach Police Boys Club. <BR>
"Some of my mates come and watch me train and have a bit of a fence. They enjoy it, it's a fun sport and it keeps you healthy and fit."<BR>
Jesse took up the sport after moving close to the Broadbeach Police Boys Club.<BR>
"Mum was the one who pushed me into it and I'm glad she did," said Jesse.<BR>
This time mum really did know best - TOUCH.

</CENTER>
Every year the students at Somerset College are provided with the opportunity to participate in a wide range of sports.  However one sport that is not offered is ice hockey due to the unavailability of ice rinks and the rarity of the game in our hot climate.  One person who has taken up the game at Iceland Bundall despite these drawbacks is Alfie Phillips.<BR>
Alfie's interest in ice hockey began with his participation in field hockey and in-line skating which later combined into in-line hockey.  At the beginning of this year Alfie took up ice hockey in the position of goalie and has been playing ever since.  His enthusiasm and dedication to practices four times a week with his club team, Gold Coast Grizzleys, awarded him a place as the youngest player in the Under 13 Queensland team.  Having only taken up ice hockey at the start of 1996, this is an achievement for any young person.  However at just ten years of age, Alfie's selection is outstanding.<BR>
On October 11, Alfie and the Queensland team met in Brisbane and travelled by coach to Sydney where they competed in the National Titles.  Their accommodation for their week in Sydney was at a Cable Ski Park, from where they travelled to the Blackburn Skating Rink for the competition.<BR>
The team came a very promising 3rd at the Championships<BR>
which now places them in a position to play for the 'President's Cup' in Perth next year.<BR>
Alfie will be attending a special 'Goalies' School' in Sydney in January for three days of intensive training which he can't wait for.<BR>
When asked about his experience in Sydney Alfie simply replied, "It was fierce, fast and a lot of fun!"

On March 18 next year Somerset College's rowing teams will be competing in the Maadi Cup New Zealand Secondary National Championships.  They will be competing against teams from countries including England, South Africa, Canada, Asia and the United States.<BR>
Eleven boys will be competing in the Under 15, four and eight Quads on Lake Karapiro, Cambridge on the North Island.<BR>
In the months leading up to the event, our competitors will have four training sessions per week both on the water and in the gym.  They will average about 50 kilometres per week.  During the Christmas break there will be no slowing down as they will be attending two training camps where they will work for 8-9 hours per day.  All this training is necessary to compete at the highest level possible whilst in New Zealand.<BR>
During their visit to New Zealand it won't be all hard work and no play.  The boys will be billeted with New Zealand families and will have the opportunity to see the sights including the mud pools of Rotorua and riding on the luge.<BR>
According to rowing coach, <A HREF="mailto:mtwigg@somerset.qld.edu.au">Martin Twigg</A>, the best conditions for rowing are calm winds or a slight tailwind.  A headwind will make the job even harder and possibly slower.  The competitors are expecting mild weather, although some rain is always expected whilst in New Zealand!  The team was invited by New Zealand rowing on their ability, previous performances and availability.<BR>
Each of the boys will be conducting their own fundraising, holding raffles etc.  A social evening for parents and friends was held in the Koala House on 29 November.<BR>
The team will be leasing an eight man boat and also buying a Kiwi built Quad.  They will proudly be wearing the Somerset College rowing uniform.<BR>
Everybody at Somerset would like to wish Martin and the rowers the very best of luck in New Zealand.  If the hard work has been done, I'm sure the boys will be very successful in their attempt to bring home the Maadi Cup.
<P>
Simon Harris<BR>

</CENTER>
1996 has been a very successful year for Somerset dance students. Royal Academy of Dancing exam results were the highest yet. Students worked very hard and were rewarded with excellent results.  The dancers also enjoyed the chance to perform in 'The Performers in Training Concert Series'.  There was also the welcome return of Raquel Guthrie, former student and one of the first dance students at Somerset.  Raquel who spent 12 months in Sweden as an exchange student now attends Griffith University as an Arts student.  Raquel danced a Modern Solo choreographed for her by Louise Schriek in the 1996 Ballet Concert held in November in the Performing Arts Theatre.<BR>
The concert, which was the highlight of the year, had all children taking part.  It covered all forms of dance from Tap, Classical Ballet, Modern Dance and Jazz Ballet.  <BR>
It was an eagerly awaited night of tremendous excitement and fun with the students performing in front of their parents and friends in a first class production. 
<P>
Louise Schriek<BR>

"I'll Be There For You"<BR>
So, no one told you life was gonna be this way,<BR>
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.<BR>
It's like you're always stuck in second gear.<BR>
Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year. But
<P>
I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.<BR>
I'll be there for you like I've been there before.<BR>

<P>
You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight.<BR>
You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great.<BR>
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,<BR>

I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.<BR>
I'll be there for you like I've been there before.<BR>
I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me, too.
<P>
No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me.<BR>
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me.<BR>
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with, someone I'll always laugh with.<BR>
Even at my worst, I'm best with you.  Yeah!
<P>
It's like you're always stuck in second gear.<BR>
Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year.  But
<P>
I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.<BR>
I'll be there for you like I've been there before.<BR>
I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me, too.

</CENTER>
The gathering of the school on Scholars' Day marks both the end of another academic year and,  for our matriculating students, the commencement of life beyond school.
<P>
This is a proper time for us to reflect on the past, enjoy the present, and speculate on what the future might hold for each one of us.
<P>
In a typically insightful analysis Hedley Beare, Emeritus Professor in Education at the University of Melbourne, has suggested that we should view the future in a flexible way, involving a whole range of possible futures which can then be narrowed down to a range of probable futures, which in turn would, or perhaps would not, contain a range of preferable futures.
<P>
The futures looming before us as we move towards a new century and a new millennium are at once both exciting and frightening.  Exciting if we accept the opportunities that an avalanche of change will bring and frightening if we fail to prepare ourselves with the intellectual and social resources we will need to ride this wave of change.
<P>
Following the lead of Dr Rick Slaughter who wrote a critique on megatrends in a 1993 edition of the journal "Futures", Beare lists his top 50 megatrends:  for global citizenship, the world of work, and for personal development.   You will probably be relieved to know that I intend to take just a few examples to illustrate and draw some conclusions about outcomes which might have some bearing on schools in general and this school in particular.
<P>
First - Technology.<BR>
	The way we use computers will gently refashion how we think about knowledge - what it is, how it is accessed, how knowledge is produced, who owns it.
<P>
	Individuals will increasingly have personal access to the international economy through credit cards and trans national banks.  Travel and overseas residence will be much easier.
<P>
	World economy will be controlled not so much by nations as by regional centres of trade & finance (and perhaps increasingly by multinational companies).
<P>
Although not specifically mentioned, the driving force underlying these changes is the world wide computer and information net works.
<P>
Second - Social Issues.<BR>
	Change in families may escalate.  Currently 50% of fathers and mothers will separate and remarry while their children are still at school. Many children will not know their grandparents because of family blending and because families will move so often.
<P>
	Frequent job or location changes will increase. Up to 16 or 17  job changes during a working life will not be unusual.  Most Australians will work overseas at some time.
<P>
Third - Employment.<BR>
	The newly prosperous nations will trade in non material goods, like technical skills, brain power and knowhow.  Wealth will come from problem solving and strategic brokerage. Prosperity will depend on the ability to create value through people.
<P>
	Employment patterns will be largely based on contracts and fixed term projects for an agreed fee.
<P>
	Work will tend to ebb and flow with the worker managing his or her own career like a one person business. 
<P>
Fourth - World Demographics.<BR>
	The Asia/Pacific area will have become the epicentre of world economics actively by 2010. (Japan and Korea are currently Australia's two largest overseas markets).
<P>
	Our nearest neighbour Indonesia is the world's most densely populated nation and the world's largest Muslim country.  In 2006 it will be larger than Japan and Russia  but still less populous than India.
<P>
	People born in China and India will make up more than half the world's population by 2020.  Chinese and Indian people living overseas will be extremely influential in the world networking webs.
<P>
What Role Should Young Australians Seek to Play ?<BR>
Clearly the old Australian phrase "she'll be right" needs to be consigned to history.  This is a time for effort and foresight if we are to make the most of the opportunities we all share - a time to 'seize the moment'.
<P>
Nowhere is this more evident than in a school like Somerset. 
<P>
This school's engineering technology facilities are the most advanced in the nation - in fact there may be few schools in the world with this level of technology.
<P>
<BR>
 
<P>
All of our computers are linked into the global communications network.  How this has grown since Mr Taylor's early pioneering work with the Homelink system which allowed young Somersetians to dial into the school computer from home just a few years ago..
<P>
Pupils as young as ten years of age can routinely communicate with other pupils in any country in the world.
<P>
Looking further ahead the academic staff at the school are reviewing the curriculum changes in Years 8, 9 and 10 which will be introduced, beginning with a revised Year 8 course, in 1997.  Other changes in Foreign Languages, Studies of Society and Environment, Business Technology, Engineering Technology and Technology in the Performing Arts, will figure prominently in the redesign.
<P>
<BR>
ACADEMIC MATTERS<BR>
At this stage it is perhaps appropriate to shift focus from the imperatives of the future and to reflect on the academic life of this school, particularly relating to this past year.  It illustrates in action, I believe, some of the things that I have already identified.
<P>
Many pupils have achieved high recognition for their efforts throughout the year.  However, since space here does not permit me to list each and every case I will illustrate with just one example.
<P>
Year 12 pupil Annaleise Grummitt was one of just  three very talented students who won the right to represent Australia at the International Chemistry Olympics held this year in Moscow.  Annaleise won a bronze medal and demonstrated to us all that talented young Australians can compete with the world's best.  Annaleise is an outstanding representative of Australia. Her school is proud to acknowledge her effort.
<P>
My colleagues who head the school's various academic departments have written complete records of achievement in their own areas.  I urge you to peruse these reports which highlight the many examples of high academic achievement in the school in 1996.
<P>
The 1995 matriculation results released earlier this year were once again very pleasing for the school.  Over 94% of the matriculating class were successful in receiving Queensland Tertiary Admission Centre offers and most of them achieved their first preference.  Somerset has maintained its reputation of unmatched performance among the schools in the region. 
<P>
Unfortunately and paradoxically, freedom of information legislation still prohibits pupils and their parents access to this data.  I maintain my belief that this is unfortunate, on balance, because it denies parents one valuable and quantifiable piece of information useful in making decisions about schools.  Evidence from last year's experience was that while schools were eager to publish success in the number of OP 1's achieved, none were prepared to give much prominence to areas of poor performance.
<P>
Somerset, as a matter of principle, makes its matriculation data available through the school publication "Lifetimes".  Please look carefully at the articles written by <A HREF="mailto:nscott@somerset.qld.edu.au">Noel Scott</A>, the school's Guidance Counsellor.
<P>
In what I can only hope is becoming something of an established pattern I am pleased to announce that one of our school captains, Kiah Wood, has been awarded the prestigious Vice Chancellor's Scholarship in Law at Bond University.  Kiah also completed the first year of an Arts degree during her matriculation studies.  Kiah follows 1995 senior Darren Bridges who won a Bond Vice Chancellor Scholarship in his final school year.  Congratulations Kiah on a very fine achievement.
<P>
<BR>
PASTORAL CARE.<BR>
To the uninitiated, schools are straightforward places where teachers teach and children learn.  Such a simple minded view might easily see schools transformed, with the benefit of technology,  to networks of computer stations occupied by silent pupils transfixed in the glow of their computer monitors.
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth.  Schools are social places where people skills are tested and honed for a lifetime of use.  Mistakes are made and painful lessons are sometimes learned.  The role of a caring and giving staff is critical in giving a school its heart. Perhaps this is only completely understood by those who see the staff going quietly and effectively about their work.  My colleagues are heroes whose efforts are, I am sorry to say, all too often overlooked.
<P>
A day such as Scholars' Day is one which gives me the opportunity to publicly and sincerely acknowledge and thank them.
<P>
The life of a school such as Somerset reflects every aspect of the human condition.  Earlier this year we were very sad to learn of the death of a Year 10  pupil, Robert Gatenby, who was fatally injured doing his duty as a surf lifesaver.  Surf lifesaving was one of the many things Robert loved and did well. 
<P>
Three years earlier our current Year 12s endured the sadness associated with Ainslie Richardson's fatal accident. These young people have displayed a maturity and understanding far beyond their years in coping with that very sad event.  I would like them to know that I admire and respect them greatly for their strength and compassion for others.
<P>
On a happier note the year also brought news of weddings and births as past pupils returned to school to chat and just to keep in touch.  Next year Somerset will welcome the class of 1987 back for their ten year reunion.  This is a very special event in the life of Somerset. 
<P>
<BR>
CO-CURRICULA ACTIVITIES. <BR>
Beyond the classroom those extra activities which add so much to the rich experience of the life of the school have flourished.
<P>
<BR>
MUSIC<BR>
The music rehearsal schedule reproduced in full in Mrs Roberts' report gives some idea of the comprehensiveness of the school's music programme.  Rehearsals begin each Monday before school when the Senior Chamber Orchestra and Junior Chorale meet. Other bands, groups and choirs continue to use every available out of school time to practise until  Friday afternoon when the Show Choir wind up the week for the musicians. In addition to this, many other hours are involved in producing the school's three musical productions.  The senior school flagship production of the difficult musical 'Evita' was superb.
<P>
The Tropicarnival Eisteddfod also proved to be a great success for the school this year.  The choirs in particular did very well winning the open vocal section, the secondary school choral section and gaining a second place in the Junior School choirs. Choirs and orchestras from the school also received high praise at the Queensland Festival of Music in Brisbane.
<P>
I would also like to make a special mention of Year 9 pupil Katherine Day who has been invited to join the Australian Children's Wind Orchestra as basoonist. Congratulations Katherine. 
<P>
In her report Mrs Roberts has named and thanked each member of her music staff.  I should like to add my thanks also as well as acknowledging the leadership and direction given by the Director of Music herself.
<P>
<BR>
PERFORMING ARTS<BR>
Theatre once again played a big part in the life of the school beginning in Term 1 with the House Plays won this year by Starkey with their production of "Living with Lady Macbeth".
<P>
The NIDA workshop, productions by the Queensland Theatre Company, Queensland Arts Council and The Australian Film and Television Academy all added to cultural life of the school.
<P>
The school also featured strongly in the Gold Coast Secondary Schools Drama Festival when James Brown (Year 8), Amy Vidgen (Year 9) and Ryan Johnson (Year12) all received best actor awards.  Sharon Malecki also received an award for the Best Overall Comedy Actor.
<P>
In his more complete report, Mr Mulder has identified all of those staff members who have assisted in this field.  I add my thanks to Mr Mulder and those named for their work with the pupils of the school. 
<P>
<BR>
DEBATING AND LITERATURE<BR>
The English Department also acted as an umbrella organisation for a range of co-curricula activities.  A welcome addition this year is the Creative Writing Group initiated by the Dean of Studies Mr Brohier.  This group of young writers meet to develop work for publication and performance. 
<P>
In addition, the School Literature Festival is now a well established feature on the local and national scene and attracts participants from Brisbane, the Gold Coast and all over Australia.
<P>
Debating and public speaking have also been well supported.  The school has performed well in the prestigious Queensland Debating Union Competition which involves 130 schools from throughout Queensland.
<P>
SPORT<BR>
No account of school life would be complete without reference to the many and varied activities which make up the junior and senior school sporting programme.  And 1996 has been a very good year for Somerset.
<P>
Our Kayakers travelled to Europe to represent Australia.  To our delight we discovered that they were able to compete on equal terms with the world's best. Nick Crilly, Darren Tonna,  Bridget Woodman and Jamie Williams all returned to school with top placings,  to their credit. 
<P>
In Cycling,  Sara Carrigan and Natalie Aitken represented Queensland only 18 months after taking up the sport.
<P>
In senior team sports,  premierships were achieved by 1st XV Rugby, 1st XI Soccer, 1st XI Girls Hockey, 1st XI Boys Hockey, Junior Hockey and 13 Years Rugby.
<P>
Particular mention needs to be made of the Girls Open Hockey team who made it to the finals of the State Hockey Championships, defeated all comers from Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and then went on to record a very creditable 4th place.
<P>
The staffing necessary to support the sports programme is enormous and for a great part provided on an honorary and voluntary basis by teaching staff and some parents.  I extend my sincere thanks to the Director of Sport, Mr Sayer, the Phys Ed. staff and all of the teacher, parent and past pupil helpers and coaches.  It would not be possible without you.
<P>
<BR>
THE SCHOOL COUNCIL<BR>
Earlier this year the School Council invited me to consider another term as Head of Somerset.  I am deeply honoured by their confidence and mindful of the very considerable responsibility of leading a still young but nonetheless great school forward into the next millennium.
<P>
In accepting I did so with enthusiasm. It is my earnest intention to ensure that Somerset remains dedicated to its task of providing a thousand or so young Australians with a caring and safe learning environment which is dedicated to assisting each pupil to discover and attain the highest levels of personal development and scholarship of which they are capable.
<P>
The school already has a proud and progressive tradition. This must be maintained and even enhanced if we are to continue to provide young Somersetians with the resources they will need to meet the challenges of a complex and exciting new millennium,.<BR>
I know that this is a vision I share with our School Council and I am happy to serve them and the pupils of the school in realising this vision.
<P>
Next year, 1997, will see a huge change in the physical resources the school enjoys.  The redevelopment of the west wing of the quad as a new administration block and the building of the country's finest, international standard 50 metre swimming pool, is testimony to the Council's commitment to its vision.
<P>
This is an appropriate time and place for me to thank the School Council and to acknowledge the support and guidance they have provided in the last year.  The members of the Somerset Council are: Mr Michael Smith (Chairman), Mr Gordon Lepp (Deputy Chairman), Mrs Mary Rudkin, Mr John Aitkenhead, Mr Brian Ray, Mr Tony Cordner, Dr Dianne Moses and Dr John Lake.
<P>
PARENTS & FRIENDS ASSOCIATION<BR>
During 1996 a very hardworking P & F have paid $50,000 for bus shelters for the pupils of the school and have donated the first half of their $100,000 pledge towards the pool project, expected to get underway early in 1997.  Originally programmed to begin in June 1996, the project was delayed to permit re-design and improvement of aspects of the filtration system.  It is still expected that the pool will be available for the 97/98  swimming season as originally planned.
<P>
The P & F  also oversee the Canteen and Somerset Shop and altogether P & F activities have contributed a total approaching $2,000,000 during the school's short  life.
<P>
I am delighted that the 1996 President (and Foundation parent) Mrs Michelle McQuay is on stage today for Scholars' Day and it gives me pleasure to acknowledge and thank each of the members of the 1996 management committee.<BR>

THE STAFF<BR>
Throughout this report I have made some reference to particular members of staff for the efforts they have made to various programmes which make up the life of the school. There are also many others who have made similar contributions, in many cases in circumstances which have not drawn attention to themselves. Grounds staff, the administrative team  and the academic staff are 'all of this one company' of colleagues whose efforts make Somerset a great as well as a caring school. 
<P>
In particular I want especially to acknowledge my deputy Mrs Gallus, the school Bursar Mr Turner, the school Chaplain Rev. Donnell, the Head of Lower Primary Department Mrs Lamb,  the Director of Student Services Mrs Peters, as well as Mr Brohier who joined the school as Dean of Studies this year and Mr Mason our new Head of Junior School.
<P>
I also note that two permanent members of staff will be moving on from Somerset at the end of this year.  Ms <A HREF="mailto:swood@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sidonie Wood</A> is moving to Brisbane to join a law firm. Mr Horrocks is returning to the Education Department. Our thanks and best wishes are extended to both Ms Wood and Mr Horrocks. 
<P>
<BR>
THE HEADMASTER'S SCHOLAR<BR>
Each year the School Council  makes available a number of scholarships.  Since 1989 the Council has designated one of these recipients as being the 'Headmaster's Scholar'.  This candidate is the one who has the most outstanding performance in the scholarship selection tests and interviews.  I am delighted to announce that the 1997 Headmaster's Scholar is Meggie Palmer who comes to us from St Kevin's Primary School Benowa.
<P>
<BR>
THE VALEDICTORIANS<BR>
Finally a word to those who are leaving school.  You have done a great job as leaders of the school in your senior year. I hope that all of your dreams can become realities.  I can think of no better advice than some words from our school prayer.
<P>
As you depart from this place go forth <BR>
'with knowledge and humility'. <BR>
Your future will be as bright as you make it. <BR>

</CENTER>
I thank my fellow councillors, Gordon Lepp my Deputy Chairman, John Aitkenhead, Tony Cordner, Mary Rudkin, Dianne Moses and John Lake for all their help and assistance during the year. This year the principal  property development has been the documentation and financing for a new swimming pool and a new administration block. Whereas the swimming pool will be built by the School, Somerset College Limited, with funds borrowed by the school, these funds will be financed during the first few years after the pool has been constructed, by monies provided by the School Foundation which come from the very generous donations to the Foundation, monies provided by the Parents and Friends Association and monies provided by the former pupils or students association. Each of these associations will be contributing to this publication and I am sure will give details of their assistance. I would advise that the swimming pool was not in the school's budget for the next few years and if it were not for these sources of funds with these school affiliates, it would not have been possible to commence on the pool now as has been done.  Obviously earlier commitment to the swimming pool will be of great interest to those in the senior school.  It will be the difference in some cases between having a pool and not having a pool whilst they are at school.  Sincere thanks to the Foundation, the P & F and the Former Students.
<P>
The administration block is a school funded operation with assistance from government grants.  I have heard mention that the new administration block could not come soon enough and how the school has totally outgrown the current administration block.  Let me hasten to say that this is true, but it was with a sense of nostalgia that I reflected, when I heard this, that the council were so delighted when they were in a position to build the current administration block as at that time it was an enormous advance on what had been before. 
<P>
The new administration block will give better conditions to both the teaching and the lay staff. The council know how hard the staff work and it gives them enormous satisfaction to be able to approve the new accommodation block.  As the school numbers are now reasonably firmly fixed, the new block should last for quite some time and the Headmaster and his administration and the Council and its building committee have spent a lot of time to ensure that everything that can be done in relation to the administration block has been done.
<P>
The headmaster and his administrative team have as always spent an enormous amount of time putting in an enormous amount of valued work in relation to the financing and approval of these projects.  The Council have been very fortunate to have had as their representatives, the Deputy Chairman of Council, Gordon Lepp, and Councillor Brian Ray, who have given up their time to attend meetings and to be in a position to grant on the spot approvals for the  hundred things that have to be approved of during the course of the financing and contract stage without the necessity of waiting for formal council meetings.
<P>
The major event of the year as far as the Council is concerned, is the fact that the Headmaster has agreed to accept a renewed offer of contract for ten years.  In conformity with enlightened trends in education, the Council have proposed and the Headmaster has accepted, that the Headmaster should attend an Advanced Management Course in the first year or so of the new ten year term.  The Advanced Management Course selected, after careful study with the Headmaster of the management courses available, is the one at Oxford University.  This is considered to be the finest Advanced Management Course in the English speaking world.  The Headmaster, as the "CEO" of the company which is Somerset College Limited, is the most pre-eminent member of Somerset College Limited.  <A HREF="mailto:barnison@somerset.qld.edu.au">Barry Arnison</A> has demonstrated that he has been able to lead the school in his first ten years as a Headmaster to the position where it is now the best academic school that has ever existed on the Gold Coast.  I, as Chairman of the Council, feel very privileged that the Headmaster has agreed to sign a contract for a further ten years with the school.  Both the Headmaster and the School Council agree that this would be a fine time and would be essential for the Headmaster to have an opportunity to be exposed to the ideas of management of the mid 1990's.  Not only will this management course be of inestimable benefit to the Headmaster and to the School, it will be an additional source of kudos to the school as there is no doubt that our Headmaster is a senior Headmaster in the Australian Association of Heads of Independent Schools in Australia and his position as a Senior Headmaster will be further strengthened by completion of this management course at Oxford University.
<P>
I and the School Council wish to thank the Headmaster for another splendid year at the School in all fields.  We wish to thank all the school staff for their efforts which we know go far above and beyond what one could expect of them.  The Headmaster could not achieve what he has with the School unless he had the best staff that has ever been at a School on the Gold Coast.
<P>
I was at the P & F election meeting and Michelle McQuay was re-elected as President  for 1997. The hierarchy is such that I do not have personal cross links with the P & F but I am immensely aware of the amount of work done by the P & F and this information is provided to me by the Headmaster and the Bursar, both of whom sit on the management committee of the P & F.
<P>
I appreciate the co-operation from the Former Students Association in relation to the swimming pool and I am very well aware that they are an active and going concern.
<P>
The School Foundation have excelled themselves this year. Details of contributions raised will be set out in the Foundation Report.  I appreciate that there would be many people associated with the Foundation. I have dealings with <A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A> and Brian Ray and thank them sincerely for their efforts and I know that they will thank all their supporters and assistants. 
<P>
Students who are leaving in Grade 12 can look forward to a bright future. The school has done everything they can for the students and they are as well prepared to face the outside world as any comparable group of students.  I pass on to you the hope that at all times you will try to do your best; at all times you will try to get on with your fellows.  Do not brood on any disappointment that you may suffer in the next few years, but positively dwell on the good things that will happen to you and delight in the good friends that you have and will have.  <BR>
Michael Smith<BR>
Chairman

</CENTER>
1996 saw the successful completion of the 2000 Club Swimming Pool Appeal.  It was most gratifying to see the list of 2000 Club supporters grow to around 50 when one considers the substantial financial commitment involved.  There was a slight hiccup in the planning process for the pool when we changed hydraulic consultants.  However, planning is now virtually finalised and a start on construction is imminent.
<P>
The Annual Giving Appeal is now in its seventh year and at the time of writing a seventh straight record looks likely.  The growing level of support especially by parents helps staff to provide items of immediate benefits to students at a time when budgets are running dry.  This financial support by parents is a great boost to staff and students in the second half of the year.
<P>
Staff have shown great leadership in their generosity not only in the massive amounts of time that they give but also in the high percentage of those who give financially by payroll deductions.
<P>
The cooperation shown by parents, staff and all school support bodies such as the School Council, P&F, Auxiliary, Former Students etc is of massive importance in the success the school has enjoyed to date in its building program.  Long may this team approach endure!
<P>
I would like to thank all those who have volunteered their time and/or financial support during the year.  Without you we would achieve very little.  More mention of this is made in both the school magazine and Christmas edition of Somerset Lifetimes.<BR>
Thank you.

</CENTER>
For many of us in the Junior School, 1996 has seen a new beginning.  From the youngest Preschooler through to the newest year sevener (or even newer Master of Junior School!) there have indeed been many "firsts" throughout the year.  It would be a very brave person who tried to list each one, especially as many of those moments may have only been felt intrinsically by the person who experienced them.  For me, these are often the most special and I encourage every member of the Junior School community: pupil, teacher and parent, to take time and reflect upon what has been an exciting and action packed year.
<P>
I will however, attempt to provide an overview of the year that was - for more detailed reports relating to the individual grades and departments, I encourage you to take a moment to peruse the Junior School Scholars' Day booklet that was distributed at this morning's ceremony.
<P>
The children of our Junior School are indeed fortunate to have access to a broad curriculum that provides for a well-rounded person.  Not only included here is the academic curriculum, but also the personal development, pastoral care and co-curricula programmes which form integral parts of the overall education of the individual.
<P>
Our Personal Development programme operates all year, however in Term Two, all students participated in sessions run by Shona Charters from Family Planning, and the Year One to Six children visited the Life Education Centre.  These sequential programmes provide opportunities for the children to become more aware of themselves and current issues influencing the broader community, in a non-threatening, caring environment.
<P>
Pastoral Care continues to play an important role in the Junior School.  The role of the classroom teacher, fellow pupils and the wider school community promotes a warm Christian atmosphere, which is often commented on by visitors to the school.  Camps, excursions and general interaction have all provided a variety of positive experiences fostering a caring attitude towards each other.
<P>
Our Religious Education programme, led so capably by the School Chaplain, Reverend <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">John Donnell</A> and Assistant Chaplain, Reverend <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Beel</A>, has provided another important facet of pastoral care in the school.  Religious Education classes have been supplemented by a number of Chapel services throughout the year and I make a special mention of the Year Four to Seven classes who each organised and led a Chapel service during fourth term.  This added a new dimension to Chapel and thanks are extended to Reverend Beel for his assistance and contributions in helping these services to be so meaningful.  
<P>
Numerous academic competitions were conducted throughout the year and involved students from Years Four to Seven in a variety of genreS.  Social Studies, Science, Chemistry, Mathematics, LOTE and English have all seen outstanding results achieved across the board.  It is especially pleasing to note the number of children who gained unexpected success, however all pupils are to be commended and should feel satisfied with their concentrated effort.
<P>
The Junior School again entered a team in the Tournament of Minds.  Mrs Pamela Mate worked with an enthusiastic group of children over a number of weeks, and although the team was very close in gaining an overall place, they were recognised with a well-deserved, creativity award. 
<P>
Mrs Mate has also provided a positive year in the Resource area, working with many children and parents in a variety of ways.  All pupils who have had the opportunity of working in the Resource Room, regardless of the type of activity, have gained valuable experience on which to build in the future.  The STEP Parenting course was extremely successful and I hope all who attended found this time valuable. I thank Mrs Mate for her contributions to the Resource area, and for her assistance in the administration of the Junior School children.
<P>
Sport in the Junior School saw some major changes towards the end of the year.  The original S.E.A.T group, although still in existence, has combined with our Senior Schools to form a new body known as the Gold Coast Private Schools' Association (GCPSA). This will enable a more consistent approach to fixtures, centrally arranged venues and the opportunity to develop closer associations with pupils from other schools.  This format was trialed in Term Four and looks set to provide a more positive competition in 1997.  The spirit of S.E.A.T will no doubt remain as the schools continue to compete vigorously in Swimming, Cross Country, Athletics and regular home and away competitions.  Many students achieved great success throughout the year and reached high levels of representation.  Details of these are listed in Mrs Karen Townson's report, however, I extend congratulations to all students who achieved personal bests in any sporting contest.  The Junior School Sporting programme would not occur without the commitment of the staff and I thank all teachers for their valuable contribution in the sporting arena. Sincere thanks are extended to Mrs Townson for the many extra hours involved in organising the extensive Sporting and Physical Education programmes offered throughout the year, and to Mr <A HREF="mailto:tmcdonald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Tony McDonald</A> who enthusiastically assisted in such a variety of ways.
<P>
Cultural activities continued to be a highlight of the year.  The Queensland Arts Council made four visits; the Celebration of Literature was without doubt a literary feast for the younger pupils, capped off by a wonderful visit from renowned children's author Margaret Mahey; the introduction of the S.E.A.T Visual Arts Exhibition; Instrumental concerts were presented; Music Fest celebrated the making of music between seventeen independent Gold Coast schools; the Performing Arts festival involved over one thousand competitors; private music lessons; classroom music; Chorale; String Orchestra; Concert Band; Speech and Drama; Gold Coast Eisteddfod; Tropicarnival; Hanami Picnic; Dance lessons and concerts; Year Three Strings programme; Christmas and Easter Concerts. The list is almost endless and has provided numerous opportunities for the children to involve themselves in the culture of the school.  The enthusiasm of Miss <A HREF="mailto:blanham@somerset.qld.edu.au">Belinda Lanham</A> has done much to foster this broad programme and I thank her for her tireless efforts in 'conducting' the Junior School Music Programme.  Thanks are also extended to Mr Rodger Graham-Wilson (Woodwind/Concert Band), Mrs <A HREF="mailto:lmason@somerset.qld.edu.au">Lisa Mason</A> and Miss Mara Pradella (Strings/JSO's), Mrs Helen Little (Recorder/Piano/Performing Arts Festival), and Director of Music, Mrs <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A> for encouraging our young musicians to reach such great heights.<BR>
 <BR>
"Cosmo's Cure" and "Kids in Space" were box office sensations involving over two hundred children from Years Four to Seven.  These wonderful productions were presented in Term Two and were a direct result of the outstanding abilities of Mrs Townson and Miss Lanham who capably led a dedicated team of performers, parents and staff. Special thanks to the class teachers and Head of Performing Arts, Mr <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Rob Mulder</A>, who all played such an important role, ensuring the success of these productions.<BR>
 <BR>
In September, a number of Year Six and Seven children, travelled to Cairns and participated in the annual 'Triniset' exchange.  As in the past, students were billeted with families and enjoyed the hospitality of Far North Queensland and the Trinity Anglican School.  Sporting and cultural activities were enjoyed by all, as well as excursions to Moore Reef and Kuranda.  Trinity were worthy winners of the perpetual trophy and we look forward to recontesting the shield on home territory in 1997.  The students who remained at Somerset were treated to a week of alternative activities, of which a visit from the R.A.A.F Dog Squad was reported as the highlight for many.  
<P>
Public Speaking provided a high point in Term Four, where many pupils prepared and presented speeches for the annual competition.  The standard was exceptionally high and this flowed through to competitions held outside of the school, where our pupils performed remarkably well.  It never ceases to amaze me the confidence our young children display when presenting work, not only to their peers, but often to a wider and older audience.
<P>
With the introduction of the Internet to every classroom in the Junior School, pupils now have immediate access to the Information Highway extending world wide.  Several classes have developed contacts with buddies and schools overseas, some have e-mailed Grandparents, others have contacted areas of industry as a part of their research and for most, the opportunity to access the World Wide Web. Three classes developed high quality Home Pages and it is hoped that in 1997, more classes will do the same, encouraging children to publish their work for the world wide audience. <BR>
 <BR>
Chess has once again flourished under the enthusiasm and guidance of Mr <A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A>.  Each lunch time, many students can be seen testing their skills against each other and working towards the ultimate challenge of beating Mr Gardiner. Offering a range of inter and intra school competitions and a classroom programme at Years Three and Four, pupils from Preschool to Year Seven have enjoyed a very successful year on the boards.  Undoubtedly, the highlight for the year was the school's first state title at the Junior School level.  
<P>
For the staff, 1996 has seen a major focus on our English curriculum.  In an ever changing world, it is important that we keep in touch with current trends and as such, our working document (only a couple of years old) was modified over many sessions, ensuring that it reflects the values and emphasis of the school, teaching styles of the staff and current educational practices.  As the school moves closer to the eight key learning areas, other curriculum areas will be revisited, ensuring a consistent and effective curriculum for the children and staff to work within.
<P>
Reflecting on the year, we are at a time where questions are being raised as to the literacy levels of children moving out of their primary years. It is reassuring to note that the results our Junior School pupils are achieving in fact do not reflect these trends.  This has been reinforced through the statewide Year Six tests in Literacy and Numeracy, where once again our pupils performed at an exceptionally high level in comparison with other children of their own age. <BR>
  <BR>
I always enjoy visiting the younger children who under the care of Mrs <A HREF="mailto:acopperwaite@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anne Copperwaite</A> and Miss Renee Pellatt (Preschool); Mrs <A HREF="mailto:bmillican@somerset.qld.edu.au">Brenda Millican</A> and Mrs Frances Corkery (Year One); Mrs Virginia Lamb, Mrs Helen Donnell and Mrs Daina McFarland (Year Two); Mrs <A HREF="mailto:jrogers@somerset.qld.edu.au">Jenny Rogers</A> and Mr Neill Whittington (Year Three), have enjoyed a wonderful start to their educational lives.  Under the guidance of our Director of Early Childhood, Mrs Virginia Lamb, the Lower Primary has blossomed throughout the year and all children are well-prepared for the next step in their quest for knowledge.
<P>
The children of Year Four have been well-served by Mrs Carole Roper and Mr <A HREF="mailto:pcooper@somerset.qld.edu.au">Peter Cooper</A>, who have provided a positive programme for the children in their first year of Upper Primary.<BR>
For the children of Year Five, some changes have occurred during the last term when Mr Ross Crilly announced his retirement.  Mrs <A HREF="mailto:exelby@somerset.qld.edu.au">Robyn Exelby</A> joined Mr <A HREF="mailto:gjones@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Jones</A> and the year ended most successfully for the children under their care.  I know the whole school community joins me in thanking Mr Crilly for his service to the school and wish him well in his retirement.
<P>
As we farewelled Mrs Jane James at the end of Term Two, Mrs <A HREF="mailto:fcook@somerset.qld.edu.au">Faye Cook</A> returned from the United Kingdom and joined Mrs <A HREF="mailto:ewheeler@somerset.qld.edu.au">Eileen Wheeler</A> in Year Six.  I am impressed by the way each child has been so well prepared for their final year of primary education.
<P>
The Transition Year has again provided a challenging time for the students in their preparation for the rigours of secondary school.  Under the guidance of Year Seven Co-ordinator, Mrs <A HREF="mailto:msauer@somerset.qld.edu.au">Michelle Sauer</A> and class teachers Mr <A HREF="mailto:tmcdonald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Tony McDonald</A> and Mr <A HREF="mailto:ahalloran@somerset.qld.edu.au">Andrew Halloran</A>, the children have enjoyed their last year of primary school and have provided positive leadership to their fellow pupils of the Junior School.  I thank the Year Seven students for their efforts and wish them well for their future studies.
<P>
We are indeed fortunate to have a totally dedicated and enthusiastic group of staff working in the Junior School and I thank them all for what has been an outstanding year in every classroom.  Assistance to the staff has been provided by Teacher Aides, Mrs Jayne Lofthouse and Mrs Leanne Murray (Preschool); Mrs Kathy Pedersen and Mrs Angela Stephenson (Art).  Their efforts, often above and beyond the call of duty, have been greatly appreciated.  Numerous secondary teachers have enhanced the Junior School curriculum with their talents.  I extend thanks on behalf of the Junior School to Mr <A HREF="mailto:ghorrocks@somerset.qld.edu.au">Gary Horrocks</A> and Mr Geoff Pryor (LOTE); Mrs <A HREF="mailto:esmith@somerset.qld.edu.au">Edith Smith</A>, Mr Ted de Boer and Miss <A HREF="mailto:afitzgerald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anna Fitzgerald</A> (Science); Mr Charlie Cooper (Sailing); Mr <A HREF="mailto:gcater@somerset.qld.edu.au">Greg Cater</A> (Mathematics); Reverend <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Beel</A> (R.E.) and Mr Ross Keefer (Art).  I offer  congratulations and thanks to the 1996 School Captains, Kate Dorrington and David McIntosh.  They have been excellent role models and have provided excellent leadership for the younger children and have deservedly earned the respect of their peers.  Both have capably fullfilled this important role and are to be commended for their efforts.  To the Junior School Administration team of Mrs Virginia Lamb, Ms Pat Kelly and Mrs Julie Wirth (Junior School Secretary), I offer my personal thanks for their support throughout the year, and for their commitment to the welfare of the staff, pupils and parents of the school.  This support, combined with the warm welcome that my wife Joanne and I, our children Caitlin and Bradley, have received from the whole school community, has enabled us all to immensely enjoy our first year as members of the Somerset family.
<P>
As we look forward to the Christmas vacation and on to the new beginnings that 1997 will bring, I wish you all a peaceful, happy and Holy Christmas.<BR>

</CENTER>
On planet earth, we human beings must be one of the strangest and, at the same time, most amazing creatures. We share many characteristics with most other creatures, responding to instincts which ensure  survival, the continuation of the species, safety and security. All have appetites which provide the motivation for so many recognisable behaviours. Yet among them all we alone are able to respond to other factors that seem to have their origin outside the domain of habit and instinct. We can say, "I'm hungry now", but choose not to do anything about eating yet! "I must preserve my own life at all costs", but choose to endanger myself for the benefit of others. "Why are we here? What is the meaning of all this?" 
<P>
Yes, we are an interesting, puzzling and paradoxical creature. We have an awareness of ourselves, of others and of the world in which we live. Often the outcomes of this awareness conflict with our more basic appetites and instincts producing dilemma, confusion and anxiety. This, necessarily, must be addressed in the education process.
<P>
Somerset provides, through its curriculum, the opportunity for pupils to learn about the world in which they live and about the people who share it with them. But there is also what may be called the spiritual dimension which addresses issues of self-awareness and meaning. This is formalised in the Religious Education, Personal Development and Chapel programs, but the 'between classes' contact between students and staff provide an important and informal learning experience.
<P>
Chapels are held regularly for Houses as well as the whole school. There are those memorable occasions when all are invited, such as the Carols and Family Services and others where a much smaller group will meet in the Small Chapel. Other occasions are for significant and special moments in the school year: the Investiture of Prefects and Commissioning of Senior Students, the Valedictory Service and Founders' Day Service are highlights that give meaning to the school and its community.  The school is fortunate to have among its staff and students those who are able to share in the leadership of services.  A special commendation to the 1996 Sacristan, Eliza Wallace, for the dignified and helpful way in which she carried out her duties this year.
<P>
The Religious Education classes are attended by all students and seek to give an understanding of the Judaeo-Christian heritage through formal lessons. Time is also taken to encourage young people to explore personal and social issues, evaluate ways that various people have answered them and to come to a reasonable and responsible decision for themselves.  Thanks go to the Headmaster Mr Arnison and my colleagues the Rev <A HREF="mailto:jdonnell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Geoff Beel</A>, Mrs <A HREF="mailto:dstonier@somerset.qld.edu.au">Diana Stonier</A>, Mrs <A HREF="mailto:sroberts@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sue Roberts</A> and Mr Charlie Cooper for their participation in the program this year.
<P>
The students of Somerset have a well-deserved reputation for efforts in providing help for the needy. World Vision, Red Cross, Life-Line and other Gold Coast groups have benefited by their endeavours. The importance of recognising need around us and then of doing something to meet that need cannot be stressed enough. Congratulations to those individuals and House groups who this year have undertaken the sponsorship of children through the World Vision program!
<P>
We are strange creatures and our world is all the worse for our inability to deal adequately with our paradoxical nature. Through the school's program, its students are prepared to make their contribution to a better world. <BR>

Again, this has been a very interesting and busy year for Art students and again there have been many successes for students entering the various competitions offered at local, State and National levels.  Notable achievements have been gained by Somerset students with an incredible win in the Australian Science Teachers' Poster Competition for Charles Tomlinson of Year 8.  His poster gained a first place at State level.  Year 9 students entered an Indy car replica in the Southport Mall Indy Coca Cola Competition which won the "Greatest Effort" section.
<P>
Senior students exhibited works at the Currumbin Festival of Arts, and at 'Energies' - the combined Gold Coast High Schools Exhibition which is held annually at the Gold Coast Arts Centre Gallery.  
<P>
The work of Year 12 students has been innovative and very witty again this year.  Many of the jewellery and painted works submitted for assessment have been of the highest possible standard.
<P>
Rachel Churchin and Jacqueline Ford won prizes in the Harvey World "Travel Victoria" Poster Competition and won 2nd and 3rd prizes respectively for their paintings.
<P>
The Year 9 Art elective students have been working on one eightieth of the Queensland entry for the Guinness Book of Records World's biggest painting with the Asia Australia Society of Queensland.  We expect to complete our huge section early in 1997.  Year 9 students have also been fortunate to work with artists in residence provided by the Robina Town Centre Project.  Along with the Year 11 Art students, they produced huge banners for the Food Hall.  Our contributions are now hanging in the Food Hall along with those from eight other schools in the region.  The students found making banners four metres long a challenge, but the job was done and the rewards gained from group work were very positive.  
<P>
On the whole, it has been a very successful year across both curricular and extra-curricular areas.<BR>

While Somerset students will not, until next year, study areas of commerce as part of a core curriculum, the electives offered from Years 9 - 12  give them the opportunity to develop valuable skills necessary to enhance their own employment opportunities.  At a launch of an enterprise competition held in February of this year, Dr John Bailey, a member of the influential Karpin task force which reviewed the competency of Australian managers, commented that a stronger commitment to encourage enterprising skills in the school system could "transform this nation". Business subjects directly offer students diverse opportunities to develop the knowledge and be involved in activities which foster these very skills.
<P>
In the first week of the school year one of our Senior students, Angela Taylor, was involved in an innovative program, designed as part of Queensland Australian Business Week 1996. Hosted by the Queensland University of Technology in partnership with the Department of Education, this residential course required students to manage a company in a simulation for a week and then report on its progress.  It combined elements of accounting, economics, management and communication skills. The week proved such a success that another course will be offered in January 1997 and already three of our Year 11 students have been offered places.
<P>
To Commerce and Economics students opportunities have been given to apply their knowledge in State and National Competitions. All the Year 12 students undertook the A.M.P. Investments Economics Competition held in May. While performances of several students were graded at Distinction and Credit levels, High Distinction Certificates were awarded to Esa Valttila and Angela Taylor. Some of the younger students tested their oral and persuasive abilities in a very different type of activity i.e. mediation.  Here, students are required to role-play a situation which involves a conflict at school/family/community level.  A mediator has to allow both sides to present their concerns and he/she assists them to arrive at a compromise. The Competition is run by the Queensland Law Society and is called S.C.R.A.M. i.e. Student Conflict Resolution and Mediation. While the students did not progress beyond Round 2, they gained some interesting insights into a process which is being applied much more widely in the community.   The local solicitors who judged their efforts commended them on their performance. 
<P>
For Legal  Studies students (and some who do not study this subject) the art of advocacy was practised in the annual Intra-School Mooting Competition held in late February. This was open to any Year 11 and 12 student and was judged by two past students, Daniel Stoten and Ben Munro. The standard of presentation improves each year with 1996 producing particularly fine performances from Michael Exelby, Samantha Ariss, Corrinne Gygar and Olivia Stuckey. Michael and Samantha earned the right to represent the College at the Friends of Bond University  High Schools' Mooting Competition held in May. Their team performance here was creditable.  
<P>
For the first time, some of our Senior students were participants in the Queensland Accounting competition sponsored by the Business Educators of Queensland.  We were also pleased to submit entries into the inaugural Gold Coast Schools' Legal Essay Competition. 
<P>
As has become traditional, we welcomed into our classes a number of speakers from industry/tertiary institutions.  They were able to provide a further dimension to the curriculum.  Thanks must go to: Sally Edwards who discussed the role of the Criminal Justice Commission; Ross Sorbello and Liz Winters who shared their expertise on the Stock Exchange; Gary Oliver who spoke on police procedures; Alan Hauquitz who analysed the role of economics in the health industry;  Anne Haley-Brown who focussed on law as a profession; and Laurence Boulle who examined the role of mediation in conflict resolution.
<P>
<BR>
Excursions to relevant workplaces were included at most subject levels. Year 9 Commerce classes visited the new Robina Town Centre and later the Magistrates and District Courts in Southport. The manufacturing industry was the focus of the Year 10 Commerce classes when they spent a half day at Coca-Cola Amatil in Brisbane.  Legal Studies classes in the Senior School spent some time looking at the research facilities of the Bond Law Library and viewed court cases at the Supreme Court in Brisbane. This was followed by a short visit to the David Longlands Correctional Centre at Wacol. The final excursion for the Year was to Dairyfields at Labrador and Sea World.  The role of these industries together with relevant labour/management relations provided the principal focus of these visits by Year 11 Economics students.  Other Year 11 students were also involved in the A.I.E.S.E.C. Global Education Seminar. 
<P>
The enthusiasm and professionalism of the Somerset Commerce teachers is one of the significant factors in determining the interest and development of students. I would like to thank Graeme Trethewey, <A HREF="mailto:mtwigg@somerset.qld.edu.au">Martin Twigg</A>, Jan Pearson, Karen Crowley, <A HREF="mailto:swood@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sidonie Wood</A> and Geoff Pryor for their tireless effort throughout the year.<BR>

The English Department has had another successful year as we continue to strive to facilitate excellence for our students. 
<P>
This year saw the implementation of our new English Work Programme in Years 8 to 12.  The programme is developmental throughout the year levels and utilises a wide variety of tasks, whilst at the same time minimising the number of assessment items.
<P>
Our English Book Hire Scheme also commenced this year to coincide with our new work programme.  This scheme will continue to provide our students with a greater variety of resources and cater for individual learning needs.  In 1997, another range of texts will be offered along with out existing titles.  A sincere thank you must be extended to the P & F, Mrs Maree Lazarides and the Bookshop Staff for their efforts in supporting and organising the book hire scheme.
<P>
Student Achievements<BR>
In the 1996 Australian Schools English Competition involving 338,000 students from Australasia, our students demonstrated that their proficiency in English is equal to that of the best of students from Queensland.  In Years 5 to 11, our students received 13 High Distinctions (top 1%), 88 Distinctions (top 10%) and 160 Credits (top 20%).  High Distinctions were awarded to Ka Lei Lau,  Nigel Tarr, Regis Broadway (Year 6), Richard Speter (Year 7), Nathan Shuker, Tom Yakimoff (Year 8), Brett Roughan, Peggy Cuthbert, Tamma Sorbello (Year 9), Brooke Doherty, Errol Wong, Graeme Cuthbert and Hayden Richards (year 11).  These results vindicate the efforts of both teachers and students in the classroom and we will continue to strive for even better results in the years to come.
<P>
The 1996 Somerset Short Story Competition and The Poetry Prize attracted a large number of creative entries.  I would like to thank Mrs Lorraine Pilgrim for taking on the difficult  task of judging the entries and Mr Jon Barker for co-ordinating the competition.  The results are as follows :

Cultural Achievements<BR>
Our students continued to excel in the area of debating. However, this year saw a change in debating at the College as we entered the prestigious Queensland Debating Union Competition. This is a large competition with approximately 130 schools from around the State, entering teams.  We performed creditably with seven of our nine teams making various stages of the knock-out Finals, after successfully competing in the preliminary rounds.  Our best result was our Year 10(2) team who reached the final sixteen.
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our debating coaches - Miss Pullar, Mrs Lambert, Mrs Stonier, Miss O'Connor and Mr Evans - for their enthusiasm, dedication and willingness to give up so much of their time to prepare teams.
<P>
In the area of public speaking, our students participated in the Lions Youth of the Year, Rostrum Voice of Youth, Jaycees, Credit Union and A.B.Paterson Public Speaking Competitions.  Our students performed well in all competitions, however, special mention must be made of the achievements of Annaleise Grummitt and Kiah Wood who successfully reached the regional final of the Lions' Youth of the Year Competition and Annaleise was also awarded first place in the senior division of the A.B. Paterson Competition.  I would like to thank Mr Geoff Pryor for his efforts in co-ordinating public speaking during 1996.
<P>
Special Events<BR>
The Somerset Celebration of Literature continued to be a great success and a very useful learning experience for both staff and students.  This year saw our students gain greater exposure to a variety of writers.  Not only did students have the opportunity to attend several of the formal sessions, but they also experienced the writers first hand in a number of classroom sessions and writing workshops.  This is an unique opportunity for the students of Somerset College and next years 'Celebration' looks even more exciting.  I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the staff of  the English Department who worked tirelessly over the four days of the festival.
<P>
This year saw the  formation of the Creative Writing Club.  This club was founded by Mr Brohier and is going from strength to strength.  As well as meeting on a regular basis within the college, the club members also participate in a number of outside gatherings such as literary dinners and public readings.  Our students can only benefit from participating in such activities and I would like to acknowledge the talent and effort of Mr Brohier.
<P>
Life at Somerset College is so full of activity that it is always easy to overlook something.  However, it would be remiss of me not to thank the staff members of the English Department for their outstanding efforts, commitment and achievements.  I would especially like to thank Mrs Margaret Doherty for her contribution to the department over the last six months.
<P>
This year has been a memorable one for the English Department and we look forward to continued success in 1997.<BR>

</CENTER>
Most of the goals for 1996 have been achieved. Somerset has a permanent ISDN link to the internet which is networked throughout the school. HomeLink, our dial in service that allows you to access our networked resources from off campus, is available via the internet. Staff have individual email addresses which they use to communicate internally and to the rest of the world. Web page design has been incorporated into the computing courses and the internet is used extensively by students and staff for research and fun. The "web browser" has supplanted the word processor as the most used type of software.  The first priority for selecting new computers and upgrading older ones is that they can be made to access the internet and run the latest web software.
<P>
Many families have accounts with commercial internet service providers. Their students  are increasingly familiar with the use of this technology, being able to  cope with the quirks of finding information in an environment where it is very easy to "find what you are not looking for".  Some have found friends on the web via chat sessions and email; many of these contacts are overseas, the ability to directly communicate being incidentally effected by time zones but not at all by distance. Indeed there is software available for speaking directly to people over the internet, thus bypassing normal telephone charges.
<P>
The sophistication and currency of the work produced by increasing numbers of students has improved markedly due to the availability of  resources on  the internet. Several primary classes have  pages published as do ex students who are invited to keep in contact via our web pages. The computer system is better named the information and communication system to reflect its majority functions.
<P>
The school has countless compact discs containing digital information  distributed all over the campus, in the Preschool, the Library, individual departments and networked into our integrated system and thus available over HomeLink. Of particular interest is the Encyclopaedia Britannica CD, not so much because it is so good, which it is, but because it uses a web browser for access and is also available,  if you have a subscription, over the internet. I think this is indicative of the eventual demise of the compact disc as a medium for data delivery and its replacement with remote services which develop from the meld of internet and cable television.  The reducing cost and increasing capacity of solid state non volatile memory (chips that don't forget when the power goes off) , will eventually supplant the CD even for music and will lead to smaller, more robust, reliable, less power hungry devices with high  level computational capabilities (a sort of super digital watch cum mobile phone).
<P>
The balance of this report is about what may happen, because it is the nature of rapid change that what has happened is less relevant than what will happen.
<P>
The information revolution is not over. The novelty of the internet may be waning as internet addresses become a familiar part of contact details in ads and articles in all media. This is a lull before the next storm which will boost affordability and bandwidth of access to remote information. Next year will see the introduction of Network computers and cable modems into society; these will be the vehicles for change.  
<P>
The Network computer is essentially a less complex, less powerful and therefore cheaper version of the current PC with just enough nous to access information  coupled with instructions from the internet: the difference is that the modern PC has to know how to do everything, just in case it is asked to. All these capabilities must be included in the operating system which becomes large and memory hungry, hence the need for big discs and multi megabytes of RAM and high costs; it is essentially designed to stand alone.  The old style information object contains the data and some key word that tells the computer which set of stored instructions to use to cope with it. The new information object contains information and instructions, so all the network computer needs to be able to do is to read and convert the instructions and data into actions; it is designed to be connected to and depend on the network.
<P>
Bandwidth is essentially the rate at which information can be accessed and sent. The current internet has low bandwidth, film clips take a long time to download and are consequently brief and cut down in quality to make them practical. Live video over the phone line internet connection is of poor quality due to these limitations. Cable television has no such problems; the bandwidth is wide, many channels at a time come into your connection, your television just picks the one it is told to. Cable modems and improved data compression standards will enable a much more interactive, lifelike version of the internet to come into your home via the set top box or Network Computer attached to or built into yout television.

By the turn of the century, the expectation that a family will be linked to and using whatever the global information system will then be called, will be the same as the expectation that they have a phone today. It will be less difficult to use too, for example telephone shopping and banking could much better be handled if you could see what your options were and had more than 0 to 9 to choose from.  With remote interaction of this standard available it may well affect (and actually already is affecting) the method of delivering and participating in Education as well as work, shopping and leisure. The fast pace of change that society is undergoing, called "information revolution", means that one of the premier requirements for success and employability is the willingness to keep learning new perspectives and skills.<BR>

The ongoing developments in information and communications technologies which Somerset College  continues to embrace have resulted in students potentially having access to the whole world as  a learning resource.  As the power base of our society is knowledge and information, the challenge for Somerset College is to provide access to, and effective use of, available resources in all forms in order that students can become information-literate life-long learners. Through the Library all students of Somerset College have access to a great deal of information in  many forms. This is essential if they are to become information literate.
<P>
There seems to be evolving an erroneous perception that generally people are being incapacitated by an overload of information, the dilemma that our students must be guided towards resolving is the oversupply of data; something that has become more apparent everyday as the World Wide Web continues to grow at an exponential rate.
<P>
The impact of this access to data is very demanding of students, and as part of the process of assisting them to develop their competencies in the management of data, the library works at being responsive to these ever changing circumstances in order to create a learning environment that is flexible and adaptive.  Students' abilities to think critically and to reason, need to be fostered by creating an environment where students can develop inquiry-based questioning skills, develop their imaginations and engage in collaborative dialogues and communications.  By encouraging students to think together we can encourage them to think for themselves.  They need to be able to access raw data from which they learn to generate meaningful information.  The great problem for students is not the overload of information but the oversupply of data.  They need experience in learning to discern where value lies in the mass of data now available.  They must learn how to separate the "signal" from the " background noise".
<P>
Information literacy means understanding how data and information, in whatever form, is gathered, analysed and synthesised to become meaningful knowledge.  The mass of data is to be seen as a means to an end, not as an end in itself.  For Somerset College a library is a place that provides information services (raw data) that allows the college to work towards fulfilling the mission of ensuring that students become effective users of ideas and information.<BR>

</CENTER>
During the year our LOTE students have been involved in a wide range of activities, designed to give them opportunities to practise their skills in a variety of ways and to develop their understanding of other cultures.  Many of our students have excelled in competitions and a few have been fortunate enough to take part in Study Tours to Germany and Japan.  
<P>
Year 8 German Concert<BR>
A large number of Year 8 concerts are held annually in May for LOTE students on the Gold Coast, and our Year 8s attended the German Concert, as they studied German in the first semester and Japanese in the second semester.  This year they displayed their creative flair in an impressive array of costumes and cakes with a German theme.  The efforts of our students and their parents are always greatly appreciated by all who attend the concert, and the Somerset contingent managed to take First place in both the Traditional and Novelty sections of the Fancy Dress and Cake Decorating Competitions.  
<P>
Our Quiz representatives,  Pieta Modini, Sharon Malecki and Andre Dauwalder, were quick on the buzzers and received a "Champion School" certificate for their outstanding knowledge of language and culture.
<P>
Hanami Concert and Picnic<BR>
The Hanami Concert and Picnic is another major event held in the same month.  The Year 10 Japanese class traditionally writes a short play especially for the occasion, and the students in Years 4 - 6, as well as their parents who attend the concert, have the opportunity to observe the older students with more advanced language skills using the language in a light-hearted, enjoyable manner.  The older students also assist with the delicious lunch, part of which is prepared on sizzling barbecues on the front oval.  We are very grateful to Mr. Horrocks for his hard work in establishing this wonderful tradition, enjoyed annually by hundreds of Somerset parents and students.
<P>
Role-Plays<BR>
The writing and performance of short plays on varying themes is an integral part of LOTE learning at Somerset College.  In Semester 2, for example, the Year 8 students presented entertaining skits incorporating the themes they had studied relating to teenagers, parties and popular activities.  Using language in role-play situations helps students to become more aware and more tolerant of socio-cultural differences.  The Years 9 and 10 German classes have transformed the classroom into various settings, including parties, cafes and shopping centres and the humour and originality of their work never ceases to impress.
<P>
Guest Speakers and Visitors from Germany and Japan<BR>
During 1996 the Japanese and German classes in Years 10 to 12 enjoyed a visit from a guest speaker from the Australian Institute of International Understanding, who talked to the students about career paths and the opportunities for short or long term exchanges in Germany and Japan.  Australia's trade relations with these countries were discussed and it was emphasized that proficiency in languages other than English is a valuable asset.
<P>
We have also welcomed groups of Japanese students who were taken on a tour of the school by students from the Japanese classes.  A visit from the President of the C.I.Y.E., an organization which facilitates international youth exchange, was kindly co-ordinated by a Somerset parent, Mrs. Chicaco Smith.  Mr. Ohno and the teachers who accompanied him on his visit to various classes were delighted to be warmly received by staff and students and were particularly impressed with the enthusiastic greetings and farewells in Japanese from our students in the Infants Department.  The C.I.Y.E. plans to select trainee teachers from Japan who will travel to Australia to assist with our Japanese classes.  Mr. Ohno presented Mr. Arnison with a fine trophy to be awarded annually to the top senior student of Japanese.
<P>
A German teenager, who was spending part of her summer holidays with the Richards family, presented a talk to students of German in Years 10, 11 and 12 about the German school system and the leisure pursuits of German teenagers.  She observed that our school day was much longer than hers and that life at Somerset College was quite hectic in comparison.
<P>
Gold Coast Speech Contest<BR>
The Gold Coast Speech Contest is an annual event which attracts increasing numbers of contestants each year.  This year the contest, which is held at the Griffith University's Gold Coast Campus, expanded to include five languages:  French; German; Indonesian; Italian and Japanese.
<P>
Contestants deliver a prepared speech and are also required to engage in conversation with judges, who are native speakers.  While awaiting the announcement of the major place-getters, who are invited to attend the official presentation ceremony, students and their families savour a variety of international foods and are entertained in the courtyard with a multicultural programme.  Our winners of Gold, Silver and Bronze medals in German were Andre Dauwalder, Karen Miley, Vanessa Phillips, Penny Butcher and Lisa Boman and in Japanese Lee Copperwaite, Olivia Stuckey and Paul Chiu.  A number of other students in Years 7 to 12 were highly commended.
<P>
Study Tours of Japan and Germany<BR>
Four of our students spent most of July on a Study Tour of Germany.  David Novakovic (Year 9), Sarah Tandy (Year 10), Jackie Bruce (Year 11) and Vanessa Phillips (Year 11) stayed with host families in Trier and Saulgau, and in Youth Hostels in the larger cities of Munich and Berlin.  They returned with improved skills, increased confidence and a great deal of enthusiasm for their German studies.  It was the second German Study Tour for Vanessa and Jackie, who were elated at having had the opportunity to rekindle friendships made in 1994.
<P>
Margaret Opitz and Bonnie Shum spent three weeks in Japan in September on the Combined Schools Study Tour.  They visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima, Kobe and Osaka, and were able to practise their Japanese in a variety of situations.  The girls were also invited to take part in a traditional tea ceremony and were taught ikebana, the art of floral arrangement.  In Tokyo and Kobe they attended high schools and made many friends.
<P>
The Export Challenge Competition<BR>
Year 10 Japanese students, Hayley Tarr and Simon Lu, won second prize in the Export Challenge Competition, organized by the Department of Education in association with International Business Week.
<P>
The aims of this competition for students of LOTE in Years 10, 11 and 12 were to promote export awareness, to provide the opportunity for students of languages to consider the role of languages and cultures in international business, and to encourage the use of language skills and cultural knowledge in developing an export proposal.  Hayley and Simon were required to write 2,000 words, partly in English and partly in Japanese, telling a group of Japanese people about the benefits of a Queensland product.
<P>
S.A.G.S.E. Scholarship Winners<BR>
Lisa Boman (Year 12) and Justin Richards (Year 10) were awarded Exchange Scholarships by the Society for Australian German Student Exchange.  After sitting for demanding examinations which assessed their writing, reading and listening comprehension skills, they were chosen to progress to the most challenging stage of selection, an interview by a panel of four native speakers from various professions.  Justin has decided to postpone his exchange, however Lisa is leaving on the 2nd of December 1996 for Germany, where she will stay with a host family, attend school and enjoy the Christmas and New Year celebrations.  Scholarship winners will also take part in a week's trip through Bavaria and Austria.  
<P>
Exchange Students<BR>
Jessica Scantlebury, another member of the Year 12 German class, will spend a year in Germany as a Rotary International Youth Exchange student.  The Robina Rotary Club is sponsoring Jessica's exchange, which will involve stays with up to four different host families, as well as a tour of Europe with other exchange students.  Jessica took part in our 1994 German Study Tour, and was encouraged by her experiences to apply for an exchange.
<P>
Kimberley Orth (Year 11) is also eagerly awaiting her eight week exchange in Germany, which was arranged through Southern Cross Cultural Exchange.  Kimberley will be staying with a host family in Munich.  We look forward to her return to the Year 12 German class in 1997 with tales of her adventures.
<P>
Margaret Opitz, who studies both Japanese and German and who has recently returned from Japan, is planning to spend six months in Germany next year on a cultural exchange.  
<P>
One of our Year 5 students, Jessica Richards, has joined the Year 9 German class to help develop her language skills.  Jessica will have the opportunity of attending school in Austria for six months next year.
<P>
One of the most rewarding aspects of language teaching is hearing news from past students who have had the opportunity to travel to the country of their target language.  Over the years many of our past students have returned to the school to share their experiences with younger language learners.  Shanon Cook, who completed her study of German in Year 12, 1993, has recently written about her travels in Germany and Austria.  It is encouraging to hear that Shanon was delighted with her language proficiency which has enabled her to live with families, communicate with a wide range of people and travel extensively.
<P>
Farewell to Mr. Horrocks<BR>
Finally, I would like to farewell Mr. Horrocks on behalf of all his students and colleagues and thank him for his valuable contribution to LOTE activities and the development of our Japanese Programs.  
<P>
Thank you also to all the students and parents who have supported our activities during 1996.<BR>

According to John Dewey, "Education is not preparation for life. It is life itself". This theme is reflected by similar statements in the National Statement on Mathematics for Australian Schools which states:<BR>
"We need to aim for the improvement in both access and success in mathematics for all Australians. All Australians must leave school well prepared to meet the demands of their lives and with the knowledge<BR>
and attitudes needed to become lifelong learners of mathematics". 
<P>
Mathematics is studied because it is a tool for understanding our world, for understanding how society operates, and for understanding and discussing other related topics. 
<P>
Students need to know when, how and why to apply mathematical techniques in a real life situation. Learning mathematics by doing hundreds of problems from a textbook will not develop mathematical understanding. What you learn will not benefit you unless you look to apply it on your own after you have finished your school education. Students need to keep this in mind when they approach their future mathematical studies.
<P>
From a competition point of view, 1996 has been another successful year. The Year 8 team of Bradley Spencer, Mitsuhiro Sumiya, Nathan Shuker, Matthew Spong and Matthew Sonter won the Mathematics Team Challenge. The Year 9, 10 team finished second in their division.  won the local Gold Coast Year 8 Pacific Coal Competition and went on to represent the region where they performed very well but did not gain a winning position. The following students won prizes in the Australian Mathematics Competition: - Annaleise Grummitt, Jason Langenauer, Dale Hembrow, Jenny Lu and Bradley Spencer. This result places them in the top 0.3% of the 500 000 students who enter this competition. There were another seventeen students who gained a high distinction which places them in the top 2% for the competition. It was pleasing to note that all year levels were above the state averages for this competition.<BR>
	<BR>
The format of the Year 8, 9 and 10 exams have been changed this year to bring them in line with the new Maths A, B and C that is operating in the senior school. The end of semester exams are broken into two criteria called Techniques and Applications and a further criterion called Communication is also addressed in this new format. Communication does not have a separate section but is spread across the other two criteria. The work program for these three years has been modified to allow for more problem solving to be included and further modification will continue next year.
<P>
I would like to thank the teachers of my department for all their hard work that they have put in during the year. A special thank you to Mrs Tiplady who has been filling in for a large part of the year due to the unfortunate accident to Mrs Pearson. I am happy to report that Mrs Pearson has been back working on a reduced load this term. My spies have informed me that even though her speed around the classroom has been slightly decreased, this has not reduced her effective teaching style. I wish everybody a safe and happy holiday and an exciting 1997.<BR>

</CENTER>
The music department within Somerset College is an extremely busy and active department within the college.  All pupils are encouraged to participate in any of the various ensembles, orchestras, band and choirs offered to the level that they feel comfortable.  The aim of the music department is to foster a genuine love of music through both performance and academic work, a love for music for music's sake.  To this end, the work within the department has been successful as one only has to walk into the Performing Arts Centre on any day (weekends included) and it would be unusual not to hear students creating music (although some would say 'Is that music?') in almost every nook and cranny of the building.  As music appears to invade every facet of our lives, it seems to invade the very bricks and mortar of the P. A. so that even after the students have left their sounds still echo through the building.
<P>
To show how the music department works, this report is going to take a calendar approach to show the machinations and the achievements of the department throughout 1996.
<P>
January<BR>
While many students still have not even contemplated the return to school for the new year, the music department has started its gradual creaking back to life. The planning for the school year is under way with dates for performances being decided upon, musicals being selected, staff considerations and the like.  This year saw a Co-curricular handbook posted out to all families in the initial school posting to facilitate the planning for the co-curricular program.  Enrolments for this program are considered and finalised during January so lessons can start at the commencement of the school year.  The  co-curricular staff meet so timetabling of students can be considered and fees can be determined.  Staff for the beginning of the 1996 year were Mr. Anton Koch (brass), Mrs. Louise Schriek (dance), Ms. Yenny Barnes (drums/percussion), Mr. Bryce Leader (guitar), Mr. Rob Soothill (keyboard), Mrs. Helen Little (piano, recorder, theory, flute), Mrs. Lois Beel (voice), Mr. John Harlow-Charlton (speech), Miss. Justine Michel (speech), Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:lmason@somerset.qld.edu.au">Lisa Mason</A> (string), and, Mr. Rodger Graham-Wilson (clarinet, saxophone).  We welcomed the return of Miss. Helen Hurst to teach cello and also the commencement of Mr. Benjamin Singh who has come in to help with the numbers of violin students we have. These staff members have worked exceptionally hard throughout the year with both individual students and also in the preparation of ensemble groups for concerts and  for the general good growth of the department.
<P>
February<BR>
February saw the commencement of the school year proper. The first day sees a meeting of senior students where they are informed of the various opportunities available. Students write their names down on lists for the various ensembles and they then decide what is possible for them to participate in with considerations to their studies, sporting commitments, debating chances and the myriad of other opportunities available to them at the college.  Rehearsal times are published and the whole machine moves into first gear.  
<P>
The first full week of school sees all the rehearsal commence in both Junior and Senior school.  A week of rehearsals looks like this:-
<P>
Monday	before sch	lChamber Orchestra	senior<BR>
		Junior chorale	junior<BR>
		recorder ensemble	junior<BR>
	lunchtime	clarinet ensemble	senior<BR>
		flute ensemble	junior  <BR>

<P>
Friday	before scl	saxophone ensemble	senior<BR>
		Junior String Orch. 2	junior<BR>
	lunchtime	jazz band	senior<BR>
	after school 	show choir	senior
<P>
This list shows the comprehensive list of times and opportunities available for the students. Not included in this list are the musical rehearsal which at this stage of the year has the Junior school rehearsing for the Year 6/7 production on a Tuesday after school and various other times for the principals, the Year 4/5 musical using an afternoon of school time with the Senior Musical rehearsing on a Wednesday lunchtime. The early weeks of February see auditions occurring for the principal and minor roles of the Senior musical and also auditions for the openings in show choir.  Auditions for the Junior School Musical will have been finalised by this stage and students are well on their way to learning their parts.
<P>
Another important event that occurs in February is the auditions for students who wish to take part in the Gold Coast Independent School Music Fest.  Students from the independent schools on the coast audition to become part of the many groups that perform as part of this Festival.  Performance groups for the Festival include:-  string orchestra, concert band, dance troupe, recorder ensemble, speech choir, two festival choirs.  These groups rehearse for individual items as well as a massed item.  Many of our junior school students were successful in gaining positions in these groups.
<P>
The first Year 12 dinner took place and Year 11 student Penny Cooper kindly provided the light dinner music for this function.  
<P>
As can be seen by this the department has moved very quickly from first gear into second and by the time March arrived, it was moving at full speed.
<P>
March<BR>
March draws term one to its close and is the month that most of the ensemble groups have an opportunity to perform.  Throughout the month of March staff and students were kept very busy.  Early in the month were the family services for both senior and junior school.  The concert band, vocal group and show choir performed at the senior service providing music for the hymns, processionals and anthems whereas in the junior service those same tasks were filled by JSO 1 and the junior chorale.  As this was the first public airing for these ensembles for 1996 they all acquitted themselves very well considering the short preparation time had.   In the line of services, JSO 1 also participated in the providing of the music for the Year 7 Ecumenical Service held each year.<BR>
 <BR>
The first of the Master Musicians' Series occurred.  Pianist Lev Vlessenko presented a programme that proved why he has attained a legendary status as proponent of the keyboard.  Lev was not in the best of health for this concert and has been extremely ill since, so the second half of the concert was completed by his daughter, Natasha.  Although it was disappointing that Lev could not do the entire concert, Natasha's playing was by no means a disappointment.  It was easy to see why she has been such a valuable appointment to the Conservatorium's teaching staff.  It was Natasha's second visit with the series and it is wonderful that the series is gaining an almost familial attachment with its performers.
<P>
At the end of the month the Celebration of Literature occurred which kept most of the musicians on their toes for the weekend.  The jazz band provided pre-dinner music for the Literary Dinner whereas various ensembles and soloists provided entertainment in the Hard Back Cafe during the session breaks.  Ensembles and soloists who provided music included the flute trio, Lincoln Ramsay, the recorder ensemble, Vojazz and we were fortunate to have the return of two past students, Martin Hall and Peter Cuthbert who entertained lunch time visitors with their own brand of light music.  During the weekend the show choir also provided the anthem for the chapel service.  The show choir continued their performances in the month by providing light music for the commencement of Grandparents' day and the recorder ensemble continued on their trouping ways by providing incidental music for the P-3 Easter Hat parade.
<P>
In the last week of the month, the first of the formalised Performers in Training Series of concerts was held.  These concerts are designed to allow students the opportunity to perform publicly in an informal and friendly setting in front of a very encouraging audience.  The students enjoy these concerts as it allows them the possibility of trying out exam pieces, audition pieces and even just the work they learn in their lessons in a concert setting.
<P>
All other rehearsals continue throughout the month with the Junior School musical having had their full school day rehearsal and the Senior School musical using the last few Thursdays of term to commence their after school rehearsals.
<P>
The academic side of the music department finds the end of term hectic with exams in both the written and aural areas as well as assignments being due along with practical exams.
<P>
The holidays arrive at the end of the month and many students and staff breathe a huge sigh of relief as it is time to recuperate for the next term.  Principals of the Senior Show continue to work during the holidays, learning lines and songs for the show.<BR>
April<BR>
The holidays at the beginning of April gave a nice start to the month with all spending the time recuperating ready for action in Term 2.  Rehearsals during the holidays now see the principals of the senior school musical ready for action.  
<P>
Crunch time now occurs for the senior musical with Thursday after school rehearsals happening in earnest and the musical camp occurring on the weekend after Anzac Day.  Choreography and costuming are now well under way as they are  for the junior musicals which are getting close to performance time.  The band for the junior musical now starts its rehearsals as the first night looms very close.  The Andrews and Franklin church service pops up at the end of the month just to keep the musicians on their toes. 
<P>
The second of the Master Musicians' Series occurred with the wonderful voice of Dr. Hester Wilce.  Dr. Wilce was the winner of the McDonald's Aria Competition and her performance on the night left no one in doubt as to why that was so.  The programme was one that all could appreciate and her supporting cast of players were of the same high standard that she obviously strives to achieve. 
<P>
May<BR>
May looms as a very busy month for all of the students.  The Juniors Musicals, Year 6 and 7 - "Kids in Space" and the Year 4 and 5 - "Cosmo's Cure", reach their first night of performance.  After many months of preparation,  the hard work of rehearsal for singing, dancing, and acting, the making of costumes, the building and painting of sets and backdrops finally had its grand presentation, and, what a success it was.  Both shows had exuberance that their young casts bring to the stage as well as a wealth of talent which was carefully sculptured by the staff who worked with these young people to prepare the show.  Many thanks go to all the staff, parents and students who worked hard to present these musicals.
<P>
While the junior musical was wending its way successfully to its close for the 1996 year, the senior students were out doing different performances.  Some senior students were involved in playing for the junior musical while the senior string orchestra were off playing for a conference held at Seaworld and the Senior String Trio were playing for the 50th Anniversary ball at the Southport Yacht Club.  The Starkey chapel kept some musicians busy while the clarinet ensemble provided the dinner music for the Year 12 dinner and Vojazz provided light music for the 2000 Club lunch.
<P>
Elective music students and Year 8 music students were kept busy with assignments and practical assessments along with keeping up with their studies for their end of semester exams.  
<P>
Junior school students were not allowed much respite after finishing the musical as those selected then went straight into rehearsals for Music Fest.  The senior school musical stepped up another gear and moved to some Sunday rehearsal times.
<P>
June<BR>
With the commencement of the examination period in the Senior school, rehearsals for the senior students slows down only to begin in earnest again in the final week of term.
<P>
Music Fest rehearsals continue for the Junior school students involved ending with the actual Music Fest performance in the last week of term.  Once again this was a resounding success with a standing ovation for the finale number.  It is definitely an event worth seeing as it celebrates the wealth of talent our young students have.  As well as performing in the Music Fest, our young performers also produced the first junior school instrumental concert for the year.  As all would appreciate it takes a little time for younger students to put together material for a concert but this concert demonstrated the wealth of talent our young students have.
<P>
The second Performers in Training Concert took place in the last week of term, and this, along with the Laver and Veivers chapel kept our senior students busy.  All breathed a sigh of relief at the end of term as once again it was hoped that the holidays would give everyone the energy for the onslaught on term 3, and, what an onslaught it would be.
<P>
July<BR>
The commencement of Term 3 was, we thought, as busy as it could be.  The holidays saw the principals and various groups from the senior musical working on parts of the show in readiness for the increasingly getting closer opening night of the show.  The first month saw the all day rehearsals, the technical runs and the dress rehearsal for the show.  Band rehearsals for the show commenced which is a sure sign that the show is not too far away.  Once again the band consisted of current students, past students, parents, friends of the school and staff and is one of the most pleasant aspects of the show as all these people with different backgrounds and jobs come together for the purpose of creating a tight ensemble for the performances.  
<P>
A Starkey and an Andrews and Franklin chapel kept musicians busy providing music as did Founders' Day when the concert band, vocal group and show choir provided music for the service which served to open the new Technology centre.  
<P>
Amid these 'everyday' performances, the Junior Performing Arts Festival occurred.  This festival is run along the lines of a mini-eisteddfod although it has now outgrown the idea of being a 'mini' eisteddfod with entries numbering close to the 1000 this year.  The festival allows students to perform in a relaxed atmosphere which is sometimes lost in the bigger competitions.  Students have their performances rewarded with encouraging remarks from adjudicators as well as the now obligatory chocolate frogs for the P-3 competitors and ribbons and certificates.  The immense task of organising this festival falls on Mrs. Helen Little who once again did an outstanding job and thanks must go to her and her band of helpers for making this the success that it was.
<P>
The third of the Master Musicians' series also occurred during this month with the flying fingers of harpist Sebastian Lipman.  Sebastian came to the college from his post as solo harpist with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and it was easy to see why he had that position with such a prestigious orchestra.  The magic that poured from the fingers of Sebastian will something that lingers in the mind and ears of all those who heard him perform on that night.
<P>
August<BR>
August would have to be one of the two busiest months for the department.  The first day of the month saw the opening night of the Senior musical 'Evita' and it was in the six days of August that the school family and supporters saw the culmination of many months of hard work by students, staff and friends of the school.  The months of planning with music, choreography, costumes, set design and painting, collection of props, sound, lighting and effects preparation all came to fruition to present a most memorable show.  Participants are keenly awaiting the release of the movie to see if it lives up to our show.  Thanks must go to all those involved with show as it would not be possible to stage a musical of  Evita's magnitude without the efforts of everyone on the team.
<P>
Straight after the senior musical saw many students involved in the Tropicarnival Eisteddfod.  This year seemed to be among the most successful the college has had.  There were debut performances of some groups and the tried and true continued to perform and compete with much aplomb.   Results were all very good and gave the students much to look forward to for next year.  The jazz band competed for the first time and although not placing were among the top group of competitors.  Also a debut performance was that of the junior concert band who received an honours rating for their efforts.  The senior concert band also received an honours rating for their efforts and were very unlucky not to have placed in the top three as later performances showed.  Other instrumental competitors were the junior string orchestra 1 who gained a second place, the senior string orchestra who received an honours rating, the clarinet ensemble who came second in the secondary school's trio or quartet section and the saxophone ensemble who came second in the open instrumental ensemble section.  Chorally, the college was extremely successful this year with the junior chorale being placed second in their section, the show choir being placed first in the open vocal ensemble section, the vocal group being placed third in the open choral section and first in their section of the secondary school choral section.  Both the Girls' choir and the Boys' choir also competed and gained respectively a highly commended and a special mention.  
<P>
As well as the eisteddfod, junior students were participating in the Year 3 string concert which is always a delight.  This concert is a culmination of the work done in the Year 3 programme and it is at this point the students then decide if they are going to continue.  A Laver and Veivers chapel kept others of our musicians busy.  Amidst these performances those who study the academic subject found themselves once again preparing for assignments and practical assessments.  Vojazz also performed at another 2000 Club lunch. 
<P>
Mid-way through August  cultural photos for the school magazine were taken.  A quick look through the magazine, looking at the photos and articles, shows the amount of students and the time that is involved in the various activities.  To take a step back and look at this can be quite mind boggling.
<P>
The fourth concert in the Master Musicians' Series also occurred in this month.  For this concert the college welcomed Brian Hawkins to the Performing Arts theatre along with Carmel Kaine, Markus Stocker (who has become almost like family now), Barry Davis and Stephen Savage.  Brian Hawkins is the principal viola player at the Royal College of Music in London and along with fellow players provided an evening of chamber music which will take a long time to match.
<P>
At the end of August, the department farewelled Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:lmason@somerset.qld.edu.au">Lisa Mason</A> who has taken twelve months leave of absence to work in England along with her husband Scott and although sad at her departure we look forward to welcoming her back in 1997 and sharing with her the new ideas she has learnt overseas.  We also welcomed Miss. Mara Pradella to the staff of the department .  Mara, who is replacing Lisa for 12 months, came to us from working in Orange and is experienced in many facets of string tuition.
<P>
September<BR>
September and spring has arrived and the music department finds itself heralded with those words that it dreads, 'Now that the musical and eisteddfod are over, you must have nothing to do'.  Sometimes we do wish but no, the rehearsals continue and the performances continue as there is always something else around the corner.
<P>
The month started with students of the academic subject preparing for various assessment items and the Year 8 students madly putting together their rock performances.  The assessment day for these performances is always one full of high spirits and quite enjoyable to watch.  While these assessment items were being prepared for and being completed, performances were still underway.  The show choir performed at the opening of the ADAPE conference and the clarinet ensemble, the string trio and Vojazz provided pre-dinner music for the final dinner of the conference.  Following hard on the heels of these performances, the jazz band, string trio and Vojazz performed at a charity benefit at Paradise Springs for Legacy run by the Royal Hutt River Navy.  Rave reviews received by all the performers ensures future engagements of this nature.
<P>
The last week of term saw another in the Performers in Training Series of concerts.  Again more students had the opportunity to 'strut their stuff' in an informal setting.  Academic testing during the last week kept a lot of the musicians out of mischief and once again everyone sighed a huge sigh of relief when the term ended and holidays were with us once more.  During the holidays Vojazz was kept busy with an audition for carols at Myer for the Christmas season in which they were successful.
<P>
October<BR>
The department thought that August was busy month but it seemed as though it was just the warmer for October.  Throughout the holidays between term 3 and 4 the show choir continued rehearse because the Queensland Festival of Music's presence was about to be felt by the school.  Three of the college's performance groups travelled to Brisbane to compete in the Queensland Festival of Music this year.  The senior strings,  although not placing, played extremely well, and as this was their debut performance in this competition have shown themselves to be a force to be contended with.  Show choir gained a highly commended in their section and were in receipt of a special mention for their efforts.  The concert band repeated their efforts of last year by winning their way through the heats with a superior rating into the final.  Although not placed the band played extremely well with adjudicators recommending an upgrading.
<P>
Cultural Awards evening took place at the end of the second week and during a very busy weekend.  This awards evening allows all the various performance groups within the department to put themselves on display and to show their capabilities.  A concert of this type will always be long but this year's was most entertaining.  At the end of the evening, blues, full colours and half colours in music, drama and performing arts are presented recognising the achievements of the students in these areas.  
<P>
As mentioned, the weekend of the cultural awards evening was very busy.  As well as the evening's performances, students were also performing at other events on that weekend.  Several bands from the school were competing in the Battle of the Bands, (congratulations to Michael Deanshaw for his award for most outstanding live performance), the clarinet ensemble, saxophone ensemble, show choir, Vojazz, junior chorale and dance troupe all performed at the Youth in Performing Arts Festival, while on the same night, the clarinet ensemble, saxophone ensemble, show choir and Vojazz fronted up to perform at the Paradise Springs Spring Festival. 
<P>
During this same, rather hectic weekend, Katherine Day travelled to Brisbane to audition for the 1997 Australian Children's  Wind Orchestra.  Katherine was successful in her audition and will travel to Sydney early next year to work with the orchestra.  Congratulations to Katherine.
<P>
Strings were kept busy in October with the string trio playing at past student, Fiona Sharpe's wedding, and also playing at the Insight International Conference held at the Southport Yacht Club.  Vojazz also sang at Fiona Sharpe's wedding.   The final Performers in Training concert was held in the last week of the month while the students of the academic subject put their final touches on assignments, practical pieces and preparation for exams.  
<P>
The last day of October saw the Valedictory chapel and the last day of formal lessons for the Year 12 students.  This service gave the jazz band and Vojazz to provide appropriate music to help in the farewelling of our senior students.
<P>
November<BR>
The beginning of November sees the onslaught of the examination period and for the music department a time to catch breath before the onslaught of the final mad two weeks before Scholars' Day.
<P>
November saw the senior string orchestra provide the music for the valedictory dinner along with Penny Cooper on piano.  The junior school put together its final concert for 1996 bringing together all the various ensemble groups within the junior school as well as solo performers.  
<P>
The final concert in the Master Musicians' Series also took place in November.  This concert was performed by the Conservatorium Opera school and was an excellent finale for the series.  In front of a full house, the members of the school performed selections from various musicals, operettas, operas and films and the show of appreciation by the audience is testimony  to  the talent of these young performers.
<P>
Carols night is always a favourite among the musicians and this years was no exception with the concert band providing the music for the carols, anthems being provided by the junior chorale, vocal group, show choir and Vojazz, and the wandering minstrels who performed before the commencement of the service.
<P>
All of this brings us to today, Scholars' Day.  The work presented by the music department here today is the culmination of 12 months work (although realistically only 10 months).  It is the sum of all the highs, the lows, the laughs and the tears that goes into putting performances together.  The students have worked hard to give to you, their audience today the only thing we can ever ask them to do, and that it is , their best.  Please sit back and enjoy it.
<P>
Postscript  - December<BR>
Although the students have gone for another year and we think about those that have left, there will be next year another bunch of eager young faces mixed with the ones that have grown a little older and maybe a little wiser.  So the journey goes on, the planning for the new year, the dates to be considered, the music to be purchased, the instruments to be repaired and renewed, the courses to be planned, and on it goes.  None of this is new but none of this would be possible without the support of the students and parents whose involvement in the co-curricular and extra-curricular area is entirely of a voluntary nature.  To these students and parents a large thank-you must be given and it is hoped that as much pleasure is derived from the involvement in these activities as there is in the sense of achievement found in a job well done.
<P>
Large thank-yous must also be given to the following staff for all their time and effort in making the music department one of the best:
<P>
Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:arowe@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anne Rowe</A> for her work in the academic subject of music as well as her work with the senior concert band as director and the jazz band as director,<BR>
Miss. <A HREF="mailto:blanham@somerset.qld.edu.au">Belinda Lanham</A> for her work in the junior school in the area of music as well as her work with the Junior chorale,<BR>
Mr. Rodger Graham-Wilson for his work as director of the junior concert band, junior training band, chamber orchestra, clarinet and saxophone ensembles and rehearsal assistant with senior concert band,<BR>
Miss. Mara Pradella for her work with all of the string orchestras (JSO 1, JSO 2, JSO 3 and SSO) and with classroom music in Year 4,<BR>
Ms. Yenny Barnes for her work with the percussion ensemble and as a rehearsal assistant for senior concert band and junior training band,<BR>
Mrs. Louise Schriek for her work with the special dance troupe,<BR>
Mrs. Helen Little for her work as the director of the junior and senior recorder ensembles and the flute ensemble.
<P>
Many thanks to all of these people.<BR>

</CENTER>
Outdoor education plays a pivotal role in the development and the education of our future citizens.  Many of our students' talents are hidden in the normal class room situations so direct experiences in the outdoors, with nature and with other people, can be great motivators.  Difficulties that students have in an academic setting are generally related to problems with trust, an inability to relate to and communication with others, a lack of understanding of others, an inability to think for oneself and solve problems. 
<P>
Our program from Year 3 to Year 11 attempts to address the education of our students in the areas that are difficult to cover in the normal classroom situation. The time for House Tutors and students to mix and chat in an informal and relaxed setting is some times difficult to find. Our society seems to be moving rapidly into an era where personal contact is being replaced by the telephone, internet and television.  If you don't like what is happening then hang up, turn off the modem or push the button; discussion, communication, tolerance and understanding are not actively promoted by modern society.
<P>
Young people of today have been accused of looking for the fast thrill, the quick fix and the expedient route but it is with great optimism that I receive reports from recent camps.  A majority of Year 10 students asked to participate in the long hikes into the 'semi-wilderness', a strenuous yet rewarding experience where the natural beauty of the Mt Barney area was explored.  The wonders of nature cannot be more real than for those who sailed with the whales and the dolphins on South Passage or almost patted a platypus from an ice-covered raft early one morning on the Nymboida River.  These wonders are no less real for the Year 3 students  at their camp-out on the back oval when the stars are brought to life at the astronomy evening.  
<P>
As our ever decreasing natural areas give way to progress it is important that environmental education takes a high priority for us all. What  better way to achieve an understanding about what is happening and what needs to be done to maintain these precious resources than for students to experience the areas at first hand.  Even if they never return I trust they will have an appreciation of the necessity to preserve and responsibly manage these natural areas. 
<P>
Education must be fun, it must be exciting and it must stand us in good stead for our future no matter how old we are.  From all reports the majority of students this year have achieved these goals and more.  
<P>
I express my sincere  appreciation for the efforts of the staff who once again have offered me wonderful support.  It is solely due to their enthusiasm, and willingness to go the extra mile that our students can be offered so many  opportunities.<BR>

A Drama and Production Perspective
<P>
When one casts a cursory glance over the year's cultural activities, the 1996 cultural calendar does not appear significantly different to the previous year.   Some activities are falling within the tradition mode.  While the literal translation of traditional being something 'that has prevailed or been accepted from generation to generation' might not universally hold, there is a distinctly static nature to the cultural calendar.  (As an aside it would be difficult to incorporate more activities.)  A paradox results with the calendar becoming static and the Performing Arts being inherently dynamic.  Paradoxes are an essential part of the Performing Arts.  To illustrate with theatre.  Theatre is unique to the moment, yet it is repeatable.  Theatre is spontaneous, yet rehearsed.  In theatre the audience believes, yet it does not.The paradoxes occur because they are a reflection of human existence as are many parts of the Performing Arts.
<P>
1996 - The Paradox of Tradition and Change<BR>
House Plays<BR>
The House Plays are now a permanent part of the calendar and it is almost a tradition for Veivers to win.  To break from tradition though, Starkey did win, with a powerful interpretation and performance of 'Living with Lady Macbeth'.  The play was directed by Conrad Taylor and Kiah Wood.  All the plays are a total student production.  They are in charge of their own destiny.
<P>
The one significant change that has occurred is the timing of the festival.  With the introduction of the Literature Festival, one week has effectively been taken off the preparation time of page to stage.  The actors and directors cope with the very short time line brilliantly.
<P>
Literature Festival<BR>
The demands on students for the festival are quite onerous.  Changes to the format this year included use of outdoor venues; musical ensembles; two book launches and a play for the dinner.  The word 'performing' is synonymous with preparation and each of these changes involved significant preparation.
<P>
Technical and performance expertise are two variables which contribute to the success of the festival.  The students performed their demanding tasks with consummate ease and accepted the different challenges enthusiastically.
<P>
National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA)<BR>
The format of the workshops has not changed significantly since the NIDA Open Program began at Somerset.  They have always been in the June/July holidays and they offer workshops for students, actors and teachers.  Next year NIDA is proposing to conduct national workshops through the year.  Support for the program is always substantial.
<P>
Westpac International Master Musicians Series<BR>
The one static of the series is the quality of the artists with the variety of their skills providing the change.  The program began with Lev Vlassenko on piano and ended with The Wonderful World of Music Theatre by the Conservatorium Opera School.  Each year the series is organised with the Queensland Conservatorium of Music and makes a profound statement about Somerset's commitment to the Performing Arts.
<P>
Cultural Awards Night<BR>
When one peruses the program of the night's entertainment two conclusions can be drawn.  It is both a long night and a good night!  It is difficult to encapsulate a year's activity in one night although the Cultural Awards Night goes close.
<P>
A Chess performance was the significant change that occurred this year.  Christopher Page was blindfolded and he competed against Joel Young in a game of 'Blind Chess'.  This was a captivating performance.
<P>
For many people this night is one of the highlights of the Cultural Calendar.  1996 was no exception with the combination of change and tradition.
<P>
Senior Musical - Evita<BR>
One event that can truly be called a Somerset tradition is the Senior Musical.  Since we began performing musicals in 1983, apart from 1985, the Senior Musical has been an annual event.  'Evita, the Musical' was an outstanding theatrical event with powerful principals, an energetic and disciplined chorus, and an army of skilful behind-the-scenes people.
<P>
The performances of the students in our musicals are always outstanding.  Each of us has our favourite show.  Evita was both brilliantly interpreted and performed and it will be fondly remembered.  
<P>
'Clarity of sound' is the best phrase to encapsulate the major change.  From a production perspective one of the most frustrating aspects of our shows is not being able to hear the performers properly after months of rehearsal.  This is no longer a problem as the sound system was significantly upgraded which improved both volume and clarity.  The upgraded sound system was financed by income derived from the hire of the Performing Arts Centre and related activities in the complex.
<P>
A great musical substantially enhanced by change.
<P>
Gold Coast Secondary Schools' Drama Festival<BR>
Somerset has participated in the Drama Festival since the school began.  The Drama Festival has been operating for a good many years as 1996 saw the 24th festival.  We again entered plays in the three divisions of Year 8, Junior and Senior.  The major change in 1996 was that, for the first time, students totally directed a play.
<P>
Year 8 Play<BR>
Mr. Geoff Pryor and Miss <A HREF="mailto:mo'connor@somerset.qld.edu.au">Maree O'Connor</A> directed 'Good Morning - and welcome to the last day of the final test at the Berlin Oval.'  The play was extremely entertaining with solid performances all round.  James Brown received a Best Actor Award and Sharon Malecki received a Best Overall Comedy Acting Award.
<P>
Junior Play<BR>
Stephanie Curran and Yasmin Smits, both Year 12 students, directed 'Ritual for Dolls'.  In the past students have assisted in the direction of plays but they have never had total artistic control.  This play deals with the universal themes of love and bigotry.  The ensemble cast performed brilliantly with Amy Vidgen receiving a Best Actor Award.
<P>
Senior Play<BR>
Mrs. Christine Lambert directed the melodrama 'Bullshot Drummond'.  This is a wonderful play which gave the actors an opportunity to utilise their comedy skills.  Exhaustion best describes one's state after viewing this hilarious story.  Ryan Johnson received a Best Actor Award for his extraordinary interpretation of Hugh Drummond.
<P>
Congratulations must go to all cast and crew of all the shows and to our inaugural student directors.
<P>
Use of the Performing Arts Centre (PAC)<BR>
The use of the complex is extensive with both internal and external demands. 
<P>
External uses are:<BR>
.	Queensland Arts Council<BR>
.	Gold Coast Independent Primary Schools Music Fest<BR>
.	Lions Youth of the Year<BR>
.	Queensland Debating Union<BR>
.	Queensland Theatre Company<BR>
.	Australian Film and Television Academy<BR>
.	Dance Companies<BR>
.	Other Schools - Musicals<BR>
.	Australian Society of Keyboards<BR>
.	Grin and Tonic Theatre Troupe.
<P>
The PAC is used extensively by all facets of the school.  Some of the more demanding (not already mentioned) requiring both rehearsals and/or technical expertise are:<BR>
.	Franklin House - Purple Faces<BR>
.	Starkey House - Fashion Parade<BR>
.	Junior School Performing Arts Festival<BR>
.	Junior String Concerts<BR>
.	Performers in Training Concerts<BR>
.	Junior Musical<BR>
.	Junior Christmas Concert<BR>
.	Drama Assessment nights and days<BR>
.	Dance Concert - Mrs. Louise Schriek<BR>
.	Science Week.
<P>
While the use of the PAC does not fit neatly into a tradition or change paradigm it does illustrate the demands on staff and the building.
<P>
Support Crews<BR>
The PAC would not function if it were not for the generous support of the<BR>
.	Front of the House - Elly Van Vliet<BR>
.	Box Office Administration - Jane Ryan<BR>
.	Technical Crew - Students.
<P>
The transitory status of students embodies the changes that occur within schools.  The technical crew has been relatively stable with the present Year 12 comprising the bulk of the crew over the last couple of years.  Strong leadership does contribute to an efficient team and this has certainly been the case with Trent Moffatt leading the lighting crew and Temujin Morgan leading the sound crew.  Their enthusiasm, innovation and discipline was always appreciated and will be missed.  The changing of the guard!
<P>
Overview<BR>
Change for the sake of change does not necessarily result in more rewarding experiences.  The combination of tradition and change in the Performing Arts at Somerset does appear to be an effective mix.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the following members of staff who have worked in the Drama Department this year - Mrs. Christine Lambert, Mrs. Margaret Doherty, Mr. Jon Barker and Miss <A HREF="mailto:jpullar@somerset.qld.edu.au">Jean Pullar</A>.  There is always something extra that has to be done with performance work and the willingness of staff to contribute that little bit extra ensures the success of many activities.  It has been a busy year.
<P>
1996 was a year which combined both tradition and change but the one attribute that was always constant was quality!<BR>

1996 has been yet another successful year for the Science Department at Somerset College,  The highlight of the year was without doubt, in July when Year 12 student, Annaleise Grummitt represented Australia in the International Chemistry Olympiad in Moscow and took out a Bronze medal.
<P>
In addition it has been particularly pleasing to see around 50% of the Grade 11 population elect to study each of the senior subjects, Physics and Chemistry.
<P>
Many students have been involved in a variety of activities throughout the year.  Prior to the commencement of school in January, fifteen Year 10 students attended the innovative Siemens Science School at local Universities, thirty Year 12 students visited tropical Heron Island and Year 12 student Catherine Tarr attended the National Youth Science Forum in Canberra.
<P>
In May, twelve of our senior chemistry students demonstrated their practical skills in the Raci National Chemical Analysis Competition at Griffith University.  All took out  certificates of varying degrees of competency.
<P>
The annual Science Week was held in July.  Numerous scientists enthused the students from preschool to Grade 12: to mention a few - archaeologist Sue Solomon, Alistair Beer re electrical issues, Dr. Lang - geologist (QUT), Val Tancred - worm farmer and Pippa Jones - hands on science activities.  The Australian Institute of Physics Annual Youth Lecture was given in this week by Dr Jak Kelly from the University of New South Wales, on the topic 'Physicists do Everything'.
<P>
Later in July, the Royal Australian Chemical Institute Annual Youth Lecture was given by Dr Bruce Bawden from James Cook University. The topic was 'Flavours, Odours, Medicines and Poisons'.
<P>
Shortly after,  the Somerset College Science competition was held.  Once again it was really good to see the Great Hall filled to capacity with projects from preschool to Grade 10.  Prizes were awarded in all grades.  Grade 9 students Jarrod Shandley and Thomas Hobman took out the Bridges Shield.
<P>
Many students took their projects further and won additional prizes in the Gold Coast and Brisbane Science competitions. 
<P>
On Scholars' Day 'The Robert Gatenby Memorial Prize for Project Work in Junior Science' will be awarded.  It is very pleasing to see this kind of innovative work being given prominence on such an important  occasion.  I thank the Gatenby family for their contribution of this memorial prize.
<P>
Many students received certificates at varying levels in the Raci National Chemistry Quiz which was held mid year.  Mark Haron in Grade 7 was awarded a plaque of excellence for his perfect score.  In addition the National Science Quiz run by the University of New South Wales proved to be equally successful for many students. 
<P>
Annaleise's success in Moscow brought prominence to the Science Olympiad programme.  As a result this year, fourteen Grade 11 students took on the challenge of the Olympiad examinations in October.
<P>
There's no doubt that science continues to flourish at Somerset College.  A combination of dedication and motivation from those who learn and those who teach, not forgetting the invaluable contribution of the laboratory staff.  My sincere thanks go to them all. <BR>

National Profile Statements, Key Competencies, S.O.S.O., Asian Studies integration, Internationalising Communities, Competitions, Excursions, visitors and somewhere in there the development of the skills, processes and knowledge that only History and Geography can manage - it certainly hasn't been a boring year for the Social Science Department in 1996 !
<P>
The ending of the official Magnet Schools programme has seen a move into a less organised  but no less interesting and diverse continuation of the integration of Asian studies into all aspects of our curriculum from pre-school to Year 12.  Contact has continued with the Access Asia organisation and continued funding from AISQ  and ALGAS has seen further additions to resources at the school, as well as the funding of teacher attendance at important conferences.  Nanette Bidmead, who has already in the past won an AEF scholarship to China with <A HREF="mailto:gparr@somerset.qld.edu.au">Gail Parr</A>, is now in the process of producing a thesis on the importance of incorporating Asian studies across the curriculum.
<P>
Our involvement with the Asia-Wise Australia-Wise competition continues and has been again rewarded with a range of credit and distinction results.  Particular congratulations to Janine Genn for her high distinction, with a score of 97%.  The competition is an interesting one, in that students are allowed to research the answers.  However, the questions are pretty tough, and marks are deducted for incorrect answers, so guessing can be a dicey business.  Negative results are possible !
<P>
Year 8 students continued their Asian experience with their visit in Term 3 to the Taoist templenear Nudgee in Brisbane.  The visit was rounded off with an Australian flavour with their visit to Victoria Point, where they practised the Geography skill of field sketching and learnt something about the environment of the area.  With many families not being original "Coasties", the Year 8s' look at local history, finalised by a day long excursion to local points of interest, helped them place themselves in the local area.  The everyday implements and re-creation of a pioneer cottage found at the Gold Coast History Museum gave many students cause for thought, as did  many of the inscriptions on gravestones at Southport Cemetery and on Neddy Harper's memorial in the Cascade Gardens.
<P>
Historical excursions for the senior students included a visit to the Antiquities Museum at Queensland University and subsequent use of the facilities of the Undergraduate  Library.
<P>
Geography excursions have included visits to Brisbane for the Year 12s, to study the effects of gentrification,  a look at the physical environment of Currumbin Creek for the Year 11s, the study of a variety of local shopping developments for the Year  9s and the beaches for Year 10s,  and a visit to Lamington's Rainforest for the Year 8s.
<P>
The Year 11 and 12 Ancient History students also enjoyed a Greek night out in Term 3.  Luke Vaughan's suggestions to the belly dancer were thankfully ignored and Esa Valttila enjoyed an impromptu Greek dancing lesson.  Many thanks to Mrs Stonier for organising this Ancient History 'bonding' experience !
<P>
Results in subject specific competitions continue to be good.  In the annual QHTA State-wide essay competition Esa again featured gaining a Highly Commended in the Year 12 Modern History section.  Our Year 11 Modern History results were even more pleasing, with Leanne Hammond gaining 3rd place with  her essay on a comparison of the USSR before and after World War II, and Graeme Cuthbert topping the State with his study  of Stalin's regime in the 1930's - well done, Graeme !  For several years now, we have successfully taken out first place in one year level or another and it's great to see Graeme continue the tradition.  More interestingly, attention has in recent years shifted in the education debate from not just a concern about the lack of girls who do science and maths but the lack of boys in the humanities. Of 36 students who gained a place or a highly  commended mention in the State competition for Year 11 and 12 Ancient and Modern History, only two were male - and both were from Somerset.  
<P>
Our competition successes had started earlier in the year with some great results in the Australian Geography competition. A number of students performed very well, with an impressive list of credits, distinctions and high distinctions. Of special note were the results of  Robert  Gatenby and Sam Oglethorpe, who both scored in the top 1% of all entrants, Australia wide.
<P>
The coming year promises to be no less exciting, with the school beginning its reorganisation of the secondary school subjects more obviously into the key learning areas.  For next year, that will mean Year 8 students studying SOSE (the Study of Society and the Environment) - a blend of History, Geography and Commerce -  rather than separate and identifiable History and Geography.  It is the wish of all in the department to continue to develop the skills and knowledge we have developed in the past, and to enable students to continue to develop an understanding of the society in which they live. It is our intention to produce a new course that will place high emphasis on scholarship. I'm sure we will succeed.
<P>
At this point, it is appropriate to indicate why I am so confident of our ability to make the move to SOSE a positive move.  My belief is based on my confidence in the staff of the Social Sciences Department who work unstintingly throughout the year and without whose tremendous contribution the success of the Department  could not be possible.  My heartfelt thanks to you all.<BR>

</CENTER>
1996 has seen many changes to our sports structure and while we anticipated many teething problems these fears were largely unfounded as we have sailed through with solid results and increased opportunities for our students.
<P>
Our inter school sports association was reduced to five participating schools this year - A.B. Paterson College, All Saints Anglican School, Emmanuel College, Trinity Lutheran School and Somerset College.  The schools involved were all supportive of using our sporting afternoons more productively and this meant that some teams could occasionally finish after school time.  This has been a rare occurrence and the infrequent inconvenience has been more than compensated by our sports people being engaged in meaningful competition where games are no longer halted at half time to meet buses.
<P>
We have also committed to our current winter and summer sports and will no longer have to justify the inclusion of a sport each year.  With this consistent approach we have begun the process of developing all our sports through from the Junior School to Year 12.  The positive aspects of this have already flowed through with coaches now more committed to upgrading their own expertise, realizing it can be used each year.
<P>
The reduced size of the new association has also allowed us to offer our development sports in school time.  This year was our first trial for the formal inclusion of rowing, sailing, golf, kayaking, equestrian, middle distance running and cycling into the regular inter school sports time slots.
<P>
Our development sports, through talent identification programs, have already reaped some excellent results with Jamie Williams, Darren Tonna, Bridget Woodman and Nicholas Crilly all being selected in the Australian Junior Kayaking Team and Sara Carrigan and Natalie Aitken representing Queensland in cycling after only being identified at school 18 months ago.
<P>
While many of our young athletes choose to train for development sports, just as many remain committed to our inter school sports competition with our 1st XV Rugby, 13yrs Rugby, 1st XI Soccer (Boys), 1st Hockey (Boys and Girls) and Junior Hockey (Boys) all winning premierships.  Our 1st XI Hockey Girls' Team went on to place 4th in the State wide Telstra Cup - a tremendous effort.
<P>
Our summer sports teams have achieved similar success particularly our Cricket and Tennis Teams who have remained on top of the ladder so far this season.  
<P>
With so many students striving towards elite performance the school saw a real need to help the students combine the strenuous academic load at Somerset with their sporting commitments.  The new Sports Development Support Program, co-ordinated by Mr. <A HREF="mailto:bnewell@somerset.qld.edu.au">Brendan Newell</A>, will give the necessary support to all students involved in elite sports from Years 8 to 12.  This program however will focus primarily on the growing numbers of students choosing to study their senior over 3 years, thus enabling them to pursue sporting excellence while maintaining their best academic performance.
<P>
The culmination of a busy year in sport is the Sports Awards Dinner that is so well supported by students and parents.  In this, an Olympic year, we were lucky to be joined by David Weightman and Robert Scott who won Silver in Atlanta in the Double Sculls - Rowing.  Congratulations to all those students who were awarded on the night.
<P>
Finally, I would like to thank all the staff who give so freely of their time to coach and support our young students in their endeavours.  I look forward to 1997 now, with its new challenges in sport.<BR>

As this is the first of many such reports I will be writing as Head of Technology I feel a certain responsibility to establish a unique style for reporting on our Department.  However, in keeping with the only real tradition of technology I have decided that whatever I establish now is likely to be superseded in twelve months time so something new and innovative each year is most appropriate.
<P>
Most of us at some stage or another have come face to face with a member of the Technology species.  Some are friendly and co-operative while others can be uncontrollable beasts that threaten our sanity.  Whatever your experience, Technology exists to assist us and if it cannot be understood, tamed and controlled to fulfil a need then there is little point in attempting to use it.  It is the role of all in the Technology Department to foster understanding, ability and confidence in others so that they may benefit from its use. 
<P>
The Technology Department at Somerset encompasses the subject areas of Computing, Graphics and Engineering.  I am confident I speak for all the Technology staff in describing involvement in this field as exciting, challenging, demanding and rewarding. This is primarily due to the unique rate of change of the content addressed in such subjects. Keeping abreast of constant developments is extremely demanding on the personal time of staff and I sincerely commend their dedication and commitment in this regard.  However, for this same reason, it is also unrealistic to expect the traditional role of the teacher as being the authority on all subject matter to endure in technology related subjects.  In the Computer Studies area in particular, the role of the teacher is anything but traditional.  Students are encouraged to explore, discover   and conquer under the guidance of the teacher, yet it is not uncommon nowadays that we as teachers can learn from our students.
<P>
'BEWARE THE SELF PROFESSED EXPERT - THE MORE ONE LEARNS ABOUT A SUBJECT, THE MORE ONE FINDS THERE IS TO KNOW !'
<P>
1996 has seen a number of significant developments in the Technology Department. Most notable has been the completion and official opening of our world class Engineering Technology Centre by the Minister for Education and Somerset parent, the Honourable Bob Quinn.  Accompanied by Federal Member John Bradford and Mayor Ray Stevens, Mr Quinn initiated the instructions to the centre's robot to cut the ceremonial cake.  Founders' Day also coincided with the publication of a feature article about our new centre in an internationally circulated engineering journal.
<P>
Our 37 Engineering students have survived their first year of involvement in this challenging new area of our curriculum with the same enthusiasm as they began but with a greater appreciation of the discipline required of Engineers.  We have also enjoyed visits from many of the Junior School classes.  Some of the Year 3's were somewhat disappointed that the robot was 'just an arm' and couldn't walk down to their classroom to talk to them.  My first reaction was to grin but there is every likelihood such a situation will eventuate in their lifetime.
<P>
Another significant development in 1996 has been the boom of the Internet and all it has to offer the Somerset Community at large.  Early in the year we established a permanent connection to the Net and access by staff and students from Preschool to Year 12 at numerous locations throughout the College is now a facility  that many use regularly for Email correspondence and research.  Resources such as this don't just appear.  Mr <A HREF="mailto:btaylor@somerset.qld.edu.au">Bill Taylor</A> began this constantly evolving project at the beginning of 1995 and it is solely to his credit that two years later the students and staff accept  and use the Internet with the same familiarity as they use a biro.  I am sure Bill will give more detail in his report. 
<P>
In May of 1996 we also welcomed aboard Curtis Hodge.  In his role as help desk support and technical assistant, Curtis is the saviour of many.  His eagerness to assist, wealth of knowledge and pleasant manner  is greatly appreciated by all.
<P>
Graphics continues to be a popular subject among our students and it has been great to hear of successes from past students now engaged in related fields such as Architecture, Engineering, Graphic Arts and Interior and Industrial Design.  The quality of student work is constantly improving as they continue to apply the latest computer graphics techniques to their work.  With the Graphics teachers leading the students down this path, reinforced by work experience observations and many students having such facilities at home, the shift towards electronic mediums for the production of technical graphics continues unabated. 
<P>
To all staff, students and parents who have contributed to the expansion of technology at Somerset throughout '96 I extend sincere thanks on behalf of all who benefit from your involvement.

1996 has been another busy year for the Parents and Friends' association with involvement in school building projects, fund raising and our many social occasions. The building of the Bus Shelter was a $50,000 commitment undertaken last year with $19,000 raised from the '95 Chocolate Drive.  I know the building time extended over the estimated four weeks but I'm sure our children will appreciate the cover this summer.  Last year we also pledged $100,000 over the next two years to the Swimming Pool Fund  - this year's donation of $50,000 has been passed on to the fund.
<P>
The Somerset Shop continues to run smoothly under the guidance of convenor Maree Lazarides and her assistant Virginia Owen.  This year a hire system for senior English books was introduced, an outlay of $36,000 was spent at the beginning of the year with a further $18,000 to be spent by year's end.  The number of book titles now available to our children has greatly improved and will continue to do so.  We have anticipated that the levy of $60 will not increase in the foreseeable future. Some parents have voiced reluctance to the change as they still have many of the current books but we feel over the next couple of years the increased volume of books and this simple system will show them the benefits to their children.
<P>
The Canteen contribution this year was $30,000. The new improvements have certainly made for a better working place. Jacquie Hunt was our convenor for most of the year. Unfortunately she had to leave us to help her mother run their family business in Sydney,  Our new convenor is Sue Armstrong, who is a parent and has been one of our  volunteers over the years.  We must thank assistant Lyn Walker for helping  Sue to settle in and for her tireless efforts over the year.  To the 70-odd mums who give up their time to help in the canteen, thank you is not enough, without you we could not run at a profit.  A profit that is for the benefit of your children.  The Canteen is always in need of more volunteers; it's a great place to meet new mums and catch up on school gossip.
<P>
Thank you to all parents and friends who have helped in the Somerset Shop, the Canteen, Athletics Day and assorted functions  - your contribution  is greatly appreciated.
<P>
The Chocolate Drive was again our major fund-raiser for the year.  Thank you to Bambi Singer and her band of helpers for raising $16,000.  We all appreciated your effort.
<P>
Our functions this year have been well attended.  The "New Parents Dinner" was a lovely intimate affair which was enjoyed by both parents and teachers.  "Quiz Night" as always was an outstanding success thanks to the efforts of Jann and  Richard Stuckey.  Revellers at the "Somerset Gala Ball" danced the night away.  The "Stampede" was a runaway success.
<P>
The members of the  Parents Auxiliary have continued with their great meetings this year.  Each has been well attended with a variety of interesting speakers.  Thanks to class co-ordinators who have organised morning teas for parents to get to know one another, it has been a great team effort.  The P & F would like to thank the out-going committee of Sharon Hunter, Mary Warren, Kerry Watts, Denise Benjamin and Jenny Blyth for their initiative.  Good luck to the 1997 committee of Diann Eadeh, Fiona Spencer, Susie Goldstein, Carol Burow, Jacki Hendy and Karen Ramsay.
<P>
I would personally like to thank the spouses of my management committee who put up with the late night meetings and offered support where it was needed.  Thank you Ross Sorbello who once again has taken on all our catering operations.  Bambi Singer who seems to live at the school, Roslyn Neville and Robyn Phillips for invitation writing and  organising the ball.  Lastly Christine Wiltshire for deciphering my handwriting each week for the newsletter.
<P>
The 1997 Committee was elected at the general meeting on 11th November and will assume office at the Annual General Meeting of the Association to be held on Monday  10th February 1997.  I have had a wonderful fourteen years being a Parent at Somerset, next year I become a Friend, the first Friend on the P & F.  I look back over those years and can't imagine what it would have been like not to be involved.  I encourage all parents and friends of parents and students to make the effort to become part of Somerset College in some way.<BR>

</CENTER>
Students at Somerset can be particularly proud of both their efforts and achievements in chess during 1996.
<P>
Whilst chess in the curriculum for Grade 3/4 students has continued in term 2, beginners, intermediate and advanced squads have continued to be coached by Andrew Allen as an extra curricular activity.
<P>
Both the Primary and Secondary  schools had outstanding team results in the middle of the year.  In the Queensland Primary Schools Teams Championships held over 3 Sundays, Somerset teams came first and second in A grade.  Congratulations to  Rhys Rakauskas, Damon Jackson, Chris Page and Robert Kingston, the State Champions, and also to Mitchell Carey, Richard Laufer, Mei-lin Robertson, James Littlejohn and Jenny Chiu.
<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Lisa & Amalia Gebhard</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
I received a long email from <A HREF="mailto:paul@stayfree.com">Paul Gebhard</A> who is involved in an <A HREF="http://www.stayfree.com">holiday and hospitality exchange club</A> in Athens. His two daughters have been living life to the full since they left Somerset
<P>
<A NAME="Lisa"><B>Lisa Gebhard</B></A> left Somerset during the first term of grade 12 in 1987 to return to Greece from where she took her British A levels before going on to complete a 4 year degree in history at an American College (Deree) in Athens. She graduated with a bachelor degree in 1993 since when she has been working in the reception of the Athenaum Inter Continental Hotel. A few months ago she was promoted to the Reception of the Executive (Club) floor. The latest excitement was looking after Liza Minelli for a week when she was her to give one solo performance to 4500 people in the famous ancient Herodian theatre below the Acropolis (superb performance).
<P>
If any Somerseters (?) are passing through Athens they can 'phone Lisa in Athens on 6778709 and her email address is <A HREF="mailto:Lisa@stayfree.com">Lisa@stayfree.com</A>
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Amalia"><B>Amalia Gebhard</B></A> (the traveller!) graduated from Somerset with the Class of '89. She got a years deferment from Griffith which she spent working in a travel agency in Athens and doing some studies at Deree before returning to the Gold Coast to start her 3 year degree course at Griffith in Business and Hotel Management. As a student she did part time work at Pizza Hut and Royal Pines Resort. After graduating from Griffith she worked for about 2 years at Royal Pines. For the first few months she was a banqueting waitress and also ran the Coffee Shop from time to time before being employed in the main reception where she worked until January 1996. 1995 holidays included a Ski trip to South Island, a week in Fiji and a long weekend in Sydney. 
<P>
This January she took long leave to visit Europe visiting Ireland, Scotland and England (all the family joined her in London for her 23rd birthday (on St Valentine's Day) and celebrated by attending the matinee performance of "Miss Saigon" followed by a dinner attended by three friends from the Gold Coast who were also in London. Amalia then made a six week bus tour or Europe travelling to France (saw Michael Jackson in the foyer of a hotel in Monte Carlo!), Belgium,Luxembourg,Germany, Holland,Italy, Spain,Switzerland, Hungary and the Czech Republic before coming to Athens. She worked here for 3 months as a hostess of American tour groups that arrived in Piraeus by cruise ship and stayed at the Inter Continental for the days they were visiting the sights of Athens. She also had time to have short holidays on some of the Greek Islands such as Aegina, Hydra, Santorini and Myconos before returning to Queensland on 28 August. Rumour has it that she has just got a new job at a hotel in Brisbane (we heard it from the Somerset vine tree yesterday! No doubt Amalia will be calling us at the week end to tell us herself!)She is staying temporarily with the Barrett family and her Gold Coast number is 55971734. Her E-mail address is <A HREF="mailto:Amalia@stayfree.com">Amalia@stayfree.com</A>
<P>
By the way Amalia has funded the cost of all the above travel from saving her wages and working along the way. 
<P>
Right now a Somerset class mate of Amalia, <B>Nikki Mewett</B> (who later graduated from Bond), is in Greece with two friends and they stayed a night with us in Athens recently on their way to the islands. 
<P>
A post card arrived here yesterday for Amalia from Vancouver from <B>Renae Chircop</B> (also Somerset graduating class of '89). She seems to be having a great time and is just about to take up a job for the winter in a Canadian ski resort. She also graduated in Hotel Management from Griffith.

<title>Web66: Eight Minute HTML Primer</title>
<center>
<h1> The Eight Minute HTML Primer </h1>
<h2>From <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/">Web 66</A></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>Preparation Time:
8 Minutes</i><p>
This primer explains eight basic HTML directives which should take about eight minutes to master.
Hint:
it will be much easier to understand if you print the source and the resulting page and compare the two printouts.
<h3>Ingredients</h3> <ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.austin.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/Utilities.SW/SimpleText.1.1.sea.hqx">SimpleText</a> </ul>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Study the example below.
<li>Make changes to the Default.html file on your server.
<li>View the changes with your WWW browser.
<li>Repeat until you understand HTML. </ol>
<h3>Primer</h3>
 HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language: the definition of the directives placed
in World Wide Web documents.<p>
Directives are enclosed in brackets.<p>
Directives normally affect the text between the directive and a closing directive.
A closing directive is normally the same as the opening directive but preceeded by a slash.<p>
The following eight directives enable you to format most basic documents: <ol>
<li><b>TITLE</b> gives the window title.
<li><b>H#</b> formats a header in large bold type.
<li><b>B</b> formats boldface type
<li><b>I</b> formats italic type.
<li><b>P</b> designates the end of a paragraph.

<li><b>HR</b> places a line, or horizontal rule, across the page.
<li><b>IMG</b> points at a picture to be placed on the page.
<li><b>A</b> creates a hypertext link to another page. </ol>
 The following example demonstrates these eight directives.
This page
shows the source, which is in a text file created with TeachText.
If you click on the example source, you'll see a working example of the resulting page.<p>
<hr> <h3>Contents of the file <tt>Example.html</tt></h3> <a href="Example.html"><img src="ExampleHTML.gif"></a>
<hr> <h3>Contents of the file <tt>Another.html</tt></h3> <a href="Another.html"><img src="AnotherHTML.gif"></a>
<hr> <h3>Contents of the file <tt>Example.gif</tt></h3> <img src="Example.gif">
<hr> <h3>Comments</h3> You might want to examine
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html "> NCSA's HTML Primer</a>

<H1>A Longer Example</H1>
This is a simple HTML document. This is the first
paragraph. <P>
This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.  This is a
word in <I>italics</I>.
This is a word in <B>bold</B>.
Here is an in-lined GIF image: <IMG SRC = "myimage.gif">.
<P>
This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  Here is
a hypertext link from the word <A HREF = "courses/course_index.html">foo</A>
to a document called "courses/course_index.html". (If you
try to follow this link, you will get an error screen.) <P>
<H2>A second-level header</H2>
Here is a section of text that should display as a
fixed-width font: <P>
<PRE>
On the stiff twig up there Hunches a wet black rook
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...
</PRE>
This is a unordered list with two items: <P>
<UL>
<LI> cranberries
<LI> blueberries
</UL>
This is the end of my example document. <P>

<!-- This is the Syntax for a comment, it will NOT appear on the web page -->
<!-- Comments are not needed on your page, they are purely here to help you learn to publish they can extend over several lines, in fact browsers ignore blank lines, line breaks and more than one space between words. 

Note that less than and greater than signs are used for telling a web browser what to do, the tags are NOT case sensitive (but page locations are)

 Here is how to end a comment -->

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Template page</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<!-- the title is what appears in the bar above the page -->

<BODY>
<!-- Beginning of the page displayed on the web -->
<center>
<!-- This tells the browser to center what follows NOTE centRE won't work! -->

<Img src="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/somelogo.gif">
<!-- this is the location of our school logo, it will be included in the display of this page, if you leave this line in -->

<H1>Template Page</H1>
<!-- this is a level one heading (there are five levels H1 .. H5, headings are turned on and turned off (see the /) -->

</center>
<!-- centering needs to be turned off too when you have finshed with it -->

You can type test freely    no matter how many     blanks you put between words or blank


lines you put in browsers will ignore all but one   space and all blank lines, to put a line break in use <BR> to put a couple in use <P> for paragraph 

Text can be made <B>BOLD</B> or <I>Italic</I> or <B><I>both</I></B> (remember to turn off commands in the reverse order they were turned on.
<P>
<UL> <!-- the beginning of an unordered list -->
<Li> This is the first line, the browser puts a leading dot in automatically
<Li> here is the next line
<ol><li> This is the first line of an ordered (automatically numbered list
<Li> it is nested within the unordered list because I haven't turned it off yet
</ol>
<Li> Now the nested ordered list is off, I can end the outer list
</ul>

There are also data lists
<DL>
<DT>Which have titles
<DD>and definition lines, the browser takes care of indenting and
<DD> all that stuff for you.

<BODY>

<IMG src="somelogo.gif">
<H1>Make your own Page</H1>
<H3>Abstract: This page allows you to create your own page, view it and publish it on our system (this last only if you have  a valid password). </H3>
</center>

The page will (may*) contain
<ul>
<li>The Somerset Logo (or more accurately a link to it)
<li>A Title  the same size as the title of this page
<li>An abstract the same size as the abstract above
<li>General text where blank lines will be treated as paragraph separtaors but otherwise in which you are free to do your own HTML
<li>The bottom of the page will contain your name, a link to your email and to Somersets home page and the creation date of the page
</ul>
<hr>
<H2>STEP 1</H2>
Your page must have a location and a page name 

The location must be in the staff folder although it could be within a folder within the staff folder.  so the prefix "http://somerset.qld.edu.au/staff/" will be added to your url (Universal Record Locator is the address of a page on the World Wide Web)

The page name needs to be  a valid new file name,  that is the folder (or directory) that it is going to be placed in must already exist and there must be no existing file with that name in the chosen folder. The file name has to be a single word (use _ to replace spaces if you must) be 25 characters or less in length not including the postfix which must be ".html" (don't forget the DOT)

<form method=POST action="../HyperCard.cgi$create_page:169:staff">

Here is an example
<B>http://somerset.qld.edu.au/staff/my_home_page.html</B>

Enter the location and page name for your page here<br>
http://somerset.qld.edu.au/staff/<INPUT NAME="location" VALUE="my_home_page.html" SIZE=40>

<hr>
<H3>STEP 2</H3>
Enter a title for you page <INPUT NAME="title" SIZE=40><br>
 it will appear in the title bar and as a level one heading

<H3>STEP 3</H3>
Enter an abstract <textarea name="abstract" rows=3 cols=60></textarea>
<br>this will appear as a third level heading

<H3>STEP 4</H3>
Enter the main body of your page <textarea name="body" rows=10 cols=60></textarea>
<br> this will appear as normal text: <P>
<B>*Note if you leave the Title and Abstract blank you can type or paste a complete HTML page in the body section (it will override all the default formatting including any information entered in the following steps). 
<P>
This is very useful, since you can paste the "source" of a page directly into this box, edit it and submit it. A good way to
<UL>
<LI>Make personalised copies of other pages
<Li>Modify your existing page
</Ul>
</B>

<H3>STEP 5</H3>
Enter your email address <input name="email"  value="mailto:someone@somerset.qld.edu.au" size="40">

<H3>STEP 6</H3>
Enter your real name <input name="author" size="40">

<H3>STEP 7</H3>
Enter a <B>valid</B> password <Input name="password" value=""> this is required to create or modify the page using this form. Now <input type=submit value="Submit"> your page
<H3>NOTE: TO VIEW THE MODIFIED PAGE YOU MUST PRESS THE RELOAD BUTTON</H3>
</form>
<H3>STEP 8</H3>
Linking: You can make a link to your page(s) from various other pages, a good one would be the <A HREF="email.html">staff email page</A>, you could either put the complete url of your page in place of your email address, or include the url in your comment
<P>
To include a link within your comment you would need to type something like this:
<PRE>
I have &ltA HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/staff/my_home_page.html"&gt
My very own home Page&lt/A&gt which I invite you to inspect
</PRE>
<NAME="loop">it will appear like this:</A>
<P>
I have <A HREF="#loop">My very own home Page</A> which I invite you to inspect

<P>
<H3>STEP the rest</H3>
<B>Editing your Page</B>
About now you are probably wondering how you are going to edit your page. or indeed use any other internet page as the basis for your page. This page is very much a primer, although it can be used to create or modify web pages there are better and easier ways especially via our internal network.
<P>
If you insist on using this form then here is how to generalise the editing of pages using it.
<ol>
<Li>Access the page from the internet,
<Li>"view source" (look for this in your browser menu) to display the raw HTML
<Li>Select copy and paste the source code  into the <B>body section of THIS page</B>
<Li>Enter the page address (or indeed a new address) into the location box
<Li>Ensure all other sections are blank, except for the page location and body
<Li>Edit the Body text
<Li>Type in a valid password (the same one used to create the page) and submit the page
</ol>
<P>
Alternatively you can access your page directly over the school's internal network and use any text editor to modify it, indeed I encourage you to bypass this form altogether and create new pages yourself. <A HREF="html_manuals/index.html">You can learn how to write HTML from our online tutorials</A>, many web sites and many books, but "view source" is the handiest method.

<LI>Learn web search techniques
<LI>Learn HTML for defining links (Anchoring Hypertext REFerences)
<LI>Learn more about HTML by looking at the balance of this page in a text editor
<LI>Develop efficeint editing techniques

<P>
<H3>Rationale</H3>
Although Bookmarks are a good way of recording links and then producing a research page, the management and transfer is a bit involved. This exercise has the added benefit of exposure to authoring on the web via HTML editing. 
<P>
 It is important that people can create on the web in order to understand it and to develop a measure of control for themselves in the information world, the web is very much self service, adequate management of its facilities requires active control, the term "user" was misconceived for computers and is moreso for the web.

<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
As the Web continues to explode in its own inimitable fashion, it is becoming more and more important to write HTML that conforms to certain guidelines.
Specifically, with the current diversity of clients for the Web (and we can only expect to see more!), it's become important to write HTML that will look good on <STRONG>any</STRONG> client, and not just on the specific client which the author may have access to.<P>
To that end, there are a few solutions.
One approach is this one -- documents which point out common errors one might make in the composition of HTML.
The other approach is software based -- a "lint"-like program for catching semantic errors in HTML, and perhaps even correcting them.<P>
The thing to bear in mind is that, if you follow these guidelines, your document may not look as best as it possibly can on a particular browser.
However, it also will not look ugly on any browser, which is the risk you take by disregarding these recommendations and tweaking your HTML for, say, Mosaic.
Unfortunately, Mosaic may render things differently from Lynx which may render things differently from TkWWW, etc, etc, etc.
These guidelines, in essence, should ensure the <EM>best fit across the space of all possible browsers</EM>, if you get my drift.<P>
This document does <STRONG>not</STRONG> purport to be a style guide, or a beginner's manual to HTML.
<A HREF="#furtherinfo">Fine documents already exists for these purposes.</A><P>
<EM>(Note: This document is fairly stable, but still open to amendment.
Please feel free to comment on that which is missing, wrong, right, or silly.
<STRONG>Especially,</STRONG> please point out anywhere that I don't follow my own guidelines -- I'll slink back and fix it, I promise!

<!-- the following is an experimental "include" to allow me to generate


multiple views of this document (these files should also be indicated


in the head) -->



<H2><A NAME="gp">Good Practices</A></H2>
Things contained in this section are good practices for the generation of any HTML document.
Specifically, this would include anything which should routinely be done in the creation of documents for the benefit of both reader and author.
<H3><A NAME="sigs">Signing Documents, and Time-Stamps</A></H3>
It is a good idea to sign and date all documents served on the Web, so that people viewing the documents can form some impression of the authority of the document (i.e. how recent it is, and how reliable the information provider is).
For example, <A HREF="#signature">this document has been signed.</A><P>
Also, when dating a document, try to avoid ambiguous formats.
For example, both the month/day/year and day/month/year format are used on the web -- so is "4/2/94" April 2 or February 4?
A solution to this is to use the name of the month (or an abbreviation).<P>
Finally, the best way to sign a document is to to include a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/LINK.html">LINK</A> element of type "made" in your <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html">HEAD</A> element.
For example:<P>
<PRE> &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;TITLE&gt;This is my Title&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:author@some.site.org"&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt; </PRE>
For an example, look at the HTML source of this document.





<H2><A NAME="ce">Common Errors</A></H2>
This section details common errors in HTML composition, that may lead to documents which are not fully device-independent.
The behaviors of these errors are undefined, so certain browsers may render them as intended <STRONG>but not all browsers are guaranteed of doing so</STRONG>.
Therefore, these mistakes should be avoided, even if your browser of choice renders your documents correctly.
<H3>Contents</H3>
<UL> <LI> <A HREF="#break">Paragraph Break Errors</A> <LI> <A HREF="#entity">Character and Entity Reference Errors</A> <LI> <A HREF="#url">URL Errors</A>
<UL> <LI> <A HREF="#url-dirs">Directory Reference Errors</A> <LI> <A HREF="#url-fqdn">Not Using Fully Qualified Domain Names</A> <LI> <A HREF="#url-rel">Improper Use of Relative URLs</A> </UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#quote">Missing Quotes in Start Tags</A> <LI> <A HREF="#endtag">Missed End Tags</A> </UL>
<H3><A NAME="break">Paragraph Break Errors</A></H3>
<em>This is probably the most prevalent kind of error, and is the number one culprit in cases of ugly HTML rendering.
If you fix nothing else, fix these!</em>
Perhaps the biggest misconception about the &lt;P&gt; element is that it signals an end-of-paragraph, rather than a paragraph break.
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/P.html">According to the specification</A>, "&lt;P&gt; is used between two pieces of text which otherwise would be flowed together".<P>
In most cases this is not important -- functionally, the &lt;P&gt; serves as an end-of-paragraph marker.
However, in certain contexts, use of &lt;P&gt; should be avoided, such as directly before or after any other element which already implies a paragraph break.
To wit, the &lt;P&gt; element <EM>should not be placed either <STRONG>before</STRONG> or <STRONG>after</STRONG> the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html">headings</A>, <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HR.html">HR</A> (can I get a ruling on this?
people don't handle HR consistently... X Mosaic has no white space before or after, and Lynx appears to put white space after), <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/ADDRESS.html">ADDRESS</A>, <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/BLOCKQUOTE.html">BLOCKQUOTE</A>, or <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/PRE.html">PRE</A>.</EM> <P>
It should also not be placed immediately before or after a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html">list element</A> of any stripe.
That is, a &lt;P&gt; should not be used to mark the end-of-text for &lt;LI&gt;, &lt;DT&gt; or &lt;DD&gt;.
These elements already imply paragraph breaks.<P>
<H4><A NAME="p-caveats">Caveats</A></H4>
Some clarifications on the above might be in order.
One is the difficulties of rendering appropriate white space by a browser. While it is true that all of the entities mentioned above imply a paragraph break, this only occasionally means that they also imply white space between sections -- this depends on the browser.
So, while you might feel inclined to add a &lt;P&gt; in order to fix white space problems, please think twice and avoid it if you can.<P>
Also, when using the glossary list (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html#z32">DL</A>), please try to avoid using multiple DD's (definitions of terms) in order to provide multiple entries for a term (DT).
Instead, use a &lt;P&gt; marker between paragraphs in a definition.
The use of a DD (definition) without a matching DT (term) is illegal, although a DT without a DD can be used without dire consequences.<P>
All clear now?
<h3><A NAME="entity">Character and Entity Reference Errors</A></h3>
Simply put, a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html#z4">character reference</A> and an <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html#z5">entity reference</A> are ways to represent information that might otherwise be interpreted as a markup tag.
For instance, in order to represent &lt;P&gt; in this text, I had to use <CODE>&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;</CODE> in my raw HTML.
There are currently <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Entities.html">five entities for this purpose in HTML</A>, as well as several entities which allow encoding of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/ISOlat1.html">ISO Latin-1 Character Set</A>.<P>
The most common error in the use of references is to leave off the trailing semicolon.
Also, no additional spaces are needed before or after the entity/character reference.
<h3><A NAME="url">URL Errors</A></h3>
Another misunderstood aspect of HTML is in the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">composition of URLs</A>.
<H4><A NAME="url-dirs">Directory Reference Errors</A></H4>
One grey area involves references to directories.
It is possible to request an index of a directory from an HTTP server.
The typical response from the server is to either return a pregenerated index document (which is often the document "index.html" in the referenced directory), or to construct an HTML document on the fly which contains a listing of all files in the directory.
However, when making such a directory reference, <EM>it is important to make sure to have a trailing slash on the URL</EM>.
That is, if you were to request the index of the directory which this document resides in, you would want to refer to it as <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/"> http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/</A>, not as <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition"> http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition</A>. <P>
Some servers are able to catch these errors, and provide redirection to the proper URL, but it's best to get the URL right in the first place -- notably because not all browsers support transparent redirection.<P>
<H4><A NAME="url-fqdn">Not Using Fully Qualified Domain Names</A></H4>
Problems can arise when the hostnames in URLs aren't fully qualified In local networks, you can usually refer to your own machines simply by their names -- for instance, here at Willamette we refer to our local WWW server as "www".
However, the server's FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is "www.willamette.edu".
The FQDN provides enough information that any host, anywhere on the Internet, can find this particular machine.
(It's like trying to find all the Vermeers in New York :).<P>
What happens is that an HTML might construct a link that looks like this:<P>
<CODE>&lt;A HREF="http://www/~jtilton/metanoia/"&gt;Metanoia -- A Change In Spirit&lt;/A&gt;</CODE><P>
which produces a link to <A HREF="http://www/~jtilton/metanoia/">Metanoia -- A Change In Spirit</A> that will only work for people in the local network that that machine is on.
A correct link would look like this, instead:<P>
<CODE>&lt;A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/metanoia/"&gt;Metanoia&lt;/A&gt;</CODE><P>
which would allow all of you who are interested in <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/metanoia/">Metanoia</A> to actually follow the link.<P>
This leads almost directly into:
<H4><A NAME="url-rel">Improper Use of Relative URLs</A></H4>
Finally, a brief section on relative URLs.
It is possible to construct a "relative" URL, which gives you the following advantages:
<UL> <LI> It's shorter. <LI> It makes a collection of documents which are linked together more portable (easier to move from directory to directory, or server to server). </UL>
However, relative URLs can also break things.<P>
A relative URL is a URL which doesn't contain all the necessary parts of a "full" URL (scheme, host, path information).
There's a large number of things which might fit this description!
The browser will try to assume the parts that have been "left out" by using the information from the URL of the document which contains the link.
However, not all browsers will make these assumptions in the same way.
Here's a short list of what's "safe" and "unsafe" (based on experience, and not on a specification anywhere -- unfortunately).
<DL>
<DT> <STRONG>Safe:</STRONG> Same directory relative URLs <DD> A reference to a document in the same logical directory (such as <A HREF="">&lt;A HREF="strict-html-gp.html"&gt;Good Practices&lt;/A&gt;</A>) is safe.
This kind of reference, roughly speaking, contains no "/"'s.
<DT> <STRONG>Safe:</STRONG> Same server relative URLs <DD> A reference to a document in the same server (such as <A HREF="/~jtilton/">&lt;A HREF="/~jtilton/"&gt;Eric's Hyplan&lt;/A&gt;</A>) is also safe.
This kind of reference, roughly speaking, will begin with a "/".
(It will also be semi-absolute, in that it starts at the top of that server's directory structure...)
<DT> <STRONG>Unclear:</STRONG> Most other kinds of relative URLs <DD> References such as &lt;A HREF="~jtilton/euphonium.html"&gt;&lt;/A&gt; can be dangerous -- sometimes browsers will interpret that as meaning "go up one directory level, find the directory '~jtilton', and then find 'euphonium.html' in it."
And sometimes they won't.<P>
Currently, I don't understand this problem well enough to speak about it.
I will try and get a canonical answer when next I have the energy to update this document.
<DT> <STRONG>Unsafe:</STRONG> "file://localhost/..." <DD> It's also possible to have a reference to "file://localhost/some/file/pathname".
What this does is references the file described on the <EM>local host of whoever is browsing the document.</EM> Which is why a reference to <A HREF="file://localhost/etc/motd">&lt;A HREF="file://localhost/etc/motd"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</A> will display the message of the day on your machine, not the message of the day on my machine.
Unless you know what you are doing, these references will really mess up your documents.
</DL>
<EM>(This sub-section isn't written very well, I fear.
If anyone has any better copy, I'll gladly put it here instead. -et/April 7, 1994)</EM>
<H3><A NAME="quote">Missing Quotes in Start Tags</A></H3>
One common error that I used to make all the time (I use Marc Andreesen's <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/html/elisp/html-mode.el">html-mode.el</A> for Emacs these days -- I had to learn Emacs, but now it's so much easier to write HTML!) was to leave off a quote in my start tags.
For example, this reference to the <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html">euphonium, king of instruments</A> should look like:<P>
<CODE>&lt;A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html"&gt; </CODE><P>
but I would often use<P>
<CODE>&lt;A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html&gt; </CODE><P>
instead.
I suppose by the end of that huge URL, I'd forgotten it was supposed to be quoted.
The behaviour of browsers upon encountering this varies -- some display a proper link, but you can't follow it, while others actually eat up huge portions of the following text, thinking it to be part of the URL.
<H3><A NAME="endtag">Missed End Tags</A></H3>
Many of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">HTML elements</A> contain information within them.
For example, <CODE>&lt;em&gt;emphasized text&lt;/em&gt;</CODE> would be rendered as <EM>emphasized text</EM>.
There is a start tag (<CODE>&lt;EM&gt;</CODE>), some content (which may include text, and in some cases, other nested elements), and an end tag (<CODE>&lt;/EM&gt;</CODE>, indicated by the &lt;/).
A common mistake is to miss the / in the end tag.
All elements (except empty elements, see next paragraph) must be terminated by an end tag -- otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.<P>
Some HTML elements may be empty, such as &lt;P&gt; and &lt;HR&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">The W3C</A> provides an <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html">extended discussion on element content</A>).
If this is the case, there is no need for an end tag.






<h2><A NAME="tta">Things to Avoid</A></h2>
This section concentrates on mistakes in HTML authoring that are more problems of aesthetics then problems of device-independence.

<h3><A NAME="mixing">Mixing HEAD and BODY Elements</A></h3>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">section on HTML elements</A> in the HTML specification</A> indicates that HTML documents should not mix those elements which belong in the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html">HEAD</A> of a document with those which belong in the BODY</A>. The urgency of this suggestion is unclear, but it does make a certain amount of common sense for readability of HTML code, and for conformance with possible future browsers which may not support the mixing of these elements.
Essentially, it lacks serious style points &gt;=).
<h3><A NAME="tags">Using White Space Around Element Tags</A></h3>
In general, the use of white space around element tags should be avoided.
If white space immediately follows a start tag, for example, the style changes implied by that element may be applied to the initial space, as well.
For instance, &lt;A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/"&gt; CZeCh THIZ 0uT &lt;/A&gt; would be rendered as <A HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/"> CZeCh THIZ 0uT </A>.
On some browsers, there may be white space around the anchor, which adds unwanted unsightliness to the rendering, and may lessen the impact of the document.
<EM>(This comment really applies to white space immediately following start tags, and immediately preceding end tags)</EM>.
<h3><A NAME="headers">Heading Usage</A></h3>
The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html">HTML specification</A> points out that a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html">heading</A> should not be more then one level below the heading which preceded it. That is, &lt;H3&gt; should not follow &lt;H1&gt;, etc.<P>
Also, it is pointed out that "a heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and white space (for example) necessary to render the heading".
Extra highlighting elements are discouraged, therefore.
<H3><A NAME="linktext">Meaningless Link Text</A></H3>
When creating documents, make sure that your links are meaningful -- that is, that they <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Printable.html">avoid online-specific references</A>, and that they <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">don't detract from readability</A>.
The text of your links should flow well in the context of the rest of your text <EM>(especially avoid the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html">click here</A> syndrome!)</EM>, and your text should also be able to stand alone as a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Printable.html">printable document</A>.<P>
In other words, avoid using sentences like, "You can find out more information about cows by clicking <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/about-the-net/libsoft/agguide.dos">here</A>".
(This is also bad because it refers to "clicking", which assumes that everyone is using a mouse with their browser!)
A much better alternative is "<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/about-the-net/libsoft/agguide.dos">More information about cows</A> is available."
<h3><A NAME="logical">Physical vs. Logical Character Emphasis</A></h3>
Since HTML (and also SGML) is designed to be a device independent language for describing the content of documents, most of the elements within it aren't intended to give direct control to the author over how the final page layout will look.
The major exceptions to this are in the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Highlighting.html">character highlighting</A> elements.<P>
There are two types of character highlighting elements -- physical and logical.
The physical styles involve things like "italic font", "boldface", etc; while the logical styles are things like "emphasis", "citation", "strong", etc.
It is <STRONG>strongly recommended</STRONG> that you employ the logical styles rather than the physical styles in your documents.
Using &lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt; to render text in italics will only be effective on those browsers which are capable of displaying italics -- which all browsers are not guaranteed to do.
It is far better to encode semantic content -- to describe things in terms of logical styles -- and then allow the browser to display that semantic structure as best it can, given its display capabilities.<P>
So, instead of
<DL> <DT> <i>&lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;</i> <DD> you might use <EM>&lt;EM&gt;emphasized&lt;/EM&gt;</EM>, or a <CITE>&lt;CITE&gt;citation&lt;/CITE&gt;</CITE>, and instead of <DT> <B>&lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;</B> <DD> you might use <STRONG>&lt;STRONG&gt;strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;</STRONG>. </DL>
This also leaves the possibilities open in the future for more sophisticated uses of these semantic renderings, which have much more inherent meaning than font styles like bold or italic.<P>
<EM>(Unfortunately, the jury is still out to lunch on this one.
One argument against logical character styles is that it turns out to be a bottomless pit, attempting to define logical styles for every possibility.
Physical styles, combined with the context of the text in which they are placed, seem to provide a much richer set without a huge number of tags.
Oh, well.
Use logical styles when you can, though.)</EM>

<a name="C1"><h2>Using JavaScript in HTML </h2></a>

<P>
JavaScript can be embedded in an HTML document in two ways:
<UL>
<LI>As statements and functions using the SCRIPT tag.
<LI>As event handlers using HTML tags.
</UL>

<h3>The SCRIPT tag</h3>
A script embedded in HTML with the SCRIPT tag uses the format:
<XMP>
<SCRIPT> 
   JavaScript statements...
</SCRIPT>
</XMP>

<P>
The optional LANGUAGE attribute specifies the scripting language as
follows:
 <XMP>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
   JavaScript statements...
</SCRIPT>
</XMP>

<P>
The HMTL tag, &lt;SCRIPT&gt;, and its closing counterpart, &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
can enclose any number of JavaScript statements in a document.
<P> 
JavaScript is case sensitive.
<HR>

<P>
<B>Example 1: a simple script.</B>
<P>
<XMP>
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
document.write("Hello net.")
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
That's all, folks.
</BODY>
</HTML>
</XMP>
<P>
<B>Example 1 page display.</B>
<P>
Hello net. That's all folks.
<HR>

<h3>Code Hiding</h3>
Scripts can be placed inside comment fields to ensure that your
JavaScript code is not displayed by old browsers that do not
recognize JavaScript. The entire script is encased by HTML comment
tags:
<XMP>
<!-- Begin to hide script contents from old browsers.
// End the hiding here. -->
</XMP>

<h3>Defining and Calling Functions</h3>
<P>
Scripts placed within SCRIPT tags are evaluated after the page loads.
Functions are stored, but not executed. Functions are executed by
events in the page.
<P>
It's important to understand the difference between defining a
function and calling the function.  Defining the function simply
names the function and specifies what to do when the function is
called.  Calling the function actually performs the specified actions
with the indicated parameters.
<HR>

<P>
<B>Example 2: a script with a function and comments.</B>
<XMP>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
<!--  to hide script contents from old browsers
  function square(i) {
    document.write("The call passed ", i ," to the function.","&lt;BR&gt;")
    return i * i
  }
  document.write("The function returned ",square(5),".")
// end hiding contents from old browsers  -->
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<BR>
All done.
</BODY>
</XMP>

<P>
<B> Example 2 page display.</B>
<P>
We passed 5 to the function.
<BR>
The function returned 25.
<BR>
All done.
<HR>

<h3>The HEAD tag</h3>
Generally, you should define the functions for a page in the HEAD
portion of a document.  Since the HEAD is loaded first, this practice
guarantees that functions are loaded before the user has a chance to
do anything that might call a function.
<HR>

<P>
<B>Example 3: a script with two functions.</B>
<XMP>
<HEAD>
<SCRIPT>
<!--- hide script from old browsers
function bar() {
   document.write("<HR ALIGN='left' WIDTH=25%>")
}
function output(head, level, string) {
   document.write("<H" + level + ">" + head + "</H" + level + "><P>" + string)
}
// end hiding from old browsers -->
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<SCRIPT>
<!--- hide script from old browsers
document.write(bar(),output("Make Me Big",3,"Make me ordinary."))
// end hiding from old browsers -->
</SCRIPT>
<P>
Thanks.
</BODY>
</XMP>

<P>
<B> Example 3 results.</B>
<SCRIPT>
<!--- hide script from old browsers
function bar() {
   document.write("<HR ALIGN='left' WIDTH=25%>")
}
function output(head, level, string) {
   document.write("<H" + level + ">" + head + "</H" + level + "><P>" + string)
}
document.write(bar(),output("Make Me Big",3,"Make me ordinary."))
// end hiding from old browsers -->
</SCRIPT>
<P>
Thanks.
<HR>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
Use single quotes (') to delimit string literals so that scripts can
distinguish the literal from attribute values enclosed in double
quotes. In the previous example, function bar contains the literal
'left' within a double-quoted attribute value. Here's another
example:
<xmp>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="Press Me" onClick="myfunc('astring')">
</xmp>

<HR>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="C2"><h2>Scripting Event Handlers </h2></a>
<P>

JavaScript applications in the Navigator are largely event-driven.
<i>Events</i> are actions that occur, usually as a result of something the user does.
For example, a button click is an event, as is giving focus to a form
element.  There is a specific set of events that Navigator recognizes.
You can define <i>Event handlers</i>, scripts that are automatically executed
when an event occurs. 

<P>
Event handlers are embedded in documents as attributes of HTML tags to which you 
assign JavaScript code to execute.
The general syntax is
<XMP>
<TAG eventHandler="JavaScript Code">
</XMP>
where TAG is some HTML tag and <i>eventHandler</i> is the name of the event handler.

<p>
For example, suppose you have created a JavaScript function called
<i>compute</i>. You can cause Navigator to perform this function when the user clicks on a
button by assigning the function call to the button's <i>onClick</i> event handler:

<XMP>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="Calculate" onClick="compute(this.form)">
</XMP>
<P>
You can put any JavaScript statements inside the quotes following <i>onClick</i>.
These statements get executed when the user clicks on the button.
If you want to include more than one statement, separate statements with a semicolon (;).
<P>
In general, it is a good idea to define functions for your event handlers because:
<UL>
<LI>it makes your code modular-you can use the same function as an event handler for
many different items.
<LI>it makes your code easier to read.  
</UL>

<p>
Notice in this example the use of <b>this.form</b> to refer to the current form. 
The keyword
<b>this</b> refers to the current object-in the above example, 
the button object.   The construct <b>this.form</b> then refers to the form
containing the button. In the above example, the onClick event handler is a
call to the <i>compute()</i> function, with <b>this.form</b>, the current form,
as the parameter to the function. 

<p>
Events apply to HTML tags as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Focus, Blur, Change events: text fields, textareas, and selections
<li>Click events: buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit
buttons, reset buttons, links
<li>Select events: text fields, textareas
<li>MouseOver event: links
</ul>
<P>
If an event applies to an HTML tag, then you can define an event handler for it.
In general, an event handler has the name of the event, preceded by "on."
For example, the event handler for the Focus event is onFocus.
<P>
Many objects also have methods that emulate events.  For example, button has a click
method that emulates the button being clicked.
<b>Note:</b> The event-emulation methods do not trigger event-handlers.  So, for example,
the click method does not trigger an onClick event-handler.
However, you can always call an event-handler directly (for example, you can call
onClick explicitly in a script).

<a name="C3"><h2>Tips and Techniques </h2></a>
<P>
This section describes various useful scripting techniques.
<P>
<h3>Updating Pages</h3>
<P>
JavaScript in Navigator generates its results from the top of the page down.
Once something has been formatted, you can't change it without reloading the page.
Currently, you cannot update a particular part of a page without updating the entire page.
However, you can update a "sub-window" in a frame separately.  
<P>
<h3>Printing</h3>
<P>
You cannot currently print output created with JavaScript.
For example, if you had the following in a page:
<xmp>
<P>This is some text.
<SCRIPT>document.write("<P>And some generated text")</SCRIPT>
</xmp>
And you printed it, you would get only "This is some text", 
even though you would see both lines on-screen.
<P>
<h3>Using Quotes</h3>
<P>
Be sure to alternate double quotes with single quotes.
Since event handlers in HTML must be enclosed in quotes, you must use single
quotes to delimit arguments.  For example

<xmp>
<FORM NAME="myform">
<INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="Open Sesame!" 
onClick="window.open('stmtsov.html', 'newWin', 'toolbar=no,directories=no')">
</FORM>
</xmp>
<P>
Alternatively, you can escape quotes by preceding them by a backslash (\).

<h3>Defining Functions</h3>
<P>
It is always a good idea to define all of your functions in the HEAD of your HTML page.
This way, all functions will be defined before any content is displayed.
Otherwise, the user might perform some action while the page is still loading that triggers
an event handler and calls an undefined function, leading to an error.

<h3>Creating Arrays</h3>
<P>
An array is an ordered set of values that you reference through an array name and an index.
For example, you could have an array called emp, that contains employees' names 
indexed by their employee number.  So emp[1] would be employee number one, emp[2]
employee number two, and so on.

<P>
JavaScript does not have an explicit array data type, but because of the intimate relationship 
between arrays and object properties (see <a href="model.html">JavaScript Object Model</a>), 
it is easy to create arrays in JavaScript.
You can define an array object type, as follows:
<pre>
function MakeArray(n) {
   this.length = n;
   for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 
     this[i] = 0 }
     return this
     }
}
</pre>
<P>
This defines an array such that the first property, length, (with index of zero), 
represents the number of elements in the array.  
The remaining properties have an integer index of one or greater, and are initialized to zero.
<P>
You can then create an array by a call to <b>new</b> with the array name, 
specifying the number of elements it has. For example:
<pre>
emp = new MakeArray(20);
</pre>
<P>
This creates an array called emp with 20 elements, and initializes the elements to zero.

<h4>Populating an Array</h4>
<P>
You can populate an array by simply assigning values to its elements.  For example:
<pre>
emp[1] = "Casey Jones"
emp[2] = "Phil Lesh"
emp[3] = "August West"
</pre>
and so on.

<P>
You can also create arrays of objects.  For example, suppose you define an object type
named Employees, as follows:

<pre>
function Employee(empno, name, dept) {
   this.empno = empno;
   this.name = name;
   this.dept = dept;
}
</pre>
<P>
Then the following statements define an array of these objects:

<pre>
emp = new MakeArray(3)
emp[1] = new Employee(1, "Casey Jones", "Engineering")
emp[2] = new Employee(2, "Phil Lesh", "Music")
emp[3] = new Employee(3, "August West", "Admin")
</pre>
<P>
Then you can easily display the objects in this array using the show_props function
(defined in the section on the <a href="model.html">JavaScript Object Model</a>) as follows:
<pre>
for (var n =1; n <= 3; n++) {
   document.write(show_props(emp[n], "emp") + "<BR>");
}
</pre>

Introduction
</H2>
Somerset College is an independent K-12 school on the Gold Coast in Queensland Australia. Development of information technology for administration, reference and curricular use has a high  priority.  In 1990 I investigated the then innovative concept of introducing Laptop computers for widespread student use, this involved visits to pioneering primary and secondary schools in this regard. I learnt  that such a programme would impose very high overall costs to the school community and large infrastructure and  maintenance costs directly on the school, for the benefit of access to  relatively low level creative tools such as word processors, simple databases, spreadsheets and programming languages. I formed the opinion that the cost outweighed the benefit. A large part of the school technology infrastructure would be devoted to battery charging, security, computer first aid and maintenance as necessities, relegating network access to school information sources as a secondary priority. 
<P>
I thought that the computer's niche in the information revolution would be as an information source and retrieval tool, the creative tools (word processors etc) were the devices whereby students would manipulate the information.  I determined that my priority for the use of computers in education was Information access and then, information manipulation. This priority seemed to be the reverse of a practical implementation of the laptop scenario. I resolved to find an economic alternative which matched my priorities.

<H2>HomeLink</H2>
In 1991 Somerset introduced a dial up access service for the school community, called HomeLink. The factors leading to this service included:
<ul>
<Li>A 1990 survey of home computers within the school community indicated that around 70% of homes had computers and 10% had modems. 
<Li>We were developing information sources on the school network
<Li>There were information sources available via modem, notably the South Australian Education Department's Nexus service.
<Li>The school was set to increase its investment in Compact Disc and Hard disc based information sources and network facilities for distributing these.<br>
<Li>Remote Access and/or Remote Control software was available for Macintosh and Microsoft operating systems
</ul>
From small beginnings the service has grown in usage, there have been "learning opportunities" for families in regard to buying and setting up equipment. I get at least five phone calls a week asking advice and I recommend that a modem should have greater priority than a CD player since it can give access to much more information. 
<P>
As an adjunct to direct dialling of the school, I manage accounts for our  students on the Nexus system, which  added access to the Internet to its services in late 1994. Nexus has its own information and mail system, as well as  cooperative  projects for students. The advantage and drawback of Nexus is that it allows only text terminal access, this means that a cheaper modem and computer are adequate, but that navigation is more difficult, especially on the internet.
<P>
HomeLink seems in retrospect to have been an obvious step to take, probably its main achievement  has been to raise the consciousness and experience of our school community  in regard to the information age. They are  slightly better informed and equipped to enable them to cope with the impact of the information revolution on society. Extending HomeLink to include Internet, and specifically <A HREF="#WWW">WWW</A> access seems to be the next "obvious" step.
<H2>
Onto The Net
</H2>
Prior to mid 1994 the only realistic chance a school had for access to the internet was through a University. Happily, some Universities were planning pilot programmes to link schools to the internet, but possibilities for access have now broadened to allow access, via commercial service providers, to society in general.
<P>
Early in 1995, a <A HREF="http://www.OntheNet.com.au">Local Internet service provider "OntheNet"</A> started operations on the Gold Coast. This has enabled us to introduce World Wide Web Access from campus according to our own requirements and therefore faster than through a coordinated effort with others. A local provider also makes internet connectivity more economical for families. Subsequently two other commercial providers have opened and another is about to.

<H3>"Policy is the art of making the best of what is possible, Technology is the art of discovering what is possible"</H3>

My "Policy" is the schools defacto policy on internet access. It has developed as I learn what is possible and how to implement it. That is why this paper is in the first person, so far Somerset's web presence is a one man show, and despite the fact that that man is me I do not think that this continues to be a good idea.
<P>
My <B>initial <A HREF="WWW">WWW</A> priority</B> was to establish a connection to the internet for as many computers on our networks as I could, this proved more involved than I had anticipated and there were two false starts.
 <ul>
<Li>Trying to bypass using <A HREF="#TCP/IP">TCP/IP</A> since I had no source of <A HREF="#IP">IP</A> numbers
<Li>Trying to implement a software (non Unix) <A HREF="#TCP/IP">IP</A> router
</ul>
The resolution of this issue... so far:<ul>
<Li>On 31/3/95, we installed a two port Telebit Netblazer router which has now been upgraded to a four port model. This device will also allow an improved HomeLink system as it supports AppleTalk Remote Access, IPX and PCanywhere.  Our service provider originally allocated a subnet of 32 <A HREF="#IP">IP</A> numbers to us.  I  applied to <A HREF="AARNet">AARNet</A> for a two class C sets.  which I have used along with a third set from my consulting business to route <A HREF="#IP">IP</A> throughout our school Network. Currently access is via a single fast modem, which provides adequate performance, I anticipate installing an <A HREF="#ISDN">ISDN</A> connection next year as funding becomes available. There were considerable technical difficulties with routing and sustaining a connection, these have all been satisfactorily resolved. 
<P></ul>
The <B>second priority</B> was to establish a Somerset set of pages, I had thought that we would need to establish our own Unix server to do this, but my very fast learning curve led me to establish our pages on  21/2/95 on our service providers hardware. Authoring the pages in <A HREF="#HTML">HTML</A> and setting them up on the server proved a relatively easy task.

<P>
The <B>third priority</B> was to establish the technical capability to access the Web via HomeLink. Although it would be preferable if families had their own accounts a, dial through (our router and later our server) the school to the internet is also possible for families who have Farallon's Timbuktu software on their Macintosh or Nortons PCAnywhere on their IBM compatible. A direct <A HREF="#PPP">PPP</A> connection to the internet via our router is also possible. We are not permitting interent access for HomeLink users via either of these systems yet, pending policy on providing such access and negotiations with our service provider. The main reason that the capability was developed was "because it was possible", the second reason is to permit staff access from their homes.

<P>There is a philosophical reason for considering NOT providing dial through service to the internet for families in general. Our school is in the business  preparing students for the wider world, they are gradually given more responsibility and eventually are entirely responsible for themselves, notably after that fateful night at the end of year 12. From a "marketing" perspective the success of our operation depends on the perception of the community of the satisfaction of the customers who all eventually leave us, and not on keeping customers dependent on us as is the case with many other businesses. Paralleling this ethos in spirit if not chronology:<ol>
<Li>The school provides facilities to experience information services in many forms
<Li>HomeLink provides external connection to school information managed by the school.
<Li>Nexus provides a connection to external resources managed by the school.
<Li>The final step is personal connection to external resources completely independent of the school.</ol>
The internet with its community popularity, incredible scope and opportunities for business is the ideal end game of the process.<P>

<H2>Towards deeper entanglement in the Web</H2>
There was a particular reason for my  race to get network access and web pages up, this was our <A HREF="litfest/litfest.htm">Celebration of Literature festival</A>, held at the school from March 30  to April 2. This festival was to have 2 (eventually 3) Internet tutorials, which I had decided should be as "hands on" as possible.  In addition to this, the presenters included <A HREF="litfest/god">Douglas Adams</A>, of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy fame, he turned out to be an enthusiastic and expert supporter of the internet, as is <A HREF="litfest/president">Barry Jones</A>,<A HREF="litfest/kkruszelnicki"> Karl Kruszelnicki</A>  of Sydney University, <A HREF="litfest/bcaelli">Professor Bill Caelli</A>  of QUT and Professor Tommy Thomas of Bond University. Indeed the sessions involving these people all had an internet component or were entirely about the internet. This was not entirely planned! The literature festival  proved how much community interest there is in the Internet and generated more.
<P>
I attended <A HREF="http://www.scu.edu.au/ausweb95">Ausweb95</A> (the only representative from any educational institution in the range K-12!). This was an eye opener to the extensive level of current and proposed Web usage by business, tertiary education, government and councils and very valuable for contacts. Next year, <A HREF="http://www.scu.edu.au/ausweb96">Ausweb96</A> will be held at Jupiter's Casino on the Gold Coast, our school will be providing pre conference tutorial sessions and there will be a <A HREF="#K-12">K-12</A> thread. This opportunity should not be missed by <A HREF="#K-12">K-12</A> educators.
<P>
The <B>fourth priority</B> has been much coloured by these experiences and my wish to fund increasingly sophisticated internet capabilities. We have completed the first session of  <A HREF="#WWW">WWW</A> <A HREF="somwebcourses.html">training courses</A>, developed and presented by me.<ul>
<Li>Courses for students (web publishing is currently being written into our existing computer courses)
<Li>Staff inservice courses
<Li><A HREF="somwebcourses.html">Courses</A> for the school community and, teachers and students from other schools.
</ul>

The courses cover <ol>
<Li>Internet history and issues
<Li>Browsing the web
<Li>Creating Web pages
<li>Multimedia on the web</ol>

A <B>fifth priority</B> is to establish our own server, so that:<ul>
<Li>We can support our own account structure for staff
<Li>We can support <A HREF="#CGI">CGI</A> script interaction for our pages (for example forms support and database searching) and support school publication on the net without specific requirement to reformat documents. Indeed we are using the web browser program to present a lot of internal information, not published on our World Wide Web pages.
<Li> The college may also support pages of other parties, definitely community, possibly commercial</ul>
The servers being considered are:<ul>
<Li>A 486 running free BSD: The cheapest but most difficult to configure
<Li>A 486 running Linux: The better of the cheap Unix solutions
<Li>A Macintosh running <A HREF="#HTTP">MacHTTP</A> (by far the preferred option, easiest to set up,  write <A HREF="#CGI">CGI</A> scripts and integrate into our system) a  <A HREF="#DNS">DNS</A> for the Macintosh has recently been released completing the set of tools required to establish an independent Web server</ul>
<H2>
Internal issues with the Web
</H2>
<H3>Establishing a position for Web Access within the school</H3>

"Policy is a reaction to wide ranging behaviour.": 
The World Wide Web and the internet should be an underlying information resource for the school first and an adjunct to particular curricula second. <P>

The internet is too pervasive and too general to be identified as a province for the computing subject area, indeed it makes cross curricula studies within subjects much easier. For example, our first course project for the use of the internet is from the Mathematics department, where they are seeking information and statistics on health implications of smoking. <P>

Students have been using  the world wide web along with our internal networked information sources for personal research for some time, now the worth of this access is beginning to be reflected in its inclusion in specific course material.

<H3>How to get the Web into the curriculum</H3>
This has been tackled overtly by offering inservice courses, but more effectively by the individual research of students. "I got that from the Web" is becoming a more familiar reference, and with that, student and staff consciousness of the information resources available on our internal network is being boosted. <P>

It is my experience that adults will often only try to adopt a new process if they can see an advantage in it. Children are less harried by and more familiar with confronting new concepts and change, because they normally interact with novelty in all spheres of their lives every day, the process is called "growing up". <P>

"Cold" inservicing for staff is usually ineffective and always inefficient, for it has no relevance. Developing a general consciousness of the medium is a far better starting point, inservice only provides confidence and expertise when the area of skills, in this case use of digital information sources, is already in the service of the individuals concerned. In most endeavours there is little choice but to use the "cold" inservice approach, the community has no mania for Patrick White or Pythagoras theorem. With the internet specifically and digitised information in general this is far from the case, every radio station every television channel, every newspaper resonates with a rising chatter about the information revolution. <P>

An effective way to achieve  web consciousness in staff is to encourage the enthusiastic telling of anecdotes by students and to encourage individual students to source their material from the World Wide Web. Thus the method spreads amongst the students and from them to their teachers. This approach is slow to start since there are no focused goals, indeed the best initial goal for anyone is something of interest to them, be it the Simpsons or basketball or the skiing conditions. Once the process is familiar  and the value of the resource realised in a particular instance, the resource is enthusiastically grasped by the peer group for wider use.<P>

In summary: Let the children play then eventually as students they will submit URL's as references in their assignments, this will tweak the interest in staff, which will eventually result in specific curricula use of the World Wide Web. At Somerset, from a "cold" start this process has taken less than 4 months in one instance, and is on the way to fruition in others. This process is proving to be pervasive and effective as it sponsors, the spread of innovation by enthusiastic staff. <P>

<H3>Establishing a documentation standard</H3>
Being able to perform a task is empowering, subsequent to that getting someone else to do it is an exercise of (a different) power. On the other hand having someone else perform a task because you can't is dis-empowering in regard to the task. I therefore think that staff should be encouraged to learn how to produce documentation themselves, be it course material or web pages. At Somerset many staff can and do use computers to produce their own documents.<P>

From an operational point of view there is a particular issue, as more staff choose to prepare their own documents:  getting  them to adhere to a document standard. This is more than just what a document looks like, it also includes how it is produced and stored. This issue is a pressing one in the normal operation of a school (more so at a university), but is of particular importance to me, if others are going to be able to easily publish web pages. I do not suggest that <A HREF="#HTML">HTML</A> should be the standard. I am suggesting that exclusive use of style sheets be mandatory so as to enable automatic translation to <A HREF="#HTML">HTML</A> or cross platform formats. I would wish to aim for the <A HREF="#SGML">SGML</A> standard eventually. In regard to the World Wide Web, the ability for staff to translate and transfer documents to Web pages on the internet is empowering. A document standard will help enable this process.
<P>

<H3>Policy Generation</H3>

My approach to instilling technological eptness and maturity into the school has been helping people to help themselves as opposed to doing things directly for people, (although this is essential in the early stage): "If you give a man a fish he is fed once, if you teach him to fish he has the means to feed himself (and others) for life". Although this a hard road initially and the lead time has been long there has recently been, a very satisfying, marked jump in the number of staff taking the inititative and responsibilty for assessing and fullfilling their computing needs. The technological background noise on campus is at a level where its value to individuals is occasionally and increasingly obvious... the physical model for this method is called "stochastic resonance" : You can get a semblance of a desired signal above a threshold level by actually adding a small amount of random noise. 
<P>
Given widespread personal technological maturity, we need to manage the responsibilities, in this case associated, with our internet presence: Policy needs to be made (as usual after the technological possibilities are perceived) Relating to:
<ul>
<Li>Who is responsible for the school Web image and services offered.
<Li>Student and community access to and through our facilities
<Li>Funding of our web services
<Li>Responsibility for staff development
<Li>How and what (if anything) to monitor.
</ul>
<HR>
<H2>Quo Vadis?</H2>
At the outset of this paper I noted that I thought that the computer is now primarily an information gathering tool, with manipulation of information increasingly relegated to a supporting function. Another major paradigm  is that of a communication tool, indeed this is what the internet evolved into soon after its inception as a bomb proof computer networking system. The information revolution is currently resolving into the promise of an information and communication portal and processor for the "nu sphere", an information layer around the world.  Similar to the Agriculture layer which freed most of us from the basic responsibilities of feeding ourselves and the Industrial layer which freed most of us from the bounds and responsibilities of our physical capabilities. As with those successful revolutions, (the mythology one failed) our basic social substrate is thickened, increasing our separation from personal dependency on nature. At once we get a broader horizon and loose the basic skills which each layer automatically supports, for example hunting and making a fire or caring for crops and horses are  the professional province of a decreasing proportion of humanity even in the third world, and there is a much noted decline in the proportion involved in manufacturing as the "nu sphere" develops. I believe that this envelopment is occurring quickly and within the immediate conscious time sense of people.
<P>
First world countries are being rapidly wired for broadband access, mostly one way, in the guise of cable TV. The very much two way, egalitarian, internet is also rocketing in popular acceptance in the guise of the World Wide Web. The melding of the web into the multi mega bit broadband system is not far off, and it will be readily available to most city based Australians for an increasingly decreasing price. In 1995, we have computers that can handle television  too, they  are already in department stores and in the lower end of product ranges. TV capability will become a neo standard feature as have CD players. The idiosyncrasies of modems and <A HREF="#ISDN">ISDN</A> will dissolve into the broadband ether, much as the imperative of understanding the telephone system in order to use it has faded into the technical substrate of society.
<P>
With the advent of the World Wide Web, computer education is at a levelling off point and is beginning to diffuse. It started in the 80's as a marginal curiosity, a wonderfully creative tool for logical pursuits, now it is a ubiquitous optional course with similar stature to social sciences. Attitudes are maturing as computer technology is integrated across the curriculum, with the timely side effect of encouraging and facilitating cooperative learning, transgressing subject borders and requiring teachers to be coaches rather than instructors. I believe that even now this innovative role for computer education is changing to a supportive one, playing a temporary bridging role, acting as a source of experience to what will soon be a fundamental expectation of society. 
<P>
Computer courses are evolving and integrating into non technical courses such as media studies and publishing, the computer seen as both a  tool and as a field of study. Indeed the threshold  for acceptance of this technology has long since been passed, schools are no longer essential for the sponsoring of computer usage. Particular courses won't need particular computing components, just as they do not need particular components for using videos. Computerised information and communication sources will be as common place in classrooms, the personal possessions of students as a calculator, a phone or television. By the turn of the century I think that this end game will be over, in 2001 you might be buying breakfast cereals to get the free "Windows for Weet-Bix" chip.
<P>
Looking back from a hypothetical (Sydney) Olympian view, (well maybe a few years later than that) I think that the major impact of computers on society will be seen as the democratising agent for the information world the nub of the means for getting the information you want rather than receiving the information you have been sent. For education I think the role will be seen as having been a tool of reformation, dissolving subject barriers and facilitating cooperative learning and realistic scenarios. It will have been a rubicon for teachers too. We tell students that it will be the norm for them to change careers 6 to 8 times in their working lives, and that a basic survival tool will be their ability and willingness to retrain themselves... therefore a basic skill for teachers in the future, and that includes teachers that are present, is precisely that same ability.
<HR>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
The Internet has sustained and massive media coverage. It is possible that commerce on the web can bypass national monetary systems and information on the web can bypass national (and organisational) censorship arrangements. It takes fundamental power from nations, and gives it to multinational organisations and to individuals, indeed it is a brave new world. It looks like the Web or Information super highway is going to be increasingly important and is here to stay, an information layer around the world. Educationalists and families will need to embrace this change.
<P>
Somerset is in the forefront of <A HREF="#K-12">K-12</A> Web development, at least in Queensland, our lead won't last long. How effective our web services are depends on teachers, students and parents finding it useful and seeking to educate themselves accordingly. The school has a major role in promoting and nurturing this process.

<H2>Introduction</H2> Somerset seems to have been the first school in Queensland and
maybe Australia to have the internet networked into the school.  This initiative
followed the introduction of the HomeLink system in 1991. HomeLink is a dial in
service for staff and students. HomeLink will be altered and enhanced this year to
take advantage of our internet connection.

<H2>Status Quo</H2> <em>Carbon based:</em> The school does not spend a lot of money on
computers compared to similar schools. The bulk of the system is run entirely by me, I
have no assistant. My responsibilities include help desk, maintenance, repairs,
network and information system design, system analysis and writing of code including
the school administration system, pleading for funds   and all aspects of their
disbursement, planning the future, supervising of computer rooms at lunch and after
school, assisting staff and inservicing...oh yes and in complete charge of our web
presence.  It is far too much for one person, this has various repercussions the
relevant one being that information services do not get adequately marketed.  I feel
most comfortable with advertising what we can do not what we will be able to do soon: 
"Have the product before you sell it", sounds alarmingly old fashioned doesn't it! <P>
<em>Silicon et al based:</em> The Network I support consists of about 150 computers
spread throughout the campus, 90 in three secondary computer labs, 1 or 2 in all
classes from pre school to year 7. Three  machines  the library and many in staff offices and
work areas. The majority of computers range from Mac Pluses to Power Macs, one
laboratory has Dos and Windows machines as does the library and a separate research
area.  The system is served by one Netware and two AppleShare servers  with networked
compact disc players and five laser printers. Other systems include the Library (Pick)
system and Accounts (DG) which run separately with dumb serial terminals and no
networking. The bookshop has a 3 workstation Netware Lite system and the new
engineering science lab has a Windows NT server and 12 pentium workstations. The
fastest networking we have is thin ethernet. <P> Our internet connection is  a
permanent ISDN link via a local service provider <A
HREF="http://www.onthenet.com.au">Onthenet</A> who are helpful and
knowledgeable. We have 5 dial in lines 1 for AppleTalk remote access, 1 for PCAnywhere
and 4 for ppp dial in ... I know that adds up to 6, but the PCanywhere service is
being phased out.  At the moment we do not have a web server on site, but I have
tested a Linux  and a Macintosh solution and have ordered a Macintosh web and file
server. <P> <H2>The Future</H2> There is a plan to integrate all administration
systems but  inadequate funding will make this very difficult. Optical fibre with hubs
sprouting RJ45 will be installed new buildings are completed next year but upgraded
workstations may have to wait. Although it would be good to buy an administration
system,  I am rather appalled at the cost of these products and on more careful
assessment their palpable inadequacy for the enterprise they are intended to model,
namely Somerset College. We  may have to continue developing our home grown system, perhaps on the back of a particular commercial system. One decision
which has been made is that we will use SQL with a client server RDBMS. I am using a
test version of  "Butler"  RDBMS which  providing and testing a template for the
administration system, a working example will go a long way to help senior management
visualise problems and possibilities. <P> Our web services will be edited by staff
moving documents around on the Macintosh server, at the moment I accept, files,
convert them to HTML and mount them, this is not an onerous duty. 
<Name="webpresence">My current plan for delegating the development our web presence
is:</A> 
<ul> 
<li>The Librarian's responsibility is to build and maintain a coherent resource of web
resources, via research and bookmarking. 
<Li>Our new Director of studies will
coordinate presentation of curriculum based information, 
<Li>House Masters will
provide information relating to intra school competition and social events 
<Li>The
development manager will coordinate material promoting and describing the school and
its activities on the web including old students pages, although an ex school captain is considering taking this responsibility
 <Li>Clerical staff will
learn to convert and deploy documents onto the web. 
<Li>Staff can opt to have an email
address and will be totally responsible for checking their mail 
<Li>Various community
groups and clubs will be encouraged to represent themselves via our server at no cost.
</ul> <strong>HomeLink has changed</strong> so that it is accessed exclusively from
the internet. This change is due to increasing usage and the  the high profile advent
of the World Wide Web in society and the rather low cost for service.  It is no longer
an issue of expense or expertise that precludes families from getting onto the web.
Nearly everyone has an adequate home computer, modems and internet offers are being
included as standard features of computer packages and are already  becoming a delete
option as CD players have become. So I expect that families will buy an internet
account and encourage them to do so. We can offer much more access via this method
than by providing our own modem bank. <P> <A Href="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/homelink.html">HomeLink via the
internet</A> uses <A href="http://farallon.com">Farallon's Timbuktu Pro software</A> to
enable remote control of Macs and  Windows machines on our network via TCP/IP,
Obviously there need to be safeguards here for access, copyright and to protect the
integrity of the machines. The access security is provided by the need for a user name
and password, regular password changes and a usage log. Copyright by restrictions
on file copying and usual network security. Maintaining the integrity of the machines
has been adequately established using an auto reboot system extension and MacPrefect
software on Macs and commands in the  Progman.ini and control.ini files on the Windows
machines. 
<P>
 We offer staff free access  to HomeLink and the internet via our four
dial in lines which are accessed via one number. We could take the next step and
become a service provider for our school community, but that "we", is "I" and I don't
have the time to run a monitoring,  billing and guaranteed service: More
pointedly it is literally not our business to be an internet service provider rather
an <A href="#esp">Education Service Provider</A>, so such we will be, using the
internet to do it. 
<P>
<em>Software licensing issues</em>
have been adequately resolved in most cases during our past experience with HomeLink, 
most vendors  are developing policies on remote access, some  throw the problem in the
too hard basket and some need to be guided away from initial knee jerk reactions.
Fortunately there is a distinct move towards maturity, another legacy of the advent of
the web. There is a lot of software around and we can afford not to use specific
titles if the licensing is not suitable for our needs. With remote control rather than
remote access, the issue is a fair bit clearer as the software is in the RAM of the
machine at school, only the screen display is transported off campus. 
<P>
 I hope that this year I will be able to add some <em>variety to our web presence.</em> The problem
is that although staff are using the web they are not contributing to it.  Last year I
designed and ran courses on browsing and authoring, these were poorly attended by
staff, most disappointing.  I am hoping that my <A HREF="#webpresence">plan for delegation of
responsibilities for the web pages</A> will be adapted and implemented. A strong push for
staff web awareness comes from the students who are using the internet as a research
and resource for their work. <P> <A NAME="esp">Our own web presence is the first stage
in developing a <strong>Queensland curriculum  resource on the web </strong></A>,
plenty of information is out there but it is not organised with respect to the needs
of Queensland students. There is  a huge amount of curriculum specific information
within schools: policies, methods, philosophies, research and actual classroom stuff.
<P> The provision of this education service is a project of a consortium of five
schools: The Southport School, St. Hildas, All Saints Anglican School, Trinity
Lutheran College and ourselves. The first stage has been to get each of us networked,
onto the net.  The second stage, which needs a bit of a push right now, is to produce
a web index and eventually provide a dedicated manager for the system, I think the
manager is essential as committees are okay for forming a consensus but the best thing
they actually do... is lunch. <P> The most generally valuable long term goal of this
coherent educational resource could be to provide a forum for sponsoring students work
and experiences and links with the world. I think ultimately education along with
society will be literally global  and that it should be our role to help facilitate
this.

<H2>Policy and Practice</H2> The <A href="#webpresence">policy regarding our web
presence</A> is to delegate responsibility for the pages to those responsible for the
information. 
<P>
 Student access to the web if free and unrestricted. Our policy on
censorship is practised and tested: We are ambivalent about the ethics of filtering
out sites, nor is it of any practical value since there are so many home computers
accessing the internet.  Mostly, we wish to remove the link between the messenger and
the message. It is not the technology or the access which is the problem, it is
certain content. In short we do not differentiate between the bringing of a naughty
thing to school via the internet or a school bag. On the other hand if we were to
claim that we monitored traffic and failed in perhaps some unforeseen way to do so,
then we may be legally liable (It has happened, to Prodigy services, a large communications
network). 
<P> Girls use the web and computers less than boys. There is a lot of
variety in the usage by students in general, from none to manic. I note that girls
don't generally play with the computers, their usage tends to be more purposeful than
boys, yet there are about the same number of "purposeful" boy users as girls. Everyone
has the opportunity to use the information system. Personally I do not subscribe to
"affirmative action", positive discrimination of one group over the other, means
negative discrimination of the other over the one. I would advise the purveyors of
such rhetoric as "the end justifies the means" to take a long hard look at history. Our
clients have been born and grown in a society where there is a fundamental acceptance
of the principal of equality. <P> On the issue of isolation from the real world due to
manic use of computers, children are wont to be consumed by fads as are adults, 
football is a good example of a socially encouraged mania. "Computer mania" is rarely
permanent and may actually lead to discovery of talent or a career. I am dubious of
the term "real world", it is a personal construct of ones experience, peer group,
hopes and dreams. From my perspective the information revolution is sweeping like a
tidal wave over society, those who don't surf it are in my opinion failing to live in
the <A href="ganesh.html">real world</A> and it is they who will find their skills
less relevant. <Hr> <center><A Href="../Welcome.html">Return to Home Page</A>

<body><H1 Align =center>S P E C I A L <br> R E L A T I V I T Y</H1><P align=center><b><i>William Taylor</i></b><P>
The popularity of the special theory of relativity stems from extraordinary
predictions about time, distance, mass, Energy and the nature of space.  What
follows attempts to connect the concepts of time dilation with the equivalence
of mass and energy and the concept of four dimensions.  Relativity isnt a fact,
it is a set of ideas which can be used to interpret the results of experiments
and observations and to make predictions in a consistent way, so far it has
done so with great accuracy.<p>
<p>
NOTE:  Throughout this essay an assumption that NO ACCELERATION is going on is
implicit, consideration of relativistic effects due to acceleration (or vice
versa) are the realm of General relativity and Machs Principle (which has
nothing to do with the speed of sound).<p>
<p>
There are two principles:<p>
<p>
1.	The speed of light, in empty space, is the same <tt>c</tt> independent of
the motion of its source.<p>
<p>
2.	A principle best stated in several forms:<p>
<p>
	Electrodynamic and mechanical effects do not have properties that require the
concept of an absolute state of rest.<p>
<p>
	The speed of an object cannot be determined IN ANY WAY without external
reference.  This is hard to prove since EVERY WAY of detecting motion should be
checked and we dont know them all!<p>
<p>
	No object is absolutely stationary (this is well known to the highway
patrol).<p>
<p>
	The concept of absolute (non-accelerating) motion is invalid.<p>
<HR>
<B>Remember !<br>
<ol>
<LI>The speed of light is constant in every frame of reference
<Li>There is no preferred frame of reference</B>

<CENTER><H1>Sunshine</H1>
<B><I>by William Taylor</I><BR>&#169; July 1996</B>
<H4>The duration of daylight varies over latitude and season, this procedure calculates the hours of "sunshine", defined to be the time between sunrise and sunset, at any latitude, on any day... on any planet orbiting any star! and all you need is a grasp of trigonometry and a functioning cerebral cortex... a calculator or spreadsheet might help too</H4>
<HR>
</CENTER>
Consider a planet circling a star, preferably one with really good snow fields. It rotates about an axis which may not be that of its orbit, let us suppose that the angle between these axes is <B>T</B>. for Earth, T = 23.5 degrees. Now initially I'm not going to use <B>T</B> but <B>A</B> there is a reason for this, and that has to do with something in figure 3 to which we have yet to come.
<P>
Suppose we live on a Latitude of <B>L</B> degrees (The Gold Coast is at a latitude of about 28 degrees South of the equator... it is also on Earth). A "Latitude" on the surface of a planet is a circle on its surface where a radius from every point on it to the centre makes an angle of  L degrees with the equatorial plane of the planet... sort of a parallel circle to the equator:
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="figure1.gif">
<BR><B>figure 1</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Figure 1 shows a cross section of a planet of radius <B>R</B> (6,400 km for Earth) with some algebra relevant to latitude <B>L</B> ...well one of the latitude <B>L</B>'s, our <B>L</B> is the "downunder" one called South and rather unfairly "minus" on Earth. The "Solar Axis" is the axis perpendicular to the sun's (the planets star's) light, the planet actually rotates about an axis which is <B>T</B> degrees different from this and that axis is conveniently directly behind the "Solar Axis" in figure 1. Therefore in this diagram <B>T</B> is the same as <B>A</B> but as mentioned before this is only the case on a special occasion.
<P>
Another fact to note in figure 1 is that for latitudes bigger than a certain value, called <B>P</B> for "Polar" in figure 1, the latitude is either entirely in the dark (the Southern Hemisphere in figure 1) or entirely in the light (the Northern Hemisphere in figure 1) so we need to remember that <B>+P</B> and <B>-P</B> degrees are boundaries inside which the following Maths works and outside which it doesn't, much the same as the limitation that the latitudes can only lie between outside <B>+90</B> and <B>-90</B> degrees and still be on the planet!
<P>
There is a neat relationship between <B>A</B> degrees and <B>P</B> degrees and it is pretty easy to work out. Note that the triangle formed with base equal to the latitude <B>P</B> (either one, but  the Northern one is drawn in in figure 1)   and the centre of the circle, the arms of the triangle are both the same (equal to R the radius of the planet) and that the central angle of this (isoceles) triangle is <B>90-P+A</B> degrees, the base angles are both <B>P</B> degrees (because of the isocelesnessosity!) of the triangle and all three add up to <B>180</B> degrees. Therefore

<PRE>i.e. <B>P + P + (90-P+A) = 180</B>  
 so  <B>90 + P + A = 180</B>
 so  <B>P + A = 90</B>
 so  <B>P = 90 - A</B></PRE>

This means that <B>P</B> and <B>A</B> are complimentary angles. For Earth, the special case where  the axial Tilt <B>T</B> = <B>A</B> (= <B>23.5</B> degrees) <B>P</B> will be the polar circles at <B>66.5</B> degrees, the limit of the 24 hour day in summer and 24 hour night in winter: 
<P>
At this stage I am going to introduce some "preemptive retrospection", this is my term for discovering a problem in the derivation later on and then tracing it back to, in this case, around about here, and inserting the fix in such a way as to pretend that it is obvious to consider such things a priori... I have a hypothesis that the greater the haughtiness or "this is obvious..ness" of the justification the greater the actual mollification the author experienced when he she or it realised the blunder.
<P>
Ahemm... it is clearly obvious to any carbon based life form that the angle "A" can be negative as well as positive, as it will range from -T to +T degrees throughout the year, figures 3 and 4 (will) illustrate this. "A" will be positive when it leans the same way as the axial tilt and negative when it leans the other away. This means that the above representation of P is a special case where A is positive and P = 90-A, if A is negative then P would be 90+A to put these two exigencies together we use the modulus of A, written as |A| which is technically defined as +A for A &gt0 and -A for A &lt 0
so the general relationship between P and A is
<PRE><B>|P| = 90 - |A|</B></PRE>

<IMG SRC="figure2.gif">
<BR><B>figure 2</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Figure 2 shows perspective of latitude <B>L</B> with the results form figure 1 incorporated in even more Algebra (remember this maths only applies for latitudes between <B>+P</B> and <B>-P</B> degrees).  The purpose of both these pictures and the calculations is to figure out how much sunshine there is in proportion to darkness at latitude <B>L</B>
<P>
Following on from the calculation box in figure 2... to figure out the angle <B>C</B> we need to "un cosine" it, the is called "arc cos" or "inverse cos", it is a standard function on calculators and computers.

<PRE><B>C = arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(A))</B></PRE>

The angle defining the "Sector of sunshine" is actually <B>2 C</B>. Now there are <B>360</B> degrees in a circle and  if a day is <B>H</B> hours long (H=24 for Earth) then the number of sunshine hours is


<PRE><B>2C.H     C.H
----  =  ---
360      180</B></PRE>

therefore

<PRE><B>Sunshine Hours = (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(A)) (EQ 1)
<BR>but remember it is only when  |L| &lt P</B></PRE>

<H3>But wait "there's more!"</H3>
 Here is the bit where you have to worry about the difference between the axial tilt <B>T</B> and the angle <B>A</B>. The axis of rotation is not always "behind" (in the shadow of) the "Solar axis", in fact figures 1 and 2 are only accurate for the "Southern Winter Solstice" the shortest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere (and therefore the longest in the North). 
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="figure3.gif">
<BR>
<B>figure 3</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Figure 3 shows the planet at several times during the year (dates are for Earth!). Also note the parochial naming of the equinoxes by the Northerners ("up overs" ... I think they would like to call themselves). The IMPORTANT thing to note is how the axis of rotation (arrowed line) changes its orientation relative to the sunlight. I have defined the "Day Angle", <B>DA</B> for short, which relates to the number of days since the Southern Winter Solstice:
<P>
If the number of days per year is <B>DY</B> (365.25  for Earth) and the Day of the year <B>D</B> days since the Southern Winter Solstice then the "day angle" <B>DA</B> representing this day is given by
<PRE><B>DA       D
---  =  ---</B> and so <B>DA = D.360/DY (EQ 2)
360     DY</B></PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="figure4.gif">
<BR>
<B>figure 4</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Figure 4 shows a detailed schematic view of figure 3 from above, the axial tilt angle is projected onto (a line through) the direction of the sun, this projection is directly related to the "Shadow Axis angle" <B>A</B> which is used above. Recall that <B>A</B> is the effective angle required in the "sunshine" calculation for any particular day. Figure 5, which is a perspective of a particular (but not special) day shows this relationship.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="figure5.gif">
<BR><B>figure 5</B>
</CENTER>

Figure 5 shows the difference between the axis of rotation and the "Shadow axis", the component of the tilt directly "behind" the solar axis. Substituting for <B>DA</B>, using equation 2, the angle between the solar and shadow axes is 

<PRE><B>A = arc Tan(Tan(T).Cos(360.D/Y))</B></PRE>

Now recall the formula for Sunlight Hours (EQ 1), we can now substitute for <B>A</B>, the "Shadow axis angle"

<PRE><B>Sunshine = (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(A))</B> (EQ 3)</PRE>

This is an important point in the derivation, because it is where we leave the angle <B>A</B>. Recall that the limit of applicability of the formula I am generating is <B>+/- P</B> = <B>+/- (90 - |A|)</B>. However I will return to it to make the final formula into several slightly less terrifying parts. For the meantime...
<P>
we get a really horrible looking formula when we substitute for <B>A</B>
<PRE><B>Sunshine = (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(arc Tan(Cos(360 D/Y)Tan(T)))</B></PRE>

Note however that we are tan-ing then immediately un tan-ing something to no net effect, so the formula can be "de taned" to become

<PRE><B>Sunshine = (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Cos(360 D/Y)Tan(T))</B></PRE>

You may find it  neater, given that the limitations of the equations  (|L| < 90-|A|) involve the shadow axis angle "A", to retain "A" in the final representation (that is EQ 3).
<PRE>Given that <B>A = arc Tan(Tan(T)Cos(360.D/Y))</B> 
Sunshine = (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(A))</B> when |A|-90 &lt  L  &lt 90-|A| </PRE>

<H3>Towards the poles</H3>

Outside the range of latitudes,  |L| < 90 - |A|,  on which I have concentrated in the previous calculations and diagrams, people (or any lifeform)  run out of shadow (or sunlight) altogether. These latitudes are those more polar than <B>+/-P</B> in figures 1 and 2. The "sunshine" at these latitudes is variously 0 and H hours, which should be what the "sunshine" equation gives for values at its limits of applicability which is 

<PRE><B>|L|=90-|A|</B> which is the same as L = 90-|A| and L= |A| - 90</PRE>

<PRE><B>Sunshine =</B> 
<B>   (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(90-|A|)Tan(A))</B>  when 90-|A| &lt L &lt 90 
and <B>(H/180) arc Cos(Tan(|A|-90)Tan(A))</B>  when -90 &lt L &lt -90+|A| </PRE>
At this point it useful to note that
<ol>
<li> Tan(90-something) = 1/Tan(something) so <B>Tan(90-|A|) = 1/Tan(|A|)</B> 
<li>also Tan is an "odd" function, which means that Tan(-something) = - Tan(something) 
<li> Therefore:
<Ul>
<Li>  <B>Tan(90-|A|)Tan(A) = +1 for A  &gt 0 and -1 for A &lt 0</B>
<Li>and <B>Tan(|A|-90)Tan(A) = -1 for A &gt 0 and +1 for A &lt 0</B>
</ul>
<li>also <B>arc cos(1) = 0  degrees and arc cos(-1) = 180 degrees</B>
<li>so since sunshine is H/180 * ar cos(..) the limiting values are 0 or H, 
<ul>
<Li><B>0 when L and A are the same sign</B>
<Li><B>H when L and A are different signs</B>
</ul>
</ol>

<H3>The Final Formula</H3>

<PRE>Given that <B>A = arc Tan(Tan(T)Cos(360.D/Y))</B>
<B>Sunshine... </B>
<B>= (H/180) arc Cos(Tan(L)Tan(T)Cos(360.D/Y))</B> when A-90 &lt  L  &lt 90-A 
<B>= 0 when L &gt 0 and H when L &lt 0</B>  when 90-A &lt L &lt 90
<B>= H when L &gt 0 and 0 when L &gt 0</B>  when -90 &lt L &lt A-90 </PRE>

You've read the proof now see the movie: see the "Mexican wave" of sunshine hours varying horizontally with latitude and vertically with number of hours, the particular values used in this movie are brought to you by the planet Earth: The action covers the year depicted in figure 6 which has drawn on it, at the start of the year, the curve of figure 7. The scene opens on the Southern Summer Solstice. Note that on this day, the duration  reaches 24 hours at -66.5 degrees, from there to the South pole any traveller will have 24 hour sunshine (on this day). Similar Northern polar bound persons will have 24 hours of dark. Only the curve within the bounds of |P| is drawn. Equatorial Earthlings experience the same 12 hours of sunshine each and every day.

A good exercise is to make up a spreadsheet with this formula in it use references to  other cells for the variables and don't forget to use the  radians  version because that is what spreadsheets use for angle measure. <P>
Here is a formula for a "ClarisWorks" spreadsheet, where you can enter the date that you want and all angle measures in degrees.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>
=(B1/PI())*ACOS(TAN(B2*PI()/180)*COS(2*PI()*(DAYOFYEAR(B3)- DAYOFYEAR(DATE(1996,12,22)))/B4)*TAN(B5*PI()/180))
</B>
<BR>Where the cells contain..
<TABLE Border=1>
<TR><TD><B>B1</B><TD> Hours per day
<TR><TD><B>B2</B><TD> Latitude of place
<TR><TD><B>B3</B><TD> Date (format cell as date)
<TR><TD><B>B4</B><TD> Days per year
<TR><TD><B>B5</B><TD> Axial Tilt
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>By the way</B><BR>
<ul>
<Li>A radian is in some sense a more natural measure of angle, since there is no arbitrary choice of unit (i.e. 360 degrees) a radian is that angle which give you a length of arc of 1 unit in a circle of radius 1 unit and therefore it follows that there are 2 pi  radians in one revolution. 
<P>
<Li>The 360 degrees in a revolution was decided on the basis of the number of days in a year, it arose from navigational requirements, particularly finding longitude in conjunction with the use of (rather inaccurate) clocks. Some say that the ancients weren't  very accurate in their measure, but it would seem that it has long been well known that there are 365.25 days in a year. For calculations 360 is a much nicer (to  multiply or divide) number than 365.25 so for the admission of a small error, ancient navigators could more quickly reliably figure out where they were.
</ul>

<H4>Impurities!</H4>
The Earth and other planets do not have circular orbits, they are slightly elliptical, according to Kepler's Laws the closer in a planet is to its star the faster it orbits (although it doesn't spin on its axis any faster). (Actually Kepler says that the orbit sweeps out equal area in equal time, very elegant!) would this effect the formula, more so say than the tacit assumption that the Earth's surface is flat (which it isn't) and is a sphere (which it isn't either)? ... it is called Mother Earth because it has a bulge in the lower Southern Hemisphere (cellulite?). These factors would probably make only negligible contributions for Earth except if you are on a high mountain or even more so in a deep valley when the horizon changes appreciably. So the open sea is the best place for this measure to be usefully accurate which is just as well because that is the realm in which it was traditionally used ... on Earth.

<TITLE>The Moon That Isn't</TITLE>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> The Moon That Isn't</H1>

That orb that Romeo did invoke, sufficient light, adjusted right to permit yet hide a carnal fling... that thing (the moon!) of sweet soft beams is less of one than it would seem.
<P>
Few realise the gravitation of the situation, for the laws of physics agree with politically correct renomination as "sister planet" (though how does one engender gender of any cosmic member?)
<P>
You see that if the Earth you be then the Sun, the moon attracts more than thee. By Jove there are faithful moons a plenty, others weave the rings of Saturn, even Neptune has proper moons to see but alas that moon of Earth, the original sample , is  near twice acolyte to Ra, despite Earth's proximity seeming ample. Not perihelion nor even aphelion shake this double grip from afar, not inverse square of the distance there can compensate the mass of star. 
<P>
So now its time the numbers are begun, Let the mass of Earth be one!

<PRE>
	      SUN       MOON     SM/EM
Mass	    333,000	0.012
Distances
Min	152,100,000	356,399    1.82
Mean	150,000,000	384,403    2.19
Max	147,100,000	406,699    2.56
</PRE>

The min mean max in kilometres be, whilst third of columns is Ra's superiority to Earth's lunar attractivity, forced by mass times inverse square of all those numbers mentioned there, contrived to give the smallest min and the greatest max the formulation no real mental tax.
<P>
Despite this tortured ditty it is  reason brokered by nature which comes out pretty. What use is this accountants ask, none to them whose life is but financial farce and what of art, that anthropic thing whose cause for proof is trifling thin... I just thought I'd get a dig in!

<TITLE>Babylonic Libation Support Device</TITLE>

<H1>Babylonic Libation Support Device</H1>

In ancient Babylon there was a game of wit called nim. It was used to determine who would buy the next round of drinks, usually a tray of Tigris Tumblers or Euphrates Ecstasy's  guaranteed to make hung gardeners droop. This mildly apocryphal tale leads in to the analysis of the things called nim which were games with coins.
<P>
Nim the first oft learnt by rote for a fixed set of coins (15), but easily  generalised and a great thing to give kids as a programming project and a lesson in AI (that's Artificial Intelligence for you veterinaries!!)
<P>
<A HREF="nim2.html">Nim the second</A> was invented to overcome the problem of finding reliable patsies to buy the drinks once the strategy for nim the first became common knowledge, more complex but still tractable.
<P>
After that some idiot invented chess, long game, no guaranteed strategy; definitely too long between drinks to sustain a civilisation... and so the Babylonians sobered up and, naturally, they all killed each other... 

<H2>Nim the First</H2>
<ul>
<Li>There is a pile of coins
<Li>There are two players
<Li>The players decide on a maximum number of coins that may be taken during a turn
<Li>Initially a decision has to be made as to whose turn it is first (this is crucial given two competent players)
<Li>Players take alternate turns, they remove any number of coins between 1 and the maximum (inclusive)
<Li> The one who removes the last coin buys the next round of drinks
</ul>

<H4>How to avoid buying the drinks:</H4>
Well this can be done by cheating or mathematical induction or by simple Arithmetic progressions. Now cheating is lot of fun but it  inexorably leads to futures exchanges and derivative trading but that really has no Barings on the current matter. Some people don't like mathematical induction but they can't prove there is more than one of them so they don't count(!). Arithmetic progressions on the other hand are one of those dumb things kids have gotta do in Mafs (that's how they pronounce Mathematics in Australian Juvenile dialect).... so I'll do it that way.

Lets suppose there is only one coin "O" (O is a good symbol for a coin),
if it's your go, you're on your way to the bar, so the idea is to make sure your opponent is left with that one "O".  Now for arguments sake lets suppose that the agreed maximum "O"s that can be taken on any one go is 3. Well we better make sure that on our preceding go we had between 2 and 4 coins in the pile...'cause then you can legally leave our opponent (hereintofor "the patsy") with one. Now that  means that we had better have left the patsy with 5 coins on the go previous to that. That  is, always exactly one "O" out of reach. So in this contrived game it means we have to always  ensure that after our go we leave ... 17,13,9,5,1 coins for the patsy to play with (that is 3+1=4 apart). Now number separqated by a common difference is an Arithmetic progression, so if you know how to work out the terms of an A.P. then you can win this game
<P>
The actual numbers have no particular attraction, who wants to enumerate the games? (there was this guy who had this great program for working out which horse would win... yeh he is still a teacher... but he wanted to take a booklet to the races which was the printed output from the permutations of his program... I worked out that the hire of the nine semi trailers he'd need were not within his budgetary constraints)... so lets put some algebra into the nim thing:
<P>
Let  M= maximum  number of coins which may be taken on any one turn<br>
Let  N= the number of coins currently in the pile<br>
So if 1 is the first patsy number then the i th patsy number is 1 + M(N-1)
To decide if you should try to go first or not you should work out if the number of "O"'s sitting on the bar is a patsy number, if it is then contrive not to go first.
<P>
Each of your turns should leave the patsy on one of the sequence of patsy numbers. To do this you need to work out how far you are from the next lowest patsy number, this will be a number between 0 and M, so its a good time to introduce modular arithmetic: You should take <B>(N-1) mod (M+1)</B> coins. For example if there were 23 coins in the pile and M is 3,  you should take (23-1) mod (3+1)  which is 22 mod 4 or 2 coins, leaving the patsy with 21 coins, subsequently you leave the patsy with (21-4) 17 coins then 13,9,5,1 and then he's on his way to the bar. (Sorry about the "he" but "he slash she" is needlessly violent and "it" has not yet been adopted as a generic politically correct title for humans since it more familiarly applies to anything (alive or not), so PC is still anthropocentric, it hasn't run its full course yet!. )
<P> 
<H4>So now how to sell nim to the kids</H4><ol>
<Li>Have them pair up and play (use stand alone graphics instruments and paper) Don't tell them the winning strategy. The two points here are to familiarise them with the game and let them find out that some thought is required.
<P>
<Li>It's a challenge to write a program to play nim, even if kids aren't given the strategy there is the user interaction to set up and the screen display (Using HyperCard on a Macintosh makes this really easy). They are going to need a routine for the computers "go", a random number generator will do initially
<P>
<Li>Having developed/plagiarised a working (but dumb) program, tell them (the kids) about the strategy, or coach them into finding out (this is a nifty cross curricula bit with maths), they can now alter their programs  to determine when they are in a position to use the strategy (i.e the mod thingy is not zero) and when they should retain the random number generator in the hope that the (now not so) patsy will make an error later on.
<P>
<Li>The AI part is to get the kids to pit their program against other people and (probably) beat them, then ask the kids to explain how they feel about that and if their program is "intelligent" or has stored their intelligence or the person who invented the strategy's intelligence or whatever.. that is get a personal handle on the concept of intelligence (be it artificial or not)
<p>
<Li><DT>Assessment could be cross curricula
<DD><ul>
<Li> Understanding of the algebraic bit (Maths er.. Mafs)
<Li> Presentation of a reasonable argument regarding Artificial Intelligence (English)
<Li> Assessment of the computer program*
<Li> Even a little play relevant to the game in some other context (speech and drama#)
</DT></ul></ol>

*The way I like to assess computer programs especially big collaborative projects is in a test situation. I allow the victims any resources they want and insist that they bring their code (on disc or paper) then ask them to make minor changes to their program code (like alter the user prompt, or restrict selection of the maximum number of coins to a range) or to "circle" bits in their code which do things (like the optimal strategy). This process allows the victims to demonstrate their level of understanding of their project. You can throw in more challenging stuff (probably as take home assessment items), like discuss how you would adjust the strategy if the maximum number of coins that could be taken increased / decreased by x after each turn... 
<P>
#As part of a conference where a team of us developed a presentation of program linking (on Macintosh of course: Apple conferences are a lot of fun) we used Nim as a symbolic conflict between George Bush and Sadam Hussein on separate computers.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="blindmind1.gif"><br>
Consider the five shapes<P>

Decide Which shape is the MOST DIFFERENTJustify your decision.</H4>
<P>
This sort of task is common in Intelligence tests. Most of the time there is an objective, logical  or statistical method of resolving the problem. In other words there is an algorithm. There are useful "tricks" in these types of tests, the tricks are useful because they are so widely applicable to facets of life such as picking out features of arguments and  analysis of a problems, deciding which car or dress to buy, things which help you discover  and choose alternatives. The kind of thing can be  called "pattern recognition" and a person who is good at it is thought to be smarter then a person who isn't. The really clinching argument here is that this view is shared by the actual people involved:
The person who generally "can" thinks it is smarter than the person who generally "can't" AND the person who generally "can't" thinks it is less smart than the person who generally "can". 
<P>
To compensate my ego, whenever I generally can't recognise patterns, solve a problem or follow an argument, I initially make up excuses, usually to do with some physical rather than mental deficit (poor eyesight) or lack of experience, but I still feel the sting that someone is smarter than me, I recognise the harsh truth and it adds veracity to the definition of intelligence as "The ability to analyse patterns" and I try to increase my skills in that particular area of pattern recognition... because I want to be smarter.
<P>
Example: ability to play chess, understand rubics cube, understanding what a book or film or painting is getting at, being able to understand algebra, seeing the pictures in those "3D"  drawings (such as the dinosaurs). There is a skill in these which is different from factual knowledge, such as in Trivial Pursuit, or being able to recite formulas, or knowing the names and personalities of characters in a book or film (like the academic names for the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park)... That isn't "smart", it's just "knowledgeable". 
<P>
"Knowledge is fuel for intelligence: petrol is fuel for engines: food is fuel for the body"

This statement is, itself, a "pattern recognition" task, to help clarify the position I'm taking, it is a set of metaphors, showing the same reasoning in a different context. The inference here is that fuel is different from an engine, an engine runs and does useful things, it needs the fuel but the fuel itself is inert. I wish to identify this relationship with the relationship between knowledge and intelligence, the third part of the metaphor about food and body is intended to make the point in another familiar context... The pattern I want you to recognise is that all three statements have a right hand, complex,  thing that makes use of the left hand, simpler, thing and needs it to function, and that  the simple, left, thing is dumb and senseless of the uses to which  it can be put by  the complex, right, thing. I could then summarise  the idea into a glib phrase (one that sounds good but is not very meaningful by itself). 
<P>
<H4>"knowledge has no sense, Intelligence makes sense of knowledge"</H4>
<P>
People are good at metaphors, that's why other people use them to help explain things. The set of metaphors I used up there didn't require the explanation that followed, your intelligence, fuelled by your experience of previous metaphors and concepts of  fuel, engines , food  and bodies would enable you to recognise the patterns  in the  metaphor and understand the point I'm making.
<P>
The more intelligent amongst you will recognise a pretty pattern: That I am using a definition of intelligence as an example in a definition of intelligence. Such a concept is called recursion... and you may also see the rather elitist beginning of this paragraph, itself, is another level in the recursion.
<P>
There are some tricks to recognising patterns, they are part of the experience and knowledge that can fuel your intelligence. This fuel is necessary for you to perform better, for example, if you had to do an IQ test in Norweigen, knowledge and experience of the Norweigen language would enable you to perform better, the same sort of thing as physical fitness being helpful for success in sport. It wasn't until recently that potential immigrants to Australia had to pass an IQ test...in English, which mixes  up "social engineering" with "intelligence".
<P>
Most pattern recognition tests ask you to pick one item from a set... the most different, the one that doesn't belong... or something equivalent to identifying the pattern in the items and then the one item that least or most fits the pattern. 
<P>
To make a general tool for pattern recognition, the idea is to find a common language that patterns can be translated into. The concept of number is the most generally applicable comparative tool that the human  mind has devised. Some people don't like numbers because they have not been overly successful at using them, overcoming such fears will enable you to analyse more problems and be assessed by yourself and others as more intelligent. 
<P>
There are differences between numbers and words that make numbers bite the mind that wields them more so than words.
<P>
Numbers are conceptually the same in every context and applied to every circumstance, meanings for words can be altered by the context in which they are used: "Two is never equal to three, even for very large values of two".the concept of "two", the twoness of something does not depend at all on the something.
Two bears, two cups, two numbers: the concept of twoness applies equally to bears, cups and numbers ... so you can't hang a mental picture on a number (like you can with "bear")
<P>
Each number can be expressed in terms of every other number so their interaction swamps you with infinity whereas words interact on a finite level contrived by an author. 2 = 3-1, 2 =6/3, 2 = -1+3..... try expressing cat in terms of dog and tin can.
<P>
To achieve such generality the concept of number has to be extremely fundamental, it isn't "human" (like words, societies, emotions, experiences) and finite, it is "natural" (atomic, primordial,subliminal, intangible, precise) and infinite. So if we are trying to measure peoples "natural" abilities then "human" tools are too "big", like trying to do brain surgery with a jack hammer... it just isn't subtle or sterile or sharp enough.
<P>
So to the "tricks" of pattern recognition:
Consider a set of items that you want to differentiate between.
<P><ul>

<Li>Identify ALL objective differences
<Li>Give every objective difference a rating
<Li>Give every item a score by summing the ratings
<Li>Make your decision based on the final score for each item.
</ul>
You may need to repeat some of the steps several times to reach a final rating
<P>
Subjective differences are things that include a matter of opinion, not entirely attributable to facts or logic. With regard to a set of patterns, any attribute determined on the basis of information not in the patterns or instructions is "subjective" because it's not based solely on the facts  at hand, so an objective attribute is one based on what is in the patterns and instructions, without consideration of outside influences. Subjectivity  mostly manifests itself in a preference of one attribute over another, for example in the set of 5 patterns at the top, most people choose shape 3, because of "the circle"... but they all have "circles" and they all have different shadings... the first impression values  one attribute over the others. This is the error most people make, thinking there is a one step solution, trusting that all others would see the patterns the same way... this is a subjective judgment and is equivalent to stating that the other differences in the patterns don't  matter. See the other set of shapes later in this document for an example.
<P>
Initially every difference should be given a rating of 1, since there is usually no objective reason to prefer one difference over another. The number of items which share a feature constitute the rating of that feature for a shape.
<P>
The sum of the ratings of the all the features for a shape constitute its score. The way this has been explained, a high score indicates alikeness and a low score differentness.
<P>
It will most likely be that maximum or minimum ratings will be shared amongst patterns, in other words there need not be a single pattern which is most different or most the same, the concept actually gives each pattern a score, there is more information than just the extremes, so, for instance, you can say by what percentage one pattern differs from another
<P>
Here are two examples, they both use the set of country flags consisting of three vertical stripes: 
<P><PRE>
Chad		BYR
France		BWR
Guinea		RWG
Ireland		GWY
Italy		GWR
Ivory Coast	YWG
Mali		GYR
Romania		BWR

Key B Blue, Y Yellow, W White, R Red, G Green
</PRE>

Example 1
Of all the flags which consist of three vertical stripes, which has the most unique set of colours?
<P><PRE>
		Blue	Green	Red	White	Yellow	Rating	
Chad		1		1		1	12
France		1		1	1		14
Guinea			1	1	1		17
Ireland			1		1	1	16
Italy			1	1	1		17
Ivory Coast		1		1	1	16
Mali			1	1		1	15
Romania		1	1		1		15
		3	6	5	6	4	

Step 1 	Identify differences (that's all the ones)
Step 2 	give each difference a rating (add up the columns)
step 3	give each flag a rating by adding the column total by row entries

(for example Chad has a 3 rating (for blue) + 5 (for red) + 4 (for yellow) the total is 12
</PRE><P>
The rightmost column is a measure of sameness of colour (the higher the number the more the same) hence Chad has the most different flag on this criterion.. Note that does not mean in anyway that Chad is a more different country than another or that Blue is a better colour than green, such judgments would have to be based on information not found in the puzzle. There is no judgment based on facts outside the puzzle itself.
</PRE>
<B>Example 2</B><BR>
Of all the country flags consisting of three vertical stripes which are the most different
(Note this is a different question from the previous example because we now have to take the ORDER of the colours into account as well)
</PRE><PRE>
country		flag	left	mid	right	Score
Chad		BYR	3	2	5	10
France		BWR	3	6	5	14
Guinea		RWG	1	6	2	9
Ireland		GWY	3	6	1	10
Italy		GWR	3	6	5	14
Ivory Coast	YWG	1	6	2	9
Mali		GYR	3	1	5	9
Romania		BWR	3	6	5	14
</PRE>
I have left out the tables that generate the scores for left, mid and right colours for brevity, these are counted using the same process as for the first example.
<P>
In this example there is no one minimum (most different) score, so if the word "are" were replaced by "is", in the question, then there would not be an answer to it, but there "are" 3 flags with a score of 9 so the answer is {Guinea, Ivory Coast and Mali}
<P>
The two examples show the need to comprehend the question precisely , they both sound the same on first reading, but one requires that the order of the colours be eliminated and the other that the order of the colours be considered. Hence you should also see that in any puzzle you must...
<H4>
"Consider All the information and nothing but the information"
</H4>
To summarise:<Ul>
<Li>Resolution of puzzles which include a subjective element are not reliable or generally reproducible because it involves information outside the puzzle which may differ for different people and circumstances.

<P><Li>A  puzzle is dependably resolved solely on the basis of the information IT contains and not anything to do with the context in which it appears. 

<P><Li>An objective resolution of a puzzle may be possible by use of some procedure (called an algorithm)</ul>


<B>Blind Mind</B> is an implementation of such an algorithm, in fact both the picture and colour puzzles presented here can be solved in that way (but the picture puzzle has a twist!).
The concept is that you are explaining the patterns to the computer as you would the flag problems to a person blind from birth with no concept of colour. This is a neat trick for making the subjective elements of a puzzle stand out.. that is "it has to do with colour... so lets pretend I don't know what colour is..."
In doing so you basically solve the puzzle for yourself, the computer just does the add ups... so it is solving an intelligence test problem, but in a purely automated way. It is an "expert" on puzzle solving, because it has a procedure for solving many apparently different puzzles.
<P>
Here is another pattern puzzle
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="blindmind2.gif"><P>

consider the five shapes<br>
Decide Which shape is the MOST DIFFERENT<BR>
Justify your decision.</H4>
<P>
The table of values for this puzzle is exactly the same as for the first pattern puzzle, it is shape 4 which is the most different in both cases.  A first impression would indicate shape 2 to be the most different, but this cannot be justified objectively, remember it was shape 3 in the first set of shapes which subjectively looks the most different.
<P>
YOUR TASK is to design a "Puzzle expert" , using the strategy described above, like the sample HyperCard stack "Blind Mind", A good indication of your success would be :<Ul>
<Li> To demonstrate that your algorithm solves the flag problem
<Li> That you are able to design and solve similar puzzles (and that your algorithm can do it too)
<Li> Lastly there is just a bit more to this than has been covered so far: if you can objectively explain WHY it is shape 4 which is the most different both the set of shapes in this document (that is, your algorithm identifies shape 4), then  you'll have discovered a really  neat little twist which I'll leave to you to discover!</ul>
<P>
<B>Post Script</B><BR>
Can all puzzles be solved by an algorithm? (this question is itself a "puzzle")
the answer is NO... and that CAN be shown by an algorithm!
This is called Godel's Theorem, it can be rephrased to be emotive and subjective so beware.
<H3>
There are things which are true which CANNOT be proved!</H3>

<H3 Align=center>October 1994</H2>
The experience in Nepal took a lifetime, in Queensland time it took only  a month. I started writing the total tale of this trip and soon realised that it would be a short novel. So for this article I had to decide between a chronological summary or a highlight, the latter won my mind. This highlight is the climb, be assured there were plenty more, but in a country where the altimeter reading is more sought than the distance travelled, the climb is the king that catches the heart of the thing. 
<P>
   Nepal is Sandwiched between India and Tibet, most of its people live on  a long flat sea level plain called the Terai, but most interest is in the capital Kathmandu,  the Himalaya ("himal" means "mountain range") and the mountain tribes, especially the Sherpas and Gurkhas. There is a fundamental difference between most of Australia and most of Nepal, the former is flat and the latter is vertical. There are very few vehicular roads,  they are spreading out from Kathmandu but monsoons and landslides are currently keeping them almost at bay. All traffic in greater Nepal is on foot, there is some animal portering but nearly everything is carried  by pedestrians. Goods are carried in conical baskets made from stripped bamboo. The baskets hang down the porter's back stabilised and attached only by a forehead strap, they regularly weigh forty  kilograms, the design looks impractical and neck wrenching but it works incredibly well. The tracks are rough hewn, often comprising paddy levies or rock steps near villages and slippery creek beds or narrow pads elsewhere, and nearly always precipitous: Nepal is a land where the wheel is an impractical device.
<P>
This trip was lead by Tim Macartney-Snape, a climber of note. Tim speaks in a dry matter of fact tone, all that is needed, for his awesome accomplishments make the tirades of enthusiasm of lesser beings over lesser deeds seem just so. Our trip was a challenge for we  mortals and it was to make all of us  better people:  better able to let stress wash past, better able to accept a wider perspective of life. The party consisted of 9 men and 4 women, all from Australia. Our Nepali support crew comprised a sirdar (manager), three sherpa guides, a cook crew of six  and forty, dwindling to twenty, porters. Kasi, the sirdar and Durgar the cook spoke reasonable  English, the sherpas had a smattering, the porters and cooks had very little, usually none. Of the Australians Tim has an effective grasp of Nepali and I can almost get by. Despite the limited verbal channels, communication  was generally  easy, there was a lot of pointing, body language and smiles.
<P>
We didn't really know where we would be going, Tim's first act when we met in the bar of the Hotel Kathmandu was to tear up the "itinerary". He said "This is an exploration not a trek, it is likely no foreigners have ever been to some of the places we will go, particularly in the Ganesh Himal. The maps are probably wrong and we will be navigating by sight". He was to prove correct on all counts, the support staff were expedition (as opposed to trekking) staff, used to dealing with more hardship and unexpected events than a normal trek would present.

<P>
Nearly two weeks into the trek we arrived at a lake. It was a beautiful lake, the scene, we were told,  of an occasional religious festival. That may have been the reason that track to it was in fair condition for we were a long way off the regularly used routes. We hadn't seen a sign of habitation or any "locals" for the preceding four days and apart from the cubic piles of rock called chortens and the ruins of two stone huts, the lake was pristine.  The last villagers we had  met could not understand why anyone would want to go up "there", "How will you survive  the cold at night ?" they had asked. We also were advised that "the Gods will be angry if you invade their domain without due ceremony" maybe we should have brought Indiana Jones along. There were signs throughout the area that there had once been a few sparsely distributed shepherds huts, low rock rectangles amidst stubby alpine vegetation, but these looked to have been destroyed long ago, the summer herdsmen must come here rarely now. We had spied the lake the day before  from a summit far above.  That day had been, a "rest"  day so some of us had climbed a "hill"   twelve hundred metres above camp to get a glimpse of what lay beyond. This was essential, because, as expected, the trekking map had proven very inaccurate, missing  rivers, ridges, valleys and indeed this lake. We had also spied "the peak", a minor high point on a spur running up to "Kabil" one of the major peaks of the Ganesh Himal . Tim decided that "the peak" would be our target, it has no name but it is on the map as near as we can tell, since very few the heights marked on the map agreed with our altimeter readings.
<P>
The lake  reflects a dramatic and vast amphitheatre in its quiet surface, it is a magic place.  Since "flat" and "rockless" are two favoured qualities of camp sites and two rare qualities in the Himalayas and  we had a large expanse of both together on one shore of our lake, everyone was very pleased, especially since the last camp site had had a vertical separation of one hundred metres between the tents.  One of  more spiritual group members who read auspiciousness, or at least supernatural portent, into just about any event  that enveloped her, had been overjoyed when she learnt we were going to the Ganesh Himal, the namesake of one of our Sherpas and also the Hindu God of Wisdom. Indeed we would all come away from the Ganesh Himal a little wiser about others and especially about ourselves. 

<P>
Three of  our group decided to stay at the lake with  most of the cook crew, nearly all the porters and one sherpa  for four days whilst the rest of the group went off to establish an advanced camp and try the climb. That afternoon while we were still at the lake, snow clouds lowered over the peaks and we got a small side order of corn snow as well as some large fluffy flakes, not enough to stay, but enough to remind us that the weather is a key player in the mountains, a warning to the wise from Ganesh.

<P>
Morning dawned bright and clear, we set off around the head of the valley to a saddle in an iron grey range across from us. Two hours later we were at the saddle.  Amidst its guard of  chortens we looked out into a vast vista. A valley,  three kilometres deep, plummeted steeply from our feet, the major Ganesh peaks comprising its opposing wall. Swinging our gaze leftwards past towering ice ramparts we could see our peak amongst the range that defined the western edge of the visible. The only way down was by a fortunate collision of rock strata. A long traverse over loose rock on a narrow ledge iced with a smattering of snow made the descent "interesting". Eventually this preciptous route let us out into the alpine grasslands at the valley head.
<P>
From our vantage point at the saddle we had planned to traverse half way across the head of the valley then ascend  to camp under a glacier, but, as usual, we underestimated the scale of things, a thin black band of rock we planned to hurdle turned out to be a fifty metre high cliff line which we would have to circumnavigate. The  bypass took us almost all the way around the head of the valley to a huge rock spur, sharp and brutally serrated, rising steep to our peak. Fortunately the black cliff line relented before we were faced with this greater barrier. We had lost a lot of height trying to get around the rock band, to regain it meant a hard slog straight up a steep grassy bank. The day had been long already and  the air was thin, the rests were becoming more frequent. "GTA" Tim would say, "Good training for the Alps". After another hour and a half the camp came into view.  Tim and the sherpas had previously gone on ahead to locate a suitable camp site and had started landscaping works by the time we arrived. The site was well above the last grasses set amongst glacial moraine and talus but still well below the ice edge of the glacier itself. Clearing four tent sites amidst the rock proved a long and arduous task but it was more or less complete by the time our three porters arrived with the tents and climbing gear. The porters immediately turned back towards the lake even though the light was already fading and the trip would take them a good five hours, it would be warmer and far more comfortable there. Fortunately for the entire venture, the moon was full and the skies stayed clear at night, so, in this instance, the porters would have had no difficulty in finding the lake, in any case, their track finding skills and surefootedness seem supernatural. 

<P>
The warm sunny day had changed the snow conditions causing numerous avalanches to roar down from the Ganesh peaks far across the valley. The sight and sound of them was separated by many seconds, reminding us of the scale of the scene and reassuring us of our safety. The final avalanche was a huge event, a vast ice wall collapsed from near the summit of Kabil, the ice and rock fell over two kilometres vertically into the valley behind that serrated spur beside which we had ascended. The billowing cloud of snow continued to rise into sight as the avalanche crashed several kilometres further down along the valley... "over there" Tim said with typical laconic understatement "it is dangerous".
<P>
The  cook crew provided a three course dinner as usual. It consisted of our staples, rice, lentils and potato, supplemented by warming clear soup and canned mango. The professionalism of the cook crew could not be faulted at any time on the trip, they were always up before everyone else in the morning, preparing "bed tea" then breakfast, cleaning up then generally racing past us while we washed or rested. We would catch up to them later on cooking lunch for us. When they arrived at the next camp, they immediately prepared afternoon tea and dinner. The cooks' day was never shorter than fourteen hours and often nearer twenty,  they kept  up an excellent standard of cleanliness, cooking and friendliness all day every day for a month. The porters and sherpas were  similarly conscientious at their tasks. Our Nepali crew contained many teenagers, the youngest about sixteen, some of slight stature, both boys and girls. They had to fend for themselves for a month in the wilderness, often without tents or sleeping bags. The cooperation, generosity, conscientiousness and toughness of these Nepali people is a cut above anything else I've seen in the world, it is a rewarding experience just to be involved with them.

<P>
Another beautiful morning to usher us into the world of real mountain climbing. We left the cook crew at camp and climbed up to the glacier. The ascent  took about two hours, and there was more climbing, less walking and more loose rock the higher we went.  Most of us had no experience with crampons and ice axes, indeed some of the group had little experience of snow and ice. Consequently we had a "learn to walk" session  and  then a "how to self arrest using an ice axe without embedding it in your chest" session, hosted by Tim, on the first piece of snow we came across. The next stage was a roped ascent of the glacier, it was very steep but the snow was hard which is good for climbing. Twelve people, ten from oz and two sherpas, roped together is probably too many for efficient coordination, especially with only  five metres separation between each person. Everyone has to move at the same pace and this is difficult as the terrain varies considerably over just about any sixty metre stretch, hence progress was slow. 

<P>
We had not been sure if we could continue our trek in this general direction, we would have had to cross the ridge we were now on further down to avoid the glacier and that looked difficult, but we had heard there was an old trading route to Tibet up here, so there might be a way although we could not see any signs of one. When we came to the top of the ridge we realised that we could not go any further this way, the other side was a steepening to sheer drop plummeting into a deep obviously unused valley below, the only thing you could trade here would be hang gliders. This discovery was of mixed blessing for it meant that the entire group would have to retrace the route to the camp before the lake, but we could also clearly see another ridge running towards the valley of the Bari Gandaki river which lay between us and our next high adventure, the Manaslu Himal, a majestic range now clearly visible for the first time, but that was yet another week and  half away. A quick lunch of cheese and bread and it was past time to descend. 

<P>
Tim lead us down an "easier" way which turned out to involve our first crevasse field and a slippery descent amongst the loose rock and random streams below the glacier, eventually we arrived at advanced camp. During the descent, individual  decisions had to be made at the foot of the glacier. Our route had brought us within close sight of the spur we would have to ascend to "the peak", it was very rugged, not at all a "walk up" as we had hoped.  Those of us who would attempt the climb would leave our gear at the foot of the glacier, to save weight energy and time when returning the next day.  All but four of us and the two sherpas decided, now on the basis of  a little experience, that the climb was beyond their capabilities. Tim was a very good leader in this regard, he would wait until  individuals had a taste of a challenge and  could make an informed decision for themselves, before requiring a commitment to the task: "Challenge by (informed) choice".

<P>
Bed tea was at 3 a.m. we were up and gone by 3:30, breakfast would be a cold boiled egg at 11 a.m. much further up. The weather was excellent, clear and still  but very cold, even the down jacket and body heat generated by our steep fast ascent could not entirely keep that sort of cold at bay. We reached the gear at the foot of the glacier at morning glow. The sun rises fast here, especially when you are gaining height too, so we were barely on top of the leading edge of the glacier when dawn broke. It wasn't long before the warm gear was stowed. Reflection from the snow and the thin air helped transform cold to warm quickly. Thin air cannot convect as much as thick air, so the difference in temperature between shadow and sunlight is usually appreciably greater at altitude. We reached the base of the spur to our peak and left the glacier for rock, still wearing the steel crampons on our boots. Climbing with crampons was a new experience for me, I found that the crampons were different but no worse to climb with than bare boots, the reduced flexibility due to the unyielding steel being compensated by the tenacity of grip due to pressure of the crampon teeth on the rock.

<P>
The climb varied between rock and snow, the rock was often very loose, Tim noted that there would have been signs of previous ascents but the fact that there were none meant that it was reasonable to expect that we were going where no one had been before. It soon became evident that we should fix some ropes to make the ascent safer. Tim lead and fixed two pitches, it was intriguing to see one of the worlds best mountain climbers in action and very fulfilling to be able to follow him. No one needed to rely on the rope, however it did give a measure of confidence, especially once for me when I kicked a little too hard and the snow bank I was climbing caved in. Roped together, we ascended a very rocky section bringing us to the ridge line.  As he reached the top, Tim ,in the lead, jumped back, we all saw why shortly thereafter. The spur line, like the glacier we were on the day before, dropped steeply away, but here it was concave for a long, long way down, the loose rock defining the ridge top could therefore not be trusted. We ascended a short distance to a summit on the ridge then had to move across a snow and ice cornice about a metre deep, uncertain if it was supported adequately by underlying rock. Despite an "interesting" crack that widened as we traversed we all got across safely, the rope wrapped around anything that looked stable, just in case. We then had to contour under an overhang on the concave side of the ridge, again it was most edifying not to plummet into the void. 

<P>
We rested on a small glacier four hundred vertical metres below our peak, but alas we would go no further, we had past the turn back time an hour ago. The  return journey, all the way back to the lake, would be very long and we did not crave returning across the glacier at night. We estimated that the remaining four hundred  metres would take another three hours, thus adding five or six hours to our climb.  We reconciled ourselves that we had already reached two minor peaks on the way up and another on that rest day that now seemed an aeon ago. After a few photo opportunities we retraced our steps, the cracked cornice held while we crossed, then a slow careful descent over the rocks brought us to the top of the double pitch snow bank. Rather than descend roped together we decided to sacrifice some pitons and slings to abseil down. Abseiling is much safer but slower than a roped descent, since only one person can use the rope at a time. The second rope became wedged as we tried to retrieve it and it took some valuable time and some re-climbing to release it. Traversing back across the glacier was a lot easier than anticipated but we were all very tired when we reached its foot and removed the crampons.

 <P>
I lagged behind on the descent, having stopped to fill my water bottle at a drip from the glacier, the streams were freezing up as the temperature dropped, so this took a while. Tim's warning about the descent being the most dangerous part of a climb came to mind many times as I noticed that my climbing was becoming very clumsy and I had to force myself to concentrate on the task at hand. The climbing over, the descent was still steep I wandered slowly downwards.  A porter suddenly appeared from behind a rock, five had come up to take our camp and climbing gear back to the lake and had decided to help the climbers down the last part. I gladly handed over my pack and was ushered down to sherpa Ganesh who had a kettle of warm sweet cordial and some cups, we were not far from camp, but I did not expect to find the cook crew still there let alone the huge "lunch" (it was now very late in the afternoon) they had prepared for us.... great guys! All those who had not attempted this days climb, save one, had returned to the lake earlier in the day.

<P>
The twilight ended when we got to the saddle separating "peak" valley from "lake" valley, but the moon was already high in the sky and so bright that we cast shadows. The moonlight coloured the entire Himal a haunting glacial blue. At 10:30 p.m. we arrived back at the lake tired but feeling a sense of accomplishment, we had not reached our planned peak, but had reached summits that we believe no one had climbed before. For Tim this could hardly have been a challenge, he has climbed Everest twice without oxygen and it is over two kilometres higher than we managed, however he did say that our climb was harder than he had planned and for that my ego thanks him.

<H1 align=center>Viento Blanco</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because it's there&quot;. George Mallory's famous response to the question &quot;why climb 
mountains?&quot; is  remembered because it is glib, brave and enigmatic. Unfortunately 
Mallory and his companion Irvine disappeared whilst attempting the summit of Everest 
in 1924 and Mallory has not yet returned to explain his answer. No one knows if Mallory or 
Irvine got to the top, all subsequent expeditions failed to summit until 29 years 
later. On 28 may 1953 Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa stood on the top of 
the world and returned to tell their tale.  <BR>
<BR>
The mountain I climbed in January was first climbed in 1897 by Mattias Zubriggen, 
its name is Aconcagua, known colloquially as &quot;viento bianco&quot; : white wind, popularly 
depicted with an alpinist walking up a sleeping white tiger's spine, the weather 
can turn from calm to deadly in minutes. The sun burns and blisters exposed skin, the wind 
chill snap freezes everything and whips away body heat and sanity, the clouds can 
white out the way to safety.<BR>
<BR>
Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayas, its summit is 
over three <A HREF="#tallest">Kosciuskos*</A> high and under one third of sea level 
air pressure. The South face of Aconcagua was rated as the hardest climb in the world, 
many have died attempting its vast vertical walls. K2 in Pakistan now holds that title, 
but unlike K2, Aconcagua has easy ways up too and we took one of these along with 
American, Irish, French, Russian, Spanish, Chilean and Argentinean expeditions: truly 
peak hour.<BR>
<BR>
It is easy to get to this mountain, there are two bus stops on the Mendoza, San Diego 
highway at the entrance to the Horconus and Vacus valleys which lead around the mountain 
to two well patronised base camps. We walked up the Vacus valley for two days through sparsely vegetated desert till a side valley framed viento blanco in its V.  
Another day, rising up this valley, was base camp. Mules had been carrying the bulk 
of our gear to this point, from now on we would have to carry everything ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
Base camp is at 4200 metres on the terminal moraine of the &quot;English Glacier&quot; a scree 
of stone, no plant life, indeed no life at all except for crazy homo sapiens, awesome 
kilometre high cliffs and the peak on view much higher than these. This would be 
the home we would cleave to for the next three weeks. The weather was bad and good, Aconcagua 
would dispense the pale remnants of its white winds down the valleys blasting us 
with snow and flattening our tents on our faces as we slept. We did however have 
a mess tent, heavily weighed down, seating for all of us, an eating and social centre 
to huddle and warm in. <BR>
<BR>
From base camp we would go up and down doing &quot;carries&quot; to camps one and two which 
would help us acclimatise. With each carry most of us could feel our fitness increasing, 
unfortunately some reached their personal limits and had to return and remain at 
base camp. Acclimatisation is essential, altitude has inexorable effects due to the reducing 
air pressure, the signs are vivid dreams and constant headache, should the headache 
become a pounding one you will quickly die of cerebral edema unless you descend immediately. Fortunately acclimatisation is straightforward for most, just take it easy 
and keep breathing. Water is another problem, even at base camp there was only a 
small tricle from melting ice, higher up water had to be melted from snow, a slow 
and inefficient process exacerbated by the heavy demand due to zero humidity, fast breathing 
and exertion. Our pressurised shellite stoves were going nearly all the time we were 
in camp. <BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after arriving at base camp seven of the thirteen starters  staggered into 
camp three, a flat clay pan, six and a bit kilometres above the sea and subject to 
the rough handling of viento blanco's whims. It got cold up there, minus thirty five 
with a sixty kilometre per hour breeze equates to minus ninety seven according to the 
U.S meteorological bureau wind chill formula I found on the internet.  Those were 
the conditions under which we started our summit attempt, one day, one vertical kilometre 
up then one back. The names we knew now, &quot;indpendencia&quot; a way point with a destroyed 
wooden shelter the size of a kennel, the &quot;canaleta&quot;, the final chute to the top, 
where two Argentineans had slipped and slid a kilometre two days before.<BR>
<BR>
My hands were cold when we started, despite two layers of gloves, they did not warm 
up for five hours, I got frost nip which made everything tingle for three months, 
lucky for me. Two Spaniards, lost overnight, were rescued only to be told that they 
would have to walk to base camp before they could be ferried out by mule to have their frost 
bitten feet amputated. It turned dangerous this day too, our first indication was 
the French team descending past us &quot;plus tres froid&quot;, they had suffered dangerous 
cold injuries and were on their way off the mountain as quickly as they could. Two solo 
climbers turned back with the French. An American group and ourselves pushed on, 
as the sun hit, the world changed, rocks lit like gold, clouds defining a false fluffy 
base to our world at 5000 metres, with a few peaks poking past, it looked like we were 
going to have a good summit day.<BR>
<BR>
At Independencia things began to change quickly, the wind increased, the cloud came 
down, the tiger was stirring, another hundred metres up and the tiger awoke, viento 
blanco ripped into us, it was difficult and dangerous to stand even with crampons 
and ice axe firmly planted. The Americans a little further on were pinned behind a large 
boulder, we could see the canaleta quickly being consumed by cloud, our guide decided 
it was best to retreat with lives, hands and feet intact. Hours latter we staggered 
like drunkards into our tents all the energy blown and frozen out of us. We had failed 
to reach the top, turned back four hundred metres short, without sufficient energy 
to make another attempt and quickly wasting due to the effects of exertion at altitude. 
We had a temporary addition to our group as well, a lost sole very much worse for wear, 
sunburnt, snowblind and cold effected, he descended the easier Horconus side of the 
mountain with some rangers the next day.<BR>
<BR>
After a rest day we headed for base camp, an hour down from camp three, we came accross 
four lost and exhausted climbers headed the wrong way we directed them towards the 
Horconus descent route and wished them well. A long day later we arrived at base 
camp, met by our compatriots who had satisfied their personal limits earlier.  Relatively 
thick air, copious quantities of food and the mess tent: base camp felt luxurious. 
Four days later, in Mendoza, I had my first shower in a month and the first beer. 
I felt that I had left reality in the wilderness and returned to the artifice of civilisation.<BR>
<BR>
So why do I climb mountains. Well &quot;because I'm here&quot;, life without challenge is like 
death with taxes.  John and Brigitte Muir were our guides on this trip, they have 
made a business out of what they love doing and the business is a means to doing 
what they love, there's a lesson for me in there somewhere.<BR>
<BR>
<A Name="tallest">*</A><CITE>Australia's highest mountain is not Kosciusko (2228 metres), it is an active Volcano 
on Herd Island, near Antarctica called &quot;Big Ben&quot; or &quot;Mawson's Peak&quot;,  about 2745 metres 
high, straight out of the sea and the weather is absolutely atrocious... maybe next 
year!</CITE>

<BR>
<BR>
In May 1996 eight climbers died in a blizzard on Mount Everest, it came on them suddenly, 
out of a calm  blue sky during their descent from the summit. This event brought 
two quotes to my mind, the first is a poem that attempts to encapsulate the challenge, and the second words from Scott of the Antarctic, found with his body.<BR>
<BR>
<center>
<B>
To suffer wowes which hope thinks infinite.<BR>
To forgive wrongs darker than death or night.<BR>
To defy power which seems omnipotent.<BR>
Neither to change nor falter nor repent.<BR>
This is to be good, great and joyous, beautiful and free.<BR>
This is a lone life joy, empire and victory.<BR>
<BR>
</b>
</center>
It is the superscription to Vaughn Williams Antarctic Symphony which arose from his 
score for the film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, and Scotts last words...<BR>
<BR>
<center><B>
I do not regret this journey,<BR>
we took risks,<BR>
we new we took them,<BR>
things have turned out against us<BR>
therefore we have no cause for complaint.<BR>

<b>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</b><p>
<u>A Statement by Senator Bill O'Chee</u><p>
<u></u>A few years ago at our Valedictory Dinner, we had the privilege of being
addressed by Senator Bill O'Chee.  Recently I received an extract from the
Hansard record of Senate proceedings in which the Senator made a very important
statement which I think should be of interest to all of his fellow
Australians.<p>
<p>
"This nation is about upholding the fundamental truths which attract people
from the four corners of the world.  As the people come to us from the four
corners of the world, I propose a four-square deal for all Australian because
there are four truths that underpin everything in Australian society.  They are
as follows.  Freedom - freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from
persecution and freedom from violence.  A fair go - equality of opportunity
regardless of circumstance, regardless of the colour of your skin, regardless
of the wealth or poverty of your parents.  Mateship - loving one's countrymen,
respecting them and treating them as you would want to be treated yourself.
And reward for effort - looking after those who seek to look after
themselves.<p>
<p>
Those are the four great truths upon which this nation was built.  They marked
the upward passage of our society and turned us from a convict settlement into
one of the greatest nations on the face of the earth.  They encouraged young
Australian men and women to spread these truths to other countries and to other
people less fortunate than ourselves.  They are the four great truths which we
should seek to uphold in this place.  Protecting the weak, the needy and the
vulnerable are a consequence of the four great truths.<p>
<p>
If this nation is to have any meaning, if this society is to have any value, we
must ensure for all of our citizens the four-square deal which I outline here
today.  But, most importantly, unless you have lived with fear, unless you have
felt it well up in your throat, unless you have come scarred and battered from
the battlefield of the intolerant mind, freedom of speech, which is won with
little effort and paid for with no sacrifice, is freedom of speech in rhetoric
only.  It is really freedom to be intolerant.  I believe the finest thing we
can offer is a tolerant Australia."<p>
<p>
This remarkable and very direct statement should be an inspiration to us all.<p>
<p>
<u>The 1996 School Magazine</u><p>
<u></u>This year's school magazine will differ from previous editions in a
number of ways.<p>
<p>
First we are delaying printing to allow the inclusion of a full list of the
Scholars' Day awards as well as reports of events in the last few weeks of the
school year.<p>
<p>
Aa a consequence the magazine will be distributed to all pupils when they
return from holidays.  Those who are not returning, such as the matriculating
class, will receive their copy in the post during the same week.<p>
<p>
Overall the magazine will contain more pages with some additional attention
being given to House matters and other aspects of school life.<p>

Another impressive primary school chapel service was held last Wednesday,
planned and produced by <A HREF="mailto:tmcdonald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Tony McDonald</A>'s Year 7 students.  An outline of the
life of William Booth (founder of the Salvation Army) was given and this was
followed by a talk by Fr. Shelto Douglas of Rosies, a mission to street kids
here on the Coast.  Children were challenged to be aware of needs apart from
their own and to consider giving their support to those who help the needy.
Thank you, Mr. McDonald and students for a well prepared and presented Chapel
Service.<p>
<p>
The proceeds from the sale of candles on Carols Night will go to help the
refugees in Zaire.  World Vision describes it as "shaping up to be Africa's
biggest humanitarian disaster.  There are half a million adults and children
caught up in the escalating violence.  At this time, money will be used to buy
food, medicines, shelter and other relief items."  We will be pleased to
forward on any special donations which individuals may care to make.  Another
avenue is to call 1300 303 440 (local call cost) and make a donation via a
credit card.<p>
<p>
May God bless you all,<p>

The Careflight Fundraiser scheduled for the last day of the school term
(29th November) has been postponed until 1997.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="7">EFFECTIVE PARENTING COURSES -1997</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>In line with the College's commitment to the philosophy
that education and social development of your children is the joint
responsibility of both the school and the home, we will be again offering a
course for developing your parenting skills.  This is not to suggest that your
present skills are inadequate, but merely to offer you a more effective and
enjoyable way to relate to your children.  The course which takes 8 weeks
assists you to raise responsible children who will grow into responsible men
and women capable of living meaningful happy adult lives.<p>
<p>
It seems that today an increasing percentage of our children are under
achieving, unco-operative and apparently unhappy.  As parents we face far
greater challenges than our parents did and we need to analyse just how we can
best meet the needs of ourselves and our children.<p>
<p>
Today's parents live in an era when family structure is based increasingly on
social equality.  Traditional methods of raising children are no longer as
effective as they were a generation ago.  In fact parenting is a job most of us
have thrust upon us with little or no preparation.  It indeed seems strange
that other jobs require training and in some cases a signed certificate, not so
parenthood.<p>
<p>
Mr. Bruce McKenzie, a senior lecturer in social studies and a member of the
International Conference on Social Welfare, recently wrote in an article that
"Developing effective communication skills may be the best weapon at hand for
the family in the battle for survival".<p>
<p>
The course, which runs for 8 weeks, will commence on Tuesday February 11th and
will run from 1.30 to 3.20p.m.   Wednesday evening sessions are also offered
commencing February 12th and running from 7.30 to 9.30p.m.  The cost of the
course, which includes a handbook, is $50 per person or $75 per couple.  Please
complete the form below and return to me at school if you would like to
attend.<p>

<b></b>Recently the Year 2 students wrote letters to Santa.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b><i>From Carla</i></b><p>
<i>Dear Santa,</i><p>
<i>My name is Carla Baericke.  I am 7 years old.  I go to Somerset College.  I
am an elf in the school play.  The play is called The Night the Reindeers
Rocked.  </i><p>
<i>from Carla.</i><p>
<i>P.S.  Last year the reindeers left snow on my driveway.</i><p>
<i>P.P.S. Have any of your reindeers been sick?</i><p>
<p>
<i><b>From Santa</b></i><p>
<i>Dear Carla,</i><p>
<i>I love your letter Carla and I hope you like mine.  The reindeer and I can't
wait to visit your home again.  Th elves tell me that you have been very good
this year and that pleases me.  I have just read your letter to the reindeer
and the elves too!  </i><p>
<p>
<i>Do you know what some of the elves asked?  They wanted some disappearing
dust so they could go and watch your play.  I told them that this would be
okay.  </i><p>
<p>
<i>To answer your question.  The reindeer are always well because Mrs. Claus
feeds them magical hay, to keep  them healthy and fit.</i><p>
<p>
<i>With Christmas being so close, I would  like you to be very good for your
parents and help them in any way possible.</i><p>
<i>Love,</i><p>
<i>Santa Claus</i><p>
<i>P.S.  One thing I like best is a cool cup of water and a piece of Christmas
Cake.</i><p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><p>
The school's annual Carols Night is next Thursday, which is
November 21st.  This really does mean that the school year is rapidly drawing
to a close.<p>
<p>
We plan to conduct the ceremony in the quad using the Science block stairs and
verandahs as staging.  Of course if the weather is inclement we will be able to
retreat to the Great Hall.  <p>
<p>
The service should, as in the past, be lovely and a really warm friendly
occasion featuring the real meaning of Christmas through carols and stories and
prayer.  This of course is the family service for Term 4 and as such it is
expected that all pupils should attend and it would be prudent for them to make
a point of seeing their House Tutor or Class Teacher so that their attendance
can be noted.<p>
<p>
After the service, which begins at 7.00p.m., the P. &amp; F. will once again be
cooking BBQ fare for those people who would prefer not to return home to begin
cooking dinner.  To assist the P. &amp; F. with their catering it is essential
that the food is pre-ordered using the flyer included with this newsletter.<p>
<p>
Those who wish to bring a present to be passed on to those who, for a variety
of reasons, are in need on the Gold Coast, may leave it at the base of the
Christmas Tree.  The donations will be distributed by the Lifeline.<p>
<p>
<u>New Sporting Arrangements</u><p>
<u></u>Following on from this year's very successful sporting arrangements the
schools involved have agreed to some further developments which will improve
the standard of competition and increase the  opportunity for the schools to
act together to produce higher standards of coaching and refereeing through
increased co-operative staff development programmes accredited under the
National Sporting and Coaching Accreditation Schemes.<p>
<p>
What will be of particular interest to parents making plans for next year are a
few changes to training and competition days.  <p>
<p>
Beginning in 1997 the Junior School teams will practise on Tuesday and play
their inter school competition on Thursday afternoon.<p>
<p>
Secondary School training days beginning in 1997 will be Monday and Wednesday
with the inter school competition on Friday afternoons.<p>
<p>
The range of sports offered will remain pretty much similar to 1996.  However,
in addition the school will continue to develop its special sports such as
sailing, kayaking, rowing, equestrian, golf and cycling.<p>
<p>
<u>Staff Matters</u><p>
<u></u>Two long serving members of staff have advised me that they will be
leaving Somerset at the end of 1996.  <p>
<p>
Mr. <A HREF="mailto:ghorrocks@somerset.qld.edu.au">Gary Horrocks</A> has been at Somerset since 1991 when he joined the school to
teach Japanese.  He is well known around the school and can frequently be seen
on his way to teach primary classes in Japanese costume.  He will be well known
to those who have attended his Hanami Picnics.<p>
<p>
Miss <A HREF="mailto:swood@somerset.qld.edu.au">Sidonie Wood</A> will also be leaving the school after 7 years.  Miss Wood has
been involved in many parts of school life from ski trips, camps and sport
through to her teaching areas which have included Geography, Mathematics,
Economics and Legal Studies.  Miss Wood, who holds a Law degree, will be
working with a Brisbane law firm.<p>
<p>
On behalf of the school I extend thanks and best wishes to Mr. Horrocks and
Miss Wood for the future.<p>
<p>
<u>Parents &amp; Friends Association</u><p>
<u></u>Earlier this week at the P. &amp; F. Open Meeting the new P. &amp; F.
Management Committee for 1997 was elected.  The time for more formal thanks to
the 1996 Committee will come at next year's Annual General Meeting.  However, I
would like to thank the outgoing Committee briefly now and note the
contribution they have made to the life of pupils at Somerset through their
assistance at sports days etc, funding for bus shelters and much more.<p>

We are all looking forward to a great 1997.  Work has already commenced with
the booking of functions for next year and these will be published in the
school calendar that is sent to all families next year, so keep some of these
dates free.<p>
<p>
I would like to thank the outgoing Committee members Ross Sorbello, Janyne
Lambert, Laurence Boulle and Andrea Harris for the enthusiasm and hard work
that they have put into the P. &amp; F. over the years but I know they still
will be willing helpers - such is the commitment of these parents to
Somerset.<p>
<p>
Carols Night is next Thursday evening and if you still wish to order food the
last flyer is in today's newsletter.  Orders must be in by Monday.  Tickets for
<u>ordered</u> food will be available at the Canteen on the night.<p>
<p>
Finally, the year 12s finish today - on behalf of all the Parents of Somerset
College, I wish these young people all the best with whatever they wish to
achieve in their lives.  The world is before you.  Good luck!<p>

<b></b>On Wednesday, our Preschoolers proudly represented Somerset
College at K-mart's official launch of their Wishing Tree project.  They sang a
variety of Christmas tunes to families and local shoppers and presented a
lovely hamper of goodies to the Wishing Tree.<p>
<p>
I congratulation Mrs. Copperwaite, Miss Pellatt and all the preschoolers for
their fine efforts towards this most worthy cause.  K-Mart will be setting up a
static display of the launch in their Robina store and the invitation has been
extended to all families to peruse this over the coming weeks.<p>
<p>
Next Thursday evening, the Junior School will be participating in the family
Carols Service to be held in the quadrangle.  Following a similar theme of the
Wishing Tree, I encourage all families to contribute to our own Christmas Tree,
where gifts will be passed on to children and adults from less fortunate
families.<p>
<p>
Good luck to all Lower Primary swimmers as they compete in their Swimming
Carnival this Saturday.  I hope the weather remains fine, that the competition
is fair and that the best team wins.  I look forward to sharing this morning
with the Lower Primary children.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="11">DOUBLE HELIX CLUB GROWS CRYSTALS</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>During Term 3, an activity of the Double Helix Club was to
grow crystals in the hope of entering the State Crystal Growing Competition.
Members were enthusiastic and quickly learned how to make a saturated solution
of alum (Potassium aluminium Sulphate), then grew small seed crystals.  The
best shaped of these were selected, put into separate beakers with fresh
solution, and allowed to "grow" during the rest of the term.  They were
regularly checked and fresh solution added when necessary.<p>
<p>
By the end of the term, quite large crystals had been grown, and these are a
credit to the students.  They have been placed on display in the Library for a
week, and will then go on permanent display in the new Senior Chemistry
Laboratory.<p>
<p>
Students to receive special achievement certificates were Year 5 students -
Jessica Horrocks, Jeremy Stahl, Connie Chan, James Holz, Ben Tiplady, and Year
4C students - Mitchell Peers, Anthony Millican, Joshua Lessing, Joshua Cooper,
Paul Bullen and Charles Davidson.<p>
<p>
This has been good experience for the students for the competition next year,
where we hope to grow a variety of crystals of different colours and shapes.<p>
<b><A HREF="mailto:aday@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anita Day</A></b><p>
<b>Science Department</b><p>
<p>
<u>Growing My Crystal</u><p>
<u></u>First we put some alum in a beaker and mixed it with hot water.  We
stirred the solution until the alum crystals were dissolved.  The solution was
poured into another beaker and covered with filter paper and left to cool.
After 24 hours crystals had formed on the bottom of the beaker.  We took out
the biggest crystal and put it in another beaker.  We made more solution and
poured it in the new beaker with the crystal.  In about 5 days small crystals
and fungus began to appear at the bottom of the solution.  The crystal was
taken out and placed on filter paper.  Using filter paper and a funnel the
solution was cleaned and topped up.  The crystal was put back into the clean
solution.  The crystal will grow if this process is repeated.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="15">YEAR 4 R - A VISIT FROM A GRANDFATHER</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>Last week Mr. Watson, Ben Goodall's grandfather, came to
show Year 4R how to do a bark picture.  First he showed us some pictures he had
done himself, they look brilliant!  Then he got a thick piece of cardboard that
had a sketch of mountains and trees on it.  He slowly but surely filled in the
sketch with pieces of bark using P.V.A. glue.  After he had made the first tree
he got a soldering iron and placed it on the bark which scorched a black
outline, which became a shadow.  Soon the picture was done.  It looked
magnificent but he said it had not much detail and that he would spend more
time on it (which was hard to believe).  When it was time for him to go he said
that maybe we could try bark pictures at home and he also told us that a bark
picture unframed would be about $35 and framed about $150, it depends on the
artist and size of the picture.  We all enjoyed Mr. Watson coming to visit.
Thanks to Ben for sharing his grandfather and a big thanks to Mr. Watson.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="16">YEAR 10 ANDREWS GARAGE SALE</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>On the 10th of October 1996, six year old Tjandamurra
O'Shane was pulled from his classroom at Cairns North primary School, doused
with petrol and set alight in the school's playground.<p>
<p>
As a result, Tjandamurra suffered burns to 70% of his body.  Already,
Tjandamurra has undergone five skin graft operations in the Royal Children's
Hospital which has cared for many serious burns patients in the past.<p>
<p>
Year 10 Andrews has decided to raise funds for both the Royal Children's
Hospital in Brisbane and Tjandamurra.  Our Garage Sale will be held on Saturday
23rd of November in the front carpark of Somerset.  We are appealing to you to
donate goods for sale.  All next week, between 7.45 and 8.30a.m.  Year 10
Andrews students will be collecting donations in the front carpark of the
school.<p>

<b></b>What you need to know about melanoma and skin cancer - as
our long, hot summer approaches.  There are three forms of skin cancer and all
are common in Australia as a result of the amount of sunlight to which we are
exposed.<p>
<p>
The most dangerous form of skin cancer is melanoma because it can spread to
other parts of the body.  However, if it is detected soon after it first
develops it is curable by simple surgical excision.  Each year over 5,000 cases
of melanoma are reported in Australia with 1,000 dying of the disease.<p>
<p>
The most common form of skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma (B.C.C.) of which
125,000 new cases are reported each year.  This very rarely spreads to other
organs but, if left undetected, will continue to grow, usually slowly, and may
invade the underlying tissues.  Again, this cancer is curable by surgical
excision or radiotherapy.<p>
<p>
The third type of skin cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (S.C.C.) which often
develops from a solar keratosis (sunspot).  If not treated early, these may
spread to other parts of the body.  Again, these are curable before that occurs
by surgical excision or radiotherapy.  20,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma
are reported annually in Australia.<p>
<p>
Much sunlight damage starts early in life - so <u>hats, shirts, sunglasses,
shade and sunscreens</u> are essential protection for children and young
adults, along with a careful check of skin regularly.<p>
<p>
Melanoma Awareness Day (MAD Day) will fall on Friday, 22nd November and MAD
badges will be on sale at school reception for $2 each.  The funds will go to
the organisers - Melanoma and Skin Cancer Research Institute.<p>

Wednesday 27th Novemebr from 8.45a.m. to 3.00p.m.  Forty-four Somerset students
have been selected for this event.  Unfortunately, due to an unavoidable clash
with the Lower Primary Christmas Concert, Grades 1 to 3 will not be able to
participate on this occasion.<p>
<p>
The Gold Coast Club Championships Finals Day and Break-Up is on in the Somerset
Sports Pavilion on Sunday 24 November from 9.30a.m. to 5.00p.m., followed by a
social event and presentations.  All Somerset Chess players are encouraged to

<b></b><u>Performances</u><p>
This evening the Senior String orchestra will be playing for the Valedictory
Dinner in the Great Hall.  The senior strings have been working hard all year
and this evening's performance will be a fitting finale for that hard work.
Throughout the year they have benefited from their tutelage from both Mrs.
Mason and Miss. Pradella.  Also providing music for the dinner will be Year 11
Franklin house student Penny Cooper.  Penny, a most accomplished pianist, has
fulfilled this function at many school functions and her efforts and abilities
are most appreciated. <p>
<p>
<u>Master Musicians' Series  </u><p>
<u></u>Last Saturday night, the final of the Master Musicians' series occurred.
This concert featured the Conservatorium of Music's Opera School and they
presented a programme entitled `The World of Music Theatre'.  The concert was
presented in a cabaret style with all the performers being on stage for the
entire concert.  Some memorable moments of the concert included the performance
of the trio `You could drive a person crazy' from Comp<i>any</i> by Stephen
Sondheim,  the solo `The Saga of Jenny' from <i>Lady in the Dark</i> by Kurt
Weill, the quartet `So please you sir' from <i>The Mikado</i> by Gilbert and
Sullivan as well as the ensemble finale `On Sunday Arvo' from <i>The
Sentimental Bloke</i> by Albert Arlen.  The concert was of an exceptionally
high standard with full credit to Giuseppe Sorbello for his direction and also
to the obviously outstanding accompanist and repertoire skills of Rita Miles,
whose wizardry and obvious enjoyment at the piano was a joy for all to see.  <p>
<p>
A pleasant surprise in the company was the appearance of Sarah Sullivan.  Sarah
is a past student of Somerset College and in the concert performed as part of
various quartets and duets on the evening.  Sarah was only at Somerset for a
relatively short time but made her mark being in the college's production of
`My Fair Lady' as well as being a member of the vocal group and show choir and
playing clarinet in the concert band.  She is now studying voice at the
Conservatorium in Brisbane after having started her studies at the Mackay
campus of the Conservatorium. <p>
<p>
<u>Coming Events</u><p>
On Monday night, November 18,  the concert band will be having a gathering at
the Mermaid Beach Sizzlers to put a close on the 1996 year and to farewell the
seniors of the group.  If students are unsure of the details please contact
Mrs. Rowe at school on Monday.<p>
<p>
Carols' Night and Scholars' Day are fast approaching and the music department
goes into heavy rehearsal for the next two weeks.  Students in concert band are
reminded that they need their instruments and music at school
e<b><u>veryday</u></b>.  Chamber orchestra students need to make sure they
check the rehearsal schedule in the P.A. to ensure they know when their
rehearsals are on.  Vocal group also practises everyday.<p>
<p>
<u>Co-curricular programme for 1997</u><p>
<u></u>Parents are reminded that for students to continue their co-curricular
lessons (music, speech, ballet) in 1997, there is no need to complete enrolment
forms.  It is assumed that unless the Director of Music is notified, that
lessons will continue in the new year.  If a change of lessons is required,
parents must notify the Director of Music <b><u>in writing</u></b> so the
appropriate changes can be made.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

<b><cite><A NAME="23">EFFECTIVE PARENTING COURSES -1997</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>In line with the College's commitment to the philosophy
that education and social development of your children is the joint
responsibility of both the school and the home, we will be again offering a
course for developing your parenting skills.  This is not to suggest that your
present skills are inadequate, but merely to offer you a more effective and
enjoyable way to relate to your children.  The course which takes 8 weeks
assists you to raise responsible children who will grow into responsible men
and women capable of living meaningful happy adult lives.It seems that today an
increasing percentage of our children are under achieving, unco-operative and
apparently unhappy.  As parents we face far greater challenges than our parents
did and we need to analyse just how we can best meet the needs of ourselves and
our children.  Today's parents live in an era when family structure is based
increasingly on social equality.  Traditional methods of raising children are
no longer as effective as they were a generation ago.  In fact parenting is a
job most of us have thrust upon us with little or no preparation.  It indeed
seems strange that other jobs require training and in some cases a signed
certificate, not so parenthood.<p>
<p>
Mr. Bruce McKenzie, a senior lecturer in social studies and a member of the
International Conference on Social Welfare, recently wrote in an article that
"Developing effective communication skills may be the best weapon at hand for
the family in the battle for survival".<p>
<p>
The course, which runs for 8 weeks, will commence on Tuesday February 11th and
will run from 1.30 to 3.20p.m.   Wednesday evening sessions are also offered
commencing February 12th and running from 7.30 to 9.30p.m.  The cost of the
course, which includes a handbook, is $50 per person or $75 per couple.  Please
complete the form below and return to me at school if you would like to
attend.<p>

Robina.  The day is to provide a social / sport outing for the enjoyment of the
participants.  Golf is available with 18 or 9 holes and dinner is also on the
menu.<p>
<p>
I would like to encourage students to invite their parents to play; organise a
group with other friends and make it an enjoyable time together,  Yes, I
sidestepped saying rugby boys and their dads - female students and family
members are most welcome!  Anybody can play golf and anybody can talk about
rugby.Funds raised will assist in the Rugby package offered at Somerset.  A
Somerset Rugby Tie is in the planning stage.  A Rugby tie fits well in
anybody's wardrobe.  Funds this year will be directed towards getting a
Somerset Rugby Tie around the necks of our Somerset Rugby fraternity.  If you
would like to join us for golf and dinner, just golf, or just dinner and have
not yet completed a form please collect a flyer from reception and return it to
me as soon as possible.<p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><u></u><p>
<u>Melbourne Cup </u>celebrations were properly observed at Divinas Restaurant
by the lake at Robina.  A very large party of Somerset parents and friends took
over the restaurant to view the race on video after enjoying lunch and a
fashion parade.<p>
<p>
The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable and loads of fun thanks to the
organizing skills of the members of the outgoing committee of the Auxiliary.
It is also a very appropriate opportunity for me to thank Sharon Hunter, Mary
Warren, Kerry Watts, Denise Benjamin and Jenny Blyth for the many functions
they have promoted during the year.  It is also a good time to extend best
wishes to Diann Eadeh, Fiona Spencer, Suzie Goldstein, Carol Burow, Jacki Hendy
and Karen Ramsay, the incoming committee for 1997.<p>
<p>
<u>Parents and Friends Association Open Meeting</u><p>
<u></u>Monday night's Open Meeting of the Parents and Friends Association will
include the annual election of office bearers.  Those who are successful will
take over the reins of the association as the new P. &amp; F. Management
Committee.<p>
<p>
I know that P. &amp; F. President, Michelle McQuay, hopes that the meeting will
be well attended.  I understand that there will be chicken and champagne to
celebrate the end of the meeting.  (I'm not sure if it is the old committee or
the new committee who will be celebrating - perhaps both?)<p>
<p>
In any case I endorse Michelle's thoughts on a good attendance.  Somerset and
more particularly, the pupils of Somerset, benefit greatly from the generosity
and enormous efforts the P. &amp; F. has provided over the years.  Simply in
financial terms their contribution would be approaching $2 million.  The most
recent and tangible evidence of their efforts is the bus shelters for pupils
who have to wait in the carpark area.  <p>
<p>
The Committee deserves your support.<p>
<p>
<u>Gold Coast City Council Homestay Programme</u><p>
<u></u>Each year, the Councils of Takasu and the Gold Coast send a group of 10
- 12 students overseas to participate in a 7-10 day homestay programme and
educational tour.  In 1997, the Takasu students will travel to the Gold Coast
in early January 1997, during the period of the summer school holidays.  The
corresponding Gold Coast group will travel to Takasu in June 1997.  The Council
seeks homestay families for students arriving in the January group.  Council is
unable to provide a subsidy for families hosting students, however, Australian
host students will be included in a full week's activity programme at no cost.
This generally involves excursions to local theme parks, a short camping trip,
welcoming and farewell receptions, lunches and shopping days.  Council would
like to invite all students of Japanese language and culture to consider
hosting a student for this period.  Interested families are asked to contact
Council and register their interest by 29th November 1996, on (07) 5581 6789.
<p>
<p>
<u>Sports Awards Dinner</u><p>
<u></u>This year's Sports Awards Dinner was a huge success.  Somerset really
takes great pride in the sporting prowess and spirit of those who win the right
to represent us.  These awards which are given on the night are <u>first and
foremost Somerset College awards</u> and a large component of the assessment
for winning these awards is sportsmanship and contribution to those sports
within the school.  In many cases the level of achievement also acknowledges
performance at state, national or international level.<p>
<p>
To the Director of Sport, Mr. Sayer, and to all those staff who put in a huge
effort to support sport in the school, I extend the thanks of the school. <p>
<p>
This year is perhaps one of the most successful in the history of what is by
broader standards, quite a small school.  It seems remarkable that state final
performances in Hockey and Equestrian, as well as international success in
kayaking, should be achieved by a school which, by choice, is limited to around
300 boys and 300 girls in the secondary grades.<p>
<p>
We can add to this the great performances of all of those students who went out
on to sporting fields representing the school and did their best.<p>

<b></b>Last Thursday evening, nine pupils from the Junior School
competed in the semi finals of the A. B. Paterson Public Speaking Competition.
On the Gold Coast, this competition is a major event in public speaking and
reaching the semi finals is a wonderful achievement in itself.  All speakers
represented themselves and the school exceptionally well and I congratulate
each finalist for their efforts.<p>
<p>
Four pupils made it through to the Grand Final and achieved outstanding
results.  Special congratulations are extended to Mei-lin Robertson (Year 7) -
First;  Alicia Blake (Year 6) - Second;  Regis Broadway and Kirsten Burow (Year
6) - Equal Third.<p>
<p>
The focus for this week was undoubtedly the Instrumental Concert held last
evening in the Performing Arts Centre.  A variety of musical items were
presented and were once again, of a very high standard.<p>
<p>
Thanks are extended to the Music staff for their dedication and enthusiasm in
preparing our young musicians; to the children for confidently presenting their
items and to Miss Michel for her co-ordination of the evening.  Many thanks
also to families and friends who supported this concert and for the
encouragement given at home.<p>
<p>
Inter House Chess commenced this week and moves into final rounds next week.  I
wish all pupils involved a successful tournament - and may the best House win!
Special thanks to Mr Gardiner for his organisation of this annual event.<p>

<b></b>One hundred and forty Somerset parents, family and friends
enjoyed Melbourne Cup by the lake at Robina Town Centre last Tuesday.<p>
<p>
There were certainly plenty of winners on the day, thanks to the generosity of
many Robina Town Centre and Gold Coast businesses.  In fact, we just about ran
out of time with all the prize give-aways that needed to be drawn.  Our
Headmaster did well in the shirt department, winning a lovely pink Polo Ralph
Lauren polo shirt and then a sun care gift pack, which included a lovely blue
t-shirt!<p>
<p>
<A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A> judged Karen Ramsay's hat as the winning hat of the day, and
now Karen has an addition to her family in a feisty decor "dog with an
attitude", donated by Di Lonnquist.<p>
<p>
It was a wonderful way to finish the year for the Auxiliary's 1996 committee
and we thank all of the people who donated their efforts and prizes.<p>
<p>
Many thanks to Julie Lance of Cielo Boutique, Robina Town Centre, for
organising the fashion parade.<p>
<p>
Thanks also to Jacki Hendy who did a wonderful job compering the parade, making
the important announcements and organising some of the valuable raffle
prizes.<p>
<p>
Special thanks to committee member Mary Warren - who practically lived at
Robina Town Centre over the past few weeks - for the generous prizes she was
able to obtain from various businesses at the Centre.  Thanks also to Jenny
Blyth and Susie Goldstein for the many hours they put into ticketing and
organising tables.  Not an easy task when you have 140 people wanting to be
seated at specific tables!  Kerry Watts and Denise Benjamin did a wonderful job
running the sweeps on the day - there were many winners who enjoyed substantial
prize money from the many sweeps held.  Thank you also to Di Eadeh and Carol
Burow for their raffle selling efforts - the proceeds of which will be put to
good use by the Auxiliary in purchasing some item/s needed by the students.<p>
<p>
Finally, sincere thanks to all of the parents, their families and friends who
supported the day.  We hope that the 1997 committee will continue with an
annual Melbourne Cup Lunch - last Tuesday's function was a tremendous base on
which to build and improve on in the future.<p>
<p>
Just a reminder that 1997 class co-ordinators are still needed for Years 3, 7,
8 and 10.  Please give Di Eadeh a call on (55252084) if you are interested.  We
thank Irene Shelsher who has volunteered her time as one of the class
co-ordinators for Year 9 in 1997.<p>
See you next year!<p>

<b></b>Year 8 students should now be studying and revising work
for their exams next week.  In order to help organise their time effectively
parents should note that the Year 8 timetable is as follows:<p>
<p>
Mon. 11/11	Music<p>
Tues.  12/11	Maths, Geography<p>
Wed. 13/11	English, History<p>

<p>
On Monday 11th the students will need their books for a normal timetable as the
Music exam is in the afternoon.  Students have also been allocated study
periods and will therefore need to ensure they have the necessary materials to
do so.<p>
<p>
Please ensure that students are having plenty of exercise, sleep and good food
as preparation for the exam period.<p>

<b></b><u>Carols in the Quad</u><p>
Preparations are well advanced for the annual presentation of Carols in the
Quad.  Choirs, bands, musicians and singers are making their selections and are
into rehearsal mode.  Sound and lighting arrangements are being made.  We are
fortunate to have the Rev Graham Hyman able to come to present a special
Christmas message.<p>
<p>
All that is needed now is for you to check that date in your diary and plan to
be present.  <b>Thursday November 21.</b><p>
<p>
As is our custom, there will be an empty Christmas Tree, and students will be
invited to bring a gift of toys or processed food that will be given to Gold

<b><u></u></b><u>Junior School Instrumental Concert</u><p>
<u></u>Thursday night saw the last in the Junior School Instrumental Concerts
for 1996 and what a fitting conclusion it was to the year.  Many students used
this opportunity to present performances that they have worked hard on
throughout the year and the concert certainly showed the wealth of talent the
college has in the junior school.  The large groups, the string orchestras, the
concert bands and the junior chorale presented works which showed a lot of time
and effort and made the audience ponder on what they will have in store for
Scholars' Day.  Smaller ensembles performed including a keyboard quartet,
recorder ensemble and guitar ensemble all providing the listeners with
repertoire not often heard.  Also in the concert were duets on cello and
keyboard as well as a duologue and solos on French Horn, flute, violin, piano
and clarinet along with students presenting poems.  As always, the audience was
extremely supportive of these young performers.  Thanks must go to all the
staff involved in the organisation of night and the preparation of performers,
to Miss. Michel, Miss. Lanham, Mr. Graham-Wilson, Miss. Pradella, Mrs. Little,
Mr. Leader and Mr. Soothill.<p>
 <b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><u>Congratulations</u><p>
At the Junior School Instrumental concert the winner of SA Everritt award for
contribution to the development of the strings in the Junior School was
announced.  The winner for 1996 is David McIntosh.  David plays double bass in
JSO 1 and is a most worthy recipient of the award.<p>
<p>
Congratulations also to Mr. Rodger Graham-Wilson who this week announced his
engagement to Miss. Lisa Allery.  I am sure that everyone joins with me in
wishing them well.<p>
<p>
<u>Queensland Festival of Music</u><p>
The Senior string results have arrived and although not placing the students
performed very well.  This was the group's first foray into this competition
and has served as a great learning experience for them.  The adjudicator made
the following ratings; balance and blend, precision, phrasing, rhythmic
awareness, dynamics - expression were all given a B/B<sup>+</sup> rating with
the presentation and difficulty of piece - choice of material given As.
Comments made included `performance demonstrating a competent grasp of the
technical demands of the music'.  Thanks must go to Miss Pradella for her work
with the group as well as to Mr. Singh who has helped out in tutorial sessions
as well as helped on the day with preparation.  <p>
<p>
<u>Battle of the Bands</u><p>
<u></u>As mentioned in last weeks newsletter the school is still waiting for
the full results of the Battle of the Bands.  Some results are starting to
coming through and congratulations to Michael Deanshaw who won best live
performance and earned himself $100 for his efforts.<p>
<p>
<u>Performances</u><p>
Over the last two weeks the string trio and Vojazz have had a few performances
to keep them busy.  On Tuesday, November 19, the String Trio (Mercedes Wilson,
Angela Titter, Sarah Tandy) played for the Insight International Conference
held at the Southport Yacht Club.  Thanks must go to Mr. Graham-Wilson for
accompanying them on this occasion.  These young ladies are starting to earn
themselves quite a reputation around the coast and are starting to have quite a
few jobs filling their book.  They also provided music for the guests after the
wedding service for past student Fiona Sharpe.  It was a different experience
for them to play music on the footpath.  Also for the wedding of Fiona Sharpe,
Vojazz (Kiah Wood, Belinda Flindell, John Nicholson, Tim Pearson) provided
music for the guests at the reception held at Palm Meadows.  As usual all the
students performed in a highly professional manner. <p>
<p>
<u>Master Musicians' Series  </u><p>
<u></u>Tomorrow night, the final of the Master Musicians' series is on.  This
concert features the Conservatorium of Music's Opera School and they are
presenting a programme entitled `The World of Music Theatre'.  The concert is
being presented in Brisbane tonight and is the finale of their Master
Musicians' Series, to tomorrow's performance will be well prepared.  The
programme contains all manner of music from the traditional operettas of
Gilbert and Sullivan, the more unusual style of Kurt Weill, to the commercially
successful and well-known excerpts from `My Fair Lady' and `South Pacific'.
Overall it will be great concert and well worth seeing.<u></u><p>
<u></u><p>

<b></b>The students of Year 10 Andrews have chosen to do a
community service project.  After considering a number of worthy causes, we
have decided to raise money for Tjandamurra O'Shane, the little boy from Cairns
who received burns to 70% of his body.  Half of the money will be donated to
the fund set up to help Tjandamurra recover and the other half will go to the
Burns Unit of the Royal Children's Hospital to help other burns victims.<p>
<p>
<b>We have chosen to raise money with a Garage Sale, to be held in the Somerset
College front parking lot on Saturday, November 23rd</b>.  We are appealing to
all Somerset College families to donate goods for sale at our Garage Sale.
Please check your cupboards and garages for household items, clean clothing,
toys, tapes, C.D.s, books, kitchen and crockery items, sports equipment etc.
etc.<p>
<p>
<b>Donated goods can be brought to school every morning between 7.45 and
8.30a.m. to the front parking lot during Week 1 of Headstart, November 18, 19,
21 and 22.</b>  <b>Look for Year 10 Andrews students and Mr. de Boer's orange

<b><cite><A NAME="7">E-MAIL FROM THE U.S.A.</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>The students of 5J have been eagerly awaiting replies to
e-mail letters sent to students at Crooked River Elementary School in Maine,
USA.  The wait was over this week when we checked our mail to see the first
batch of replies.  All children have been given the names of students who will
become our "keypals" and it was very exciting to receive responses.  <p>
<p>
It became very evident during the process of setting this up, that punctuation
is indeed important.  We had sent several dispatches, but every day the inbox
was empty.  After wondering if we were ever going to enjoy a positive Internet
experience, we noticed that we (I) had neglected to include one full-stop in
the receiver's e-mail address.  Full-stop inserted and we were up and
running!<p>
<p>
Already the exchange has been beneficial with students realising that much of
what we take for granted actually needs to be explained in more detail for the
uninitiated.  We are looking forward to making contacts in other parts of the
world.  Thanks to Karen Berkman (Miriam's Mum) for passing on the details to
enable us to start this project.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="8">PRESCHOOLERS VISIT JULIAN YAXLEY AT HIS HOME</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>On Wednesday October 23rd our preschool group went to
Julian's house to see his train and his sheep and duck.<p>
<p>
We had a picnic at preschool first because it was too wet to go to Coolaman.
After the picnic we all went in cars to Julian's house.  Dad and my sister and
I followed Mrs. Copperwaite's car so we wouldn't get lost.  On the way I had to
see things out the window and put a spot on the game sheet.  I found all of
them.<p>
<p>
When we got to Julian's Mrs. Copperwaite made 2 groups.  My group went to see
the sheep.  Their names were Savannah and Wendy.  We patted them and tried to
feed them but they weren't very hungry.  Next we found Gordon the duck.  I
tried to pat him but he kept running away.  Then he pecked at us.  That was
really funny.<p>
<p>
We went to see Julian and his dad's train set inside.  They have lots of
trains, even some "Thomas" trains.  Some of them have smoke and a light on
them.<p>
<p>
Before we went home Mrs. Yaxley had made some cup cakes and drinks and
watermelon for afternoon tea.  The mums and dads and teachers had a cup of tea
and a cake.  Then we all got a lollipop and went home.<p>

Graphics/Arts courtyard.  This terraced area was improved last year with the
addition of shade sails to make it more comfortable for the students.  Another
small sail has been added to provide more shade.  Money for the project came
from the annual giving appeal and from Starkey House funds.  The Starkey funds
were raised from the Starkey House Fashion Parade and some from the Starkey

<b></b>On Thursday the 31st of October, a bus driver from Surfside
Buslines named Steve Willis, told 3R about safe bus rules.  He told us the many
possibilities of children like us getting hurt.  Then Steve showed us a video
called Bus Zone, which was a computer game about getting to, off and on the bus
safely.   Then he gave us a tour of his bus and told us also the possibilities
of getting hurt on the inside of the bus.<p>
<b>Lisa Hamilton.</b><p>
<p>
3R had a bus safety officer that came to talk about bus safety.  One of
the rules was, never to walk behind the bus.  Always wait till the bus has gone
and you and the drivers can easily see each other.  Never stand in the
stairwell.  You can get fined.  There's some bus safety rules.  So be a bus
safety kid.<p>

<b></b>Primary classes are excelling themselves as they each take
responsibility for a Chapel service.  The focus for Grade 4C last week was St.
Francis of Assisi, the rich young man who gave his wealth away to the poor and
lived his whole life serving others.  This week, David Livingstone, the
world-famous Christian missionary to Africa last century, was described.  He,
too, as a medical doctor and geographer, literally gave his life serving the
African people.  Thank you, boys and girls of 7S - and to <A HREF="mailto:pcooper@somerset.qld.edu.au">Peter Cooper</A> and
Michele Sauer for your time and effort in preparing the students so well.<p>
<p>
Our special visitor on Wednesday was Pam Mercier, Area Manager for World
Vision.  She presented a special plaque to the Junior School for coming second
in Queensland for the amount raised for Famine Fighters.  Kate Dorrington,
Junior School Captain, received the plaque.<p>
<p>
It  is of interest to note that $6.3 million was raised from this year's 40
Hour Famine (Australia wide).  Many people are not too sure just how this money
is used.  Take the following story from Liberia, an African country torn apart
by war, as an example.<p>
<p>
"12 year old Robert has been living at a World Vision Unaccompanied Children's
Centre in Rwanda for 2 years.  During the civil war in 1994, soldiers came to
his village and killed his mother, father and sister.  Robert only just
escaped.  Taken into the care of World Vision, Robert was fed, cared for and
counselled, while we searched for surviving family members.  Eventually, we
discovered his grandfather and an older sister living together in a small
village.  They did not know where Robert was - or even that he was alive!  A
few weeks ago, we took Robert to be re-united with his family.  His grandfather
rushed out to see him, picked him up and hugged him like he would never let him
go.  His sister hugged him and his baby cousin cried in the commotion.  When we
left, Robert waved us off with a smile, tears running down his face."<p>
<p>
When a child is re-united with their family, or a life is saved through a gift
of food  or medical care, that is when people's ongoing support of World Vision
makes all the difference. <p>
<p>
There are many ways we can help and details can be provided by phoning 133240
(local call cost) or (07) 3870 4188 Brisbane Office.<p>

May God bless you all<p>

P.S.  I will be giving information to my primary classes this week about

<p>
There is no sports training next Monday and Tuesday for any sport.  However,
training will take place for the final time on 18th and 19th November with our
final interschool fixture on the 21st.  Year 12s are reminded that although
they will have left the college they are required to return for that round of

<b>Junior XI</b><p>
Playing Emmanuel at Emmanuel, were sent into bat.  Using just five
batsmen, we reached a total of 3/164, which was going to be hard to beat.  Our
successful batsmen were Simon Dorrington 46 n.o., James Brown 44 and Matthew
Hicks 42.<p>
<p>
We bowled Emmanuel out in the 18th over, they only reached 72 runs.  Our five
bowlers all picked a wicket or two.  James Brown 3/15, Matthew Hicks 2/2,
Michael Bache 2/13, Simon Dorrington 2.20 and Ryan Criddle 1.16.<p>
<p>
It was one of our better matches in the field, with Nick Task taking two good
catches.<p>
<b>Matthew Hicks (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>Intermediate XI</b><p>
Emmanuel won the toss and elected to bat.  Our bowlers bowled well and
almost everyone took a wicket.  Brandon Wood picked up a hat trick for very
good figures.  Adam Daniels 1/6, Geoff Lewis 1/16, Luke Boman 4/9 and Brandon
3/8.<p>
<p>
All up Emmanuel made 56 runs.  It took 4 of our batsmen to reach this score,
however everyone had a bat.  Batsmen who made double figures were Michael
Turner 10, Adam Daniels 23 n.o., Luke Boman 36, Russell Tainton 11, Geoff Lewis
17 n.o., Craig Leggett 12 n.o. and Brandon Wood 10.<p>
<p>
<b>1st XI</b><p>
A.B. Paterson all out 111 (W. Keys 6 for 10 off 9), S. Peterson 2-28-7,
B. Hudson 1-8-3, I. Smith 1-14-3).  <p>
<p>
Somerset 6 for 49.  A difficult but not impossible situation from which to
retrieve the match given the batting depth in the Somerset team.  There will be
a full report in next week's newsletter following the second week of play.<p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><p>
<u>Lessons End for Year 12</u><p>
<u></u>Yesterday the senior school had a special chapel service to mark the end
of classes for the Year 12s who begin study leave and examinations today.<p>
<p>
The service is a very moving one and involves the school and House flags being
returned to the House Masters by the House Captains.  The school flag is handed
to the Headmaster by the School Captains and the school Bible is returned to
the Chaplain.<p>
<p>
The bare flagpoles in the hall are a reminder to all that the seniors are not
in residence.  This will remain the situation until the 1997 seniors are
inducted next year.  Naturally the hall will be dressed on those occasions when
the seniors come back for the Valedictory Dinner and Scholars' Day on November
30th.<p>
<p>
During the ceremony I had the opportunity to congratulate our Year 12s on the
sound leadership of the school's student body during the past year.  It has
been a great year for Somerset in sport, the performing arts and academic
achievement.<p>
<p>
On behalf of the Year 12s a senior, Greg Williams, announced that the Year 12s
have decided to leave funds for the school to build a fountain in the area of
the quad and turning circle.  In doing so this year's Year 12s have carried on
a practice which was begun by the Year 12s of 1987 who gave the school the
altar for the school Chapel.<p>
<p>
I know I speak for the whole school when I extend best wishes to the seniors
for their final exams.<p>

<b></b><u>Sports Dinner</u><p>
<u></u>Tonight is a big night in The Great Hall for all of those who have been
involved in school sport this year.  Somerset pupils have had a wonderful year
and examples include a third in the State Equestrian Titles, fourth in the
State Girls' Hockey Titles and a terrific international performance by the
school's kayakers.<p>
<p>
Outstanding sporting achievement by individuals and teams will be acknowledged
at the dinner where the speakers will be 1996 Olympic medal winners for rowing
David Weightman and Robert Scott.<p>
<p>
<u>Congratulations and Well Done</u><p>
<u></u>Our Girls' Open Hockey Team played two excellent games on the weekend to
finally end up 4th in the State Hockey Titles.  Their 2-1 defeat was, on both
occasions, the narrowest of margins and they continued to attack their
opponent's goal right up until the final hooter.  This is one of the school's
best sporting performances and during the elimination rounds they defeated Palm
Beach Currumbin and St. Hilda's on the Coast before going to Brisbane where
they had strong wins over Ipswich Girls' Grammar as well as last year's
winners, Brisbane State High.<p>
<p>
This year's State Champions are from Maryborough.<p>
<p>
Congratulations also to Ian Smith and Matthew van Tuinen who were both members
of the South Coast Regional Team which won the State Cricket Carnival in
Cairns.<p>
<p>
<u>Westpac Master Musicians Series</u><p>
<u></u>The fifth and final concert for the Series will take place next Saturday
evening, 9th November, in our Performing Arts Centre.  The Queensland
Conservatorium of Music Opera School will perform "great songs from music
theatre" (Sondheim, Gilbert and Sullivan, Strauss, Learner and Lowe, Kander,
Arlen, Weill to name but  a few) to close what has been yet another truly
excellent year of musical entertainment.   <p>

Exams have started for Year11 and 12 and will start for other
secondary students on Monday 11th November.  All students will be underway with
their revision programme.  Year 11 and 12 exams run until Friday 15th November.
Students in these years need only attend for those times when they have
scheduled examinations, however they must all attend sport each Thursday.  Most
will have an exam in the morning on Thursday anyway.  Care must be taken when
reading the timetable so that exams are not missed.<p>
<p>
For the Junior Secondary, Years 9 to 10 start exams on Monday 11th November and
Year 8 on Tuesday 12th November.<p>
<p>
Students in Years 8 to 9 must attend school every day.  Private study rooms
will operate for those not doing exams in any particular session.  Students in
10, 11, 12 may attend only when they have exams.<p>
<p>
Under the system of assessment in operation in Queensland (ROSBA) school
examinations form a major part of student assessment for formal certificates at
Junior  (Year 10) and Senior (Year 12) Level, as well as determining places for
entry to tertiary institutions.  The following rules are to be strictly adhered
to:<p>
*	No students may have information relating to exam content written on
themselves, equipment or paper taken into the exam room.<p>
*	No student may talk while in the examination room.<p>
*	No student may return to an examination after leaving the examination room.<p>
*	All books etc not needed are to be placed on the floor under the table.<p>
*	If a student wishes to ask a question they are to raise their hand to attract
the attention of a supervising teacher.<p>
*	A supervising teacher is to be present in an examination room at all times.<p>
*	Failure to observe these rules may result in the loss of part or all of the
marks for that examination.<p>
*	Any student who is absent on the day of an exam must produce a medical
certificate.<p>
*	There will be no borrowing of equipment such as calculators, pens etc during
exam sessions, so come properly equipped.<p>
*	The use of liquid paper is prohibited.<p>
*	All students must bring a note when an exam is missed.<p>
*	Students missing exams must report to me as soon as they return to school so
that an alternative sitting can be arranged.<p>
*	All students must attend sport on Thursday each week of the exams.<p>
<p>
All the best students and study hard.<p>

<b></b>On Friday Year 3 had a camp.  We went to swimming first,
then we came back to school.  We got changed into our camp gear and had our
recess.  We went to the beach and there was a path that you can walk and we saw
bush turkeys' nests.  After the walk we had our lunch.  When we came back from
the beach we set our tents up.  Then we got all the bags in the tent and we
played cricket and Simpsons on the oval.  After we played on the oval we had
dinner.  Then we had the camp fire.  When all the parents had gone we played
with the torches.  Then we watched slides about planets.  After, we played with
torches we went to sleep and in the morning it was raining.  After the rain
stopped we got all the bags up near our class.  Then we had the breakfast and
when we ate all our breakfast we went to the oval to pack our tents up.  After
we packed our tents, we went to the classroom to see a video and the video was
called "Who is Talking Now?"  When we were watching the video everyone went
back home.  My favourite bit was when we set up the tents and my worst bit was
when we went to sleep.<p>

On Friday Year 3 had a sleepover on the front oval.  Our class went to
swimming on the bus.  After swimming we got changed into our camp clothes.
Then we went back to school and said good morning to Mr. Whittington.  The
class put their lunch into the boxes then ate their snack.  After recess we
went to Burleigh Heads National Park.  We saw lots of trees.  Some had branches
wrapped around them that suck the life out of them.  I saw three bush turkeys
and their nests.  After the walk we had lunch under a tree.  I had a yummy
lunch.  We then had a sand castle competition.  Mrs. Rogers said, "Bad luck to
the losers."  We went back to school and put up the tents.  We played cricket
and the Simpsons and we all played in the adventure playground.  Everyone had
dinner and dessert.  Almost all the parents came to the singalong.  The parents
went home.  We saw slides of space and we were all falling asleep.  We brushed
our teeth and went to bed.  In the morning I woke up at 4.47a.m.  I got
dressed, had breakfast and went home.<p>

<b></b>Last week there was a collision between two cars not far
from Somerset College.  It happened about 4.30p.m. and as I recognised both
drivers I stopped to render assistance.  Nobody was hurt but the drivers were
naturally shaken.<p>
<p>
With the people at the scene of the accident, three tow-trucks, two damaged
cars, together with the parked cars of people who had stopped to comfort those
involved, it would have been patently clear to other motorists that they were
approaching the scene of an accident.  Yet their speed did not slacken as they
passed by.  All the drivers, including those of heavily laden trucks, seemed to
be in a desperate hurry - even oblivious to the possibility that someone might
step onto the road unexpectedly.<p>
<p>
Why are people always in such a hurry, always so impatient to get to their
destination?  With all our modern labour-saving devices we enjoy in the western
world, people seem to be busier than ever and quite often short-tempered!
Somewhere our priorities must get mixed up.<p>
<p>
Life can be relaxed and restful, even though busy.  It's our inner being that
is all important and that can remain at peace in the most stressful
circumstances.  A relationship with God through Christ offers such peace -
peace that the world cannot understand, a peace promised by Jesus.  He said,
"My peace I give to you."  It is available to all.<p>

<b></b>Term 4 is well and truly upon us and already there has been
a lot of action happening in Franklin House.  This week, the Year 11 and 12
Franklin House Groups had a luncheon.  The luncheon provided an opportunity for
the Year 12 students to pass on their thoughts and some advice to the future
Year 12s of 1997.  It was also an opportunity for the Year 11s to thank the
Franklin House Seniors for their efforts in 1996.  House Captain, Nicole Hardy
handed over the `Franklin Seniors' trophy to Year 11 representative Michael
Day.  This symbolised the handing over of the leadership of Franklin House to
the Year 11s.  Nicole thanked her fellow seniors for their support over the
year and 12F House Tutor, Mrs. Day, for her guidance and efforts.  I sincerely
endorse Nicole's comments, and add that she has performed her duties as House
Captain to a very high standard.  Thank you.<p>
<p>
Last week, Franklin House presented the School Chapel Service.  Year 11
students, Penny Cooper, Kate Clements and Craig Roughan co-ordinated this
service which delivered a message regarding the importance of
`<u>determination</u>'.  Students from all year levels were involved in the
presentation and really enjoyed the opportunity to convey the theme to the
student body.  Thank you to all those students who had a key role in the
organisation of this service.<p>
<p>
House Group Co-ordinators for this term are:  <p>
8F - Brooke Powell, Caroline McQueen<p>
9F - Michael Lambert, Brett Roughan<p>
10F - Wendy Kingston, Ben Cho<p>
11F - Kate Clements, Craig Roughan<p>
<p>
These students have been meeting each Thursday morning to discuss and organise
end of year arrangements.  I congratulation you all on your selection as House
Group Co-ordinators and look forward to working with you for the remainder of
the school year.<p>
<p>
Finally, best of luck to our seniors who begin their exams today.  I have
appreciated your support and enthusiasm with House events and  I look forward
to seeing you all and your parents at the Valedictory Dinner.<p>

contribution to school life has been extensive both through her role as
ambassador for the school overseas and her significant contribution to Veivers
House.<p>
<p>
With the end of the year approaching students are busily preparing for exams.
Senior Veivers students took time out this week to meet together socially.
This started with a progressive dinner organised by Year 11 Veivers students
and Mr. Murray.  We thank the Bruce Family, the Chou Family and the Ang Family
for allowing us into their homes and the Sullivan Family for transporting the
students around to the venues.  The night proved to be an enjoyable evening
which allowed the students to socialise together in a relaxed manner.  (Thanks
Paul for Karaoke.)  The organisation and co-operation of the students and the
mature manner in which they conducted themselves demonstrates the strong
leadership they will offer the House next year.<p>
<p>
The Year 12s with their House Tutor, Mrs. Lambert, went out to dinner.  This
created the opportunity in an informal setting to discuss their future hopes
and dreams and also to reminisce on the memorable things they have all done
together over the past years.  On behalf of Mrs. Lambert and myself we thank
the Year 12 Veivers students for their leadership and good natured approach.
We wish them success in their exams.<p>

<b>Year 12 Legal Studies</b><p>
On Friday the 18th October the Year 12 Legal Studies class enjoyed an
extremely interesting presentation given by Sally Edwards - an investigations
officer of the Criminal Justice Commission.  Ms. Edwards discussed the role of
the CJC saying that their main objective is to "keep the public sector honest".
The CJC received funding from the Government.  However they are a separate body
enabling them to look at members of parliament and other public servants from
an external viewpoint.  <p>
<p>
Students were given inside information about criminal investigations, listening
devices and organized crime throughout Queensland.  Ms. Edwards also commented
on the current controversy surrounding the Commission.<p>

<p>
On Tuesday 22nd October Anne Haley-Brown and her gorgeous daughter,
Evan, visited Somerset College.  Anne spoke to the Year 11 and 12 Legal Studies
classes about her background and involvement with the law.<p>
<p>
She grew up with an avid interest in ballet, becoming a ballet dancer with a
New York Company.  However, she was also interested in law due to her father's
and grandfather's involvement in it.  After completing four years of university
at Brown University, she proceeded to study Law at Stanford.  A few years
experience in the courtroom led her to a firm specialising in Entertainment
law.  This firm was that of Johnny Cochrane who was based in Los Angeles and
became famous for his involvement in the O.J. Simpson case.  A later client of
his was Michael Jackson.<p>
<p>
Anne, her child and her husband, are currently in Australian because of
husband's career as an actor in the new Flipper series.  While he is filming,
Anne will begin lecturing Law at Bond University in November.<p>
<p>
We wish Anne and her family the best of luck in Australia.  Don't forget to
keep an eye out for the new Flipper series!<p>

As mentioned in last week's newsletter, Katherine Day has been selected in the
1997 National Children's Wind Orchestra of Australia.  In recognition of this
fine achievement Monday's assembly saw Katherine awarded a blue in Music.  As
pointed out by the headmaster, the blue is not only recognition of the level of
achievement but also recognition of Katherine's dedication, talent and hard
work.  So once again congratulations to Katherine on her award and also to Mrs.
<A HREF="mailto:arowe@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anne Rowe</A> her teacher, as together they have worked hard to achieve this
success. <p>
<p>
<u>Queensland Festival of Music</u><p>
The Queensland Festival of Music (Q.F.M.) is now over for 1996 for Somerset
College.  Although it has been a long haul I am sure that all students who
participated in the Festival found it a rewarding experience.   As yet the
results regarding the Senior strings have not been forwarded to the college so
unfortunately comments regarding their performance will have to be held over to
a later newsletter. <p>
<p>
Thursday evening saw the concert band compete in the finals of the concert band
section.  It is a difficult decision as to whether it is better to compete in
heats and finals on the one day or to space out the heats and finals for the
group.  For the past two years it has been tried both ways and it is still not
clear which way is best, both have their pros and cons.  Although not gaining a
place in the final the band played extremely well.  There needed to be a
programme change from the Monday as one piece was deemed possiblyillegal, which
saw the concert band work on some hurried changes on their Wednesday afternoon
rehearsal.  This may have affected their performance on the Thursday evening.
The adjudicators made the following comments concerning their performance,
"...a good balance and blend...the tone, the balance/blend/intonation is
certainly very good... presentation - bravo!...you have some good sections and
individual instrumentalists...energetic and enthusiastic sums up this
performance...good music was in evidence...".  The band has enjoyed
participating in the Festival and although not gaining a placing they have
shown that the most important aspect of the Festival is young people making
music together and sharing in the camaraderie that this builds.  The band has
grown closer as a group through playing in the Festival and the associated
activities, and this camaraderie which has developed is what making music is
all about.  <p>
<p>
A very large thank-you must go to Mrs. Rowe for all her hard work with the
grou, as working with a group of young men and women of such a diverse array of
personalities and abilities is indeed hard work.  Thanks also to Mr.
Graham-Wilson and Ms. Barnes for their assistance in rehearsal, and also to Mr.
Jackson who has become a chef extraordinaire and who also accompanied the group
on Thursday night.<p>
<p>
<u>Battle of the Bands</u><p>
<u></u>As mentioned in last week's newsletter the school had three bands
compete in the South East Queensland Battle of the Bands conducted by Trinity
Lutheran College at the Tropicarnival Park, Bundall on Saturday, October 19.
The prize pool associated with this competition was approx. $12,000 with prizes
ranging from recording time to guitars.  As yet the official result sheets have
not been sent to the school but as soon as they do, the newsletter will carry
the list of results.  <p>
<p>
<u>Performers' in Training Series Concert </u><p>
Wednesday evening, October 30, saw the final concert in the Performers in
Training Series for 1997.  There have been four of these concerts throughout
the year.  These concerts are designed to be informal in nature and allow
students to perform in the public eye without feeling the pressures that
sometimes occurs in a more formal concert.  Wednesday's concert had
performances in voice, violin, French horn, recorder and piano.  The concerts
are held at the end of each term with consideration for exams and are an
excellent opportunity for our young performers.  Thanks must go to Mr.
Graham-Wilson for organising these concerts, to the various co-curricular
teachers for preparing students, to the students themselves for participating
and the parents for their support.  These concerts are scheduled to continue
next year and are sure to bring the wealth of talent to the fore next year as
they have this year.<p>
<p>
<u>Valedictory Chapel  </u><p>
<u></u>Thursday, October 31, saw the last day of formal lessons for the current
Year 12 and hence the Valedictory Chapel.  Members of the Jazz band and Vojazz
contributed to the service.  The jazz band played the processional and
recessional for the senior students and staff as well as the hymn.  The music
for the processional and recessional was `Hey Jude' and on reflection, the
opening words of the song, `Hey Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song and
make it better', made it a most apt choice.  The Headmaster's message in the
service was that although today can be considered to be a sad day it is also a
day of new beginnings for the seniors: `take a sad song and make it better'.<p>
<p>
Vojazz sang the anthem `The Prayer of St. Francis' by Allen Pote which includes
some of the best known religious texts and most suitable for the service:
`Lord make me an instrument of your peace, where there is hatred let me sow
love...'.  The opening and closing solo of the anthem was sung superbly by John
Nicholson.<p>
<p>
Thanks to Mrs. Rowe for preparing the Jazz band for the service and also to the
members for playing.  The band was minus its seniors for this service and it
pleasing to see the core of players remaining which heralds a great band next
year.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="18">SOMERSET POETRY &amp; SHORT STORY COMPETITION</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>Once again the competition attracted large numbers of
entries from Year 7 through to Year 12.  This year we were extremely fortunate
to second the talents of Mrs. Lorraine Pilgrim, the founding Head of English in
the college, to judge the students' work.  For those of you who know Mrs.
Pilgrim she is a tireless worker with Celebration of Literature and her love
and enthusiasm for creative ideas has always been an inspiration to students.
So it is not surprising, when she presented the awards on assembly this week,
that she described the works of these talented writers in the following manner,
"as motivating and inspirationally creative pieces that draw together powerful
and authentic ideas within an entertaining medium."<p>
<p>
Congratulations to all the students who entered the competition and we wish you
the best of luck in your future writing experiences.  Listed below are the

<b></b>The Somerset Rugby Club helps with the running of the game
of Rugby within Somerset College.  Each year in November the Rugby Club
conducts a<b> RUGBY GOLF DAY</b> to raise funds.  These funds are used each
year for coaching courses and material, equipment, rugby camps, bus trips and
the hosting of visiting teams.<p>
<p>
I invite all rugby families to participate and those from the wider Somerset
community as well.  Hole Sponsors, prize donors and players are required - put
<b>Friday 22nd November</b> down in your diary!  <p>

<b>Cancellation of Wednesday Sports Training</b><p>
It is inevitable that there will be occasions when Wednesday sports
training will have to be cancelled.  This week for example with the enormous
storms heading our way was one such occasion.  <p>
<p>
My policy for cancellation is to notify students by 2.00p.m. so that you can be
called between 2 and 2.30p.m. if necessary.  However, it is my hope that
students who have a set of arrangements e.g. home by bus or notify brother or
sister and meet with them for pick-up, will alleviate massive numbers of phone
calls.  <p>
<p>
My biggest concern is the number of calls that the office receives prior to
2.00p.m.  Sport<b> is <u>ON</u></b> <b>until front office is notified at
2.00p.m.</b>  I am aware that some enquiries are necessary but the past couple
of weeks have been quite difficult to manage in the office.  Please help us -
it is easier for the office if you allow  your child to call you or have a plan
in place should it be needed in future weeks.<p>
<p>
<b>Masters Games</b><p>
We have had  many champions congratulated during the year (students that
is!).  Today I would like to congratulate a few Junior School Staff who have or
will compete in the Masters Games:<p>
*	Mr. <A HREF="mailto:pcooper@somerset.qld.edu.au">Peter Cooper</A> (Yr. 4) gained 3rd place (Bronze Medallion) in the Mountain
Bike (downhill) event.<p>
*	Mrs. Julie Wirth  (Junior School Secretary) who is busy all this week in
Netball games that will hopefully see them qualify for the finals this
weekend.<p>
*	Mr. <A HREF="mailto:tmcdonald@somerset.qld.edu.au">Tony McDonald</A> (Yr. 7) competes on Saturday in the Athletics Championships
at Pizzey Park.<p>
<p>
<b>Swimming Training</b><p>
We are under way with the Junior School Swimming Training on Wednesday
mornings at 7.00a.m. at the Mudgeeraba Pool and we would welcome any students
who would like to start developing their strength and style.  "The water is
beautiful" so the children tell me!<p>

shot quite a few more!  It was a fairly exciting game with hardly any time to
think about what we were doing.  Nina Chou played a great game.  She was really

<b><cite><A NAME="21">CRICKET REPORT</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b>Junior XI vs Trinity</b><p>
We played Trinity for the second time, hoping to win two straight games
against them.  Fielding first, our opening bowlers snared 3 wicket wickets.  We
bowled Trinity out in the 22nd over for 91.  our bowling attack managed to
share the wickets out.  Matthew Hicks w rapped the last 3 wickets up with a hat
trick 3/7, James Brown 2/8, Michael Bache 2/17, Ryan Criddle 2/27 and Simon
Dorrington 1.26.<p>
<p>
Passing Trinity's total in the 17th over, we went on to make 7/171 off our 30
overs.  Our main runs were scored by Michael Bache 50 retired, Matthew Hicks 36
and Ryan Criddle 16.<p>
<p>
We fielded better than we had in the previous game, with no catches dropped.  A
great effort in the field by Joel Ovens-Brown.<p>
<b>Matthew Hicks (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>Intermediate XI vs Trinity</b><p>
Trinity won the toss and elected to bat.  Our bowlers bowled very well
and the wicket takers were Adam Daniels 2, Russell Tainton 3 and Justin
Richards 2.  Batsmen that made double figures were Justin Richards 23, Russell
Tainton 19, Craig Leggett 30 and Adam Daniels 34 n.o.  <p>
<p>
Trinity made 73 and it took only three of our batsmen to reach their score.<p>
<b>Luke Boman (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>1st XI vs Trinity</b><p>
Somerset all out 278 defeated Trinity all out 61 and 5 for 61.<p>
<p>
Somerset wrapped this match up on the first week, thanks mainly due to the
bowling effort of Andrew Tiplady whose five wicket haul included the acceptance
of a click caught and bowled chance, and the batting of Matthew van Tuinen who
was 43 n.o. at stumps.  While Matthew only added 3 runs to his score on the
second week, his partner Ian Smith went on to score 116.  Ian's innings
included ten 4s and seven 6s and is the second highest score ever achieved for
Somerset's 1st XI.  Michael Exelby added to the entertainment hitting three 6s
off successive balls in reaching his score of 39.  The team's total of 278 is
the third highest ever recorded by the College's 1st XI.<p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><u></u><p>
<u>Somerset Drive Traffic and Parking</u><p>
<u></u>During the last holiday period a number of changes were made to the
school's front carparks.  These include:<p>
*	re-alignment of the exit lanes on to Somerset Drive to make them safer and
easier to use.  (This work was carried out by the Gold Coast City Council).<p>
*	the addition of extra carparking spaces and the re-allocation of Year 12
pupil carparking to the Koala House carpark.<p>
*	re-alignment of the traffic lanes within the school road system to provide a
left turn priority lane for cars wishing to proceed west along Somerset Drive
(i.e. towards Mudgeeraba).<p>
<p>
These changes followed on from recommendations made by traffic engineering
consultants retained by the school earlier in the year.  Altogether they have
provided significant improvement in the management of traffic entering and
leaving the school.  However, as the consultants pointed out, the main problem
is the increase in traffic on Somerset Drive which has become a very busy
road.<p>
<p>
<u>Dangerous Pick-Up Arrangements</u><p>
<u></u>I am very distressed to see that a small number of parents are
persisting with the dangerous practice of instructing their children to wait
for them on Somerset Drive.  This is a dangerous practice because Somerset
Drive is very busy.  There are no pedestrian crossings provided and there is no
pedestrian access along most of the road verge.<p>
<p>
In instructing pupils to go to Somerset Drive, parents are causing these young
people to break the rules of the school and to disobey their teachers'
instructions.  These rules are designed to ensure the safety of pupils of the
school.  Moreover the practice is pointless when there are vacant car spaces in
the carpark. <p>
<p>
Children found waiting on Somerset Drive will be sent back to the school's
administration building.<p>
<p>
<u>The Student Diary</u><p>
<u></u>With examinations approaching most pupils should be hard at work and
also well advanced on a programme of preparation and revision.<p>
<p>
Parents, if you have not done so, can I suggest that you take time to discuss
these arrangements with the students and review the programmes and homework
recorded in the diary.  This is a great aid to planning.<p>
<p>
Of course the student diary is not just for homework.  As well as containing a
lot of information on school and academic matters, it is the preferred way for
parents to advise the class or House teacher of absences, problems or other
matters.<p>
<p>
Properly kept, the diary should give a very complete picture of everything from
illnesses, detentions, homework and assignments to <p>
 awards.<p>
<p>
<u>Seniors Formal</u><p>
<u></u>Congratulations to all concerned with the Senior Formal.  In particular
the seniors on the organising committee, who did such a great job, deserve
praise.  Thank you also to Mrs. Bonifant who guided and assisted the committee.
It was a great night and the school can be very proud of the way the young men
and women of our senior year conducted themselves.<p>
<p>
<u>Congratulations and Well Done</u><p>
<u></u>Congratulations to Year 9 student, Katherine Day, who has been selected
in the 1997 National Children's Wind Orchestra of Australia.  Katherine plays
the bassoon.  <p>
<p>
Congratulations also to the following students who acquitted themselves very
well in their various events at the recent State Cycling Championships - Jay
Kownacki (2nd), Cameron Bray (2nd), Lisa Boman (1st, 3rd), Todd Alexander
(1st), Olivia Stuckey (1st), Jacinta Hyman (3rd).<p>
<p>
The Dragon Boat crew also deserve congratulations after the Queensland Dragon
Boat Championships held last Sunday.   Twenty of our fittest young men and
women took part and in 3 races were undefeated and awarded the Queensland
Championship Trophy.  Even more impressive was their time - only 2 seconds
slower than the eventual winners of the Open Section who train regularly.<p>
<p>
Finally congratulations to our students who took part in the A.B. Paterson
Public Speaking Competition held last Wednesday evening.  Annaleise Grummitt
and Olivia Stuckey came 1st and 2nd respectively in the Year 12 section; Year
11 student Nick Smythe<p>
 achieved a 2nd placing; Simone Donoghue came 2nd in the Year 10 section and
Emma Grieve made it into the finals putting the Somerset Team in the winning
position.  Well done!<p>
<p>
<u>Final P. and F. Function</u><p>
<u></u>The Somerset Stampede is scheduled to take place this Saturday evening.
If you have not yet booked a table I urge you to do so by phoning Ross Sorbello
on 55749017 and come along to what promises to be a fun evening.<p>
<p>
<u>Hockey </u><p>
<u></u>Our Senior Girls' Hockey Team will be participating in the State Finals
of the Telstra Hockey Competition this Saturday and Sunday.  I'm sure they
would be delighted to have a Somerset cheer squad with them, so if you can
spare the time please give them your support.  On Saturday the girls are
playing at 12.30p.m. on Field 2 at the State Hockey Centre, Lytton Road,
Colmslie, Brisbane.  <p>

<b></b>What do "Love One Another", "Angry Anderson" and "Spring",
all have in common?  These are the first three themes for Chapel Services run
by the classes from Grades 4 to 7, that have been held this term.  Working with
Rev. Beel, the classes plan and lead Junior School Chapel each Wednesday
morning, on a selected theme.  I have been delighted with the response from the
children and I look forward to the remaining services for the rest of the
term.<p>
<p>
Last weekend provided two important activities.  Firstly, the Primary School's
State Athletic Championships.  I extend congratulations to Cappi Lonnquist,
David McIntosh, Marc Llewellyn, Craig Hembrow and Nathan Keilar, for all
competing in this prestigious event.  Although no placings were gained, each
pupil was a fine ambassador for themselves and their school.  Secondly, the
long awaited S.E.A.T. Visual Arts Exhibition finally arrived, where ten pieces
of artwork from each primary level of each school, were selected to form a
non-competitive exhibition.  The final product was simply outstanding.  Much of
the credit lies with Mr. Ross Keefer, Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:bmillican@somerset.qld.edu.au">Brenda Millican</A> and Mrs. Kathy
Pedersen who all put in many extra hours in preparing for this exhibition.  I
extend thanks to all parents, families and staff who supported this exhibition
which looks certain to become an annual event focusing on the  importance of
the Visual Arts.<p>
<p>
The Junior School Public Speaking Competition was conducted last Thursday
evening.  Again,  I was impressed with the confidence and quality of the
speeches offered and all speakers are to be congratulated on their efforts.
Special thanks to Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:ewheeler@somerset.qld.edu.au">Eileen Wheeler</A> for her hard work in organising the
evening.  Results can be located elsewhere in this newsletter.<p>
<p>
I would like to encourage all families to consult the school calendar as to
upcoming events and note these against the family calendar, to ensure, as the
busiest time of the year approaches, that unnecessary clashes are avoided.
Thank you.<p>

Next Thursday the school gathers for one of its very significant calendar
events - the Valedictory Service on the last day  before the Senior Class
commence their final examinations.<p>
<p>
The morning will commence with a service of Holy Communion at 8 am in the Small
Chapel. The invitation is extended to the school community, especially Seniors
and their families, to join this special occasion.<p>
<p>
<u>Differences</u><p>
Much comment is being made at the moment about Australian attitudes to its
indigenous citizens and to those who have more recently arrived.  I am reminded
of a recent School Chapel conducted by students from Andrews House who
highlighted the importance of recognising and celebrating our differences.  We
need to become the best that we can be rather than a second-best imitation of
someone else and to remember that our various individual differences complement
those of others.  St Paul wrote of a body needing a variety of members - eyes,
hands, feet and ears to be a complete body.<p>
<p>
Somerset provides for all members of its community the opportunity to
recognise, value and celebrate those things that make us individuals.<p>

<b></b>This week, the Red Cross Mobile Blood Bank made its annual
visit to Somerset and I would like to thank all staff and especially the
students, who gave blood.  For a lot of the students, it was their first time
and they needed to overcome their fears about needles, pain, blood etc.  I am
sure that most would agree that it wasn't as bad as they expected and hopefully
they will all line up again next time.  This is a very important community
service and needs lots of support, so thanks again and well done.<p>

<b></b>Last Thursday 17th October, the Annual Somerset Junior
School Public Speaking Competition was held.  Once we had forgotten our nerves,
the evening became exciting, interesting and humorous, with everyone giving
their best effort to present the winning speech.<p>
<p>
The winners in each category were:<p>
Year 5 - Andrew Copperwaite and Blair McDonald<p>
Year 6 - Alicia Blake<p>
Year 7 - Allison Weiss and Mei-lin Robertson<p>
<p>
Thank you to the following Year 12 students:  Kylie Cohen, Khushpal Bansi,
Annaleise Grummitt and Margaret Opitz who gave up their time to adjudicate.  As
excellent Public Speakers themselves they were able to pass on valuable tips to
us to improve our speeches and gave us lots of positive feedback.<p>
<p>
Also a big thankyou to Mr. Mason and Miss Michel who adjudicated and Mrs.
Wheeler for organising a great evening.<p>

<b></b>It was my privilege to listen to an Indian lady doctor on
Wednesday night at a World Vision sponsored dinner at Palm Meadows Golf Club.
Dr. Rhada Paul has been working for over 35 years fighting injustice and
poverty.  She has worked on U.N. International Committees and has been invited
by the U.S. Government to research women's and family issues.<p>
<p>
Some of the statistics she gave give one an idea of the great magnitude of
problems facing India today.  With a present population of over 920 million,
the country's population by this time next year will increase by the size of
Australia's present population.  That means another fifteen million!  By the
year 2000, there will be more than one billion people in that country.  There
are 272 million illiterate, and of these, 172 million are women.  186 million
have no access to safe water, and 646 million have inadequate sanitation
facilities.  Over 55 million children (under 15 years of age) are involved in
child labour.  Each year, 147,000 women die in childbirth.<p>
<p>
There is great disparity in the treatment of girl children as against boys.
Girl children are not breast fed as long as boys and are given inferior food.
They are taught that they are inferior to boys and they not only work in the
house but also outside, tending the crops, feeding the animals or weeding the
crops.  They are paid half the male rate.  They are the ones who have to fetch
water for the household, often walking many kilometres to fill their jars.  Pay
is around one third of a rupee per hour (30 rupees = $1).  Education is for the
boys.<p>
<p>
Through the work of World Vision, literacy classes have meant that thousands of
girls (and boys) have been able to find good jobs, and many enter professions.
(World Vision supports 951,000 children!)<p>
<p>
I spoke to Dr. Rhada Paul afterwards and was pleased to be able to say that
Somerset Freedom Fighters raised over $3,000 this year to help needy
children.<p>
<p>
Our last two Chapel Services have been led by Year 6  students after much
careful planning by Mrs. Wheeler and Mrs. Cook.  Parents would have been so
proud to have seen their children on the platform, leading the service with
readings, prayers, playlets, songs and instrumental items.  Parents - you are
always welcome to attend any of our Chapel Services and see these fine
presentations for yourselves.<p>
<p>
May God bless you all,<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="15">A FEW CULTURAL NOTES</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b>Cultural Awards Night</b><p>
This festival and celebration of performance always looms heavily at the
beginning of Term 4.  While the program is essentially a performance of
previously presented pieces they still have to be rehearsed to performance
standard ... and in some cases completely rehearsed!<p>
<p>
Having said that, the impossible is always accomplished in two weeks and we are
left with the memories of a magnificent cultural extravaganza.  A quick perusal
of the program reflects the diversity and calibre of the night's
entertainment.<p>
<p>
Each performance was a highlight.  One of the features of the night is that
there are no `competition constraints'.  There was the passion, energy and
delight of performing the work.  A different dimension to the night's program
was the inclusion of a `Blind Chess Championship'.  This was fascinating,
entertaining and awesome.<p>
<p>
Having viewed most of the performance from backstage the most salient feature
of the night was the enormous unity of spirit that was reflected in both the
performance work and the organisation.  Each group helped to prepare their
set/props/instruments, then strike their gear after their excerpt and
contribute to the next performance group's organisational requirements.<p>
<p>
A night of true ensemble spirit from everybody involved with the performance.<p>
<p>
<b>WESTPAC International Master Musicians Series</b><p>
The final concert of the 1996 Series will be a show by the Queensland
Conservatorium of Music Opera School.  They will be presenting `The Wonderful
World of Music Theatre'.  The last concert of the series is always a highlight.
The night consists of singing and staging well known songs from a variety of
musicals and operas.  More information on the exact program will be subsequent
newsletters.  The concert is on Saturday, 9th November.<p>
<p>
<b>Somerset Dance Concert</b><p>
The annual Dance Concert is on Saturday 23rd November.  Mrs. Louise
Schriek, the school's Dance instructor, has been working with the dancers all
year.  They Dance Concert is an opportunity for the performers to display their
skills.  This is another night of great entertainment.<p>
<p>
<b>Use of the Performing Arts Centre</b><p>
Apart from the extensive internal use of the Performing Arts Centre
(PAC), the facility is also in great demand by other organisations.  At the end
of Term 3 both the Mudgeeraba Special School and the Robina State School
performed their musicals in our PAC.  Next week Hillcrest Christian College
will be performing a musical in the PAC.  Over the Christmas break the PAC will
be used extensively by Dance Companies for their Christmas Concerts.<p>
<p>
Our Performing Arts Centre is an invaluable complex for our internal use and it
also makes a positive contribution to the local community.<p>

Last weekend many members of the Junior School Chorale performed in the
Youth in Performing Arts Festival at the Gold Coast Arts Centre.   We really
enjoyed forming part of a massed choir at the closing ceremony and I would
really like to thank the parents who came out for the afternoon and helped us
enjoy the festivities.<p>

<b></b>Last Wednesday, the Year 11 Starkey House students held a
very successful Fashion Parade to raise funds towards a sail cover for the
courtyard at school and a donation to `Rosies'.  Fashions were provided by
Jeans West, Cue, Headworx, Canterbury, Cadillac Cowboy, Byrning Spears, Anthony
Leigh Dower, Phone a Formal, Just Jeans and Guess and the Starkey students did
a great job modelling their gear on the catwalk.  The organizers would like to
take this opportunity to thank the suppliers for their assistance with the
parade.<p>
<p>
Two Lucky Door Prizes in the form of "Dinner for Two" at The Imperial Palace
and The Orchid Palace were very kindly donated by Mrs. Jenny Wong.  Many
thanks.  <p>

<b><cite><A NAME="18">FIRST ELEVEN'S FABULOUS FEAT</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>The 1st XI Girls' Hockey Team made it through the HDSA
competition with flying colours and has now reached the semi finals for the
State-wide Telstra Cup competition.  The team has remained undefeated for the
entire year, a record similar to that of the renowned Australian Hockeyroos.
Although all of the Telstra Cup games have proved extremely difficult, we've
managed to pull through thanks to the dedicated support, coaching and
enthusiasm of Mrs. Crowley and Miss Fitzgerald.  Luke Kownacki has also done a
fantastic job in umpiring all our games for us.<p>
<p>
Miss Fitzgerald's and Mrs. Crowley's oranges, cakes, lunches, McDonalds visits
and delicious morning teas have kept us all very well fed for our matches.
We're currently undergoing an intensive training program leading up to our next
clash, with Toowoomba.  Our team's motto has clearly emerged, due to our very
successful linking up as a team, "A starry team is always better than a team of
stars."<p>
<p>
So far in the State-wide competition we've defeated St. Hilda's 3-0, Emmanuel
College 10-0, Palm Beach Currumbin 2-1, Ipswich Grammar 5-0 and the reigning
champions from last year, Brisbane State High 3-1.  Our team will be contesting
the semi-finals and finals of the Telstra Cup on the 26th and 27th of October,
respectively.  At 12.30p.m. on the Saturday, we will come against St. Saviour's
College from Toowoomba, which boasts two international players (but remember
that champion players don't make up a champion team!)  Our other rivals over
the challenging weekend will include Maryborough SHS and Cairns SHS.  The
constant support of keen Somerset supporters on the sidelines of our matches
has vastly boosted our performances, so please come along and cheer us on.<p>

<b></b><u>Congratulations</u><p>
Firstly, a very big congratulations to Katherine Day in 9 Franklin.  Recently
Katherine travelled to Brisbane to audition for the 1997 National Children's
Wind Orchestra of Australia.  On Wednesday evening, Katherine found out that
she was successful in that audition and has been selected to play bassoon with
the orchestra.  Katherine is a very talented young pupil who performs well
academically, on the sporting field and in the musical arena.  In January she
will travel to Sydney (the Hawkesbury River to be exact) to participate in the
national camp with this group.  The Australian Winds have already established
an enviable international tradition and reputation for excellence in the
performance of wind music.  The group was first formed in 1994 and in 1996 did
an overseas tour to the United States.  Katherine's selection in this group is
recognition of the dedication, talent and hard work that both she and her
teacher, Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:arowe@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anne Rowe</A>, have put into her bassoon studies.  Congratulations to
both of them for such a fine achievement.<p>
<p>
<u>Queensland Festival of Music</u><p>
The Queensland Festival of Music (Q.F.M.) is still continuing for the students
at Somerset College.  As this report is being written the concert band are
busily readying themselves for the finals of the competition.<p>
<p>
On Monday evening the Concert Band travelled to Brisbane to compete in the
heats of concert band competition in which last year they moved on to the
finals.  They once again proved successful in the heats and were selected to
move into the finals.  The adjudicators were extremely impressed with their
performance with comments regarding choice of material, musicianship, phrasing,
rhythmic awareness, dynamics - expression all being placed in the very good
category.  The adjudicators wrote "You are a very good band with some very good
musicians within the group".  The band received a superior rating and, despite
a slight hiccup with programming, as mentioned earlier they were selected to
move on into the finals.  We wish them every success in the finals and
hopefully will have some great news for next week's newsletter.  Thanks must go
to Mrs. Rowe for her work with the group and also to Mr. Graham-Wilson and Mr.
Jackson who accompanied the group on Monday night.<p>
<p>
On Wednesday night the Senior Strings ventured for their first foray into
Q.F.M.  They performed extremely well and unfortunately due to the lateness of
the evening the group could not stay to hear the results.  They are waiting
patiently for them to be posted out to them.  More news on that next week.
Thanks must go to Miss. Pradella for her work with this group and also to Mr.
Singh for availing himself in Brisbane to help with the group.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately due to a number of students having various conflicting
commitments J.S.O 1 was not able to compete in Q.F.M. on Saturday.  The
students had put in lots of work and would have played very well.  Thanks must
go to Miss. Hurst for her efforts in preparing the group.<p>
<p>
<u>Youth in Performing Arts</u><p>
<u></u>On Sunday, October 20, the Youth in Performing Arts Festival was held at
The Centre, Bundall Rd., Bundall.  The festival was a celebration of the
creative abilities of our youth.  Several of the school's ensembles and
performance groups performed on that day and their performances were a credit
to the school and themselves.<p>
<p>
The groups that performed were Vojazz, Show Choir, Senior Dance Troupe,
Clarinet Ensemble, Saxophone Ensemble and Junior Chorale.  Thanks must go to
Miss. Lanham with the Junior Chorale, Mr. Graham-Wilson with the Clarinet and
Saxophone ensembles and all the students involved in the afternoon's
performances for all their hard work in putting the programmes together for
these performances.<p>
<p>
<u>Concert, Clowns and Quartets under the Stars</u><p>
<u></u>Sunday, October 20, was a very busy day for some members of the
College's performance groups.  Members of the Saxophone ensemble, Clarinet
Ensemble, Vojazz and the Show Choir after performing at the Y.I.P.A. Festival
then performed at the above named function at Paradise Springs Golf Course,
Robina.  Students from Somerset provided music for those families who attended
the new concept by Paradise Springs.  Although the weather turned cool and the
audience was a little on the small side the students performed well and were a
credit to the college.  Thanks to Mr. Graham-Wilson for his work with the
clarinet and saxophone ensemble and to all the students involved in the
evenings performances for all their hard work in putting the programmes
together for the performance and giving up their time to do so.  <p>
<p>
<u>Battle of the Bands</u><p>
<u></u>On Saturday, October 19, three bands competed in the South East
Queensland Battle of the Bands conducted by Trinity Lutheran College at the
Tropicarnival Park, Bundall.  The prize pool associated with this competition
was approx. $12,000 with prizes ranging from recording time to guitars.  <p>
<p>
The bands competed very well and some won prizes.  Unfortunately the official
result sheets have not been sent to the school but should arrive very soon and
next week's newsletter will carry a comprehensive list of results.  Well done
to all members of the bands.<p>
<p>
<u>Cultural Awards Evening</u><p>
As many parents would be aware the cultural awards evening took place last

areas.  Awards presented on the evening included Music, Drama, Performing Arts,
Public Speaking, Debating and Chess.  The recipients in Music, Drama and
Performing Arts are listed below.  As with all the events associated with the
performing arts, there is a massive amount of teamwork involved in the actual
performance and also the preparation of all the groups who performed.  All the
music department ensembles, orchestras, bands and choirs performed on the
evening involving hundreds of students.  Thanks must go to the staff and
students for the involvement in the concert and to the parents for supporting
the event.  To those staff involved in the direction and preparation of the
various groups for the performance a verge large thank-you, to Mrs. <A HREF="mailto:arowe@somerset.qld.edu.au">Anne Rowe</A>,

<b><cite><A NAME="22">SENIOR CRICKET</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b>Junior XI vs All Saints</b><p>
Somerset winning the toss elected to field.  We knew All Saints were not
going to be easy to beat, posting a total of 5/129.  Our successful bowlers
were Ryan Criddle 2/19, Doyle Roberts 1/8 and Matthew Hicks 1/9.<p>
<p>
Somerset went out blazing, reaching 50 runs in the 9th over but after a middle
order collapse, we fell 6 runs short of victory, 8/124.  Our leading run
scorers were James Brown 38, Simon Dorrington 31 and Regan Coventry 15 n.o.<p>
<p>
Both Somerset and All Saints played good cricket.  It was our first loss of the
season and hopefully, our last.<p>
<b>Matthew Hicks (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>Intermediate XI vs All Saints</b><p>
Last Thursday we played All Saints on their home ground.  They elected
to bat and made 100 runs exactly after being 3 for 4 in the third over.  For a
30 over game this was a good score.  Our bowlers bowled consistently.  Wicket
takers were Adam Daniels 2, Jason Short 1, Russell Tainton 1, Ronald Nicholls 1
and Michael Turner 1.  <p>
<p>
Our opening batsmen David Haynes and Craig Leggett helped our team off to a
good start.  Everyone had a bat this week and it was unfortunate that we lost 6
for just 12 runs.  Batsmen who reached double figures were Craig Leggett 11,
Luke Boman 34 and Russell Tainton 10.<p>
<b>Luke Boman (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>1st XI vs Trinity</b><p>
Trinity all out for 61 in the 24th over.  A. Tiplady (5-17-10), B.
Hudson (2-1-12), M. Exelby (2-19-7) and A. Humphris (1-21-5).  Somerset 1 for
64 after 18 and M. Van Tuinen 43 n.o.<p>
<p>
In effect this game has already been won by Somerset on the first innings.
There will be a full report on the completed match in next week's newsletter.<p>

<b></b>Last Thursday, Friday and Saturday, six Somerset students
competed at ANZ Stadium in the State Track and Field Championships.  The
athletes were Rebecca Scantlebury Yr. 8L  (1500m, 800m, 400m), Sally Cooper Yr.
10L (discus), Adam Harrington Yr. 12V (shot put, discus), Sarah Tandy Yr. 10V
(triple jump), Brooke Pailthorpe Yr. 9L (3000m, 1500m) and Robert Clements Yr.
8F (Hurdles). <p>
<p>
The standard of competition was extremely high and many State records were
broken on the track and in the field.  Our athletes performed to their highest
ability, achieving personal best results and placing in the Top 10 in the State
for their events.  The level of sportsmanship, dedication, determination and
spirit displayed by these athletes was truly outstanding.  Congratulations to
these athletes who have achieved the highest standard in Track and Field at
Somerset College for 1996.<p>
<p>
The conclusion of this event brings the very busy Track and Field season to a
close.  We have had a successful season and there have been many outstanding
performances.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Captains Fiona
Rayner and Adam Harrington for their effort and support.  I would also like to
acknowledge the dedication and commitment of those athletes who I have had the
pleasure of working with as part of the Development Program.  This year you
have learnt the importance of committing yourself to a training regime and as a
result you have developed the skills of self-discipline and self-motivation.
Strength in these areas will help you improve on your performances next year
and in the future.\par<b><A HREF="mailto:kdobbie@somerset.qld.edu.au">Karen Dobbie</A> </b><p>

<b></b>Don't forget to book for the Somerset Stampede, Saturday
26th October.  At $12 for food and entertainment it can't be beaten for value,
so come along and have a fun night - the last function for 1996.<p>
<p>
Ladies, the Melbourne Cup Lunch is filling fast.  This will be the last flyer
this week.  The Auxiliary has put in a lot of work to make this a wonderful
day.  The P. &amp; F. congratulate the outgoing Auxiliary Committee of Sharon
Hunter, Jenny Blyth, Kerry Watts, Mary Warren, Susie Goldstein and Denise
Benjamin for their initiative in resurrecting the Auxiliary.  Their meetings
average an attendance of 60 parents.  <p>
<p>
I hope that our Open Meeting on 11th November will have the same response - we
are offering chicken and champagne to entice you along.<p>

<b></b>Graham Hyman's very humorous address on the pressures
facing today's teenagers and their families, at Wednesday's meeting of the
Parents' Auxiliary, was a perfect ending to a very successful 1996 for the
Auxiliary.  Some of the 60 people in attendance literally had tears rolling
down their cheeks.  But humour aside, Graham had some very valuable advice and
suggestions to offer.<p>
<p>
Congratulations to the newly elected Committee for 1997, comprising Diann
Eadeh, Fiona Spencer, Susie Goldstein, Carol Burow, Jacki Hendy and Karen
Ramsay.  Their enthusiasm and motivation will ensure the Parents' Auxiliary
will continue on from strength to strength.  Congratulations also to the ladies
who have taken on some of the 1997 Class Co-ordinator positions - Roz Neville
(Preschool), Linda Radford (Year 1), Sarie Robbie (Year 2), Di Eadeh and Julie
Hasenkam (Years 4 and 5), Sandra Tomlinson (Year 6), Jeanene Duus (Years 9 and
11) and Jan Doherty (Year 12).  The positions of Class Co-ordinators for Years
3, 7, 8 and 10 are yet  to be filled, so please contact any of the Committee
members if you'd like to take part.<p>
<p>
Although Wednesday's meeting was the final official "Koala House" meeting for
1996, we still have the Melbourne Cup lunch to take place on Tuesday, 5th
November.  Response so far has been astounding, so if you haven't yet ordered
your tickets please do so next week before tickets are sold out.  See the flier
enclosed.<p>
<p>
The 1996 Committee would like to thank <A HREF="mailto:gmason@somerset.qld.edu.au">Guy Mason</A> and his secretary, Julie
Wirth, for their support and assistance, together with Christine Wiltshire for
ensuring our fliers and notices regularly appear in the newsletters.  Many
thanks also to Michelle McQuay and the P. &amp; F. for their continued support
and liaison, and most importantly, thank you to all the parents who attended
each of the Auxiliary's functions giving support, valuable suggestions and
positive feedback.  Thanks also to the many parents and businesses, in
particular Robina Golf Club, Woodchoppers Inn Mudgeeraba and Paradise Springs
Golf Course, for the wonderful prizes donated for raffles.<p>
<p>
Finally, we'd like to acknowledge the great contribution of the 1996 Class
Co-ordinators who, through their well organised morning teas and lunches,
brought together many parents in a social atmosphere and promoted the
Auxiliary's functions.<p>
<p>
See you at the Melbourne Cup lunch!<p>

<b></b>This week has been extremely hectic around the Junior
School (when isn't it?).<p>
<p>
The Year 4 students have headed off on camp and reports to date indicate great
things are happening in a wonderful outdoor environment.  I look forward to
hearing the reports on Year 4s' return.<p>
<p>
On Thursday, 12 students attended a "Day of Excellence", joining with other
independent schools on the Gold Coast, extending as far as Beenleigh.  The
students involved were Ellia McIntyre (3R), Jyette Ryden (6W), Halina Alexander
(5C), Bradley Foster (5C), Harry Bristow (6W), Lisa Hamilton (3R), Ryan Sara
(5J), James Holz (5J), Matthew Cary (2M), Michael Worcester (3W), Annabelle
Stephenson (3W), and Andrew Copperwaite (5J).  Activities included Language,
Puppetry, Creative Writing, Tennis, Chess, Lego Technics, Theatre, Lego,
Mathematical Investigations and Poetry.  I congratulate these students on their
achievements and trust they had a valuable day.<p>
<p>
On Thursday evening, the Public Speaking Competition was held.  At the time of
writing results were not known, however, I congratulate all students who
competed during the evening.<p>
<p>
The Internet is alive and well in the Junior School and it is exciting to hear
of international contacts and pen pals that have been established recently.
Updates can be found through the school's own home page and I look forward to
seeing the results of children talking to children, thousands of kilometres
apart.<p>
<p>
I especially encourage those with access to the net, to surf through Junior
School's class home pages which are of an exceptional standard and provide a
great insight into what's happening in these classes at the moment.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="6">LOWER PRIMARY BEACHATHON</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>On the second last Friday of last term, 250 children in
Preschool, Years 1, 2 and 3 enjoyed a wonderful introduction to Spring by
participating in our annual Beachathon.  The children, accompanied by 150
parents, grandparents and friends trekked 5km along Burleigh Beach.  Gwen and
John Fischer from the Spit Roast Company provided us with a wonderful picnic
lunch after the walk.  The day provided a great opportunity for children to
enjoy the beach and sunshine and for parents to mix and meet other parents.
Close to $5,000 was raised in sponsorship, which is an outstanding achievement.
The winning class was Year 3R where 30 children raised a grand total of $900 in
sponsorship.  What a mighty effort!  All these funds are used to purchase
resources for the Lower Primary classes.  <p>
<p>
Thank you to all children and their sponsors for their outstanding support.<p>

There has been a fair bit of activity through the past student (alumni) page,
some past students now living in Greece have had a very interesting time, so
much so that I have set up a separate page for them.  A few past students have

<b></b>Learning how to make full use of our newly connected email
function has been an exciting feature of our daily preschool routine.<p>
<p>
Gerard Taylor, one of the preschoolers, has shown particular interest in this
activity and he has taken on the role of `opening the email' each morning.<p>
<p>
What a wonderful surprise on Tuesday morning when we opened email and received
a message from Julia Medland's Grandpa who lives in the USA and teaches organic
science at Marshall University, West Virginia.  After lots of discuss and
negotiation, we sent Mr. Persinger a reply ... we now look anxiously at the
screen each morning - will we receive a reply?<p>
<p>
<i>Email from Mr. Persinger</i><p>
<i>Good Day to Ms. Copperwaite's class from the United States.  It will be a
pleasure to send and get email from you.  I will expect Gerard Taylor to show
everyone how to operate the computer with a little help from your teacher.
Julia and her friend Christina might well get to tell me, Julia's Grandfather,
Happy Birthday because today, October 14, is my birthday.  I was born in 1918.
Can you count to see just how old I am?  I will look forward to your reply !!!
Harry Persinger, Marshall University, Huntington, West Virginia, USA.</i><p>
<p>
<i>Reply </i><p>
<i>Dear Julia's Grandfather.  We were very excited to receive your letter !!!!!
All the way from the US of A.  We talked about where you live and then how old
you were on October 14th.  To find out your age we wrote a long list of all the
years from 1918 to 1996.  Then, we counted each of the years and we discovered
that you turned 78 ... Happy Birthday to you from Julia and all her preschool
friends at Somerset College.  We hope that you write back to us soon.  Julia
has a special message for you, "Hello Grandpa, I love you."  Goodbye for now.

<b></b>Justifiable public outrage followed the report of the 6
year old boy in Cairns having been doused in petrol and set alight.  Our
prayers are certainly with him and the medical team whose task it is to restore
his little body to a measure of good health.   But let us remember also the
many unnamed children who daily suffer physical and emotional harm from adults.
In most cases children are abused by either close relatives or trusted friends.
Their injuries are also horrific and almost always permanent in effect.  Whilst
we all ask how anyone could possible harm a defenceless and innocent child, the
fact is that there are people out there who can and do perpetrate such acts.
Lifeline (13114) is one source of helpful advice if you suspect that a child
you know is being abused in any way.  The Queensland Centre of Prevention of
Child Abuse (QCPCA) operates a centre with information and resource materials
(print and video) on child abuse prevention.  These are available for loan or
sale to interested persons, groups or organisations.  Contact The Manger QCPCA,
Box 806, Brisbane 4001 or telephone (07) 32247588.<p>
<p>
One of the most beautiful word-pictures in the Bible is the one drawn by Mark
in Chapter 10.  There he describes a scene where children are being held in
Jesus' arms and blessed.  Jesus went on to assure the adults standing around
that unless they became "like little children" they would have no chance of
entering God's kingdom.  Jesus used children as models for adults to emulate.
Consider children in terms of openness, receptivity and willingness to forgive.
<p>
<p>
Last week at Junior School Chapel we saw the beautiful qualities of children
demonstrated in the presentation of the service which emphasized the need to
love all people.  One example given was the life of a Christian minister, John
Flynn, whose vision was to provide outback Australia with a mantle of safety.
This vision led to the birth of The Royal Flying Doctor Service, which over the
years has been the means of saving thousands of lives.  Grade 7H spent many
hours preparing for this service made up of prayers, readings, dramatisation,
songs and a video segment.  Thank you boys and girls and also Mr. Halloran for
his meticulous planning and patient rehearsing.<p>

<b></b>Graeme Cuthbert learnt this week that he has been awarded
first place in the Year 11 State-wide Modern History Competition.  Graeme's
entry, which involved his development of an hypothesis of his own, dealt with
Stalin's control of the USSR in the 1930's.  Besides the honour of topping the
State, Graeme's effort will earn him $100.<p>
<p>
Graeme is joined by Leanne Hammond, who took out 3rd place in the State in the
same competition.  Leanne also developed her own hypothesis, which compared the
success of Stalin's regime with that of the USSR in the post Stalinist period.
Leanne will enjoy her reward of $35.<p>
<p>
Esa Valttila entered the Year 12 Modern History Competition and his study of
the Vietnam War gained him a Highly Commended mention from the State
organisers.<p>
<p>
Strong entries were also made by Sharon Malecki from Year 8; Adam Brown, Shune
Toyoike and Brooke Cowper of Year 9; Justin Richards from Year 10 and Hayden
Richards from Year 11.<p>

As we draw the second week of Term 4 to a close it seems for some of us
that the holidays were many months past and the next holidays seem forever
away.  We always think that it could never become busier but there always seems
to be one more event that is placed into the calender.  Events that have
occurred in the past week and those about to occur in the near future are as
follows:-<p>
<p>
<u>Queensland Festival of Music</u><p>
As mentioned in last weeks newsletter the Queensland Festival of Music (Q.F.M.)
is one of the most prestigious music competitions held in the country.  The
festival is sponsored by the Australian Academy of Music and is designed to be
a festival with the aspect of competition really being second place to the
opportunity for young people to perform music and to hear others perform music
as well.  Almost all schools in the southern part of the State are represented
in this competition.  <p>
<p>
Last Tuesday, the Show Choir competed in the vocal ensemble section.  This
section is for groups of 16 or less voices.  Groups competing varied in size
from quartets through to the full complement of 16 members.  The competition
requires a programme of not more than 12 minutes and no more than three pieces.
The show choir's performance included works from the Renaissance through to
jazz arrangements in the style made popular by Manhatten Transfer.  Although
the group was unplaced in the competition they were awarded a highly commended
which is a very rare occurrence in this competition.  The adjudicators were
impressed by the overall standard of all of the competitors and said they had
difficulty separating the top four choirs, of which Somerset was one.  Comments
by the adjudicators included "A very difficult program, and your attention to
the material is obvious throughout", "Warm sound, refined and restrained",
"SATB very good", "Men do well", and "Diligent rehearsal obvious".  All of the
students in the group have worked very hard for this competition and their
commitment to the group must be commended.  Thanks must go to Mrs. Marie
Nicholson who travelled to Brisbane to accompany the group.<p>
<p>
Other performances to come in the Q.F.M. include the concert band, J.S.O. 1 and
the Senior Strings.  As listed in the dates last week, the Concert Band are off
next Monday, October 21, to the Sleeman Complex to do battle in the band
section.  Last year saw the band reach the finals and they hope to repeat the
performance this year and perhaps gain a place that they only just missed out
on last year.  The Senior Strings are off on Wednesday, October 23, to Harker
Hall at Somerville House to contest the Senior String Orchestra section.  This
is the first time in this competition for our Senior Strings so it will be
interesting to see how they go.  J.S.O. 1 will be travelling to the same venue
on Saturday, October 19 to participate in the Junior String section of the
competition.  Last year this group won the B grade section of this competition
and this year are competing in the A grade where they are hoping to do just as
well.<p>
<p>
I'm sure that all join in wishing these groups, along with their conductors,
the Concert Band with Mrs. Rowe, the Senior Strings with Miss. Pradella and
J.S.O. 1 with Miss. Hurst the best of luck in their appropriate sections.<p>
<p>
<u>Cultural Awards Evening</u><p>
The Cultural Awards Evening is to take place this Saturday evening at 7.00 p.m.
in the Performing Arts Theatre.  This evening is a showcase of the efforts and
talents of our young men and women in the music and drama areas.  Awards
presented on the evening include Music, Drama, Performing Arts, Public
Speaking, Debating and Chess.  All are welcome to the evening as it is one of
the best opportunities for parents to see the results of all those hours your
students seem to spend at the school.<p>
<p>
The Music Department groups performing on the evening are as follows:-  Concert
Band, Chamber Orchestra, Senior Strings, Show Choir, Jazz Band, Saxophone
Ensemble, Clarinet Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, Boys' Choir, Girls' Choir,

<b><u></u></b><p>
<u>Youth in Performing Arts</u><p>
<u></u>On Sunday, October 20, the Youth in Performing Arts Festival will be
held at The Centre, Bundall Rd., Bundall.  This festival is a celebration of
the creative abilities of our youth.  Several of the school's ensembles and
performance groups are displaying their wares that day and their performance

evening starts at 7.00 p.m. and finishes at 8.30 p.m.  The groups that will be
performing are:- the Clarinet Ensemble, the Saxophone Ensemble, Vojazz and Show
Choir.  Thanks to Mr. Graham-Wilson and his ensembles for this performance.<p>
<p>
<u>Tropicarnival Winners' Concert</u><p>
<u></u>On Monday night, the Vocal Group performed at the Tropicarnival Winners'
Concert.  This was done at very short notice which required the students to
confirm their availabilty on Monday and then sing Monday night.  The evening's
concert featured winners of various sections of the recent Tropicarnival
Eisteddfod.  Considering the shortness of notices and the fact the students had
not sung the repertoire since August, their performance at the concert was
outstanding.  A very big thank-you must go to those student's and also to these
students' parents who would have had to make various alterations to family
movements for that night.  The eisteddfod committee were very grateful for the
effort that these students made and effusive in their praise of the
performance.<p>
<p>
<u>Battle of the Bands</u><p>
<u></u>On Saturday, October 19, three bands whose students are based at the
school will be competing in the South East Queensland Battle of the Bands being
held at Trinity Luthern College.  The prize pool associated with this competion
is approx. $12,000 with prizes ranging from recording time to guitars.  <p>
<p>
The bands competing are:-<p>
Manafold 	leader - Peter Rose<p>
Spud Gun 	leader - Dale Hembrow<p>
We're only in it for the	leader - Ben Edwin <p>

<b>Rugby Golf Day - Friday 22nd November. </b> Each year Somerset
Rugby conducts a Rugby Golf Day at Paradise Spring to raise funds for the
conduct of Rugby at Somerset College.  Parents, students and friends enjoy a
great afternoon of golf and social togetherness.<p>
<p>
Some of the funds raised will be set aside to make up a "SOMERSET RUGBY' tie to
be available for 1997.  A rugby tie tells a story and is a great link for
Somerset rugby and the school itself into the wider community.<p>
<p>
I would like to encourage families to look forward to this event and plan to
have a parent/child combination play.  In the past a number of these groups
participated in the 4.00p.m. 9 hole Ambrose event, stayed on at the club to
enjoy dinner and try their luck with golf and lucky prizes.<p>
<p>
To make the event a success we need your support both as players and if
possible hole sponsors.  Please refer to the flyer in this newsletter.<p>

<b>Junior XI </b><p>
We played Emmanuel on their home ground.  Losing the toss, we were sent
in to bat.  A few good partnerships helped us to a total of 7/110 off 26 overs.
Good scores were produced by James Brown 36, Simon Dorrington 24 n.o. and
Matthew Hicks 21.  Our bowlers put in a good effort to contain Emmanuel's total
of 6/85 after 26 overs.  Wickets were taken by James Brown 1/0, Simon
Dorrington 1/2, Doyle Roberts 1/3, Dominic Poon 1/3 and Matthew Hicks 1/9.  We
still remain undefeated, but we have to work on our catching and fielding
skills.<p>
<b>Matthew Hicks (Captain)</b><p>
<p>
<b>1st XI vs All Saints</b><p>
Somerset batted first and were in trouble at 4 for 56 when Tim Pearson
came to the wicket.  While Tim was a little rusty at first, not having played
for over a year, (his first nine scoring shorts were singles) his timing and
confidence improved during his innings.  At the fall of the last wicket he was
64 not out (one 6 and six 4's).  Tim's score helped the team to reach a
respectable total of 191 all out.  His partnership of 64 with Michael Exelby
(26) was a turning point in the game.  Other batsmen to make significant
contributions were Matthew Van Tuinen 26, Ian Smith 21 and Sam Petersen 17.<p>
<p>
Tim also made a significant contribution in the field taking two stumpings off
Andrew Tiplady's bowling.  Andrew was the main wicket taker with 4 for 43 off
10.  Other wicket takers were Adam Humphris (2-10-8), Ben Hudson (2-10-2)  and
Wes Keys (1-10-5).  Adam Daniels stood out in the field with some good diving
stops.  All Saints were dismissed for 96 runs creating the biggest winning
margin we have achieved against them in eight years of competition.<p>
<p>
Congratulations to Ian Smith and Matthew Van Tuinen who were members  of the
South Coast Regional Team which won the State Carnival in Cairns earlier this
week.  Their best performances both came in the first match against
Metropolitan East.  Ian took 4 for 32 off 11, bowing off spin.  Matthew scored
33 batting at number 6.  These performances helped their team to achieve the
first ever outright victory in a State Open Carnival.<p>
<p>
Congratulations also to Luke Boman, Adam Daniels, Matthew Hicks and Jason Short
who have all been selected to play for Gold Coast representative teams in their
respective age groups.<p>
<p>
This Sunday the 1st XI travel to Warwick to play Scots College hoping to
reverse the result from our match against them earlier in the year when we were
soundly defeated at home.<p>

<b></b>As reported previously Sara Carrigan won 4 State road
cycling titles last August (and followed that with a silver medal at the
Australian Titles).  Last weekend Sara added to her tally when she competed at
the State Mountain Bike Titles.  A fellow CATS club member offered Sara a ride
on his spare bike and Sara, with no competitive experience with this type of
riding, had 2 weeks to get the hang of it.  After a few falls, close encounters
with trees, etc, Sara fronted up at the races and proceeded to win everything
she rode in, though not with the ease this may imply as many of her opposition
were experienced MTB riders. Sara won the uphill, the X-country and the dreaded
downhill as well.  Seven State titles in 2 months.<p>
<p>
Also on the competition scene, Jay Kownacki gained a 3rd in the highly
competitive under 19 section of the Regional Criterium Championships last
Sunday - this after a late, late night at the Year 12 Formal on Friday night!<p>
<p>
As a consequence of some good showings at the State schools finals in
Townsville several of our riders have had their talent recognised and the QCA
has approached them with offers of a VIP membership to the QCA, to help and
encourage them with their racing. To date Olivia Stuckey, Jacinta Hyman, Tom
Cooper and Cameron Bray have been contacted.  Well done, and perhaps there are
more to come.<p>

<i>These things happen.  We all know that the White Fangs were just devasted at

a sturggle.  We got out there ready to go for gold.  Well the game started and
we were here, there ,everywhere!  And we were going back and forth.  We were
just going crazy.  Anyway Holly was just skidding across the court.  Layup
after layup.  And Lauren went flying through the air.  With a bit of defence
here and a bit of dribbling there.  The rest of the team was always there.  By
the end of the game we were all pooped!  With Most Valuable Player going to

<b>Honour for a Somerset Pupil</b><p>
Simone Donoghue has been selected to act as a junior ambassador
for Children's Week 1996.  Altogether three junior ambassadors have been chosen
to represent the Youth of Queensland during the 25th anniversary of Children's
Week.<p>
<p>
For Simone the role will involve a number of speaking engagements.  The first
will be at the opening where she will be onstage with the Brisbane Lord Mayor
and the Minister for Community Service, Mr. Lingard.  She will also speak to an
Ecumenical Service at St. Mary's Church, South Brisbane.  Simone's appointment
follows on from a number of high achievements which have included winning The
John Franklin Memorial Trust Award, achieving the highest mark in Australia for
her division of Trinity College, London public speaking exams and the Most
Improved Junior Disabled Athlete in Queensland.<p>
<p>
I know that I speak for all in congratulating Simone on a remarkable year of
achievement.<p>
<p>
<b>End of Year Functions</b><p>
This weekend will see the first of a number of functions designed to
recognise the achievements of pupils of the school in all aspects of school
life.<p>
<p>
On Saturday evening we will recognise those who have achieved in Music, Drama
and a wide range of co-curricular, cultural activities at <u>Cultural Awards
Night</u>.    This takes the form of a series of events and performances in a
concert in the school's Performing Arts Centre.<p>
<p>
The next event of this kind is the <u>Sports Awards Dinner</u> to be held in
The Great Hall on November 15th.  We will also have the privilege of an address
of some of Australia's successful 1996 Olympians.  <p>
<p>
Finally, outstanding academic achievements and effort will be acknowledged on
<u>Scholars' Day</u> Saturday November 30th.  This is the final event for
pupils for the school year and it is a compulsory event for all.  The various
award ceremonies during the day will also feature performances by school music
groups.  It has also become an established feature of the day that the Houses
will host school families to afternoon tea and House Awards during the break
before the final ceremony.<p>
<p>
<b>History Awards</b><p>
I am delighted to announce that Graeme Cuthbert of Year 11 was awarded
first place in the State in the Queensland Modern History Competition.  Leanne
Hammond, Year 11, took out a Third place in the competition and Esa Valttila of
Year 12 achieved a Highly  Commended Award.  Well done to all concerned.<p>
<p>
<b>Senior Girls' Hockey</b><p>
In a little over a week's time our Senior Girls' Hockey Team will be
participating in the State Finals of the Telstra Hockey Competition.  This is a
wonderful achievement for these young people.  I am sure that they deserve and
would really appreciate support from everyone who can be at the State Hockey
Centre at Colmslie in Brisbane to cheer them on.  Mrs. Crowley has provided
full details of their match elsewhere in this newsletter.<p>
<p>
<b>Somerset Stampede</b><p>
The Parents and Friends Association's "Somerset Stampede" is shaping up
as a very interesting event.  This is a relatively inexpensive and informal
night which promises to be a lot of fun.  It is very much an end of year
function and I look forward to seeing you there.<p>
<p>
<b>Pupil Free Day -  Monday 21st October</b><p>
On Monday many teachers from schools all over the State will be engaged
in finalizing Board of Senior Secondary School Studies data for matriculating
pupils.  The disruption to regular school timetables is so extensive that
normal classes are discontinued and pupils are given the day off.  Teachers not
engaged in the process will be involved in inservice training.<p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><p>
<u>School Captain Recognised by Bond University</u><p>
<u></u>I am delighted to report that one of the School Captains, Kiah Wood, has
been awarded a prestigious Vice Chancellor's Scholarship at Bond University.
Kiah will be enrolled in the Law Faculty and plans to complete a double degree
in Law and Arts.  Indeed by the end of this year, Kiah expects not only to
matriculate, but also complete the first year of her Arts degree.  This has
been made possible through Kiah's involvement in the school's Open Learning
Program co-ordinated by Monash University.  Altogether these achievements
represent a quite remarkable and very well earned acknowledgment of Kiah's
talent and effort.  I am sure that the whole school joins with me in
congratulating Kiah.<p>
<p>
<u>Drugs in Schools</u><p>
<u></u>On Monday I returned to school to find the Gold Coast Bulletin
announcing in enormous headlines, that a new drug called fantasy was in the
region's schools and was being widely sold to school pupils.  The following day
a small, rather apologetic page 4 story headed "Schools free from Fantasy"
corrected this information.<p>
<p>
Although those involved with the drug in the incident reported were long past
being school pupils the story was linked to schools in a "knee jerk" fashion.
Perhaps this is not so remarkable since the Gold Coast will soon host visits by
hordes of school leavers celebrating completion of 12 years of primary and
secondary education.<p>
<p>
It is clear that our society has a problem with drugs and most of us are
alarmed and frightened of the impact that this problem might have on us and our
families.  Schools cannot and do not remain isolated from such problems and
serious drug education and personal development programs have an important
place in all schools.  Somerset is no exception and the Chaplain has outlined
aspects of our approach in his section of the newsletter.<p>
<p>
Somerset in particular takes a very firm line in relation to the distribution
of any drugs in any quantity, regardless how small.  In short, anyone who
provides drugs for any other party at any time will be asked to leave the
school immediately.  This is a policy which has applied at the school
continuously for the 14 years of the school's operation.  More importantly the
school's education programs seek to arm the pupils with accurate information
about the consequences and nature of drug abuse.  The program aims to put them
in a position to be able to exercise good judgement in avoiding being drawn
into the drug culture.<p>
<p>
Equally importantly, the school's programs seek to develop strength of
character and independence through a range of intellectual and physical
challenges to be mastered on the sports field, in the classroom, on the stage
and in the outdoor education program.<p>
<p>
<u>Congratulations and Well Done</u><p>
<u></u>Hayley Tarr and Simon Lu have been successful in a competition which
involved Export Challenge, Language and Cultures.  Their project involved
promoting a Queensland export product and they chose Queensland seafood.  They
will be presented with their award in a ceremony at the Sheraton Hotel in
Brisbane on October 18th.<p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the newsletter Mrs. Smith has acknowledged all of the award
winners in the National Chemistry Quiz.  Once again we have done very well but
special congratulations go to Mark Haron in Year 7 who receives a Plaque of
Excellence for answering all questions correctly.<p>
<p>
Congratulations also to our cycling representatives who travelled all the way
to Townsville by bus to compete in the State Titles.  They alighted from the
bus on Saturday morning and went on to compete the same day.  They did very
well indeed and a full report appears in this newsletter.<p>
<p>
Finally, congratulations to our fabulous equestrians who had more than their
share of heartbreak in the lead-up to the State Titles but went on to put in a
great team performance and placed third.  Outstanding effort.<p>
<p>
<u>The Sports Development Program - Mr. Newell</u><p>
<u></u>For many years the school has had pupils competing at the highest levels
of State and National, and on occasions, International level.  Very often this
level of sporting involvement puts strains on the time and focus these young
people can bring to bear on their very important academic studies.  I have
invited Mr. Newell to act as co-ordinator of the Sports Development Program in
the school.  His job, which will report to the Director of Sport, will be to
ensure that our talented young sportsmen and women are able to also excel in
their academic work.<p>

<b></b>All parents appreciate the improvements to the college,
from the front parking area to playing fields and others less obvious, enjoyed
by their child within the college, that were achieved by "philanthropy".<p>
<p>
The Headmaster, <A HREF="mailto:barnison@somerset.qld.edu.au">Barry Arnison</A>, and staff invite all parents to inspect the
college any time including those special open days such as Founders' Day and
Grandparents' Day.  Take the time for your child to show you around the college
to appreciate the hard earned benefits and facilities that large and small
contributions have provided for all students.  Achievement at Somerset College
is a continuous effort by students, staff and families to provide the best in
the name of "philanthropy".<p>
<p>
Our Development Officer, <A HREF="mailto:ggardiner@somerset.qld.edu.au">Graeme Gardiner</A>, expounds the virtue of "philanthropy"
to the improvement of facilities enjoyed by all students at Somerset College.
<i>"It is a love of mankind, especially as manifested in deeds of practical
beneficence" </i>and involves honesty, betterment, purpose, joy (to create)
loyalty and kindness.  Your expression of "giving" to any of these ideals can
create a beneficial environment for all children at Somerset.<p>
<p>
To those families who support the 2000 Club, P &amp; F and the Giving Appeal I
thank you for your continued support!  To those who have yet to support we look
forward to any contribution.  <i>You may give what you can </i>which will be
thankfully received and faithfully applied.<p>

<b></b>Recently I was pleased to receive from a Somerset parent an
article from a church magazine.  Whilst the statistics quoted were relevant to
America, the main thrust of the address was concerning family life,  Barbara
Bush wife of former U.S. President, George Bush, is quoted as saying, "Your
success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens at
the White House, but on what happens inside your house."  The article goes on
to list four things on the part of parents which, if followed, would turn our
societies around in terms of their moral values.<p>
<p>
Let parents and children:<p>
i)	teach and learn goodness together.  Respect for all peoples, respect for
each other and a consistent expression of love for each other by the parents;<p>
ii)	work together.  Children to work with parents in tasks around the house,
cleaning, gardening, cooking (as sample jobs);<p>
iii)	read good books together.  Children love their parents reading to them.
It excites their imagination - whereas by watching T.V. it is all done for
them.  Select books and language of quality where true values are extolled;<p>
iv)	pray together.  This is not hard.  How wonderful for family members to give
thanks to God for all his blessings, and to pray for those in need.<p>
<p>
I recommend the entire article which I'll pass on to any who request it.<p>
<p>
This week the Rev. Ian McAlister of the Mudgeeraba Anglican Church is planning
a course of Confirmation for young people and this will be freely available to
all.  A promise made by the parents at the baptism of a baby is that he/she
will be brought to the Bishop to be confirmed by him when they are of age to
take upon themselves the promises made on their behalf.  Here is an opportunity
to honour that promise.  Enquires - without obligation - are welcome, either to
me or to Rev. McAlister (55306774).<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="6">CAIRNS ALTERNATE WEEK</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>Students who remained at Somerset for this year's Cairns
exchange experienced a week filled with fun and educational activities not
normally on offer.  A great deal of planning and help from members of the
school community ensured that it was a memorable week for all concerned.  The
ground staff put in a tireless effort to ensure that all equipment was ready at
appropriate times and venues were opened when needed.  The week could not have
functioned as smoothly without them.  Colin Fry and Sue Armstrong made sure the
food was there on time and I would like to thank them for their help also.<p>
<p>
The visiting guests were many and varied and all were enjoyed enormously.  Each
guest made sure the activities were age appropriate and most importantly,
fun.\par <p>
Below are student reports on the events that took place during the week.  I
know it is hard to work through a list of thankyous, so I will just say a
special thanks to everyone who gave so generously of their time during that
week to make it the success it was.<p>
<b>Kim Jones</b><p>

<p>
<u>RAAF Police Dogs</u><p>
<u></u>During the alternative week we did many activities.  One of them was
going to see the RAAF Police Dogs.  There were two dogs, each with a trainer.
Shane was the trainer of Digger and Greg was the trainer of Harvey.  They did a
series of obstacle courses which had rings of fire, tunnels, wooden planks and
jumps.  They also showed how the dog would protect their trainer by attacking
any criminals who were threatening him or other people.  Afterwards we were
lucky enough to pat the dogs and ask questions about them.  <i>Robert Kingston
(6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Mr. Richard Kownacki of K.T.'s Hairdressing</u><p>
<u></u>While some of the Year 6 and 7 students were in Cairns, many activities
were provided for the remaining students.  One of these activities was
hairdressing.  Mr. Kownacki (A. J's Dad) informed us about how he styles hair
for advertisements.  Also, he created unusual hairstyles for Ben Cooper, Nigel
Tarr and myself from Group 1.  Many hairstyles were accomplished in other
groups.  Thank you Mr. Kownacki for visiting our school and informing us about
hair.  I would like to thank Mrs. Jones for co-ordinating this enjoyable week.
<i>Rebecca Tandy (6W)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Film Education at Movie World</u><p>
<u></u>The last day of Term 3 was a fun filled day with lots of action and
excitement for the 6's and 7's who didn't go to Cairns.  We travelled to Movie
World by bus and arrived there and had a special V.I.P. tour.  When the tour
finished we were allowed to go on rides and saw the Police Academy Stunt Show.
Right after the show it rained which of course was not very pleasant.  We left
Movie World in time for the end of school term.  <i>Stephen Sugden (6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Drama with Mrs. Green</u><p>
<u></u>In the last week of Term 3, as many of our classmates eagerly awaited
their trip to Cairns, the kids staying behind were looking forward to a
fun-filled week of activities, one of these activities being Drama with Mrs.
Green.  We had so much fun playing Drama games such as Space Jump, Wink Murder
and Groups etc.  However, we were finding it very difficult making it through
the numbers game we played.  I think everyone will agree we had a great time in
our Drama lesson with Mrs. Green.  <i>Sarah Bremner  (7M)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Science and Technology with Mr. Murray</u><p>
<u></u>During the last week of Term 3, many of Somerset's Year 6 and 7 students
travelled to Cairns.  While those students were in Cairns the remaining
students had a week filled with activities.  One of these activities was
Science and Technology with Mr. Murray from the Senior school.  The students,
in different groups,  went up to the Science and Technology room to listen to
Mr. Murray.  After hearing amazing facts about Science and Technology we saw a
robot cut a cake!  Many people thought it would be a robot with a face, but it
wasn't.  It was an arm with a knife taped to the end.  We also saw a machine
that made plaques.  You could have anything engraved.  It was a very enjoyable
visit (so was the cake!!).  <i>Holly Whitcroft (6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Adopt a Cop</u><p>
<u></u>On Thursday the 19th we were lucky enough to have a sergeant come in and
talk to us about being an "adopt a cop".  The sergeant showed us his
bulletproof vest and let us sit in the police car.  He also handed out
breathalyser tubes.  After a brief talk he showed us how the speed gun worked.
He then set up a net and we each got a turn at throwing a cricket ball against
it while he checked how fast it was travelling with the speed gun.   This
turned into a competition and Peter Randell won the boys while Rebecca Todd won
the girls final.  It was all a lot of fun.  <i>Jytte Ryden</i><p>
<p>
<u>Yo Yo Demonstration with Skytes, Marina Mirage</u><p>
<u></u>Three weeks ago in the Cairns Alternative Week, the Year 6 and 7
students who didn't go to Cairns were fortunate enough to have some
professional yo yo demonstrators perform their tricks.  They also showed us how
to do their tricks.  They ended with a competition which Stephen Sugden won.  I
was very successful with the yo yo which they were demonstrating called The
Brain and they probably sold about sixty just to Year 6s and 7s.    <i>Nigel
Tarr</i><p>
<p>
<u>Hoopster Basketball Clinic</u><p>
<u></u>All the Year 6 and 7 students participated in lots of activities during
the last week of Term 3.  The basketball clinic was one of them and Rollers
team members taught us some of the skills of basketball.  Of course they
started us off with a bang, I mean a bit of a run around the court.  Passing
the ball around our head, waist and knees was not what you call easy but with
the help of the players it was "a piece of cake".  We did heaps of warm-ups and
the competitions were difficult to win but we tried our hardest and by the end
of the session we were puffed.  Learning the skills of basketball was pretty
hard but we made it and now all we have to do is practise.  <i>Kara Blyth
(6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Art with Mr. Keefer</u><p>
<u></u>On the last week of Term 3 the people who didn't go to Cairns had a week
of activities.  One of the activities was Art with Mr. Keefer where we made
magnets out of clay.  Mr. Keefer gave each table a block of clay.  When
everybody had finished their design they were then taken away to be glazed
ready to have the magnets stuck on the back of them.  <i>Leigh Appel (6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Computers with Mrs. Cook</u><p>
<u></u>Recently the people not going to TAS were involved in an alternative
program which included various fun activities.  One of these activities was
computer time with Mrs. Cook when we went to the computer room and were able to
access many programs such as the Internet and Spectre Challenger.  One of the
more popular games was called Sim City which allowed you to build your own city
including fire stations, police stations, transport services and a sports
stadium.  You then had to deal with problems such as monsters, tornadoes, fires
and earthquakes.  Another option was to try to fix an existing city such as San
Francisco with a rising crime rate.  The computers were great fun and I hope to
play Sim City again.  Re<i>becca Roylance  (6C)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Looks and Model Management with Robert Veitch</u><p>
<u></u>In the TAS alternate week the students who stayed behind had a special
talk with Mr. Robert Veitch about Model Management.  He informed us about the
different agencies and different jobs you can get with them.  He also talked to
us about interviews for jobs - what the interviewer is looking for and how to
present yourself.  Overall I think the students enjoyed Mr. Veitch's talk very
much.  <i>Simone Fagan (7S)</i><p>
<p>
<u>Kids in the Kitchen with Chef Hermann Schafellner from Walter's
Restaurant, Robina Woods Golf Club</u><p>
<u></u>On Monday the 16th of September the Year 6s and 7s not going to Cairns
were looking forward to a fun week of activities organised by Mrs. Jones.  One
of these activities was Kids in the Kitchen with Chef Hermann from Walter's
Restaurant.  He helped us make Caesar and Greek salads and they were delicious.
I would definitely recommend Walter's Restaurant for a superb meal.  <i>Richard
Laufer  (7S)</i><p>
<p>
<b><cite><A NAME="7">@ Camp</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>The "A team" challenged the twin peaks of Mt. May and Mt.
Barney on their three day expedition during the Year 10 camp.  Day 1 was a
steep "winge" (climb) straight up the ridge to the lesser peak of May.  Two
hours later, after a steep descent into the saddle and an eye widening, long
rock scramble upwards we were atop the "big" peak, only to see those of Barney
higher and farther away.  An uneasy descent to the road ended in disappointment
for Chris who slipped over and badly bruised his shin on a sharp rock. A mobile
phonecall brought rampaging <A HREF="mailto:rjackson@somerset.qld.edu.au">Ray Jackson</A> and his trustee troopie to the
rescue.<p>
<p>
The rest of us continued to Barney Gorge campsite to find not the deserted
calmness of secluded bush, but an adolescent city of eighteen Churchie boys.
We acquired a good campsite sufficiently separate from this throng.  We
conspired an early start the next day to beat "them" to "rum jungle", high in
the saddle between East and West Peaks of Barney.  Scott and Tom went on ahead
to secure our position as the rest of the group maintained a more sane pace up
the long extent of Barney Gorge.  The older and larger Churchie Boys soon
passed us but arrived well behind our forward scouts who effectively defended
our campsite much to the chagrin of our competitors.<p>
<p>
After a rest some of us scrambled to the top of East Peak, the best views.
Captain Logan who travelled from Brisbane in 1857 and was the first to climb
Mt. Barney was less edified by the view having thought that this was Mt.
Warning, only to see its peak far in the distance.  A rest back at camp and
three of us braved the wilder ascent of West Peak, the more exposed excursions
causing the adrenalin to flow as the potential for painful gravitational
embarrassment loomed.<p>
<p>
The final morning found us camped literally in a cloud which blew away as we
departed down "Peasants Ridge" to the road.  On arrival I produced 2 kg of
mixed sweets - they lasted 10.3 seconds.  Thanks to Chris, Tom, Scott, Bernie,
Pat, Justin, Jason, Brendan, Robert, Justin, James and Nathan for making the
year 10 camp a holiday for me.<p>

<b></b><u>Fantasy</u><p>
<u></u>Prior to last weekend the use of the word fantasy would have been to
describe something unreal and fictitious.  Now, of course, we have seen those
pictures of very real young people whose lives were at serious risk because of
the use of a drug known by the name `fantasy'.  We were probably shocked too by
the newspaper headlines in Tuesday's paper, <i>IT'S IN OUR SCHOOLS.  Fantasy
drug sold to kids.  </i>While the headlines over-sensationalise the incident,
it nevertheless highlights a serious concern of parents and of all who deal
responsibly with young people.<p>
<p>
There is no need for a quick knee-jerk reaction at Somerset!  The Personal
Development Program provides an awareness of issues of their personal health
and safety for primary students.  This is continued through the secondary
years.  Students are encouraged to discuss issues such as this on the basis of
factual information against a background of care and concern for themselves,
others and their world, as taught and demonstrated by Jesus.  Ultimately
students will make their own decisions and choose for themselves.  Our task in
the school and at home is to provide an environment exemplifying and
encouraging responsible decision-making so that their choices can be made using
the best of available information and with a keen sense of responsibility, not
only for ourselves, but for each other.<p>
<p>
There is need, however, one thing that we must do, we (parents and the school)
must strive to maintain a relationship with our young people that is open,
supportive, encouraging and forgiving.  <p>

<b><cite><A NAME="11">@ Perisher</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
Only 17 lucky Somersetians came along on the ski trip to Perisher where the two
metre snow base has now turned to two and a half.  We stayed at the Matterhorn
Lodge, snow right up to the door.  By the end of Monday everyone had got the
hang of it and significantly reduced their instances of vertical misalignment.
We had relatively warm and fine weather except for Thursday afternoon when the
snow came copiously in large flakes.  By 11p.m. the full moon was out in a
cloudless sky, the breeze was mild and there was a new cover of 20 cm of proper
powder snow, the kind that skis glide invisibly through with just the faintest
hint of friction.  Of course I went for a midnight ski on the cross country
trails:first tracks by moonlight, wonderful!   All of us were out bright and
early for the best half day skiing I've had for years, alas only half a day:for
this was Friday, the day to start the dreaded 21 hour bus trip back to horrid,
hot, snowless Queensland.  <p>
<p>
Thanks to Sara, Cristal (most improved), Tara, Rebecca, Kiosha, Laura,
Stephanie, Emma the Karaokette, Lauren and her neck brace, Will, Justin (party
animal), Andrew, Ashley,  Matthew, Royston and father Mr. Pryor for making this
a wonderful trip -  someone had to be responsible so I'm glad it was you guys!
We all owe a special thanks to Mr. Cooper for his hard work organising the trip
despite the fact tha he didn't end up going.<p>

<u>Queensland Festival of Music</u><p>
The Queensland Festival of Music (Q.F.M.) is one of the most prestigious music
competitions.  Almost all schools in the southern part of the state are
represented in this competition.  This year, the concert band, the show choir
and the senior strings are competing.  As listed in the dates above, the Show
Choir is competing next Tuesday and we wish them the best of luck.  Last year,
they were placed second in this competition and are hoping to go one better
this year.  The Concert Band and the Senior Strings are off the following week
to do their battle.  This is the first time for our Senior Strings so it will
be interesting to see how they go.  The Concert Band, last year, reached the
finals and hopes to again find it necessary this year to make a second trip to
play in the finals and perhaps place.  They just missed on placing last year.<p>
<p>
<u>Cultural Awards Evening - Saturday, 19th October</u><p>
The cultural awards evening is a major highlight within the Performing Arts
year.  This evening allows the college to showcase the efforts and talents of
our young men and women in the music and drama areas.  The evening commences at
7.00 p.m. and all are welcome.  Come along and see the fruits of all those
hours of work the students have been giving and the results of all that
travelling to and from the college that parents have been involved in.<p>
<p>
<u>Congratulations</u><p>
Congratulations to the members of Vojazz, Kiah Wood, Belinda Flindell, John
Nicholson and Tim Pearson, who during the holidays, performed successfully in
an audition to pick themselves up a fairly lucrative contract for the Christmas
holidays.  Who knows, the college may soon be receiving postcards from overseas
from these four.<p>

During the last week of Term Three, the whole of Year Five went to Camp
Goodenough at Carool.  We enjoyed activities including "high-ropes" which were
25 metres above the ground, "low-ropes" which included a 75 metre flying-fox
and abseiling over a 13 metre cliff.  <p>
<p>
We stayed in two cabins, one for the boys and one for the girls.  The food was
really nice and we were given a piece of fruit to take to each activity.  The
camp was situated in beautiful rainforest which grows on rich, red, volcanic
soil.  We all liked the camp motto which is, "Take nothing but photographs and
leave nothing but footprints".  We would also like to thank Mrs. Harrison
(Ashley's Mum) for accompanying us on our camp.<p>

<b>Gold Coast Arts Centre and Gold Coast City Council Chambers,
Bundall Rd., Bundall. </b><p>
<b>Sunday 20 October from 10.00a.m. to 4.45p.m.</b><p>
The Youth In Performing Arts Festival (YIPA) is a joint venture between
the Gold Coast City Council, Tropicarnival and the South Coast region of the
Department of Education to be run in conjunction with Tropicarnival's "Picnic
in the Park" on Sunday 20 October 1996.<p>

mass schools choir of approximately 600 students performing on the
Tropicarnival's main stage to close YIPA and to open the Tropicarnival final
concert.<p>
<p>
Not only will you be able to perform for family and friends and see many other
school bands, choirs and plays, but there will be lots of food to eat, the
circus to visit, lots of stalls, buskers and other entertainment and a beach

<b><cite><A NAME="16">ANANSE STORIES  - Sam Derchie</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b></b>On Tuesday, 22nd October, Years 1 - 6 will be attending the
Queensland Arts Council performance, Ananse Stories, in the Performing Arts
Centre.<p>
<p>
This is a rare opportunity to see first hand, a performance by one of the many
groups which comprise the complex mix of contemporary Australian society.  In
Ananse Stories, Sam Derchie offers a collection of his own Ashanti stories, and
for many students, this will be their first encounter with such traditions and
lifestyles.<p>
<p>
Sam introduces himself - `I'm an Australian, but I was born in Ghana, Africa.'
With stories from his people, the Ashanti of Central Ghana, and dressed in
traditional costume, Sam charms audiences with stories of Ananse, the spider
figure found in many African folktales.  Student audiences will respond
enthusiastically to the musical chants and rhythms of the talking-drum, African
xylophone and kabassa which are part of this vibrant storytelling experience.<p>
<p>
Sam is both a musician and storyteller.  He has played piano and talking-drum
from the age of six and studies African literature in Ghana.  Sam has been an
Australian resident since 1982 and in that time has developed his musical
career and his storytelling skills.<p>
<p>
Costs of $3 per child or $8 for a family of 3 or more will be debited to the
supplementary account.<p>

<b>Scuba Camp</b><p>
"Welcome to paradise."  When we stepped off the barge on that hectic
Saturday morning I'm sure none of us would have expected the following 5 days
of sun, snorkelling and relaxation.  <p>
<p>
Due to unforseen bad weather and health conditions, only half of the
anticipated scuba diving took place.  The time on Moreton was not wasted
though, many of us braved the unbearably cold waters and snorkelled around the
five rusting shipwrecks.  Some of the boys found the wrecks perfect to fish
from, while others found the tropical atmosphere ideal for sunbathing.<p>
<p>
Moreton Island is home to numerous sand dunes about the magnitude of tiny
mountains.  They proved to be a challenging climb to the top but well worth it
when zooming down on esky lids.  The highlights were cosy nights around our
miniature fires, listening to David Austin play his guitar and Mr. Murray's
trapeze acts.<p>
<p>
A big thankyou must go to our adventurous guardians Mr. Murray and Mr. Newell,
not to mention Megan, Mr. Newell's fiancee.  They helped to make the camp fun
and memorable.  Scuba Camp was arguably the best we'd ever been on.<p>
<b>Letizia Chilcott &amp; Jacky Bruce</b><p>
<p>
<b>Community Service</b><p>
During the Year 11 Outdoor Education Camp a few students chose to do
community service.  I know that you think that seems like a lame excuse not to
do camp, but I found it a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.<p>
<p>
Activities undertaken during the week ranged from Lifeline and the RSPCA to
helping at a local swim school.  The swim school was a lot of fun as I could
really see the joy in the kids faces.  Activities included helping with stroke
technique, the mini squad and of course, the adorable babies.  I really urge
the Year 10s to take this up next year as it is a very rewarding experience.
Not only will you feel that you have achieved something at the end, but you
might also have a little idea of what career path you might follow in the
future.  Like me, give it a go!<p>

<b>2nd XI</b><p>
When the Second XI arrived at Firth Park on the 19th of September, no
one (not even the players) knew what to think.  A quick review of the situation
revealed that actually we did have 12 players (4 more than expected) and, after
I met the new arrivals, we set about forming an order.  After losing the toss
and electing to take the only remaining option, the 2nds took the field.  It
looked promising with the opening bowlers Simon Harris and Jared Kerr, taking a
devastating 5 - 35 and an economical 1 - 10 respectively off their 6 overs.
Three more wickets fell for only 4 more runs and at 9 - 49, the boys from All
Saints looked like they were in trouble.  A dropped catch from the usually safe
hands of the Captain and a shocking bowling performance of 0 - 11 off 2 from
the very same however saw the boys from across the highway reach a respectable
(and hard to beat) 92 runs off 19 overs.<p>
<p>
The fact that the opposition was a team of bowlers didn't help the blue and
green's cause and only two Somerset batsmen made it into double figures.  They
were opener Simon Harris (19) and unknown quantity Craig Leggett (15 n.o.).
Other good batting performances came from Jared Kerr (7), Peter Griffiths (3),
Craig Whittington (4), Chris Jones (7), Chris Young (6) and a superb Captain's
knock by yours truly who hit his first ball straight to the man at silly point,
who took the easiest of catches.  One All Saints bowler managed to take 3 - 2
on the unpredictable Firth Park wicket, another 3 - 4.  Somerset limped from
the field with 78 runs off 19 overs, left to dwell on what could have been.<p>
<p>
N.B. In a joint team decision, the Captain has been dropped and at the time of
writing, his successor was yet to be named.<p>
<b>Nicholas Smythe (Captain, I think)</b><p>
<p>
<b>1st XI</b><p>
Somerset 191 all out against All Saints (Tim Pearson 64 n.o., Matthew
Van Tuinen 26, Michael Exelby 26, Ian Smith 21 and Sam Petersen 17).  There
will be a full report in next week's newsletter following the completion of the
match.<p>
<p>
Congratulations to Ian Smith and Matthew Van Tuinen on their selection in the
South Coast Open Team to play in the State Secondary Schools Carnival in Cairns
from Saturday, October 12th to Tuesday, October 15th.  Ian performed well in
last year's carnival and will be hoping for more success this year.  Matthew
becomes only the third Somerset student to represent the South Coast Region in
cricket.  We wish them both good luck and hope that they have the opportunity
to demonstrate the ability they have displayed in matches for the school's 1st
XI.<p>

<b><u>National Archery Champion</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>The Junior School salutes Porsha Marais (Year 5).  Porsha
competed in the World Field Archery Championships held at Darrington,
Washington USA in August.  Some 900 top shooters were present from USA, Europe,
South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  Shooting a personal best, Porsha
placed 1st in the Cub Freestyle Limited category resulting in an overall first
in the Girl Cubs U13.  She now holds the title until 1998.  What an outstanding
achievement for one so young with the 2000 Olympics on the horizon.  Porsha is
certainly going to be looking at her training and goals over the next few
years.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Congratulations</u></b><p>
<b><u></u>Hockey:</b> Adam Balanda (Yr. 6) was honoured to receive both the
Highest Goal Scorer and Best and Fairest Trophies for the U12 Boys Hockey Team
at Southport In Line Hockey Club.  Adam scored 81 goals this season which is an
outstanding result for any young player in one season.  <p>
<p>
Timothy Little (Yr. 6) was awarded Most Improved Player for his hockey team at
his Saturday club.  Congratulations to both boys who have also performed very
well for Somerset this year.<p>
<p>
<b>Ice Hockey:</b> Alfie Phillips (Yr. 4) will attend the State Ice Hockey
Championships this week as a South Coast player.  Alfie is a very talented
skater and was selected early last term to compete in a sport that very few of
his peers have had the chance to experience.  When Alfie returns next week he
will be giving us a full report on this exciting event.  Go for Gold Alfie!!<p>
<p>
<b><u>Trinity Anglican School Cairns v Somerset College Gold Coast</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>This was a very exciting and rewarding trip for all Year 6 and 7
students who travelled to Cairns in the last week of Term 3.  Somerset competed
against TAS in both sporting and cultural events throughout the week and
students were also given the opportunity to snorkel in the beautiful blue
waters of the Barrier Reef and tour the Mountain Village of Kuranda.  The week
was extremely busy for all students and their teachers as we not only strived
to achieve points for the shield but also developed some very close friendships
with our hosts and other students and staff of the TAS community.  This was the
seventh exchange between our schools and Trinity has, this year, won the
Triniset Shield for the first time.  Somerset students applauded TAS and we
look forward to the challenge of bringing the shield back to Somerset's trophy
cabinet next year.<p>
<p>
Somerset's overall results for the week were:<p>
Newcombe Ball - win<p>
Girls Hockey - loss<p>
Boys Hockey - loss<p>
Mixed Hockey - loss<p>
Girls Touch - loss<p>
Boys Touch - win<p>

<p>
Resulting in Somerset 10 - TAS 11 for shield points.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Swimming</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>It is that time of year when our beautiful summer days lend
themselves to a dip in the pool or swim at the beach.  Having a strong swimming
stroke reduces the dangers of drowning and other water related accidents.  I
would encourage all our children to develop their swimming ability and maybe
even consider taking swimming as a sport to enhance their fitness.<p>
<p>
The Somerset Junior Swimming Squad begins next week at the Mudgeeraba Pool and
we encourage children from Years 3 - 7 to join us from 7.00 to 8.15a.m. each
Wednesday morning.  Coaches from Laurie Lawrence Swim School will assist us in
running a Beginners / Intermediate Squad session.  Years 1 - 3 are already
involved in a school program but Year 3's may like to start in this squad in
preparation for their possible involvement in the school swimming team next
year as Year 4s.  <p>
<p>
<u>Junior Swimming Squad</u><p>
<u></u>Day - Wednesday<p>

<b></b>Rounds 1 and 2 of our S.E.A.T. competitions have been
without too many problems and this has been due to the very fine efforts of our
students to play and behave in such a way that both their coaches and other
staff have commented on their sportsmanship qualities, both on and off the
field.  I am still keen to hear from a new more parents who could help out on
Fridays or Wednesday training sessions as we are now participating with more
teams than in past seasons and often need your help, either in the area of
supervisor or referee.  This does not mean every week - whenever you can spare
the time would be appreciated.<p>

<b></b>On the first weekend of the holidays the dressage, combined
training and showjumping teams travelled to Toowoomba to compete in the Inter
High School State Championships.<p>
<p>
The combined training is the major event and one the Somerset team has
dominated for many years.  This year, despite tragedy, very wet conditions and
tough competition, the A Team placed an extremely commendable Third place.  The
individual placings were as follows: <p>
.  Aynsley Wylie (Prodigy) 4th<p>
.  Shiree Todd (Twiggy) 5th<p>
.  Stefanie Williams (Stylish Drifter) 5th<p>
<p>
Jacinda Kontoleon rode very well considering she and Ausden Radiant don't
usually showjump and the course was particularly demanding.<p>
<p>
The dressage team consisting of Shiree Todd, Aynsley Wylie, Jacinda Kontoleon
and Vikkie Keene competed in the individual dressage competition.  All
competitors rode very well and were in the high placings.<p>
<p>
The showjumping team rode in an extremely tough competition on the Sunday.  The
grounds were very muddy and slippery due to torrential rain.  This fact did not
however affect the course builder, who built very large and technical jumps.
Sarah Neal rode well in the Junior classes.  Aynsley, Shiree and Stefanie all
rode successfully in the senior classes.  <p>
<p>
All members of the equestrian team felt cohesion at this competition which has
not been experienced to this degree before.  A special thank you to Mr. Barker
for his tireless efforts throughout the year.<p>

<b><i>Dear Parents, Staff and Students,</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><u>The Final Term for 1996</u><p>
<u></u>How quickly this year seems to have passed.  The Spring holidays begin
today and school resumes on Monday, October 7th.<p>
<p>
For the year 12s Term 4 is a particularly short and busy time.  Their final
exams will commence on Monday November the 4th and their Valedictory Dinner
will be held on Friday, November 15th.<p>
<p>
For all pupils of the school the last day of term is Saturday, November 30th
and permission is rarely given for pupils to leave school before Scholars
Day.<p>
<p>
Another date to mark on your calendar is Carols in the Quad set down for the
evening of Thursday, November 21st.<p>
<p>
<u>Building and Construction</u><p>
<u></u>During the term break construction of additional carparking and
roadworks in the front carpark will be carried out.  These works were
identified by traffic engineering consultants as ways to improve the flow of
cars in the pupil pick-up area.<p>
<p>
The Koala house carpark will also be sealed and all students with permission to
drive to school will be required to park their cars in this area.<p>
<p>
We also hope that the final work on the shelters will be completed.  This work
has taken a long time but it is a relief to know that the shelters will be in
place for the sun and rain we can expect in summer.<p>
<p>
<u>Congratulations and Well Done</u><p>
<u></u>A special word of recognition needs to go to our remarkable Girls Open
Hockey Team.  Last Friday they defeated last year's State champions, Brisbane
State High School, in their Metway Cup match.  This is splendid and well earned
victory for these very dedicated young women.<p>
<p>
They must now be rated a very good prospect for the final.  However, whatever
the outcome beyond this point they should know that we are very proud of them
indeed.  On behalf of the school I extend our best wishes to them for the
remaining matches in this competition.<p>
<p>
Congratulations also to Lisa Boman and Justin Richards who have been awarded
scholarships for a study tour to Germany.  Lisa and Justin will leave Australia
on the 2nd of December and will be away for 6 weeks.  Congratulations also to
Jessica Scantlebury who will be living in Germany for a year as a Rotary
Exchange Student.  Mrs. Boman has written a full report elsewhere in the
newsletter.<p>
<p>
I am also pleased to announce that Ben Brodrick and Adam Johnson, both in Year
11, have had their artwork selected to be displayed in the Energies Exhibition
at the Gold Coast Art Gallery from the 19th of September to the 19th of
October.<p>
<p>
Finally I learnt only today that Hayley Tarr and Simon Lu, Year 10 students,
have been awarded second prize in the "Export Challenge" competition sponsored
by the International Business Week.  The prize will be presented at an
International Business Week seminar to be held at the Brisbane Sheraton Hotel
on Thursday, September 17th.<p>
<p>
<u>National Council of Independent Schools of Australia Conference</u><p>
<u></u>For the next four days the Chairman of the School Council and I will be
attending the National Council's biennial conference.  Topics to be addressed
include governance and enterprise in schools, strategic planning, management of
legal matters relating to schools and financial management in Australia's
independent schools.<p>
<p>
The National Council represents the broadest cross section of independent
schools in all States in Australia.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="4">NOTE FROM THE DEAN OF STUDIES</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b><cite></cite></b>Somerset College adopts the policy of retaining student
work which has been assessed.  This work is kept by individual subject teachers
and each student has a folder for each subject that he or she undertakes at
school in a particular year.<p>
<p>
These folders help subject teachers to chart the progress of students across a
subject in a year and are often used in parent - teacher interviews.  At
revision time, before Semester 1 and 2 exams, folders are returned to students
(if necessity demands it) for revision and use i<u>n class only</u>.  <p>
<p>
If parents wish to see items of student work, they only have to write a note to
the relevant subject teacher and a photocopy of the assessed work will be sent
home with the student.<p>

at 8.10a.m. on the first day of Term 4.  Have a pleasant break!<p>
<p>
<b>Summer Uniform</b><p>
<b></b>A reminder that summer uniform is worn in Term 4.  Boys in Years 8 to 12
go back to shorts and long socks.  We have a good supply of shorts in all sizes
at this stage so please be ready for the warmer months.<p>
<p>
<b>Payment of Accounts</b><p>
<b></b>Outstanding accounts at the Shop are escalating!  Please be sure to
settle your account with us before the end of term.  There will be no further
credit facility in Term 4 for Year 12 students.   All purchases will need to be
paid for at the time of sale.  We would appreciate your co-operation in
relation to this matter.<p>

<b>Graduation Rings</b><p>
<b></b>A Somerset College Graduation Ring was designed some time ago by Susan
Peacock.  The rings are tastefully designed to feature the school emblem and
make a lasting memento of the years spent at Somerset College.  Crafted in
either 18ct or 9ct gold the Graduation Ring is available for both ladies and

<b></b>Congratulations to Lisa Boman (Yr. 12) and Justin Richards (Yr. 10), who
have been awarded Exchange Scholarships by the Society for Australian German
Student Exchange.<p>
<p>
Applicants from Years 10, 11 and 12 sat for difficult written examinations and
a listening comprehension examination, from which successful students were
chosen to progress to the most challenging stage of selection, an interview by
a panel of four native speakers of German from varying professions.<p>
<p>
The Scholarship winners from Queensland will be leaving for Germany on 2
December 1996 and will stay with host families in Essen or Hessen.  They will
attend school with their host brother or sister for part of the six week
exchange.  A week's trip to Southern Germany and Austria has been organized for
the exchange students and they will also be travelling with host families when
the German schools have their Christmas holidays.<p>
<p>
<b>ROTARY EXCHANGE STUDENT</b><p>
<b></b>Jessica Scantlebury, another member of the Year 12 German class, will
spend a year in Germany as a Rotary International Youth Exchange student.  The
Robina Rotary Club is sponsoring Jessica's exchange, which will involve stays
with up to four different host families and a tour of Europe with other
exchange students.<p>
<p>
I would like to congratulate these students and extend to them our best wishes
for their trips to Germany.<p>

<b><cite></cite></b>Sometimes we, as Chaplains wonder just how much of what we
teach "gets through" to our students.  But lately we have been very encouraged
to read the students' responses to the Grade 9 Assignment on Prayer.<p>
<p>
The prayers were to be completely original and under three separate headings,
"Thank You", "Sorry" and "Praying for Others".  When you read this prayer,
you'll know why we have been encouraged.  A large number of prayers were of
this sensitive nature.  This one is from Adam.<p>
<p>
<i>"Dear God,</i><p>
<i>Thank you for the many great things that I have - things I take for granted
but other people don't even have.  Things like a dog, cat, many friends,
shelter and peaceful house and love.  Thank you for my beautiful school which
will try to equip me for my journey into the workforce.  Most of all thank you
for the knowledge of right and wrong.  Thank you, Lord for my life.  It isn't
much in the whole scheme of things, but I treasure it.  In your name, Lord,
Amen."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>I would suggest that parents of Year 9 students make a special effort to
check our their child's assignment on Prayer.  <p>
<p>
Congratulations to the many boys and girls from the Junior School who collected
for World Vision's Famine Fighters Appeal.  Our school came second in the State
of Queensland, behind Mudgeeraba State Primary $5,898 and ahead of Trinity
Lutheran with $3,454, the amount we collected was $3,553.  Well done and may
God bless you all.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="8">TERTIARY APPLICATIONS</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b><cite></cite></b>Somerset is one of a group of schools who are trialling
"phone-in" applications to QTAC (the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre),
which handles applications to tertiary institutions in Queensland.  Somerset
Seniors have until <b>OCTOBER 11</b> to submit applications to QTAC, whereas
students of most other schools have to submit by September 27.  This will
enable some Seniors (who have been, perhaps, a little remiss) to use the
vacation period to investigate courses and career options before submitting
their applications.  It is also important to note that preferences may be
changed at any time up to January 6 next year, allowing some further "fine
tuning" of preferences and preference order.<p>
<p>
Applications to other states (UAC- New South Wales, VTAC - Victoria, SATAC -
South Australia, TISC - Western Australia, Tasmania and Northern Territory)
close September 27.  Applications to other States are all "phone-in".<p>

<b><cite></cite>SAILING CAMP</b><p>
<b></b>On Saturday, August 21st, twenty-three eager Year 11 students left
Somerset on a 5 hour bus trip to Bundaberg.  Around 6.30p.m., we boarded "South
Passage", the sail training schooner on which we would spend the next four
days.  On the first night we encountered fairly rough seas and, as can be
imagined, this did wonders for those experiencing sea sickness.  A couple of
the sicker people were even strapped to the boat by harnesses to prevent them
from falling overboard while they shared their partly digested dinners with the
fish.<p>
<p>
On the ship we were each assigned to one of three "watches" which would take
turns to perform certain duties.  Watch duties included steering, adjusting
sails, looking out for other boats etc, checking ropes, washing dishes,
cleaning toilets and sometimes staying up all night to watch the anchor.  Other
activities on board included navigation exercises, knot tying competitions and
sunbaking in raincoats.<p>
<p>
On the first leg of our voyage we travelled north to Lady Musgrave Island (at
the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef) where we explored the island and
snorkelled the inner reefs.  We then sailed south, back towards Moreton Bay and
eventually to Manly, Brisbane, where our trip ended.  Along the way we
encountered dolphins that swam with the boat.  We were even privileged enough
to view some whales at play.  This was a rather unique experience as most of us
had never seen whales in the wild before.<p>
<p>
Overall, sailing was a very exciting and enjoyable camp.  The time spent in
close quarters with one another brought us closer together as a group.  This
was evident in the increased amount of teamwork and leadership that occurred in
various situations along the way.  Many thanks must go to Mr. Cooper, Mrs.
Boman and to the crew of "South Passage" for making such a trip possible.  It
was truly a memorable camp.<p>

<b>HORSE RIDING CAMP</b><p>
<b></b>On Monday 2nd September a group of inexperienced but willing horse
riders set off to Tyalgum Tops a huge 345 acre farm on the Queensland and News
South Wales border.  After settling in to our cosy self-contained units, we
were divided into 3 groups and promptly started our activities.  These included
horseriding, canoeing and free recreational time, which many of us used to
relax, eat or play boardgames.  The horseriding was both educational and fun.
After learning to saddle and mount the horses, we went for a short ride around
the farm.<p>
<p>
That night we had to cook our own dinner and entertain ourselves.  However the
biggest entertainment was Fahtima's fire fighting techniques.  The next morning
we went for another ride, but this time for 2 hours, riding through creeks,
bushes and up very steep hills.  We also learnt how to brush and groom our
horses.<p>
<p>
Throughout this camp many of us learnt how to look after and be responsible for
both ourselves and the animals.  It was a very worthwhile and enjoyable
experience and we recommend it to any year 10 students to take part in it next
year.<p>
<b>Sunni Chen &amp; Sarah Wirth</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>COMMUNITY SERVICE</b><p>
<b></b>During the Year 11 Outdoor Education Camps, Adam Johnson and I chose to
participate in some community service at the Palm Beach Salvation Army.  Over
the three days we undertook many jobs such as weeding gardens, cleaning windows
and washing the Salvo bus.<p>
<p>
As well as those who performed community service tasks at Salvation Army, many
of us took part in a range of other activities such as babysitting, care of
elderly people and work at churches.<p>
<p>
The organisation "Lifeline" was also supported by the community service effort.
A number of tasks were completed here that involved heavy  lifting and moving
of furniture.<p>
<p>
Generally feedback from all activities has been positive and the camp would on
this basis be recommended to anyone interested in goodwill and a camp that is a
little bit different.<p>

<b>RAFTING CAMP</b><p>
<b></b>Nine o'clock in the morning of Saturday 31st of August, found a group of
boys plus two guides and one teacher gearing up for the long journey to a small
town outside Grafton in N.S.W. almost 5 hours away.  Our aim was to
successfully raft the Nymboida River in six man inflatable rafts.  Day 1 saw us
tackle rapids such as "the small fall" and a section in "the Devil's Cauldron".
Day 2 presented us with more waterfalls and an exciting 15ft. rock jump.  Day
3, and more rapids to negotiate as well as a granite rock slide.  Our last day
started with an icy platypus watching trip at sunrise.  Fortunately we were
blessed with beautiful weather and powerful rapids.  However some people found
the Nymboida River to be quite cold despite its inviting looks.  Thanks to the
successful organisation by Mr. Jackson and Mrs. Bonifant, our most enjoyable 4
days ran very smoothly.  The Year 11 Rafting Trip will be remembered for a long
time in the minds of those who participated.<p>

<b><cite><A NAME="14">EQUESTRIAN</A> ....<A HREF="#TOC">back to index</A> </cite></b><p>
<b><cite></cite></b>September marks the time for the Queensland Inter School
Equestrian Championships.  Over the years the interest in schools has gone from
strength to strength.  As a result an Association was established three years
ago.  Till this point a privately owned equestrian complex had assumed the
responsibility of co-ordinating schools and competitions, which worked
effectively for ten years.  This year's program reflects the hard work of those
associated with this organisation as the large number of entries and diversity
of disciplines available has extended the State Finals across two weekends.<p>
<p>
The first stage was last weekend with the One Day Event held at Fig Tree
Pocket.  For those of you who are non horsey this involves Dressage, Cross
Country Jumping and Showjumping, similar to the event you may have seen in
Atlanta!<p>
<p>
Sarah Neale acquitted herself well dominating over the three phases and gaining
a second place after a clear and fast cross country.  Aynsley Wylie finished in
ninth place jumping a clear cross country and showjumping round.  However time
penalties slipped her down the placings.  Stefanie Williams rode confidently
around the cross country handling many of the big fences with ease.
Unfortunately Stefanie received some faults on a rather difficult jump
resulting in her placing 12th.<p>
<p>
Shiree Todd on her horse Troica completed her cross country with no faults and
within the time limit, displaying a stylish and competent round.  However an
unfortunate accident at her horse float resulted in her horse having to be put
to sleep due to an injury to her shoulder.  Our deepest sympathy goes to Shiree
for the loss of her versatile and talented horse.  We know she will be a friend
sorely missed.<p>
<p>
This weekend the team heads off to Toowoomba for the second stage of the State
Finals.  The team will consist of Jacinda Kontoleon, Vikki Keene, Aynsley
Wylie, Stefanie Williams, Sarah Neale and Shiree Todd.  <p>
<p>
The last week has been difficult for the team, however I am proud to say that
their commitment to their sport and to each other has been exceptional, hence I
have no doubt that they will acquit themselves well.<p>

travelled to ANZ Stadium in Brisbane to compete in the South Coast Regional
Athletics Championships.  Forty-eight schools participated in this carnival
which brought our students up against some very tough competition from some of
the best athletes in Queensland.  All students displayed excellent
sportsmanship and many achieved personal best performances.  It was also an
opportunity for many to experience track and field competition at a high level
and test their race tactics and strategies.<p>
<p>
Congratulations to the following students who have been selected to represent
South Coast at the State Championships in October:<p>
.	Sally Cooper (Discus 3rd)<p>
.	Adam Harrington (Discus 2nd, Shot Put 2nd)<p>

<b><cite></cite>Junior XI vs Trinity</b><p>
<b></b>The junior cricket team played Trinity at Emmanuel.  Fielding first,
Somerset did a good job to keep Trinity's total at 5 / 123.  Wicket takers were
Ryan Criddle 2/15, Simon Dorrington 2/17 and Matthew Hicks 1/5.  Somerset had a
tough total to chase of 123.  Simon Dorrington 39 and Doyle Roberts 17 helped
us to our winning total of 8 / 126.  A good effort by all the team.<p>
<p>
<b>1st XI vs A.B. Paterson</b><p>
<b></b>A.B. Paterson made a solid start to their innings reaching 2 for 88
after 28 overs.  Somerset Captain Ian Smith started a collapse however when he
dismissed the opposition Captain caught and bowled.  He dismissed the next 4
batsmen (3 bowled and 1 L.B.W.)  to achieve figures of 5 for 21 off 10, his
fourth 5 wicket haul for the 1st XI.  Michael Exelby (2 for 24 off 5) was in a
position to take his 2nd hat trick for the 1st XI.  After taking the 8th and
9th wicket with the last two balls of his 5th over Michael needed to dismiss
the last batsman with the first ball of his following over.  He didn't get that
chance however as Tim Pearson wrapped up the innings taking the final wicket in
the 42nd over with A.B. Paterson on a total of 144.  Wes Keys bowled a great
line and length and was the unluckiest of the bowlers having a number of snicks
go through vacant slips positions and having one ball actually pass
<u>between</u> the stumps without dislodging a bail.  Jono Lane stood out in
the field with some great diving stops in the outfield.<p>
<p>
While the Somerset batsmen managed to pass A.B. Paterson's score with only 3
wickets down the opposition bowlers and fielders made them work for their runs.
At the close of play Somerset were 8 for 190 after 39 overs.  The main
contributors to Somerset's score were Ian Smith 53, Jono Lane 40, Matthew Van
Tuinen 23 and Sam Petersen 17.  The players can look forward to another
fiercely contested match against A.B. in weeks 5 and 6 of Term 4.<p>

<b><cite></cite></b>Last Friday we played Trinity Lutheran College in Round 2
of our summer sports fixtures and although competition with Trinity is always
tough our students did well to achieve victories in most matches.<p>
<p>
The season is early yet but already a few teams are demonstrating that they may
be premiership favourites.  Our Cricket Teams are all strong and our Boys
Junior A and D, Open A and B Touch; Junior A, Intermediate B, Open A and B
Basketball; Junior A and B, Intermediate A and B Tennis; Girls Open Softball;
Junior B and Open B Touch football; Junior B, Intermediate A and Open B
Basketball and Junior A, Intermediate, and Open A Tennis teams have all won 2
matches from 2 rounds.  A great start!  Keep up the fitness over the holiday

<b><cite></cite></b>Greetings from North Queensland and from all travellers on
the annual Trinity Anglican School / Somerset College exchange, held this year
in Cairns.<p>
<p>
A very busy week has unfolded including vigorous sporting and academic
competitions, outer reef snorkelling and strenuous "market" research while in
Kuranda.<p>
<p>
The annual `Triniset' trophy is being fiercely contested with both schools
needing success during the last day to secure the shield.  Final results will
be available on our return, needless to say that the competition is very close
this year.<p>
<p>
On the whole, the children have gained valuable experience by being billeted
with families from another school, and it is our hope that as in the past,
friendships will remain for many years to come.<p>
<p>
I have received very positive feedback from the alternative programme week for
those Year 6/7 students not in Cairns.  I hope all involved have enjoyed the
week and I extend thanks to Mrs. Jones, who has spent many hours planning for
the week.  I also thank the staff who remained behind to assist in so many
ways.<p>
<p>
This is Mrs. Jones' last week, as Mrs. Sauer returns from long service leave
next term, and I thank her for the positive contribution she has made to Year 7
this term.<p>
<p>
Today, Year 5 students return from their annual camp and I look forward to
reading reports about their week in the next newsletter, however I am sure that
they have all benefited from their experience.<p>
<p>
Term 3 has rapidly drawn to a close and I believe that this is indicative of
the overall success of the past 11 weeks.  Term 4 is set to be an equally
successful term and I wish all families a happy, restful break in preparation
for what will be a busy conclusion to the year.<p>

<H2>AMAZON RAIN FOREST is the world's largest tropical rain forest.  It covers approximately 2 1/3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers) in the Amazon River Basin of South America.  About two-thirds of the rain forest lies in Brazil.  The forest also occupies parts of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.  It receives an average annual rainfall of 50 to 120 inches (130 to 305 centimeters).  Temperatures average about 80 degrees F (27 degrees C).<P>  
 
Trees in most of the Amazon rain forest grow in several distinct layers.  Some trees, called emergents, tower above the rest of the forest and may reach heights of 130 feet (40 meters).  The upper canopy generally grows 82 to 100 feet (25 to 30 meters) high.  Plants called epiphytes, or air plants, thrive in this layer.  They include aroids, bromeliads, ferns, liverworts, mosses, and orchids.  One or two lower canopies consist of saplings of the trees found in the upper canopy, in addition to smaller trees and shrubs.  Lianas (woody vines) wind around tree trunks and branches, extending from the ground to the upper canopy.  The canopies receive sunlight.  However, they prevent much light from reaching the forest floor.  In most areas of the Amazon rain forest, the soil is infertile. <P> 

The Amazon rain forest contains a wider variety of plant and animal life than any other place in the world.  Tens of thousands of different plant species live there.  A 2 1/2-acre (1-hectare) area of the rain forest may contain up to 280 or more species of trees.<P>  

<centre><IMG src="scene1.jpg">




</P>Many economically important plants live in the rain forest.  They yield such products as Brazil nuts, cocoa, curare (an important drug), pineapples, and rubber.  More than 1,500 species of birds make their homes in the rain forest.  The region's rivers contain about 3,000 known species of fish.  In addition, scientists believe that as many as 30 million different insect species may live in the forest.<P>  

The world's rapid population growth and increasing demands for natural resources have seriously threatened the Amazon rain forest.  Loggers cut down trees, which the lumber industry uses to make wood products.  Ranchers and farmers clear land to use for grazing beef cattle and growing crops. <P> 

Areas of the rain forest that have been cleared can regenerate.  However, regenerated areas are much less diverse than the original forest.  About 10 per cent of the Amazon rain forest has been destroyed.  Development and deforestation (the destruction of forests) also threaten the culture of the native peoples of the Amazon rain forest.  Many of these people depend on the forest to support themselves.</H2> <P>

<p><font size=4>General Information</p>

<p><H3><font size=3>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest known coral deposit in the world.  It extends for about 2010 km off the eastern coast of Queensland, Australia and is actually a chain of more than 2500 reefs and several islands.</p> <p><H4>The Great Barrier Reef is home to a remarkable number of organisms.  The coral itself is made up of the skeletons of tiny, flowerlike water animals called polyps, held together by a limestone substance produced by a type of algae.  Hundreds of species of polyps form coral in a beautiful range of colours and shapes.  

<p><font size=4>Creatures of the reef</p>

<p><H4><font size=3>The reef also supports many larger water animals, including more than 1000 species of fish - from tiny gobies to huge whale sharks.

Their colours and shapes are fantastic, and are best seen if you can snorkel or scuba dive or take a

trip on a glass-bottomed boat. Shells and shelled creatures, echinoderms (such as sea urchins,

starfish and sea cucumbers) and crustaceans (such as crabs, shrimps and lobsters) add even more

variety. Dolphins, humpback whales, dugongs and turtles are some of the area's larger visitors. The

Southern Reef Islands are particularly noted for their huge breeding populations of birds, while Dunk

and Bedarra are home to huge, bright blue Ulysses butterflies. Wallabies can be found on

Hinchinbrook Island and koalas and possums on Magnetic Island.</p>

<P><font size=4>Climate and weather</p>

<h7><FONT SIZE=3>The reef lies in the tropics, and the warm conditions increase as you head north. From Cairns

northwards, the water is pleasant year round. The southern-hemisphere winter is a good time to visit,

although it can get a little chilly in the extreme south of the area between June and August. The

summer brings extreme heat, thunderstorms and the chance of a cyclone (February and March can

be extremely wet). Rainfall is heavier as you move northwards, where the division of seasons into

just two - dry and wet - is also more noticeable.

<B>GENERAL INFORMATION</B>
<P>
	Rainforest refers to the climax or primary forest in regions with high rainfall (greater than 1.8 m/70 in per year), chiefly but not exclusively found in the tropics.  Rainforests are significant for their valuable timber resources, and in the tropics they afford sites for commercial crops such as rubber, tea, coffee, bananas, and sugarcane.  They also include some of the last remaining areas of the Earth that are both unexploited economically and inadequately known scientifically. A tropical rainforest has more kinds of trees than any other forest in the world.

	Rainforests may be grouped into two major types:  tropical and temperate.  Tropical rainforest is characterized by broadleaf evergreen trees forming a closed canopy, an abundance of vines and epiphytes (plants growing on the trees), a relatively open forest floor, and a very large number of species of both plant and animal life.  The largest trees have buttressed trunks and emerge above the continuous canopy, while smaller trees commonly form a layer of more shade-tolerant species beneath the upper canopy.  The maximum height of the upper canopy of tropical rainforests is generally about 30 to 50 m, with some individual trees rising as high as 60 m above the forest floor.
<BR>Temperate rainforests, growing in higher-latitude regions having wet, maritime climates, are less extensive than those of the tropics but include some of the most valuable timber in the world.  These forests contain trees that may exceed in height those of tropical rainforests, but there is less diversity of species.

A tropical rainforest is always green. Most of the trees in the forest lose old leaves and grow new ones throughout the year. 
Tropical rainforest trees include some species of great beauty and others that provide fruit, timber and other useful products. Most rainforest trees have smaller, less noticeable flowers and the canopy always appears mostly green.  
<BR>In a tropical rainforest, many plants grow on tree branches, where they receive more sunlight than they would on the ground. Such plants, called air plants, include ferns, mosses, orchids and bromeliads. Climbing plants called lianas twine around tree trunks and branches. Some of these plants form loops and knots as they grow toward the sunlight.
<BR>Several kinds of strangler trees grow in rainforests. These trees start life as air plants but unlike other species of air plants, they develop roots that reach down to the ground. In time, the strangler may kill the other tree by depriving it of food, water and light.
<BR>In a tropical rainforest, most plant nutrients are locked up in the living vegetation. Small amounts of nutrients are stored in a thin layer of soil near the surface, where decaying vegetation mixes with the soil. The roots of most rainforest trees remain close to the supply of nutrients near the surface. In some species, the roots form large growths called buttresses that extend between the roots and the trunk. The buttresses may help keep the trees upright.
<BR>A tropical rainforest has no dominant species of trees. Most kinds of trees are widely scattered throughout the forest and depend on animals for pollination.

<BR>
<BR>
A great variety of animals live in a tropical rainforest.  Many of these animals spend their lives in the trees and never descent to the ground.  The fruits and nuts of the upper and lower canopy furnish food for bats, gibbons, monkeys, squirrels, parrots, and toucans.  Sloths and some monkeys feed on the leaves.  Humming- birds and sunbirds sip nectar from flowers there.  Frogs, lizards and snakes also dwell among the branches.  Large birds and large snakes prey on the smaller animals.
<BR>Many canopy animals are especially suited to treetop life.  Flying lemurs and flying squirrels glide from tree to tree.  Several kinds of anteaters, monkeys, opossums, and porcupines sometimes hang by their tail.
<BR>Antelope, deer, hogs, tapirs and many kinds of rodents roam the forest floor.  They feed on roods, seeds and leaves, and also on fruit that drops to the ground.  Chimpanzees, coatis and several members of the cat family live both on the floor and in the trees.  
<BR>Ants many be found at all levels in a rainforest.  Bees, butterflies, mosquitoes, moths, termites and spiders are also abundant.

	Rainforests cover less than six percent of the Earth's total land surface, but they are the home for up to three-fourths of all known species of plants and animals;  undoubtedly they also contain many more species as yet undiscovered.  Recent studies suggest that this great diversity of species is related to the apparently dynamic and unstable nature of rainforests over geologic time.  The fact is that despite their appearance of fertile abundance, rainforests are fragile ecosystems.  Their soils can quickly lose the ability to support most forms of vegetation once the forest cover is removed, and some soils even turn into hard LATERITE clay.  The effect of forest removal on local climates is also often profound, although the role of rainforests in world climatic changes is not yet clear.

Throughout history, human beings have encroached on rainforests for living space, timber, and agricultural purposes. The practice of "shifting cultivation" has caused deterioration of the primary forest.  In this primitive system of agriculture, trees are killed in small plots that are cropped for two or three seasons and then abandoned;  if the plots are again cultivated before primary vegetation has reestablished itself, the result is a progressive deterioration of the forest, leading to coarse grass or jungle.  Lowland forests are similarly being reduced in many areas. In the 20th century these incursions on rainforests have grown rapidly, and numerous organizations are now attempting to reduce the rate of the loss.
<BR>Today, the rapid growth of the world population and the increasing demands for natural resources threaten many tropical rainforests.  Huge mining, ranching and timber projects also have caused much damage.  It is feared that further forest destruction will lead to the elimination of hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals.

Forests have always had great importance to human beings. Prehistoric people got their food mainly by hunting and gatheriingwild plants. Many of these people lived in the forest and were a natural part of it.  With the development of civilization, peopl.e settled in towns and cities.  But they still returned to the forest to get timber and to hunt.  The natural beauty and peace of the forest offer a special sources of enjoyment.  In the United States, Canada and many other countries, huge forestlands have been set aside for people's enjoyment.  Many people use these forests for such activities as camping, hiking, and hunting.  Other visit them simply to enjoy the scenery and relax in the quiet beauty.

<center><h3>Introducing Italy</h3></center>
  Italy is a boot-shaped peninsula (a piece of land that is almost an island) in Southern Europe which juts out into the Mediterranean Sea. It shares borders with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia.  It covers an area of 301,268km and has a population of over 58 million.
<p>
	The country is divided into 20 regions and includes two independent states, the Vatican city in Rome and the Republic of San Marino. Two thousand years ago, the capital, Rome, was the centre of the Roman Empire, that stretched from what is now 
Iraq. Throughout history, Italians have been great traders, artists and explorers and have exported Italian ideas around the world.
<p>
  Nowadays, tourists flock to Italy to see its' spectacular countryside, historic buildings and art collections. They find a country of contrasts, where there are both modern areas, with high living standards, and other regions that are more traditional and less wealthy.

As many as 98% of Italians are Catholics, and Italy is dotted with magnificant cathedrals, such as the Duomo in Florence (below). Many of Italy's greatest paintings and statues have a religious theme, such as the painting on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistene Chapel by Michelangelo.<p>
  Far fewer people attend Mass than they did even one generation ago, and many more women go than men. Even so, almost all Italians are baptised, married and have their funerals in church. <p>
  Many Italians are also very superstitious, and regularly consult fortune tellers or people who can interpret dreams. Friday 17 is considered an unlucky day. In the countryside there are many tales of witches or werewolves. In Naples, a big ceremony is held each year to see if a bottle supposedly containing the blood of Saint Genaro turns back into liquid blood. If it does, Neapolitans believe that the city will enjoy good luck over the following months.<p>
  The leaning tower of Pisa was constructed for religious purposes - it was supposed to be the bell tower to call people to Mass at Pisa's cathedral. <br> <br>

Italy is famous for it's art, particularly during the age of the Renaissance, the cultural movement that began in the early 1300's and ended in about 1600. During this time, Italy produced some of the greatest 
<A HREF="http://www.planetitaly.com/culture/Art/painting.html"> painters </A>
, sculptors, composers and architects in history. <p>
  One such artist was Raphael. He painted portraits and frescoes (wall paintings). He was also an architect who was in charge of the construction of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. He came from Urbino, a small university town in Umbria. <p>
  All Italian children must complete ten years of schooling, usually between the ages of six and sixteen. Some children start as young as three at nursery school. The compulsory school term begins in the term after the child's sixth birthday. <p>
  Next comes <i> scuola elementare </i>, or primary school, for five years. Then the child goes to <i> scuola media </i>, or middle school, for three years. The child takes exams at the end of every year. If they fail, they have to try again in September, but if they fail twice, they must repeat the year. <p>
  After middle school, they can go to either <i> liceo</i> for five years to prepare for university and take the <i> Maturita </i> university entrance exam, or they can go to a technical institute and get a professional qualification for a specific job. The school day starts at about 8.30 and finishes around 2 o'clock, when everybody goes home for lunch. <p>
  Italy as a long history of learning and art. It is home to some of the oldest universities in the world, including the university of Bologna which dates from about 1100. <br> <br>

  With one of the world's most pleasant climates, Italy is ideally suited for outdoor life. Football id the most popular sport for players and spectators, and basketball is very popular with both boys and girls. <p>
  People also enjoy playing tennis, cycling and motorbike racing. Winter sports are popular in parts of the Apennines and the Alps, where big skiing resorts are located. The Mediterranian and the lakes of the north are used for water sports, such as sailing, fishing and water skiing. <p>
  The most common pastime of all is the <i> passeggiata </i>, where people take a stroll in the evening, to chat with their friends and perhaps have a drink before dinner. Family and friends are important to Italians, and they take any excuse to get together and talk and eat.

<h5> <center><i>A united Italy: </i> </center></h5> <p>
  Italy was not a united country until 1870. Before this time, the country was a group of separate states ruled by France, Spain, Austria and other foreign countries. There were many attempts to unify the country but all of these failed until 1860. <p>
  In 1860, Guiseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), the child of parents who were involved in the fishing industry, formed an army of volunteer soldiers who all wore bright red shirts. They became known as the 'red shirts' and they fought boldly to drive out foriegn rulers. The red shirts successfully took over all the states, except Rome and Venetia, and in 1861, the states joined together to become one country called Italy. The new Italy was ruled by Victor Emmanual II, who was the King of Sardinia. He was the first King of Italy. <p>
  Nine years later, Venetia and Rome joined the other states and unification was complete. Rome became the capital of Italy in 1871. <p>
  During World War I, Italy joined Britain and France to fight the Germans. After the war was over, the people were poor and hungry and many of them had no job. <p>
  A man called Benito Mussolini, who had been a school teacher, became leader of a group of people called the fascists. The fascists wanted to change the goverment and promised the people that they would make life better for them. In 1922, the army of the fascists marched into Rome and seized power from the King. Mussolini became the ruler of Italy. The people called him <i> Il Duce </i> which meant 'the leader' <p>
  During World War II, from 1940 to 1943, Italy fought on the side of the Germans, but after Mussolini and his army had suffered many defeats, he was put into prison and the King returned to rule in Italy. In 1943, Italy changed sides in the war and joined Britain, France, Russia, and the United States to defeat Germany. The war ended in 1945. <p>
  Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in 1945, but he was later caught and executed by Italian soldiers. In 1946 elections were held in Italy and the people voted not to have a royal family but to become a republic headed by a president.<p>

<i><center><h5>Modern National Government:</h5> <p> </center></i>
  All Italians over 18 vote to elect members of parliament to govern the country. Parliament is divided into two sections: the Chamber of Deputies, which has 630 members, and the Senate, which has 322 members. <p>
  Some members of Parliament are chosen by the Prime Minister to form a Cabinet. Cabinet members work closely with the Prime Minister and help govern the country. <p>
  The Prime Minister is the leader of parliament and is chosen by the president. <p>
  The President is the leader of the country and is elected by members of Parliament.<p>
  Italy also has a

<br>
Italian has developed from Latin, the language of the Romans. Although it is spoken throughout Italy, it has many different dialects, so the words and grammar change from region to region. In Campania, the word for boy is <i> guaglione </i>, for instance, while in Umbria they say <i>frego </i>. <p>
  In some parts, Italian is the second language. In the Alps, some people speak French or German, while in Sardinia, many people speak Sard.

<hr>
<p>
  Until 1871, Italy was a collection of small states rather than one big country. Over a century later, most people still feel they belong to a region, such as Sicily or Tuscany, rather than Italy. <p>   Many of these regions are seperated by natural boundaries, such as the sea (in case of Sicily and Sardinia) or mountains. Apart from the Po valley in the north, much of Italy is mountainous, with the snow-peaked Alps (see below) running across the northern borders and the Apennines running down the country like a spine. In the foothills of the Alpsare the beautiful Italian lakes, including Lake Garda (see below) and Lake Como. The peninsula is surrounded by four seas: the Ligurian, the Tyrrhenian, the Lonian and the Adriatic.<p>
  Italy becomes hotter and drier the further south you go. In Tuscany, in the heart of Italy, the landscape is green with cypress and olive trees, and yellow with sunflowers. Further south the land is dry and rugged but coloured with eucalyptic and citrus fruits.

<br><img src="tglo07.GIF"></br>

It is a continent hidden by ice, a desert buried under water.
It is one wilderness that will never be logged, dammed, criss-crossed
by hiker's trails or biker's tracks, no highways will be built through it and no smog producing factories or ugly highrises threatening the homes of wildlife. At the same time, it is one of the planet's most important geological features -- for storms
that blow down from its icy heights are the engine for much of
the world's weather.<p>

<H5>Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere.</H5>

<H5>An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong rotation,</H5>

<FONT COLOR="RED"><U> WHAT IS A RAINFOREST?</FONT COLOR="RED"></U>
<P>
Rainforests are large areas of dirverse vegatation which occur on the wet tropical uplands and downlands around the equator. They have a high annual rainfall and no distinct dry season, although occasionals dry peroids occur. Rainforests contain a wide variety of tall broad-leafed evergreen trees., a few deciduous species and many epiphytic plants growing on the branches and trunks of trees. Subtropical rainforests differ from equatorial ones in that they sometimes have periods of reduced rainfall, even drought, although essentially the climate is extremely wet.
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="RAINFOREST.PIC"></CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
The most complex ecological  system on Earth is found in a troplical rainforest and the felling of tropical hardwoods, such as teak, walnut and mohogany, poses a threat to this delicate ecosystem. The hot, moist atmosphere allows a wide deversification of plants, insects and animals to grow and multiply almost throughout the year. The humidity is always high and the soil never dries out. Decaying plant and animal matter is quickly broken down into thick layers of humus, which constantly enrich the soil.<P>

<P>
The animal population of the rainforest is so abundant and dirverse that  many members have not yet been named or classified. All groups of vertebrates are represented as are almost all groups of terrestrial invertebrates. Even some species that are usually considered to be aquatic can live in the moist atmosphere. Mammels range from huge elephants and rhinoceroses down to tiny mice and shrews. The invertebrates include giant snails , bird-eating spiders and the large goliath beetles. Butterflies, moths, bees, wasps, hummingbirds and many other birds are also present in great numbers.<P>

<H3><U><CENTER>WHY SHOULD WE PROTECT OUR RAINFORESTS?</U></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> 50 - 70% of all species on earth live in the rainforest. At the present rate of destruction, more than 100 species are becoming extinct every single day!
<P>
<LI>The rainforests have been called "the lungs of the world". Indeed, the dense vegetation helps absorb much of the carbon dioxide that we and other animals breathe out, and that released by the use of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are therefore increasing. This is contributing to the GREENHOUSE EFFECT, and raising our planet's temperature!

<p><center>Antarctica is remote, inhospitable and without permanent inhabitants. It is the windiest and
highest continent, which is capped by an ice sheet over 4 km thick in places. Antarctica is 58
times larger than the United Kingdom, and surrounded in winter by a vast girdle of sea ice larger
in area than the continent itself. 
<BR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://rs560.cl.msu.edu/weather/arctic.gif">Antartica Weather Map</CENTER></A>
<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.sprint.com/epatrol/graphics/at.gif">
<p>The Antarctic's key role in global processes is now recognised. The ice sheet holds 90% of the
world's fresh water, which, if melted, would raise sea level by 65 m. The ice sheet drives the
Southern Hemisphere weather patterns and modulates world climate. The waters of the Southern
Ocean affect all other world oceans. The Antarctic polar vortex provides the conditions for
large-scale ozone destruction in the stratosphere. Antarctica acts as an unparalleled laboratory
for studying solar terrestrial phenomena. Its rocks provide the key to the evolution of the
southern continents. The ice sheet contains an outstanding history of more recent climatic
changes and man-made pollution.

<p>The waters of the Southern Ocean support an economically important world fishery of fin fish,
squid and krill, and scientific studies of these resources underpin their management. The
mineral and hydrocarbon potential of Antarctica is not exploitable under international and domestic legislation.

<font size=+1><B> Penguins </B>
<BR>		The largest of the penguin species, Emperor Penguins can
stand 4 feet high and weigh 100 pounds.  Females lay a single egg during
the coldest part of the year, and then leave for the sea.  The father stays
behind and carries the egg on the top of his feet under a flap of skin to
keep it warm .  The mother returns just as the egg is ready to hatch
and both parents bring food to the chick.  Penguin populations are
dropping because their food supply is growing smaller.  Oil spills from 
tankers have also hurt the penguins.

<font size=+1><B> Killer Whales </B><BR>		
Known by their bold black and white markings, these
beautiful killers prefer cooler waters.  Traveling together
in groups known as pods, killer whales, or orcas, have been
known to tilt a piece of floating ice dislodging sleeping prey
such as seals and penguins.  Adult males average 30 feet in
length, while the females are only half that long.  Babies are
born 8 feet long and can weigh 400 pounds.  Killer whales
are in danger because of unnecessary killing by humans.

<H3> Scrub trees at the base of Ayers Rock</H3>

<H4> There are deserts all over the globe - every continent has one. From the sandy  Sahara to the icy Arctic, deserts are a hash but misunderstood areas of land.</H4>
</CENTER><BODY><P> Hi - My name is Suzie Harbord, and welcome to my web page all about deserts. It will center on Australian deserts - their fauna, flora, and interesting facts.<P>
The Outback. The Dead Heart. The Desert. These names make you think of images of heat, vast tracts of sand, a featureless wasteland where little grows and nothing lives. Many people think a desert is a desolate and lonely place. The desert by moonlight, animals that are nowhere to be seen during the day are everywhere. As dawn comes, the star-filled sky slowly changes from black to stripes of blue, green, orange until the rising sun breaks over the horizon and lights up dewdrops on flowers and huge spider webs that stretch between the desert trees, despite the lack of rain. For travel information on the Australian outback,

<H3> A view of the horizon of the Australian desert.</H3>
</CENTER><H1> Weather</H1>
Today, 70% of Australia is semi arid to arid desert. In central Australia,
average daily summer temperatures are typically 37-39C (98-102F).
Occasionally, they may climb into the low 50's (120's). Average daily winter
temperatures range between 16-24oC (61-77F). Night time temperatures in
winter rarely drop below -2 or 3C (28-26F). In central Australia, annual
evaporation varies between 2400-4400mm (100-180 inches). Average annual
rainfall varies between 110mm (4.4 inches) around Lake Eyre to 300-450mm
(12-18 inches) on the margins. Rainfall is very sporadic. Droughts are the
normal situation in central Australia. However, localised falls can be
extremely heavy, for instance, 300mm (12 inches) in an overnight storm at
Merty Merty homestead (near Innamincka) (Bonython 1989).

<CENTER><H3> Examples of desert flora</H3></CENTER>
<H1> Flora and Fauna </H1>
Although most people think of deserts as barren wastelands, they are Actually are a host to an amazing number of plants and animals. Whenever it does rain, a furious breeding season begins with everything from lizards to insects to frogs to birds taking full advantage of the rare event. Thousands of animals and insects are born into the desert wet season, but only a few will survive to see the next. <P>
Plants such as the cactus and scrub grass thrive in the desert, and occasionally a gum tree can be found. Cactuses store their water in hollows inside of them, which allow them to survive during the long periods of drought.

Recent studies show that mountains hold a total of 25% of our landscape. They are not only called home by thousands of the world's wildlife, but help many thrill seekers obtain glory. We have the large mountain ranges like The Himlayas and in comparison the smaller like the Blue Mountains.

Mountains are also a source of revenue. Many tourists flock to the mountains to admire the scenery and as doing so, support the economy. Mountains are important within our world.</p></center>

<h3><img src="dotb3.gif">If you're looking for a quick insight into mountains here's all the information you'll need to know.</center>
</h3><hr>

<center>MOUNTAINS</center><P><HR>

Mountains are landforms with a narrow summit area that rise sharply and prominently above their surroundings.  Occurring worldwide, mountain ranges are often a major factor affecting regional weather patterns.  They have frequently served as a hindrance to travel and communication.  Mountains are important economically for their metallic mineral deposits. <P><HR><br>

 <center>GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION</center><P><HR>

Isolated mountains are those not associated with others in age, origin, or geographic distribution.  Single mountain peaks are most commonly the result of volcanic activity.<p> 

A mountain range is a long, narrow belt of mountains of similar age and origin.  The Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado and New Mexico, for example, is more than 400 km (250 mi) long and less than 24 km (15 mi) wide.  When geographically associated mountains of similar age and origin are not arranged along a narrow belt--the BLACK HILLS in South Dakota are an example--they form a mountain group.<p> 

A mountain system is composed of ranges and groups of similar age and origin.  The ROCKY MOUNTAINS comprise a mountain system that includes the BROOKS, TETON, WASATCH, and many other ranges.  A mountain cordillera may include ranges, groups, and systems of differing origins and ages.  The North American cordillera, for example, includes the COAST RANGES, the CASCADE RANGE, the SIERRA NEVADA, the ALEUTIAN ISLANDS chain, and the Rocky Mountains. <P><HR><br>

 <center>STRUCTURE AND ORIGIN</center><P><HR>

The classification of mountains based on structure and origin relies on knowledge and theories of the geologic processes active within the upper mantle and crust of the Earth. Mountains are generally placed in four structural classifications:  volcanic, erosional, fault-block, and folded mountains.<p><hr><br>  

 <center>VOLCANIC, EROSIONAL, AND FAULT-BLOCK MOUNTAINS </center><p><hr>

Volcanic mountains may be isolated, as is Mount Rainier, or in long chains, exemplified by the Hawaiian Islands.  MAUNA KEA (4,205 m/13,796 ft) and MAUNA LOA (4,169 m/13,677 ft) are two of the Hawaiian chain of volcanic mountains (not all exposed above water) stretching 2,400 km (1,500 mi) across the Pacific Ocean.  Volcanic mountains fall into two basic types:  cinder cones, such as VESUVIUS (1,277 m/4,190 ft), characterized by a rhyolitic lava and explosive eruptions;  and shield VOLCANOES, such as Mauna Loa, characterized by a flattened dome originating from flows of fluid, basaltic lava.<p> 

The processes of erosion that wear down the land act to carve out and carry away those rocks that are less resistant. Erosional mountains are those formed by the residual relief of resistant strata.  PIKES PEAK (4,301 m/14,110 ft) in Colorado is a resistant mass of granitic rock rising above the eroded strata that surround it.<p> 

The vertical movement, by faulting, of large blocks of crustal material results in the formation of fault-block mountains and fault-block valleys (called HORSTS AND GRABENS, respectively). The BASIN AND RANGE PROVINCE of Nevada is an excellent example. The Sierra Nevada mountains to the west include both upthrown fault-block mountains and erosional mountains. <P><HR><br>

 <center>FOLDED MOUNTAINS</center><P><HR>

Most mountains of the folded type have been formed by the interactions of the borders of moving crustal plates.  When two crustal plates move away from each other, the mountains form two long, narrow belts flanking a central rift valley.  The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the longest mountain range in the world, is between the North American and Eurasian crustal plates, which have diverged since at least the Jurassic Period (190 to 135 million years ago).<p>  

The crustal areas squeezed between converging crustal plates are subject to intense pressure and eventual uplift as the crustal rocks buckle.  The multiple convergence of the North American and Eurasian plates, spanning the time from the Late Precambrian Era (prior to 1 billion years ago) through the Appalachian OROGENY (250 million years ago), is thought to have provided the forces that produced the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. The complex movements of the North American and Pacific plates, extending from the Nevadan (160 to 104 million years ago) through the Laramide orogeny (65 to 35 million years ago) to the present, formed the ranges in the North American cordillera.<p>  

The convergence of the African and Eurasian crustal plates resulted in the formation of the URAL MOUNTAINS, the PYRENEES, and the ALPS (225 million, 225 to 200 million, and 65 to 2 million years ago, respectively).  The ongoing convergence of the Eurasian and Indian crustal plates has produced the HIMALAYAS in the Asian cordillera.  The convergence of the South American and Pacific plates (begun 70 million years ago) has formed the ANDES, flanking the western coast of South America.

Paris, the capital and largest city of France, is one of the world's great cities. For hundreds of years, Paris has been a world capital of art and learning. Many great artist have produced their finest masterpieces there. Every year, millions of tourists visit  famous Paris landmarks such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame, The Eiffel Tower and the Louvre - one of the largest art museums in the world.<p>
There is much more to France than just Paris. The snow-capped Alps form the border between France and Italy. Sunny beaches and steep cliffs strech along the French coast on the Mediterranean Sea. Fishing villages dot the Atlantic coast of northwestern France. The peaceful, wooded Loire Valley has many historic chateaux (castles). Colourful apple orchards, dairy farms, and vineyards lie throughout much of the countryside.<p>
The French are famous for their enjoyment of good life. Good food and wine are an important part of everyday living for most French people. The wines of France are considered the best in the world. Almost every restaurant and area has at least one special recipe of its own. The delicious breads, appetizers, sauses, soups, and deserts of France are copied by cooks in most part of the world.<p>
France has a long history and colourful history. Julius Caesar and his Roman soilders conquered the region

<h1> Ayers Rock</h1>
<h2>By Rebecca Hicks</A></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>Ayres Rock in central Australia, is a huge freestanding rock formation, or monolith.</i><p>
<Body Colour "red" >
<h3>Rising above the flat plain of central Australia, the oval-shaped mass is composed of a multicoloured, weathered conglomerate. As sunlight strikes it at different angles, it appears to change colour. Ayers Rock stands 348 metres (1,143 ft) above the desert floor; it is about 2km (1.5 miles) long and 1.5km (0.9 miles) wide and is deeply eroded from top to bottom. Its lower portion is pocked with numerous caves that have long been sacred to Aborigines who live in the region. The lower walls and caves contain traditional Aborigine paintings. Discovered in 1872 by the explorer Ernest Giles, Ayers Rock was named for a former South Australian premier, Sir Henry Ayers. The government transferred ownership of Ayers Rock to the Aborigines in 1985. 

Rising from the flat, red expanse of the landscape, Ayers Rock / Uluru and nearby Mt. Olga / Kata Tjuta appear to be the visible parts of some great submerged creature. They are the major draw card for visitors to Central Australia. Ayers Rock / Uluru, situated in Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park and rising 348 metres with a
circumference of 8 kilometres, is considered by many to be one of the great natural wonders of the world. Visitors from around Australia and the world simply stand in awe and marvel at its very existence. The more courageous attempt a climb to its summit, no easy task when the ascent is 1.6 kilometres and particularly steep in parts. It might be noted that the local Aboriginal people prefer visitors to enjoy Ayers Rock / Uluru in other ways. There are many sacred and significant sites associated with Uluru, so a walking tour around its base with a guide is rewarding.

Depending on the time of day, position of the sun and atmospheric conditions, Uluru's vast bulk metamorphoses through various shades, from glowing reds and soft oranges to delicate lilacs. It is an unmatched spectacular light show. The white sails of the adjacent Ayers Rock Resort herald its existence, with colour and form designed to blend in as much of the land, the Resort offers a variety of accommodation from camping to luxury hotels. 

A mere 30km away, as the 'crow fly's' (50km by road), Kata Tjuta seems overshadowed by Uluru. The tallest peak, Mt. Olga, is in fact, more than 200 metres taller than Uluru. The distinctive domes and striated, weathered surfaces of Kata Tjuta match Uluru in colour and are an excellent subject for photographers. Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park with its famous landmarks is a special place and not to be missed.

<p>
The Great Barrier Reef is a chain of coral reefs, in the Coral Sea, off the eastern coast of Queensland, Australia. The largest known deposits of coral, it extends in a northwestern direction more than 1930 km (more than 1200 mi) from a point opposite Mackay, Queensland, into Torres Strait, which separates Australia from the island of New Guinea. The channel between the Australian coast and the reef varies in width from about 16 km at the northern extremity to about 240 km in the south.

<A NAME="THE BIRTH AND GROWTH OF THE REEF"><FONT COLOUR=BLACK><FONT SIZE=6>THE BIRTH AND GROWTH OF THE REEF</FONT></A>

<p>
Reefs have grown on the continental shelf of Queensland for about 2 million years in the south, and as much as 18 million years in the north. 
<P>
The sea level has changed many times over the years. In the last ice age it dropped dramatically to 100 metres below its current level - draining the continental shelf and exposing reefs as coastal limestone hills. In those days it would have been possible to walk out the outer Reef.
<p>
About 20000 years ago the last ice age ended and the sea, replenished by melting ice caps, rose rapidly. About 10000 yeas ago the sea bagan to flood the old limestone hills for the first time in more than 100000 years. Corals grew on old eroded reef platforms to form the reefs of today's Great Barrier Reef. The sea reached its present level approximately 6000 years ago.

<p>
Coral reefs are composed of mostly 'dead' limestone and on ly a small part of the surface is alive with colourful coral. Coral reefs are named after tiny animals called polyps. Polyps are the most obvious reef builders, although the algae are the most important. The coral polyps, by producing a skeleton of limestone and dividing to form new polyps, create the living structures known as coral colonies.
<P>
Coral colonies grow upwards to the light. They may ultimately reach the surface and die or be grounded to rubble in a tropical cyclone. They may be eaten by crown of thorns starfish or gradually eroded by borers. If the rate of accumulation of the dead skeletons exceeds the rate of erosion, then the reef is slowly formed. 
<p>
Reefs are destroyed by heavy seas and chemicals as well as by the creatures of the Reef. Micro-borers such as algae, bacteria and fungi. 

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5><I> ALGAE : THE MORTAR</I> </FONT>
<P>
Although thry are inconspicious on coral reefs, the algae are especially important in reef building. An encrusting coralline alga resembling mauve concrete is of special importance in cementing together the skeletons of corals and other reef creatures and forms a hard pavement on reef crests. In the lagoon and reef slope much of the sediment is composed of button-sized discs of the green alga HALIMEDA, one of the most abundant coral reef algae.

The Great Barrier Reef region is administered by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The day-to-day management of this Marine Park is undertaken by the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service.
<P>In keeping with the spirit of the World Heritage Convention, the primary goal of the Authority is to provide for the protection, wise use, understanding and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reefin perpetuity through the development and care of the Marine Park.
<P>The concept of the Marine Park is based on a balance between conservation of the Reef and its prolific animal and plant life, and reasonable use by fisheren, collectors, charter operators, tourists, scientists and others. 
<P>To achieve this balance the Marine Park Authority has developed zoning plans which define the type of activities which may take place on different parts of the Reef.

Tourism is the largest commercial activity in economic terms. For its huge size, there are remarkably few places to build resorts on the Great Barrier Reef. There are 24 island resorts along the Reef region coast. Resort guests make use of reefs waters for recreational activities including fishing, diving and snorkelling, water sports, sightseeing, reef walking and some collecting.

<H2>Welcome to my web page on the mountains.  As you have guessed the topic already, I don't need to tell you it....However, I will explain to you how my page operates...
<BR>
Below are the names of the mountains I have created webpages for (or hopefully will in the near future).  All you have to do is click on any one of the mountain names you want information on and you can visit my webpage on it.
ENJOY!  :-)</H2>

<H1>RAINFOREST INFORMATION</H1>

<H3>The tropical rainforest can be found in 85 countries around the world, 90% of these forests are concentrated in 15 countries, which have more than 10 million hectares each. 

At present, the tropical rainforest is disappearing at a rate of about 2% each year. FAO estimates that 15 m hectares of forestare lost each year. This is due essentially to the growing needs of local inhabitants for food, fuel, industrial and mineral
products. 

The rate of deforestation is indirectly in proportion to the rate of population expansion and the poverty of the country. 

Of the annual production of timber from tropical forests, 85% is for fuel; 10% is for local timber needs and 5% for export. The link between the exports of tropical timber and deforestation in the tropics is much less than generally known. Moreover, because of better economic value, tropical forest providing timber for export tend to be better managed.

Shifting cultivation and forest fires are responsible for 60% of tropical deforestation; 30% is conversion to agricultural and/or industrial use as the population expands; while 10% is due to unsustainable forest management practices. In regard to
the latter, tropical timber producing countries, as members of ITTO have committed themselves to work towards sustainable management in accord with ITTO guidelines. The year 2000 has been established as the target year for sustainable management to be fully accomplished.

	The snowy Mountains which is situated in the North Western part of New South Wales has many activities in all seasons.
<p>
<p>


But the Snowy Mountains main  tourist attraction woulde be in the winter time with great  skining from June to early September. With four different ski feilds to choose from. Eack ski field having slopes from begginners to world class black runs.
<p> <center>The pictures below I have either gathered from the internet or I have scanned in.<center>
<p>


<P>
	If skiing doesn't take your fancy their are still plenty of other activities to select from.  A activitie which popular is trout fishing.  Trout fishing can be praticed in two different environments.  First one being in the wildernes with great fishing in the streams around Mt Kosikoiu and 
Jindabyne lake. The other alternative is fishing  at trout farms which consist of  man made lakes filled with rainbow and brown trout.  This type of trout fishimg is great for the kids.!   
<P>
<P>
The snowy mountains is not just a winter tourist destination with the mountains offering beautiful scenary during the summer and many activities to particpate in .  One of the most popular being horse riding thru the mountains.   Accomdation is not a problem during any season, and if you have a look in my links below you will be able to find something perfect accomidation  deals for your holiday in the snowy mountains.

<h4>	Snowboarding is not a relativly new sport but over the past two years has exploded onto the skiing scene in all countries.   Snowboarding has exploded  because of  how basic it is to learn to Snowboard rather than skiing.  Snowboarding has created its own image very similar to skateboarding with baggy clothes and skate shoes.   This is because the poiners of snowboarding were skateboards looking for a new sport to grab bigger and higher air.  Today's moves include Backfilps, grinds, Nose Grinds, triple 360's and fackies with most moves being brought across from skateboarding movement.

<h2><i>Desert Information</i></h2>
<hr>

<h3>
<i>What is a desert?</i>
</center>
<br>

Geographers generally categorize deserts as one of two basic types that, together, contain an almost unlimited variety of landscapes, vegetation communities, climates, and cultural and natural resources.  Deserts of the first major group, the result of large-scale climatic patterns, develop in regions of persistent high atmospheric pressure, where descending air masses are compressed and heated.  Those of the second major type may form behind any large mountain range that creates a rain shadow effect by preventing moist ocean air from moving inland. 
<br>
<img src="line2.gif">
<br>
<center><i>Water Sources</i></center>
<br>

With such a large percentage of the Earth's land surface marked by a moisture imbalance, the presence of water, when it is available, is of major importance.  Desert water sources are of two major types:  surface, including all streams, rivers, and lakes;  and subsurface, including all springs and wells. 
<br>
<br>
Surface water is commonly temporary, consisting of short-lived streams produced by local, violent thunderstorms.  In areas where closed basins have no outlet to the sea, shallow temporary lakes may form.  Normally, such streams and lakes are not a dependable water supply. 
<br>
<br>
Another form of surface water that is much more critical to human life in desert areas is the permanent river.  Since these originate in humid areas outside the boundaries of deserts and then flow across desert land en route to the sea, they are called exotic streams.  Typical of such permanent water sources are the Nile in Egypt and the Tigris-Euphrates in Iraq.  With irrigation water supplied by these river systems, the two areas became cradles of civilization. 
<br>
<br>
In North America, systematic development of the Colorado River, an exotic stream in the southwestern United States, has led to the creation of extensive agricultural programs in Arizona and California, within the past 40 years. 

<br>
<img src="line2.gif">
<br>

<center><i>Wildlife</i></center>
<br>
Deserts are the home to many different types of animals. Birds, mammals, reptiles and marsupials inhabit the arid landforms. Australia has a wide range of desert fauna, with  kangaroos, lizard, small marsupials and insects making the desert their home. This is some of the wildfile found in the south western deserts of America.

<center><i>Mining</i></center>

<br>


Deserts are a area of richness of minerals, and mines have been a source of incentive for people to come to the desert. Minerals such as zinc, bauxite, lead and gold are found to have an abundance in the arid wastelands.

<center> Deserts occupy approximately 15% of The United States of America. Predomidantly in the south-west of the country, deserts such as the something and the something else contain a rich diversity of wildlife.
<br>
Large cities have been built in the desert, to take advantage of the natural resources they contain. An example is Phoenix in Arizona.

<UL><Li>The first topic is <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/html/pressforce.html">forces and wind</A>
<Li>The next site is a little more complex and is about <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/html/forecast.html">analysis and interpretation of weather patterns, forecasts and maps</A>
<Li>This one is called 'atmospheric optics' and is about <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/html/cloudoptics.html">clouds and rainbows</A> and all that sort of fun stuff!
<Li>This site is all about <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/html/severestorm.html">thunder and lightning, hurricanes and twisters!</A> Be prepared!

<Li>This site is about weather such as <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/html/midlat.html">snow and fronts</A> in the middle latidudes but it's pretty much all in America.
<Li>This is about about <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/rsteve/html/lakewx.html">coastal weather</A> near Chicago and how the ocean and lakes affect the temperature.
<Li>You may think this site is good , but without a teacher is isn't that fabulous.  It is <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/rsteve/html/lakewx.html">elementary lessons</A> about weather, that mainly gives excercises for young kids to do.

New Zealand lies in the southern Pacific , 1600 km east of Australia. It is made up of the North and South Islands and a number of smaller islands with a total land area of 266,171 sq km. <P>

<CENTER><TR><TD><IMG SRC="nz1.gif" ALT="nz image" ALIGN="TOP"></CENTER>

Mountain ranges and hill country dominate New Zealand's landscape; one of the most striking physical features is the Southern Alps. These, along with fiords, glaciers and lakes and the coastal plains of Canterbury and Southland, add to the variety of the South Island scenery.  In the North Island, the volcanic interior contains New Zealand's largest lake, Lake Taupo, and most of the country's active volcanoes -<BLINK> <A HREF="http://www.mocd.govt.nz/ruapehu/ruapehu.html">Ruapehu</A></BLINK>, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro - all usually quiet.  Hot springs, geysers and mudpools also form part of the volcanic system centred around Rotorua. <P>

<P>
The name, Mount Ruapehu, means 'explosion pit'.  It is the highest mountain in the North Island of New Zealand, standing at 2797  metres.  It has three ski fields: Whakapapa, Turoa and Tukino. <P>

Mount Ruapehu has shown volcanic activity over time.  In 1945, there was an eruption series and in 1953 there was a rail disaster. <P>

The eruption series in 1945, sent ash falling over most of the North Island;  both Hawkes Bay and Wanganui had deposits.  Communities close to the mountain also suffered, with some residents experiencing breathing difficulties.  <P> 

The 1953 rail disaster was caused by a sudden release of water from the crater lake,  when volcanic mud and debris (lahar) flowed down the Whangaehu River.  The lahar weakened the rail bridge, just before a passenger express was due to come.  The bridge  collapsed and the train plunged down into the river , killing 151 people.  <P>

<P>
Volcanoes are mountains, but, they are not formed by folding and crumpling or by erosion. Instead, volcanoes are made by the accumulation of their own eruptive products -- lava, bombs (crusted over lava blobs), ashflows, and tephra (airborne ash and dust). A volcano is most commonly a mountain built around a vent that connects with reservoirs of molten rock below the surface of the Earth.  Driven by gas pressure the molten rock, which is lighter than the surrounding solid rock, forces its way upward and breaks through zones of weakness in the Earth's crust. If an eruption begins, the molten rock may pour from the vent as nonexplosive lava flows, or it may shoot violently into the air as dense clouds of lava fragments. Larger fragments fall back around the vent, and accumulations of fallback fragments may move downslope as ash flows under the force of gravity. Some of the finer ejected materials may be carried by the wind only to fall to the ground many miles away. The finest ash particles may be injected miles into the atmosphere and carried many times around the world by stratospheric winds. 
There are four types of volcanoes: cinder cones, composite volcanoes, shield volcanoes and lava domes.<P>

<BR>
<H4><font color="light blue">

The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system which is estimated to be 30 million years old,
it is also the worlds largest living structure. 
The reef is 2 000km long and covers an area of 35 million ha.<BR>
The Reef has been created over many thousands of 
years by living creatures called coral polyps.<BR>  
In the reef are over  1 500 species of fish, 400 species of coral,
4 000 species of molluscs and 240 species of birds. The reef is an important sanctuary for protecting many endangered
species. It is also an important research area for scientists to help us understand the underwater world. 
The reef is the largest marine park in the world. The reef stretches
from Cooktown in the north to Bundaberg in the south with many access points avaliable.<BR> The Great Barrier Reef is like an 
underwater jungle with coral reefs flourishing in the warm tropical seas.
 The reef can be viewed from glass bottom boats or a semi submersible vessel or by snorkelling or diving. 
          Many operators are licensed to conduct tours and day trips to many parts of the reef with diving instruction
          available.

<BR></FONT>
<H2><FONT COLOR="PEACH">HOW WAS THE REEF FORMED?</FONT>
<BR>
<H4><font color="LIGHT BLUE">
The reef has taken thousands of years to build. It is formed by coral polypys dying and new ones
building on top of them.
Polyps build skeletons of limestone around themselves and it is
these limestone skeletons that form the reef. These polyps are attached to the reef and colours 
include vibrant blues, greens, puples, reds and yellows. Corals are cnidarians (nid-air-ree-ans) a group of animal
which are invertibrates. Invertibrates have no backbone and no skeleton.<BR> 
A polyp has a soft cylindar-shaped body with a singe hole for feeding and getting rid of wastes.
They also have tentacles which have stinging cells which capture plankton and other prey. There are 
three main types of corals: hard corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Most hard corals and some soft
corals have tiny algaie called zooxanthellae (soo-an-thel-lay) growing in their tissues. This is what 
gives corals their colours. If the algae or the coral polyp die, all that is left is a white limestone skeleton.
 Algae help their host coral remove calcium carbonate from the water. Corals use the calcium to buuild their 
limestone homes.
It is illegal to collect any of the coral.
<BR><BR>
<font color="black">HARD CORALS-</font>There are 350 species of hard coral. Each hard coral polyp makes a limestone, cup-
shaped home called a corallitee. This provides support and protection for their soft bodies. When they are not
feeding most corals extend their tentacles to feed at night. The extended coral polyps look like beautiful small 
flowers. Hard corals with algae live only in tropical and subtropical regions. Hard corals have delicate branching
growths that look like trees or shrubs whether some look like big, flat plates or tables with a supporting column underneath.
Others resemble solid rocks with patters on them whether others have designs like ribbons and leaves.
<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="BLACK">SOFT CORALS-</font>Soft corals also make calcium carbonate to support and protect themselves. Their flesh 
is not protected inside a rocky cup instead within their body tissues they have small, hard pieces of calcium called spicules. 
These spicules are often hidden but some soft corals have clusteres of sharp spikes on the outside of their bodys. Spicules stop other 
animals from eating soft corals. Some corals also load their flesh with poisons so they won't be eaten. Unlike the hard corals which
only have six tentacles the soft corals have eight.
Gorgonians often live in deeper water where stong currents carry food to them which they filter out of the water. They look like plants 
waving in the sea but they are colonies
of polyps built around a flexible core of spicules.

<BR>
<H2><FONT COLOR="PEACH">HOW ARE THE ISLANDS FORMED?</FONT>
<BR>
<H4><font color="light blue">

The Great Barrier Reef has many islands which are scattered throught the reef. These islands are
popular retreats and exotic escapes for people to visit while visiting the reef. The islands were formed
by sand being washed up onto shallow coral reefs by srorms, tides and currents. Birds and tides bring seeds
and slowly and island forms. These islands form slowly
and can also disappear very quickly. Large islands can also vanish during storms and heavy seas.

<P>
<Font Color="black"> Tropical rainforests are by far the richest habitat on Earth. As many as 30 million species of plants and animals - more than half of all life forms - live in tropical rainforests. At least two-thirds of the world's plant species, including many exotic and beautiful flowers, as well as plants with medicinal value, occur in the tropics and subtropics.
<P>
Rainforests are part of the global weather system. Destroying them alters the hydrological cycle - causing drought, flooding, and soil erosion in areas where such events were previously rare. The cutting of forests also changes the albedo or reflectivity of the earth's surface, which in turn alters wind and ocean
current patterns, and changes rainfall distribution.</H3></Font>

<HR><H2><CENTER>MOUNTAINS</CENTER></H2></HR>
<L><HR><P>Mountain is a landform that stands much higher than its surroundings.  Mountains generally are larger than hills, but what people call hills in one place may be higher than what people call mountains elsewhere.  For example, the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming stand higher above their surroundings than do the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma. 
</P>

<P>
Mountains generally have steep slopes and sharp or slightly rounded peaks or ridges. Many geologists consider an elevated area a mountain only if it includes two or more zones of climate and plant life at different altitudes.  In general, the climate becomes cooler and wetter with increasing elevation. In most parts of the world, a mountain must rise about 2,000 feet (600 meters) above its surroundings to include two climate zones. A mountain may be a single peak, such as a lone volcano, or it may be part of a mountain range.  A group of mountain ranges forms a mountain system.  The Pacific Mountain System, for example, is made up of the Cascade Range and several other mountain ranges along the west coast of North America. 
</P>
<P>
Mountains occur in the ocean as well as on land.  Many islands are mountains on the ocean floor whose peaks rise above the surface of the water.  The world's longest mountain system--the Mid-Atlantic Ridge--is almost totally underwater.  It stretches more than 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) from the North Atlantic Ocean nearly to Antarctica.  Some of the ridge's highest peaks form such islands as Iceland and the Azores. The height of a mountain is usually expressed as the distance that its peak rises above sea level.  Mount Everest, long considered the world's highest mountain, rises 29,028 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level, according to a 1954 survey.  Later surveys have suggested new heights for Mount Everest, as well as for K2, which is also called Mount Godwin Austen or Dapsang.  Some surveys suggest that K2 may be a few feet higher than Mount Everest.  Someday, scientists may measure the mountains again and reach a final conclusion about their heights. 
</P>
Mauna Kea, a volcano on the island of Hawaii, has the world's largest rise from base to peak.  From the volcano's base on the floor of the Pacific Ocean to its peak 13,796 feet (4,204 meters) above the ocean surface, Mauna Kea rises a total of 33,476 feet (10,203 meters)--more than 6 miles.<HR/>
<HR><H2><CENTER>CLIMATE</CENTER></H2></HR>
<P>Mountain ranges strongly affect air movements and precipitation patterns.  The temperature of the air drops as altitude increases.  Cold air cannot hold as much moisture as warm air can.  As a result, when warm, moist air moves up the windward slope of a mountain, it cools and the water vapor it holds condenses into water droplets.  The water then falls on the windward slope as rain or snow.</P>  

<P>By the time air passes the crest of a mountain, it has lost most of its moisture.  For this reason, the side of the mountain away from the wind, called the leeward side, is drier than the windward side.  The dry area on the leeward side of a mountain range is called a rain shadow.  Many of the world's deserts lie in rain shadows.</P>

<HR><H2><CENTER>FORMATION</CENTER></H2></HR>
<P>Mountains are created over long periods of time by tremendous forces in the earth.  Since the early 1960's, earth scientists have developed a theory called plate tectonics that explains the formation of mountains and other geologic features.  According to this theory, the earth's outer shell is made up of about 30 rigid plates of various sizes.  The continents and the ocean basins make up the outermost part of these plates.  The plates are in slow, continuous motion.  Most mountain building occurs along boundaries between plates.</P> 

<P>There are five basic kinds of mountains, depending on the process by which they were formed: (1) volcanic mountains, (2) fold mountains, (3) fault-block mountains, (4) dome mountains, and (5) erosion mountains.</P>  

<P>Major mountain ranges may include more than one of these kinds.  The Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, for example, began as fold mountains.  Later, geologic forces pushed up large blocks of earth's crust in the range, creating fault-block mountains.</P>

<HR><H2><CENTER>MOUNT EVEREST</CENTER></H2></HR>

<P>Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.  It rises about 5 1/2 miles (8.9 kilometers) above sea level.  It is one of the mountains that make up the Himalaya, on the frontiers of Tibet and Nepal, north of India.</P>  

<P>Surveyors disagree on the exact height of Mount Everest.  A British government survey in the middle 1800's set the height at 29,002 feet (8,840 meters).  The 1954 Indian government survey set the present official height at 29,028 feet (8,848 meters).  But a widely used unofficial figure is 29,141 feet (8,882 meters).</P>  

<P>Mount Everest was named for Sir George Everest (1790-1866), a British surveyor-general of India.  Tibetans call Mount Everest Chomolungma.  Nepalese call the mountain Sagarmatha.</P>  

<P>Many climbers have tried to scale Mount Everest since the British first saw it in the 1850's.  Avalanches, crevasses, and strong winds have combined with extreme steepness and thin air to make the climb difficult.  On May 29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepalese Sherpa tribesman, became the first men to reach the top.  They were members of a British expedition led by Sir John Hunt.  It left Kathmandu, Nepal, on March 10, 1953, and approached the mountain from its south side--which had been called unclimbable.  As the climbers advanced up the slopes, they set up a series of camps, each with fewer members.  The last camp, one small tent at 27,900 feet (8,504 meters), was established by Hillary and Norgay, who reached the summit alone.</P>

Hawaii's long and colourful history began when the volcanoes first rose out of the sea, and life, born by water and wind, was established . Lush vegetation and rugged beauty greeted the first human settlers - the Polynesians.

<p> 
Hawaii is world famous for its beauty and pleasant climate. Its deep-blue seas, brilliantly coloured flowers, graceful palm trees, and magnificent waterfalls provide some of the country's most thrilling scenery. When tourists arrive in Hawaii, they often recieve <I>leis</I> (wreaths of flowers). Traditional feasts called <I>luaus</I> are popular attractions. Hawaiian dancing is called <I>hula</I>. 
<BLINK><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/U_S__States/Hawaii/Environment_and_Nature/">Environment and Nature</A></BLINK>
<p>
Some of the Hawaii's colourful customs come from the Polynesians. Other customs have been contributed by Hawaiians of Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, and Samoan ancestry. Hawaii is the only U.S. state that was once an independent monarchy. 
<BLINK><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/U_S__States/Hawaii/Culture/">Culture</A></BLINK>
<p>
Pineapple and sugar cane brought big business to Hawaii as plantation owners imported Chinese and Japanese contract laborers to work the fields, establishing the interracial nature of Hawaii's population.

<p>Hawaii has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. People take a lot of pride in the condition of their beaches. The center of activity in Hawaii is the ocean and its shoreline where  people can enjoy sunning on a simple 'day at the beach'. Conditions for scuba diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, surfing and windsurfing, and jetskiing are always excellent. 
This is one of the best features of Hawaii which makes the place attractive. This coastline is known for its many fine family beaches . Activities like snorkeling, tide pooling, swimming and any general ocean recreation are popular in the beaches.

<P> To meet the growing demand for wood products, the timber industry is
destroying tropical and temperate rainforest ecosystems world wide.
RAN's rainforest wood campaign calls for a ban on further logging in
all primary forests or previously unlogged areas.  Currently, RAN is
working to redirect U.S. demand for wood products from the
temperate rainforest of British Columbia and the tropical rainforest of the
Amazon to ecologically sound alternatives.</FONT>
<P>
<P>FLAVORS OF THE RAINFOREST PAPAYA PEPPER SAUCE is a delicious blend of papaya, honey, aged pepper mash and
 exotic ingredients gathered or grown by the people who inhabit the rainforest.

 Each time you purchase a bottle, you are helping to preserve the rainforest. Two (2) percent of the total sales of this
 sauce are donated to a non-profit group devoted to protecting the rainforest.</FONT>

<P>	In 1995, RAN once again demonstrated its unswerving committment to saving the rainforests. Though there is still much work to be done, RAN kept the momentum up
on all fronts: 
			After extensive campaigning by RAN and others, the British Columbia government decided to reform logging in Clayoquot Sound, following the advice of a government-appointed Scientific Panel. However, RAN is watching to see that Clayoquot's pristine areas are never logged, and that the logging that does occur adheres to the spirit of the agreement. Another good piece of news for the Sound came when the New York Times ended its paper contract with MacMillan Bloedel. New York-based Coalition for Forests and NRDC spearheaded this campaign, with support from RAN and Clayoquot Coalition.</P>
<Br>
<img=http://www.ran.org/ran/jpegs/wrr_mar_3.jpg>
<Br>
<br>
<P>The battle over Clayoquot Sound and British Columbia's ancient temperate rainforest is far from over. There were over 200 mudslides in Clayoquot Sound clearcuts this rainy season, some of which took out large areas of replanted trees. This is further evidence that clearcutting is categorically unacceptable.
			RAN witnessed a major victory when Ecuador ended oil prospecting in the Cuyabeno.  Reserve, home to indigenous tribes and an immense diversity of flora and fauna. In Brazil, undermined indigenous peoples' land titles, posing a new challenge to human rights and rainforest preservation in the Amazon. A concerted effort will be needed to head off its potentially devastating consequences. Also, there are several new road building projects in the Amazon basin that RAN is investigating for future action targets.</P>
<HR>
<P>RAN's campaign against Mitsubishi's rainforest destruction moved ahead, with Mitsubishi's American electronics and auto companies funding a systems group on forests and joining the Future 500 corporate environmental group. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Corporation sold off its shares in Daiya Malaysia logging firm, and put on
hold a salt-mining project on the Baja Peninsula that would have destroyed one of only
three grey whale nesting areas. In addition, 40 universities and colleges have either
passed or are working on resolutions banning Mitsubishi products and recruiters from
their campuses.
			During World Rainforest Week, two RAN employees scaled the Mitsubishi-owned Bank of California in downtown San Francisco, and hung a banner protesting Mitsubishi's destruction of rainforests. Rainforest groups around the country,also participated in World Rainforest Week activities. *RAN's grassroots activities grew as new RAGs joined the family, including two in Ghana and one in Nigeria. The 1995 Chautaqua RAG conference was a success. More than 200 attendees gathered at Clayoquot Sound, met with First Nations Indians, and gained a greater understanding of B.C. logging issues.
<br>
			RAN's information department answered thousands of calls and letters; our education programs reached 20,000 students. RAN called for a boycott of Shell Oil following the execution of playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in Nigeria, and participated in several protests against the oil conglomerate. The activists were killed by Nigeria's dictatorship after protesting Shell's devastation of their Ogoni homeland.

       RAN's "Boycott Mahogany" campaign made waves with its boycott efforts, which included protests at a casketmakers convention in San Francisco and at the nation's largest furniture show in High Point, North Carolina. Also, in 12 cities, RAN and RAGs held protest at furniture stores. New Jersey's Rainforest Relief RAG got Barnes and Noble to agree to stop using mahogany for store bookcases.</P>

<i>Facts-
Australian rainforests</i><p>
		Tropical rain forests grow in tropics and subtropic areas. These forests are typically composed of big, old evergreen hardwood trees that grow in several layers, or groups according to height. The tallest layer may reach heights of 150 feet (45 meters) or more. Other layers, composed of shade-tolerant trees, reach to about 100 feet (30 meters). Smaller trees and vines cover the ground in the shade in a dense tropical rain forest. These forests are often called jungles, though true jungles are dense thickets of brush and vines that may not have any tall trees.

One of the largest and most important tropical rain forests is in South America. It extends from the mouth of the Amazon River, in Brazil, to the mouth of the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, covering millions of acres. Another great rain forest is on the waist of Africa, and much of Southeast Asia is covered with rain forests. In the United States, only the southern tip of Florida and Texas has tropical forests.

In the front from left to right are Andrew, Scott, Brenton and Regis.<BR>

My dad use to have a 200CC that I could ride a bit but he sold it and bought a 650CC which I can't ride, so I'm trying to get a 100.

In class we do a little bit of every subject, most subjects are maths, english, social studies and science.  Mr.halloran usually tells you to take out your maths books and then starts talking about english, so we just ignore him while he's off in his own little world. Over all it is not very exciting in the classroom.

I think Somerset College is a really good school because it isn't an all girl school or an all boy school. We have just raised money for a technology centre which opened on Founders day. We are now raising money for an oylmpic swimming pool which is 50m long and 25m wide. Once we have raised enough money for the swimming pool we will be raising money for much more sporting equipment. In grade 6 and 7 we have an exchange program with the kids from Cairns. This year we will be going to Cairns because last year they came here. The college is located in Mudgeeraba which is a really nice quiet place.

My favourite sports are basketball and netball.  In the netball season I played Centre on the A team.  I can never get the ball in the hoop in basketball which is really annoying.  Last year I didn't get one ball in when we were playing against another school!  Shows how good I am.  My favourite foods are chocolate and McDonald's.  My favourite singers are Alanis Morrissette, No Doubt and La Bouche.  My favourite TV programmes are The Nanny, The Simpsons and Party of Five.  I recently saw Phenomenom at the cinemas and it is the best movie.  I'd write more about it but if someone read this who was going to see it, it would spoil it for them.

<P><!--**** Your Facts About Somerset Go Between these Stars ***-->
An interesting thing about Somerset is the new robot that we have in the technology room.  It's just an arm!  On Founder's Day, it cut the cake for us.  Another interesting thing about our school is that we are raising money to build a swimming pool and a sporting complex.  The pool will be 50 m long and 25 m wide.  Every year our school has a chocolate drive and sells chocolates but we usually eat it all ourselves instead of selling it.

The wildlife in Australia is unique to that of the rest of the world because most of the animals can't be found in other countries.  Such animals are kangaroos, koalas, brolgas, wombats, emus and black swans.  Weather in Australia is mostly sunny and is only cold in the middle of Winter.  Ayers rock is an inportant landmark of Australia that can be found in the Northern Territory.

I love animals.  My favorite animals are birds, so I have 13 of my own.  They are 9  Budgies ( 5 of which I bred myself), 2 Cocketeiles and 2 King Quails.

I enjoy scary rides especialy the Wipeout and rollercoaster at Dreamworld.  I am looking forward to the Gold Coast show this year.

The Religious Education program for the Senior students is less formal than for the earlier years. The
classes are arranged on a seminar basis and there is no assessment.<p>
<p>
The Headmaster takes each year level as a whole during alternate terms.  In the other term, the year
level is split between five or six teachers who lead the group in discussions of various topics.<p>

<H3>The History of the internet</H3>
<ul>
<Li>Circa 1965 the concept of "Hypertext" was invented by Douglas Englebart at Stanford and Ted Nelson at Brown University. This concept was to be integrated into the interent as the World Wide Web over twenty years later.
<Li>1969: ARPANET created with 4 computers.,Funded by U.S. defence department which wanted a redundant communication and control system that could survive a nuclear attack. The concept was based on Packets rather than point-to-point connections and used Matrix routing of packets with intelligent routers that could adjust automatically for disabled sites. TCP (transfer control protocol), TELNET and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) were part of the original design. IP (Internet Protocol) was added as an extended network was visualized.
<Li>
1971: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) standard implemented for e-mail.
<Li>
1972: First public demonstration of ARPANET.
<Li>
1975: Defense Communication Agency (DCA) assumes administrative control of ARPANET.
<Li>
1978: U.S. Government declares TCP/IP as its networking standard. OSI (Open System Interconnection) standards committees formed
in Europe about this same time to counter U.S. dominance of networking technology.
<Li>
Early 1980s: DCA funds the creation of Berkeley UNIX which incorporated TCP/IP into AT&T UNIX to create a ARPANET compatible
"open" operating system.
<Li>
01/01/83:  TCP/IP became the standard protocol for ARPANET. About 1,000 hosts on-line.
<Li>
Mid 1980s: DCA creates its own separate network (MILNET) but continues to fund ARPANET. ARPANET still used primarily by computer scientists working on military and other govt. contracts.
<Li>
1985-86: NSF becomes involved with ARPANET and expands access to a many Universities. NSF starts construction of NSFNET linking super computer centers with high speed circuits. 10,000 hosts on line (1987)
<Li>
1990: DCA disbands ARPANET and it is incorporated into NSFNET (i.e. Internet)100,000 hosts on line.
<Li>
Early 1990s: The number of Internet hosts (primary nodes) increases by 10-15% per month. 
<Li>
1992 World Wide web released by CERN: 720,000 internet hosts on line
<Li>Late 1994 Internet access made available to public: over 2 million hosts on line: estimated 20 -30 million internet users
<Li>1995 to 1996 The World wide web becomes a ubiquitous medium for communication and provision of information with represention from all all facets of society: The realistaion the information revolution.
</UL>

<H3>How the internet became user friendly</H3>
"The Internet"is a huge hotchpotch of computers connected willy nilly by wires, optical fibre and satellite links. Like "A brain the size of the planet". The computers that make up the internet are all over the globe, even in Antarctica.<ul>

<Li>The people who came up with the concept were the US military:If you have your resources widely distributed and multi connected, one bomb doesn't muck up your information network

<Li>A lot of academics thought it was better used for collaborating on research and keeping in touch with idle banter using electronic mail. And so the Internet was spawned and separated from its military mentor.

<Li>The World Wide Web was born in the late 80's when some Nuclear Physicists at CERN thought it would be really nice to make part of the internet really easy to use. They integrated the 1960's concept of hypertext into the user's view of portions of the net called the "World Wide Web" in 1993 support for pictures and other multimedia was included</ul><P>

Basically the internet is set up so that<ul>
<Li>You can chat and exchange information directly with others
<Li>You can send information to people (email)
<Li>You can set up information to be retrieved by anyone with enough permission and enough interest</ul>

There were two problems for people who wanted to get information from the internet<ul>
<Li> Knowing where to find the information
<Li> Easily retrieving it</ul>

The problem of finding the information has been dealt  with in three ways:<ol>
<Li> Special Search Programs that travel the internet (usually a predetermined subset of it) searching for key phrases in documents they find and returning a list of locations.

<Li> Some people put a lot of effort into keeping indices of information, so as long as you know where such an index is you can branch out by using it. People who want their information to be found can email such major index sites as Stanford University with information about what they have published on the internet.

<Li> "Hypertext links" which enable you to travel from site to site around part of the internet called the "World Wide Web" following  the information trail without  you having to realise what site you are at or are going to or even what the general information structure at that site is.</ol>

The second problem, Easy retrieval of the information, has gone through several stages,  but basically there were two sub problems:<ul><P>

<li>How to automate and mask the arcane computerese required to retrieve information.
<Li>Establishing a standard way of doing this between different information providing sites.<P></ul>

These issues were made a fair bit easier to deal with since nearly all the computers providing information on the internet ran on a version of an operating system called UNIX, and the way that a UNIX network passed around information (called TCP/IP) was standard throughout the world.<P><ul>


<Li>Initially there was File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which is typing intensive and requires you to know Unix commands.

<Li>Then this was augmented by Telnet which can display text based menus but is usually set up differently at different sites. Most libraries accessed via the internt still retain a telnet interface.

 
<Li>Then a lot of sites agreed on a common way  to set up access called "Gopher"services, which is  essentially a hierarchy of folders, set up at each site with actual information at the bottom level only.<P></ul>


Even with Gopher, it meant you had to "travel"to a site then delve through the folder structure they had set up to get to the information... then came <strong>Hypertext</Strong> which has reduced the need to follow the structure imposed by individual sites.<P>
 
Hypertext has become the standard. With powerful PC's and fast communication gear, It can have pictures, movies, sound and text. You read it like a magazine and if something that you wish more information on is highlighted, you select that bit and off you go to see more information, you can remain totally oblivious to the actual location of that information and still get to it.

The elimination of distance and time was most useful in matters academic, many businesses could benefit similarly.. but until recently there were two implicit internet rules:"No Commercial Activity" and "No censorship" 

With powerful personal computer, fast phone connectivity and the easy internet  navigation via the Hypertext  format, the pressure for universal access to the internet for email and information became very great.  Once the first rule fell by the wayside ... naturally because of the second... Business got into the act of providing Internet connectivity for other businesses and individuals. <P>

<H2>Internet Issues</H2>

The Internet is a new concept for most people it contains a world of information and a new way to communicate with people and a new cost structure. The internet has burst upon popular culture from the academic world, just after we all got used to economics and market forces ruling the roost. Most people, including the "experts" are uncertain of what to make of such freedom of access to information, or what its potential is, or how social and economic paradigms will be altered by it. It is however very apparant that it has already become a common and much discussed part of daily life, even for those who do not use computers.

<H3>Searching the Internet</H3>
"The web is a great place to find what you are not looking for". Information on the web is vast and structured in a myriad of ways, using a "search engine"to find particular information and verifying it is a function of how much you really want to get it, experience and  self discipline.  <P>
<CITE>A search engine is a facility provided by various organisations and individuals on the Internet, whereby you fill in a form in regard to what you want to find. The library of links  maintained at that site is searched for relevant matches which are returned to you as a web page (or pages). </CITE>
<H4>Finding information</H4>
<ol>
<Li>Choose some search engines, <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/search_engines.html">there are hundreds</A>, there are even search engines to find search engines. The facilities of search engines vary, but to use them effectively you need a grasp of Boolean operators (brackets ands, nots and ors) and the particular syntax used by that engine.
<BR><CITE>e.g. Find documents containing "Prime Minister of Australia" AND (Paul Keating" OR "John Howard")</CITE>
<Li>Select and cross check the results: As with any information you need to ensure its validity by finding various corroborating items or relying on the integrity of its source, of course this is the case with any research but it is especially so in the case of the web when so much can arrive at your screen.
<Li>Be aware of distraction! It is so easy to find and follow links irrelevant to the original purpose of the search, this along with the number of references that can be returned is probably the most novel aspect of this medium. That is not to say that it is a bad thing to let serendipity guide you... in fact it is probably one of the most wonderful aspects of the web, it just may not help get a particular assignment in on time!
</OL>

<H3>Copyright</H3>
Check out "Being Digital" by Nicholas Negroponte on this (and other issues).
Copyrights protect the expression and form of an idea (as opposed to patents which protect the idea). Computers can take a stream of numbers and express them in the form of a chart used in weather forecasting or stock movements or even as a musical score. The receiver rather than the producer defines the form of expression. With automatic agents gathering the information, not even the original data can be attributed to a single source.
<P>
Another aspect is the ease  and low cost with which thousands of copies can be made and distributed (via email for example) or more to the point how the reference alone can be bandied about giving access to the information for many at no return to the provider.  Copies can be exact and even improvements on the original (e.g with pictures).
<P>
Since copyright law is a reactive process relying  on the difficulties, costs  and organisational structures of producing copious copies, it is doomed to collapse. The paradigm is that if it is on the web then it is copiable, indeed just viewing a web document involves copying it to your computer. 
<P>
A concept for payment which has worked for years with computer programs and continues to do so is that of Shareware: Copy and use the software, if you like it, pay for it, thus registering you for support and updates. This  marketing method is used elsewhere but it has been spectacularly successful in computing despite the obvious leakage. The success of Microsoft is largely due to Bill Gates countenance, some say encouragement,  of pirating of his software in the 80's.
<P>
Schools have to make policy based on the provision of copy versus the liabilities at law, when the law itself has lost its stability and relevance. There is no safe way out, there will be test cases but the test will be more of the law than the breach. Indeed it would seem to me that the concern of liabilities at law should be viewed as a sub issue to "what is right and honourable". A policy of "in loco authoris" may prove workable "what would you expect to be ok if you were a (reasonable) author of the work"

<H3>Censorship</H3>
The issue of censorship on the  internet interacts strongly with the issue of freedom of speech and privacy. For example, a Republican bill put before the United States Senate in June 1995 calls for abolishment of moves to censor the internet as a fundamental violation of constitutional rights. More recently the "Communications Decency act" was signed into law by congress and the president, and the promptly overturned by a unanimous decision of the bench of the U.S. Federal court as being unconstitutional. The court made the time to learn about and experience the web. The turn about in congress reflects the uncertainty of political will and familiarity on this issue... knowledge is power, the legislature don't know, so their power over  this issue is demonstrably diminished by the trend to reaction over action.
<P> 
<A HREF="train.bomb.html">Home made bombs</A>: The "Jolly Roger Cookbook", that tells you how to make bombs has been around for many years, on and off the internet. Its internet home moves around the San Francisco bay area, as one site closes down another opens, this makes it hard to find but nonetheless there. One hit and multiple copies can be made. In past years the same "bomb book" has been available on local bulletin board services and even, the gossip has it, in some libraries. 
<p>
<A Href="porn.html">Pornography</A> of every conceivable (and inconceivable) kind is available on the internet. There is however some risk of discovery for those who provide or access "illegal" or "amoral" information in general. Since every computer connected to the net has to have a unique number (called an IP address) the source of information is traceable to a particular information server. This does not necessarily locate the server physically, but the numbers are registered to organisations or individuals. Similarly the computer retrieving information also has a number, although this may be harder to tie down to a particular computer, the number will still be registered to an internet service provider's domain. Hence the flow of information is in theory traceable, but in practice only applicable in very specialised cases.
<P>
There has been much talk about "firewalls", monitoring what can be accessed, but firewalls are primarily ineffective and generally better at preventing internet users getting into your computer than preventing you from accessing sites on the internet.  Here are some schemes regarding censorship, except for the first they can be used cooperatively.
<OL>
<Li>A system can be established where information is surveyed (perhaps even downloaded as is the practice in places with limited access to the internet) and access is only permitted to those prescribed sites. This scheme drastically reduces the scope, currency and usefulness of the internet.
<P>
<Li>There are "banned lists" being bandied about, they contains sites thought (by whom!) inappropriate, Software such as <A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com">Surfwatch at http://www.surfwatch.com</A> is available to mask them and a reporting and update scheme to keep lists relevant, but such lists cannot be exhaustive and may not fulfil everyone's requirements and will only be effective against the more stable and appropriately named sites.
<P>
<LI>There is software available to detect and reject pages containing certain phrases. This scheme has obvious context and language problems.
<P>
<Li>The providers of such material, especially the more obvious and stable sites, often have a vested interest in dissuading access by minors since even failed litigation can be expensive and they may have kids too. 
<P>
There are several self rating schemes under development, after all the internet is a cooperative world, where sites rate themselves or sites are labelled by other organistaions (which you might trust a bit more) on criteria of their own choice.  A universal labelling scheme called <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/">Platform for Internet Content Selection</A> (PICS) has been approved by the W3C (The controling body for internet standards) and is already included in the capabilities of some browsers... its sort of a Vchip for the internet
<P>
 Some "naughty" sites already have warnings on introductory pages.  For example the opening page to <A HREF="http://www.hottgirls.com/">http://www.hottgirls.com/</A> is entirely a Warning page with advice and links to sites such as <A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com">Surfwatch</A>, which provide shielding against sites such as themselves.
<P>
Another cooperative strategy involves an initial exchange which require that a password be sent via email to the signatory, this is also an avenue for charging for services. The encyclopaedia Britannica has such a scheme for its subscribers and I'll bet there is an exposed breast and the word sex in there!
<P>
<LI>A policy of self discipline and responsibility with access to the web being seen as equivalent to access to printed material. Bringing it to school and displaying it are subject to disciplinary measures. Some take this further to a student, family and school "contract". This is probably the best solution since the protective measure is "installed" in the user and therefore (theoretically) effective whichever conduit to the internet or other source they use.
</ol>
<P>
Given that the web is penetrating society to such an extent that many students have access from their own, or  friends homes and their expertise with installing and uninstalling software increases, it is doubtful whether any save the last two schemes will have any relevance in the near future. It is a shame that school policy is necessarily dominated by concern for legal liability in the face of unstable laws and a more litigious society. Some lawyers are making noises that indicate that they think chasing URL's more lucrative than ambulances.
<p>
Censorship on the internet is a two edged sword as <A HREF="prodigy.html">Prodigy services</A> (an IBM Sears-Roebuck joint venture) has found. Having adopted a policy of censoring its on line forums. A libel suite was taken out against them over comments posted on a bulletin board. The jist of the claim which has been upheld by a judge is that editorial control means responsibility for content.
<p>
One of the most prevalent uses of the web in our school is  "Chat" sessions, most popular with girls often between themselves but just as easily with people all over the world. It is unlikely that a local lurker will be on line and that a dangerous physical liaison may occur, nevertheless this is not the only form of harm that can occur.
<P>
Virtual assault  on the internet can occur in forums where people assume personae and communicate in "rooms". This scenario is much like the time honoured game of Dungeons and Dragons, in fact the term MUD or Multi User Dungeon/ Dimension derives from this initial use. The only form of communication in a MUD is via plain type on a text screen, there are no pictures. Suppose  you have defined a character called Dr Sandy, another character in the room, Mr Bungle types "Dr Sandy is bashed about the head by Mr Bungle". This "action" is broadcast (in type) to all members of the MUD in  the "room" at the time... doesn't seem like much does it? But this is a virtual world, developing its own social structure, evolving faster than the real thing, the participants feelings are not separate from this environment, the assault hurts the assaulted, and effects all others who witness it. A lengthy but worthwhile story <A HREF="data.rape.html">"Data Rape"</A> (The Good Weekend 19 February 1994) addresses this issue and the broader issue of social development on the internet
<P>
The web is also prone to a far more insidious form of censorship, "news speak" .  If a web document is considered authoritative then it should not be able to be altered without notice. It is very common for documents to be corrected or "updated" for errors in spelling and grammar, or "errors" in statistics or "errors" in use of language (political correctness) or errors in "doctrine". The solution to this Digital signatures, this is numeric code that summarises the content of the document much the same way as a check digit on your Bank card (that is the expire date by the way). Software is available to check for such signatures but a universal standard has yet to be agreed. 
<H3>Education</H3>
Students use the web for general research and communication
<H4>Equity</H4>
Or How do you get girls to use computers?:
<ul>
<li> My experience is that boys tend to use computers to tinker about, girls tend to use them less frequently but to more purpose. 
<li> <A HREF="http://www.theglobe.com">Web chat forums</A> have provided the motivation for girls to brave the computer labs, they are also popular with boys but a little less so. There are now almost equal numbers of boys and girls using the labs out of class time
<Li>Once the initial familiarity with computers is established on the basis of an attractive activity (such as chat forums), diversification of usage seems to follow more easily
</ul>

<H4>Teaching on the Web</H4>
Apart from using the web for general research and communication, it is also used to deliver curriculum and to be a conduit for assessment. The question arises: <BR><B>Could some school classes be attended over the internet?</B>
<BR>
Perhaps "notes on the net" and email could <B>partially</B> replace scheduled classes at school:
<A HREF="http://mc.cqu.edu.au/subjects/85321/">Some universities are running academic courses this way</A>, as has<A HREF="http://www.opennet.net.au/partners/oten/"> distance education</A> for a long time. Some schools are also moving their course material onto internal webs (intranets).   The web makes this more practical and has some interesting possibilities which have been found to add to rather than detract from the personal touch:
<ul>
<Li> People get to "talk" one on one or one to many at their own convenience and in their own time via emai, hence people tend to be less formal and more informative over email.
<Li>The teacher can annotate the on line "text book" with everybody's questions and answers
<Li> Students could attend  to the course whenever and wherever they wanted to, or even "attend" different courses at different institutions.
<Li> There would be more flexibility to the schedule and location for the social and personal development activities which are very important part of education (and are more fun too). Students could attend their maths classin grabs of time whilst on an extended excursion. 
</UL>
<P>
This is not yet practical for most as:
<UL>
<LI> course material has to be developed from the written versions, <LI>web skills need to be learnt by all concerned,
<Li>connections and equipment need to be cheap and ubiquitous, but with the advent of "Network computers" and "cable modems" (due for release at the end of 1996), The price of a combied TV/computer with cable connection to the internet with bandwidths 100 times what we have currently will probably not be too much more than a good TV today.
</UL>
<H3>Economics</H3>
<li>Finance on the Internet: 
<P>There is already a first virtual bank <A HREF="http://www.fv.com">http://www.fv.com</A> on the internet, Barclay's and others are following suite. This is a concern for those responsible for National monetary policy  as  the financial markets as well as the commerce of services on line is truly international possibly using "<A HREF="bankers.wake.html">internet funds</A>" rather than a particular national currency.  The international internet provides a new marketing challenge for all forms of commerce, and an additional challenge to national control of financial systems.
<P>
<li>Marketing on the internet:
<P>Marketing is different on the internet, perhaps the best indication of how to go about it comes from the  established commercial electronic service <A HREF="marketing.html">"CompuServe"</A>. The main difference between this medium and others is that people do not commonly even inadvertently see your product presentation, you have to PULL them in rather than PUSH your product at them. Nevertheless there is a lot in common with other marketing environments: You have to give free advice in order to show potential customers what you or your product can do, maintain an (electronic) presence in the right (electronic) places and follow up your custom. Even the smallest of firms can advertise their wares on the internet. An individual can have as big a presence as a large firm because the cost of establishing any number of Home pages and advertising their existence is negligible. 
<P>
There are a plethora of "new companies" getting in for the quick kill, offering moderate cost advertising to provide a minimal cost service to companies who are not aware that push advertising just does not happen on the web</ul>
<H3>Government</H3>
Some residential presincts are being built with access to (local Government) networks and thus to the internet. Many suburbs have access to cable services which will soon have "cable modems" allowing access speeds orders of magnitude above what we have today, the social ramifications are already beginning to be felt, at local government level they will effect the mix of expenditure and the delivery of services and information to homes. The Government becomes the community information provider, a vast improvement over the still life of local libraries and probably in conjunction with commercial services.
<P>
In the 1996 Federal election the major parties' policies were placed on the web by them as soon as they were announced, in full, for all to see. Not subject to editors whims. It would seem that our political personages have some concept of this new medium and the power to publish without intervention.
<P>
On the state and federal level, the relevance and control of governments over transactions is dwindling as geographic and political boundaries are more easily crossed they will tend to change their identity, already multinational companies cross pollinate the political policies of nations and states but it is the more subtle effect of individuals freely communicating across the world which I think will ultimately blunt borders. It may lead to a big change in the concept of nationality to more of a cultural club than an economic edifice.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
The Internet is here, it is  a replacement mail exchange by distributed organisations such as the Anglican Church, Greenpeace and my family.  Most of us are still only mildly aware that another world has enveloped ours. The virtual world grew from the imaginings and prowess of the real world, now the relationship is more symbiotic than dependent, the boundary is blurring. <A HREF="future.net.html">Do any of us know enough</A> to make safe decisions in this brave new world? How safe is it not to take the risks?

<H1>Course 2: Browsing the Web</H1>
<P>
We will be using "Netscape", one of a number of "Web browsers"  popular on Windows and Macintosh computers.
</CENTER>

<HR>
<H1>Session 2.1: Browsing</H1>
This course is intended to show you how to access information given a computer set up with a working copy of Netscape Version 2.01 and an internet connection. 
<P>

<H3>Using hypertext links to Access web documents</H3>
The World Wide Web (aka WWW or just "web") contains a collection of documents set out in a special way called HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Each document is called a "page" even though it may actually print out on many pages. Programs which can locate, interpret and display these pages are called "web browsers". Netscape Version 2.01 is the browser we will be using, Microsoft Explorer, and Mosaic are others.  The Netscape browser is virtually identical in Unix, Macintosh and Windows incarnations. A text only browser called Lynx is also commonly available on  Internet service providers Machines which you can use in terminal mode.  (Terminal mode is where your computer screen and keyboard control a session which is actually running on your service providers machine, such sessions are usually limited to the display of text only with no mouse support.)<P>

To start Netscape, once you have located its icon, just click on the icon twice quickly <i>(this is called double clicking)</I>, if your mouse has several buttons, use the left one.<P>

After Netscape launches it will display a "page", the first page of a set organised by one person or organisation is called their "home page".

<h3>What the Netscape menus and buttons do</h3>
The menu bar is the set of words "File, Edit, View..." at the top of the screen. To "drop" a menu, move the mouse over its title and hold down the mouse button, the options available for the selected menu will appear below. To select an option move the mouse (still with button depressed) down, as you pass over an item, it will hilite. To select the currently hilited option, release the mouse button. <br><i>(by the way the action of depressing and holding the mouse button, then moving the mouse, eventually releasing the button is called "dragging")</I><P>

The following is a summary of the more commonly used menu items. When you look at the menus you will see that some items have a shortcut key equivalent. For example the New Windows option on the Macintosh can be activated from the menu or by holding the command key  down and pressing "N"<ul>
<H3>File menu</H3>
<Li><B>New Web Browser:</B> One really useful feature of Netscape, and one that most people don't discover for a while, is that it can do several things at once. Selecting "New Window" gives you another copy of the Netscape screen which you can use to browse somewhere completely different, for example while the first windows is busy downloading a picture the second window could be sending a search request for information on a totally different topic. Please note that the more screens that are active the slower the performance will be overall. Each Netscape window you open is called a "session"<P>

<Li><B>New Mail Message..</B> Netscape has the capability of sending and receiving electronic mail <I>email</I> the details of this are covered later, both it and the next option <B>Mail Document...</B> bring up a mail form which allow you to type in text and attach documents such as pictures or web pages (as is the case with "Mail Document..") to other people whose email address you know.
 <P>
<Li><B>Open Location...</B> Presents a dialog box in which you type a URL to go to (URL is an abbreviation for "Universal Record Locator" which is basically an address for a page  and these are  explained later) <P>

<Li><B>Open file...</B> Presents a dialog box which asks you to locate the file (on your computer network, not the internet) that you wish Netscape to try(!) and display (Netscape expects documents to be presented in a particular way, however it is particularly forgiving in this regard).<P>

<Li><B>Save as...</B> Allows you to save the current page (but usually without pictures) onto your computer  or network as text or source. This topic is covered in more depth later in the course.<P>


<Li><B>Close...</B> means close the current window, if it is the only Netscape window that is open then you will just be left with the menu bar showing, so you may think you are no longer in Netscape at all.<br><i> by the way, the Macintosh (and Windows machines) can have several programs running at once. To use a particular one, click and hold on the icon at the top right of the screen, it will display a menu of the currently operating programs from which you can then select. (in Windows use ALT ESC to switch between programs)</i><P>

<Li><B>Page setup...</B> Always ensure that you have specified the correct paper size for your printer before printing. Most US programs default to US Letter size paper, in Australia we use A4.<P>

<Li><B>Print...</B> is self explanatory, although one thing to watch for is clipping: When you select this menu option Netscape adjusts the window width to match the page width set in page set up, so that what you see is what you get<P>

<P>

<Li><B>Quit</B> means exit from the Netscape program altogether, all windows that are open will be closed automatically, anything being downloaded at the time will be deleted.
</ul><P>

<H3>The Edit Menu</H3> contains only two useful commands for the purpose of this course.<ul><P>

<Li><B>Copy...</B> If you have hilited some text on the current page (you do this by dragging over it) then the copy option is made available, the text is copied to the computer's "clipboard" from where it can be pasted into a word processor document. Each time you copy something it replaces the current contents of the clipboard. Copy will not work with pictures in Netscape, there is another way of copying these: simply hold down the mouse button over a picture and a pop up menu will appear giving you several options including "copy"<P>

<Li><B>Find...</B> Finds words or phrases in the text of the <b>current page</b> only.
</Ul><P>
<H3>The View Menu</H3><ul>
<Li><B>Reload...</B> reloads the current page from its original source, this is useful if transfer was interrupted or you think the document might have changed since you last loaded it. Netscape "caches" pages, that is it stores them on your computer, if a page is called on a second time, Netscape checks if it already has it and loads it up saving a lot of time. Reload forces Netscape to get the page from the original source, for editing pages or pages that change often this is a very useful feature
<P>
<Li><B>Reload Frame</B> Some pages appear as a set of different frames or sections,  effectively displaying several pages on the one screen, this option reloads the currently selected frame (page)
<P>
<Li><B>Load Images...</B> Loads the pictures for a page, pictures are separate computer files, they may get muddled during a loading process (you'll see a broken frame instead) or you may have the "Auto load Images" option turned off.<P>

<Li><B>Document Source</B> If your Netscape is properly set up selecting this option will launch a word processor program and show you the actual HTML code for the current page, it is very useful for teaching yourself how to write in HTML.
<P>
<LI><B>Document Info</B> Shows details about the structure and storage of the page, it is not of particular interest for browsing the web
</ul><P>

<H3>The Go Menu</H3> 

Netscape keeps a history of the sequence of pages you have traversed since it was last opened., this can be seen using the History menu in the window menu or,  to a restricted extent, at the bottom of the go menu<P><ul>

<Li>the options <B>Back</B> and <B>Forward</B> allow you to traverse this sequence one page at a time, you can hilite any one of these to return to that page<P>
<P>
<Li><B>Home</B> is a special location, the home page as set in the Netscape preferences (in the Option menu). Home is usually set to your internet service provider's page, your own home page or the page you most frequently access. The choice of Home page is up to you<P>

<Li><B>Stop Loading</B>, quits loading the current page, this is very useful if the page is taking a long time to download or if it turns out not to be what you want, or you can already see sufficient of it for your purposes. A message "Transfer interrupted!" will be displayed on the page, if it did not load completely before you pressed stop. There can be a bit of a delay before stop actually works (and the meteors in the big N stop flying)<P>

</ul>

<H3>Bookmarks</H3> 
Bookmarks are a way of keeping track of and cataloguing pages you have found. This menu displays your bookmarks and allows you to add the current page to your list. Bookmarks are managed (added, deleted, altered and moved) under the <B>Bookmarks item in the Window menu</B><P>

<H3>Options</H3><ul>
<Li><B>Preferences...</B> has a huge range of options which have to do with setting up Netscape, it is useful to set a few of these to  personalise Netscape for your use<P>
<ol>
<LI><B>Set your home page</B>, in the General Preferences, Appearance screen: type in the address (URL) of the page you wish to use as your home page (alternatively you can navigate to that page, copy it from he location box and paste it into this box (copy and paste are in the edit menu)
<P>
<Li><B>Set Telnet and text editor programs</B> Telnet is the old way of accessing the internet, but it is still essential. Netscape needs to know where to find this so it can automatically launch it if needed, press the Browse button and navigate to your telnet program. The text editor program is what Netscape uses to display the text of a document in its HTML form (that is, the way it was typed) 
<P>
<Li><B>Select the servers Netscape will use</B> Netscape needs to feed off various information sources, to get Mail and News, to do this select the Mail and News option, select "Servers" and type in the details and select options: the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and POP (Point of Presence) servers are usually the same, ours are "mail.somerset.qld.edu.au", POP userID is your email address "someone@somewhere.edu.au" , you can select the directory you want mail stored in when you get it from the server and various other options. A news server is also need to access news groups, it will have a different name form the mail server, usually starting with "news".
<P>
<LI><B>Set up your email</B> although you already entered your POP userID, there is more to do under the Identity option, your email and reply to address are the same "someone@somewhere.edu.au" , Your name should be your real name e.g. "Mable Figsworthy" and your organisation your school or Company name in our case "Somerset College"
<P>
</ol>
There are many other options, but this is enough to personalise Netscape so that you can use all its features
<P>

<li><B>the list of checked / unchecked options</B> display various menu features as buttons on each Netscape screen. Ensure all these are checked. In particular<B>Show Location</B> shows a location box containing the URL of the currently displayed page. and <B>Auto load images</B> toggles the coincident loading of pictures with the text of pages. Large pictures can take a long time to load, so this option is very useful if you just want the text, you can select "load images" from the  view menu if you decide you want the pictures later on.
</ul><P>

<H3>The Directory  menu</H3>  has pointers to particular places on the internet, pre programmed into Netscape, the are linked to locations  supported by the Netscape company. There are many other sources of information and search procedures than are at these sites, but these hard wired options do provide a good initial gateway to the World Wide Web, a Netscape Handbook and reference for WWW jargon.
</ul><P>

<H3>Window Menu</H3> This gives access to the Mail and News features of Netscape, these are effectively separate programs which allow you to manage Email and Newsgroups. 
<Ul>
<Li><B>Address Book</B>  The Address book allows you to record peoples' email addresses and details and create Nickname for them, also the add list in the item menu allow you to  add lists of people, do that you can email many people at one time, effectively this involves adding a folder to the address book menu and dragging email items about between folders, this operates in a similar way to both the Macintosh and Windows (file manager), except that the lists of people contain "aliases" of the original, thus if you edit the original (say a change of email address) then all the others will automatically change. You can have he same item more than once so a person can be in several folders (mailing lists). To email lots of people just use the folder name or nickname as the recipient, or double click on the folder or individual in the address book
<P>
<LI><B>BookMarks</B> are managed in a similar fashion to the Address Book, folders (and separators) can be constructed and bookmarks dragged about between them, added, deleted, duplicated and edited. One very useful feature of bookmarks is the ability to "Save Bookmarks As..." a normal web page, so that they can be accessed directly from the Browser window.
<P>
Book marks and addresses can be imported and exported thus making them transportable between computers.
<P>
<LI><B>Netscape Mail and News</B> allow you to manage your mailings and postings (postings are what you call mail to news groups) in detail, the options are too copious to go into now, but the most useful menu of all is:
</ul>
<H3>The Help menu</H3>
The only one not named in the menu bar, on the Macintosh you will find it under the <B>?</B> menu, it has links to a complete handbook explaining all the features of Netscape and more... mind you the help is on the internet so you have to be connected to access it, on the other hand it will always be up to date!

 <H3>The Netscape buttons</h3>
The buttons which appear when the options menu selections are checked duplicate some of the menu commands, they are provided as short cuts.

<h3>What is Hypertext</h3>

Hypertext is text with special hot spots called "anchors" or "links" <A NAME="loopback1">which</A> appear as <A HREF="#loopback1">coloured and/or underlined words</A>. These anchors are linked to other parts of the same page or to different pages. When you click on such a hypertext anchor your computer will attempt to display the page or part of the page  to which the link points. If the page doesn't exist then you will get a rather disconcerting "Fatal Error" message with a link to "CERN", the Centre for Nuclear research in Switzerland, the origin of the World Wide Web. 

The language used to define anchors and other features of page layout is called HTML HyperText Markup Language, and it is the main subject of the "Creating Web Pages" course.

<h3>How do you know where you are</h3>

An option in the "Options" menu of Netscape allows you to "Show Location.." If you are viewing this in Netscape, try selecting and deselecting this option. When the option is checked , a thin rectangle appears with the network or internet address of the current document. These addresses will mostly start with:
<Ul>
<Li> "http://" if the page is somewhere on the web. http stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. (notice the two forward (not back) slashes)
<Li>"file:///" If the page you are viewing is on your computer or a computer on your own network and not necessarily on the web (Notice the three forward slashes).
</ul></P>

The rest of the address follows: For example<P>
<A HREF="http://www.somerset.qld.edu.au/html_manuals/courses/browsing_2.1.html">http://www.somerset.qld.edu.au/html_manuals/courses/browsing_2.1.html</A> </P>is the address for this page  on the web, it is on a computer called www.somerset.qld.edu.au (a computer can have multiple names) in a folder called "html_manuals", which has a folder inside it called "courses" which contains the file called "browsing_2.1.html"

<P>A page can also be found on an internal network, where it is referred to as a file "file:///K9/webstuff/a_page.html", this means that the file is on a disc called "K9", in a folder on K9 called "webstuff", which contains the file called "a_page.html"

<b>The generic name for all such addresses is URL or "Universal Record Locator".</b><p>

 The computer's name is usually sufficient to determine where on the web you are: for example "www.somerset.qld.edu.au".<ol>
<Li>"www" indicates that the computer has a World Wide Web server
<Li>"somerset" is the name of the organisation
<Li>"qld" including the state is a new convention
<Li>the type of enterprise that owns the computer is usually one of<ul>
<Li>com: commercial e.g. www.apple.com
<Li>edu: education e.g.www.bond.edu.au
<Li>net: network e.g. www.abc.net.au
<Li>gov: government e.g. www.whitehouse.gov
<Li>org: organisation e.g. www.liberal.org.au
</ul>
<Li>"au" stands for Australia, "uk" for England. if there is no country code it is a reasonable bet the computer is in the United States. Sometimes a state or city name also forms part of a URL. Remember that country codes may reflect that country's spelling of their name, although English is the defacto web language.
</ol>

There are no hard and fast rules on the internet, but this form of naming is the defacto standard. Here are a few computer names and URL's
<ul>
<Li>www.bond.edu.au Bond university
<Li>www.anu.edu.au  The Australian National University
<Li>www.apple.com (notice no country abbreviation for the U.S.)
<Li>www.whitehouse.gov guess!
<Li>www.mit.edu   MIT's home page
<Li>www.ed.gov  U.S. department of Education
<li>info.dpac.tas.gov.au/home.html Premier and cabinet of Tasmania (home.html is a good guess for a home page name)
<Li>www.cuni.cz   Charles University, the Czech Republic
<Li>www.zvne.etf.hr/uninfo.html University of Zagreb, Croatia
<Li>www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp Hiroshima University
<Li>www.ac.msk.su The Russian academy of sciences (in Moscow)
</Ul>

Once you've seen a few URL's, guessing others becomes easier, but as with all things on the Web there is no rigid convention.<P>

The rest of the URL, after the computer name is the internal path on the host computer, finally leading to the document, for example "browsing_2.1.html". The ".html" or sometimes ".htm"  postfix is another loose standard indicating that the document is a web page rather than just a picture ".gif" or a sound ".snd" etc. In the settings menu, under preferences: helper applications, you can assign a program to help Netscape display or play files it accesses, these are triggered by name postfixes, have a look to see the huge variety.

<P>You can also tell where a link will take you (or what it does) without actually clicking on it. There is a small status bar at the bottom of the Netscape screen, it tells you how the loading of the page is progressing (in a rather confusing way!), but it also shows you what a hypertext link's URL is when you move the mouse over the link.

<h3>Bypassing links and Going Places: The language of URL's</h3>

One very useful aspect of developing and interpretive skill for URL's is that you can jump to places whose URL's you know or whose URL's you guess without having to rely on hypertext links, after all hypertext links will in general point to information relevant to the current page and you may wish to switch to something completely different. There are two ways of doing this.
<uL>
<Li>Select go to location from the file menu and type (or paste) your URL into the box and press return or enter
<Li>In the location  box, Type a new URL or paste one or edit the URL already there then press return or enter.
</ul><P>
Either way you'll get a lot of "Fatal error" responses as you are learning.

<H3>Access means other than http and file </H3>
At times you may find links to resources outside the web, Netscape can lead you into different realms with different rules. The World Wide Web itself covers less than one percent of the information contained on the internet
<P>
There are several other prefixes for URL's other than http and file, these include
<ul>
<Li><B>gopher: </B>an older  attempt to have a common internet interface, gopher servers present information in hierarchies of folders.<P>

<Li><B>telnet:</B> for telnet sites (often not strictly part of the internet but accessible via it, library catalogues are generally connected this way. Telnet is an older style browsing program, text only with menu driven commands and no mouse support, usually different at each site. Most terminal sessions use telnet access. <P>

<Li><B>ftp:</B> which stands for file transfer protocol the most rudimentary and most general of internet tools for retrieving files, it requires considerable expertise and local knowledge to use effectively.<P>

<Li><B>news:</B> for news groups for example news:alt.folklore.urban where you can read and contribute comments and ideas.<P>

<li><B>mailto:</B>  allows you to send email, for example typing<br> <B>Mailto: btaylor@somerset.qld.edu.au</B> <br>
will bring up a mail form which you can fill in and it will be addresses from you (that is the account you are using) to Bill Taylor, whose alias or "username" is btaylor who has an account at (@) somerset.qld.edu.au.
</ul> 
<H3>Retrieving information</H3>
Every page and image you see is retrieved from its origin and stored temporarily on your computer (and possibly others along the way) in what is called a "cache", but you may wish to store the information in a more permanent form. One main reason to do this is to cut down on your "on line" time, by storing pages to read later or to store pictures or other types of files.<P>
<ul>
<Li><B>Copying from the screen, information and addresses.</B>
You can hold down the mouse button and drag across any text on the screen, it will be highlighted, you can then select "Copy" from the edit menu, switch to a word processor or notebook program and select "paste" from its edit menu. Obviously this requires you to have a word processor document open concurrently with Netscape and to know how to switch form one program to another. Note this won't work with pictures, only text. To copy a picture, simply hold the mouse button down whilst over a picture and a pop up menu will appear, one of the options is "copy"<P>
<Li><B>Saving what you see (almost) as text or source</B> A quicker, "I'll check it out later" way to record information is to save the entire page. to do this select "Save as..." from the File menu. You have to select a file name, a location for the file to be stored and whether to save as "source" or "text". The last decision is unique to web browsers such as Netscape, the others are common to all programs that save files.
<uL><P>

<Li>Save as TEXT, saves the page as plain words only, formatting such as big headings or bulleted lists like this one will be lost and so will any pictures. Saving as text allows you to load the file into a word processor without any spurious codes.<P>

<Li>Save as SOURCE, saves the page in its HTML language form, great for teaching yourself how to write HTML and great for loading back into Netscape as a "file:///"  such as when you aren't actually connected to the web, mind you the hypertext links may no longer work since the page has been taken out of its original address space. Another thing that you'll notice is that the pictures aren't saved either, its just the text. The reason for this is that pictures are stored individually as  separate files.<P>

<Li>Netsacpe 1.1 and higher  has an excellent pop up menu which is activated when you hold the button down over something on the screen, the options in the menu vary depending if the mouse is over a picture or a URL or hilited text. If over a picture, you have the option of loading the picture into Netscape, copying it or saving it to disc as a gif image.<P>

<Li>You can also PRINT the current web page, in which case you'll get a paper copy, pictures and all, but even here it pays to play. The width of the page as displayed on the screen is the width that will be printed, this means that if your screen display is wider than the actual paper page then the printout may be clipped.</ul></ul>
<HR>
Netscape provides easy access via its menus and buttons to particular internet sites. Be aware however that these sites are neither definitive nor comprehensive of the information available on the internet. In fact the World Wide Web embraces less than ten percent of the information on the internet and the Netscape buttons only access a subset of the World Wide Web.

<H1>Session 2.2: Interacting with the Web</H1>
</center>
<HR>
The World Wide Web has two main uses: 
<UL>
<LI>information resource:
<LI>Communication forum:
</UL>
<P>
The methods used are
<ul>
<Li>Telnet, gopher and ftp
<Li>Search Engines
<Li>Email
<Li>News Groups
<Li>Chat Engines
</ul>
An "engine" is a program running on some computer which takes information you supply via a form on your computer and performs an action which usually results in you receiving information. Another term often used is HyperText Mark up Language (HTML), the information you see on your screen is written in this "Language"
<HR>
<H3>Telnet, gopher and ftp</H3>
These are methods used to access specific institutions, 
<ul>
<li>ftp (file transfer protocol) requires you to know what you want and where it is 
<li>Telnet is a method of access to specific institutions facilities (such as a university library). Once "there" you run a session on the facility's own computer, the rules and procedures are identical to a session running on a terminal physically at the facility. This type of access simply takes the distance out of the proceedings, you do from home what you would do if you were at a terminal at the facility. Usually the terminal session is mouseless and text only.
<Li>Gopher is an attempt to standardise the method of access across the internet, it still requires a knowledge of "where you are", as it provides a hierarchical folder structure.
</ul>

<H3>Search Engines</H3>
To search more generally on the internet there are institutions which have established and maintain indices of information categorised along broad lines. Such indices can attain a critical mass, whereby they become so popular that people actively seek to have their own URL's included in the lists. New URLs (Universal Record Locators) are submitted by email or by forms, some indices even have an automatic, do it yourself, way of adding URL's to their indices.<p>

Another way that indices are maintained is by the index organisers sending out search "worms" into the internet to retrieve new sources of information and check the continued existence of old ones. One feature of the internet is that there is no guarantee of service. URL's come and go all the time, these worms help maintain the accuracy of their host indices.<P>

World Wide Web indices are generally categorised to make it easier to find information on a given topic, however there is so much information that it is often better to let the host computer do the searching for you. Programs designed to seek out information for you are called "search engines".  The way that you indicate what you want to find is by  filling in a <B>Form</B>: clicking inside a text box and typing in some keywords, sometimes checking or unchecking some options and clicking a button on the screen marked "submit" or "search".  Here is a (very simple) form which accesses "Lycos" a very popular search engine:<P>

<form action="http://www.lycos.com/cgi-bin/pursuit" method="get"> 
<input size="40" type="text" name="query"> <input type="submit" value="Search"><br>
</form>
<P>
The search engine selects URL's and details matching your criteria and creates a web page, consisting of links to the information it has located. Learning the best way to set up a search is best achieved by experience. Remember <b>No single search engine has access to all the information on the internet</b> and they all work a bit differently from each other.
<P>
Here are some Web index sites to explore</b><ul>

</ul>

<H3>Electronic mail (email)</H3>
One of the original uses of the internet was for people to communicate on a one to one basis, <B>email</B> was developed in order to do this. Because people do not always have their computers on and because they are not always in front of them, email is stored and processed on your internet  service providers computer, which is always on and also on secondary servers just in case the line is down. A user has a mailbox located on a host computer. When she dials in she can collect her mail and send mail to other users' mail boxes. 
<P>
Email has increased in scope from one to one text communication:
<ul>
<Li><B>Attachments</B> allow for files (such as pictures) to be sent 
<Li><B>Mailing Lists</B> allow email to be sent to many people at the same time.
<LI><B>List servers (listserv)</B> automatically send mail sent to them to a list of subscribers, these are similar in purpose to News groups but have a different mechanism.
</ul>
<P>
Email requires the recipient to specifically reply to the sender in order for the sender to receive information. A better solution in general for distributing commonly requested information was to set it up so it could be retrieved without anyone specifically having to send it. World Wide Web pages are an implementation of this idea.<P>
<P>
<B>Email in HTML links</B> Most internet software kits include a special mail program such as "Eudora", that are very flexible and powerful. Netscape 2.01 can handle email too. Send only capability was included in earlier versions of Netscape because part of the HTML standard supports references to email addresses . That is, a Hypertext link in a document can be set to send mail to an individual rather than load another page as is the more normal situation. When you use such a link, the location box reads  <b>"Mailto:aperson@a.place"</b> rather than "http://" or "file:///".<P>

The effect of the Mailto: command is to produce a special form that is divided into several sections<ul>
<Li><B>From:</B> Your account name and email address. This is  picked up from the mail settings you have entered into the browser's preferences
<Li><B>Mail To:</B> The recipient of the email (aperson@a.place) this can be edited
<Li>and / or <B>Post To:</B> A newsgroup (covered later)<P>

<Li><B>Subject:</B> a short statement that reflects the purpose of your correspondence, or commands to automatic list servers<P>

<Li>There is a wordprocessing field into which you can type or paste your message. Only plain text is supported.<P>

<Li><B>Attachments.</B> are documents you send along with your message, you can attach the text or HTML source of the document specified in the small Document window, but the most useful feature is the ability to attach any file at all (picture, fully formatted Wordprocessor document, a movie, a sound or even a computer program).<P>

<Li>The <B>Send</B> button attempts to send the mail to your service provider, when this is successfully complete the mail form disappears. It is then up to your internet service provider's computer to send the mail to the specified email address. So when the form disappears it does not mean that the intended recipient's email account has received your message. It does mean that your message has successfully made the first hop to another machine</ul><P>

<B>email addresses</B> Just as with URL's there is a certain loosely observed standard format for email addresses. Usually an email address has the person's code name called a <B>username</B> followed by an @ sign which is pronounced "at" then the institution or organisations name, called a <B>domain name</B>. For example
<b><A HREF="mailto:btaylor@somerset.qld.edu.au">btaylor@somerset.qld.edu.au</A></b> is the address of <B>btaylor</B> the username for Bill Taylor  <B>@</B> at the domain <B>somerset.qld.edu.au</B> which comprises <B>somerset</B> College in <B>qld</B> (Queensland) which is an <B>edu</B>cational institution in <B>au</B>stralia (email addresses are CasE sEnsiTiVe). <P>

<B>Note</B> domains and usernames are by no means automatic, they must be set up properly and registered and authorised by various other providers in order to function, so you can't make up your own and expect it to work. The syntax is not definitive, only a convention. My address could have been "B.Taylor@somerset_college.edu.qld.au"
<P>
There are several ways to determine someone's email address:
<ol>
<Li>Locate it on some WWW page or in a directory. Most large institutions have a search engine for locating staff details including their email addresses, or they may also have some procedure to help you figure out the syntax.<P>

<Li>Guess! This can be a bit tricky since "B.Taylor" "b.taylor" and "btaylor" are considered different by most mail systems, although some sophisticated systems can interpret small variations of an email address.<P>

<Li>Find it in some other medium (such as TV show credits, from the radio and newspapers)<P>

<Li>Ring up and ask!</ol><P>

Although the internet and email has yet to lose its cooperative spirit, do not expect to much of an individualised reply from <A HREF="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">mailto:president@whitehouse.gov</A>, but you will get a reply!<P>

<B>efficient email</B> On line time is not often free, so if you intend to send email then it is best to type or organise it before dialling up. An efficient practice is to <ol>
<Li>If you need to get an email address: log on record the email addresses to which you wish to send messages, then log off, (you can't collect your email with Netscape, however you can have "Eudora" open concurrently)<P>

<Li>Use a sophisticated word processor to construct your email responses, so that you can make use of spell checking and cutting an pasting (simple typed email can only be in plain text, but you can attach formatted documents as well)<P>

<Li>Cutting and pasting text from currently open documents (whether they be Netscape pages or in some Word processor)<P>

<Li>Once you have organised your responses and new mail, log on again paste or attach your document(s) and send.</ol>

<H3>News Groups</H3>
A newsgroup is analogous to a notice board, people attach messages on topics loosely relevant to the title of the group, these messages may start new "threads" of conversation or add to a current thread, people do not have to be "on line" at the same time to read the messages. Some newsgroups are moderated to assist in ensuring a legal, relevant and polite level of discourse, all messages are subject to review by a stipulated person (to whom you email your submission) before it is displayed for all to see. 
<P>
There are many News servers on the internet, they exchange information regularly in order to provide as many groups as possible to their users, nevertheless no single news service has all the newsgroups. Netscape allows you to access several news servers at once (look under the file menu)
<P>
The URL for most newsgroups starts, unsurprisingly, with "news:" although there are also a lot of "gopher" and "ftp"  ones as well.
Newsgroups can exist within the structure of organisations such as the educational research archive ERIC <A HREF="ericir.syr.edu">http://ericir.syr.edu</A>. , these are mostly moderated newsgroups,  Indeed a lot of  journals are on line Some organisations ,such as the IEEE, The Institute of Electrical Engineers,  <A HREF="http://www.ieee.org">http://www.ieee.org</A>, the worlds largest technical professional society, publish their journals ONLY on the internet.
<P>
<Li><B>Reading News</B> Netscape makes it easy to view Newsgroups. A Newsgroup page contains a set of message headings as icons in folders much like the operating system of your Macintosh or Windows computer. Netscape also provides options as buttons and in its menus to allow you to keep the display current and to make navigation through the message "threads" easier. A message thread is a sequence of related messages. There can be many simultaneous topics of discussion in a news group. Sometimes the topics become so disparate or the traffic so heavy that a newsgroup will split into parts, newsgroups which loose participants die out. It is an evolutionary process: Survival of the most popular <P>

<H3> sample of the news group news:aus.bushwalking</H3>
<UL>
<LI><A  HREF="#null"><B>Re: Can they arrest you? (was Re: Water Catchment Areas.)</B> - Geoff Niland</A>  (15)

<P>
Messages are indented to indicate the thread of a discussion, the text can be viewed by clicking on the title or icon, you can email the originator or post a reply to the newsgroup or both.
<P>
Some of the functions available are:
<Li><B>Post a New Article</B>:Start a new message "thread", this is used to create a new topic, to add an (indented) reply to a current topic, you <B>respond from the text of the message</B>, where there will be  options to post or post and mail replies to the newsgroup. Remember email goes only to the person whose message you are answering. If yoy post a message to a newsgroup then review the entries in the newsgroup a little later on you will see your message there. You may have to press "show read or new articles" but it will be there under the message you were responding to.
<P>
<Li><B>Mark all articles read</b> articles that have been read are not displayed when you first access a newsgroup, this button marks all articles as "having been read" so that only newer articles will be displayed thereafter. <B>Show Read articles</B> displays articles marked as having being read.<P>
Newsgroups are frequently "archived", that is all the old articles are stored somewhere else, this is entirely up to the people who run the newsgroup. For example aus.bushwalking is started afresh each month, the old messages are archived elsewhere on the web
<P>

<Li><B>Subscribing to a Newsgroup.</B> Netscape can display a list of Newsgroups you commonly access, you can subscribe and unsubscribe from them by clicking on the "tick" next to the group name and you can add them by using the "Add Newsgroup" option in the file menu, or selecting from a list of newsgroups, to toggle the display of  newsgroups and messages within the groups, select options from "options menu" To Post messages to a newsgroup or mail to an individual select New message form the file menu, or click the to: Newsgroup (mail) button, to follow up a message (add to the thread) select the re Newsgroup (mail) button (this will produce a mail form containing the quoted text of the current message)

Here are some Newsgroups chosen more or less at random, there are thousands:
<ul>
<Li><A HREF="http://www.anatomy.su.oz.au/danny/usenet/aus.books/index.html">aus.books</A>

<H3>Chatting with others</H3>
This is a proved a very popular use of the internet, particularly for female students. To be "in" on the internet it is vital to know about the sexiest parts of it, (no I don't mean the porn). These are the real time communication forums such as <ul>
<Li>IRC Internet Relay Chat:
<Li>MUD Multi User Dungeon (or Dimension or Domain) the name is a relic from one of the first and still common uses of the internet, the game of Dungeons and Dragons. A cult game for somewhat socially maladjusted university students and hence well patronised by the computer boffins who have built the internet, and of course the D&D concept is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings:  try "The two towers Mud" <A HREF="telnet://empires.stanford.edu:9999">telnet://empires.stanford.edu:9999</A> Which has a WWW helper at <A HREF="http://www.servtech.com/staff/stisa/towers/home">http://www.servtech.com/staff/stisa/towers/home</A>
<li>MOO is a "MUD Object Orientated", Object Orientation is the sexiest form of computer programming, suffice to say that this is an advance on the concept of a MUD.</ul><P>

The emphasis in these forums is real time communication, they date  from the beginnings of the internet, they are not always part of the World Wide Web, often accessed by Telnet applications, they are also usually text only, all you see is what people currently on line type. A history is usually available, so that you can catch up the thread of a conversation. Indeed a newsgroup is like a MUD with the emphasis on the what has been recorded rather than what is being currently "said". MUD topics can take the form of fantasy games to live public political talkfests (though these may actually be the same thing), here is an example of (what was) a live talkback session on the internet<P>

<CITE><A href="http://www.ambook.org/bookweb/events/live.html">http://www.ambook.org/bookweb/events/live.html</A>: Live <b>Chat</b> with Newt Gingrich, Senator Paul Simon, Harlan Ellison and Studs Terkel</a> - Mr. Gingrich will field questions from Internet users around the world for approximately 30 minutes on Monday morning June 5th. at 11:00 a.m CDT.

<H3>The World Wide Web and internet in slight perspective</H3>
The World Wide Web is like the worlds biggest Compact Disc information resource, yet it encompasses only about ten percent of the information on the internet. It is intended to be a showcase for information, a chaotic and huge library. Accessing this library is Netscape's main purpose. The other function of the internet is to facilitate communication between people. Email is the method of communicating privately.  A Newsgroup is a way of communicating publicly and mainly asynchronously. A MUD is a way of communicating publicly and mainly  synchronously, and also testing your skill and imagination.

<H1>Creating Web Pages</H1><HR>
 Assumed knowledge: that you know how to use Netscape and a Wordprocessor and particularly how to save, find and open files.
</CENTER>
<H1>Session 3.1:  Simple Document Creation</H1>
<H3>Configuring Netscape to allow viewing of HTML source</H3>
Probably the most useful feature of Netscape for learning how to write your own World Wide Web pages is the <B>View menu</B> item <B>Source... </B>. If Netscape has been set up appropriately then the page will be loaded into a wordprocessor as a text file in its raw form, so that you can see the coding required to produce the page.<P>

 To ensure your copy of Netscape is properly set up we need to look in the <B>Options menu: General preferences</B> item  then select the <B>Applications</B> tab. Press the View source: browse button and navigate to a copy of the program <B>Simpletext</B><P>

You could use Microsoft Word or ClarisWorks, they offer spell checking and advanced editing techniques, but require multiple selections to save files in the TEXT format essential for HTML pages. Simpletext is probably a better initial choice because it does not have many options which could otherwise complicate the process of learning HTML. Once you understand the basics it is best to switch to a more sophisticated programs.<P>

<H3>Some Background on HTML</B>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language: Hypertext is wordprocessing text which responds to "clicking" in a way which you can define, for example loading in another document or generating a mail form. This text is usually formatted differently from other text by colouration or underlining or both<P>

HTML is a subset of SGML (Standardised Generalised Markup Language) which was developed for use in institutions when the word processors were text based and could not display text in the way that it would appear when printed. This mode of production continues to be seen as a virtue because:<P>

<Li>Documents are fully transportable to other computer systems that work differently. This is because the files contain nothing but ordinary text hence the term <B>text file</B> which is a "lowest common denominator" for all computers. Any SGML or in the case of the World Wide Web HTML compliant viewer such as Netscape would be able to display and print the document. For example Netscape or Mosaic or lynx can all display (in their own way) HTML pages on Macintosh, Windows or Unix computers.<P>

<Li>Document formatting is automatic, all spacing and styling of text is subject to the rules of the viewing program which will be set  to  the styling policy of a particular organisation, the same document produced at a different institution would appear properly displayed under its different style requirements without any modification. Hence this text only approach allows for the same document to meet multiple document standards. In the case of the WWW automatic universal  compatibility is essential as the same page can be read by many different web browsers on many different computer systems.<P> 
<Li>Most web browsers support unofficial extensions to HTML, for this is how the language evolves, but it does hold dangers for page creators, as other browsers may cope differently or not at all with these extra features.<P>

<H3>Exercise 1: Get your software ready</H3>

In order to create your pages you need to be able to use the Macintosh  to locate files, create folders, launch programs and switch from one program to another.

<P><B>Create a blank page<ol>
<Li>Create or Locate and open a folder called "web_pages"<Li>Locate the programs Netscape and SimpleText
<Li>Launch both Netscape Simpletext, we will be flicking between them
<Li>Save the blank simpletext document as <i>your_name.html</i> into the web_pages folder (use underscore instead of space and use all lowercase characters) 
<LI>return to the finder and check that <i>your_name.html</I> is in the web_pages folder
</ol></B>

<H3>Exercise 2: your_name.html</H3>
A loose convention with web pages is to give them a postfix such as .html or .htm, if you are using a windows or dos environment remember that file names can only be 8 characters long plus a postfix of 3 characters, this is a BIG limitation since pages exist on a unix machine which supports longer file names (as does the Macintosh)<P><ol>


<Li>Type (or select, copy and paste) the following into your simpletext page<P>
<PRE>&ltHTML&gt&ltHEAD&gt<br>
&ltTITLE&gtMy First WWW Page&lt/TITLE&gt<br>
&lt/HEAD&gt<br>
&ltBODY&gt<br>
&ltH1&gtHello World Wide Web I say&lt/H1&gt<br>
&ltH5&gton you I'll have a play today!&lt/H5&gt<br>
First of all I learn 5 heading styles there be and of course <Br>plain text like me. Not that I am always thus for &ltB&gtBold&lt/B&gt  am I <BR>at times just to show a &ltI&gtdifferent slant&lt/I&gt<br>
&ltHTML&gt&ltHEAD&gt</PRE><P>

<Li>Now save the document you have typed (see the file menu)<P>
<Li>Switch to Netscape and open your_name.html (open file from the file menu)<P>
<Li>Switch back to Simpletext make some changes to your file save it again and then switch back to Netscape and press the <B>Reload</B> button
</ol><P>

<Cite><B>Note</B> Netscape is forgiving when it comes to its interpretation of HTML, one thing you can get away with is to leave out the HTML HEAD and BODY references but in the interests of guaranteed continued compatibility, especially with other browsers,  you should always include this formatting </CITE>

<H3>Exercise 3: Line breaks and paragraphs</H3>
Because of the amount of formatting text that appears in a raw HTML document, it is nigh on impossible to decide where lines will wrap or whether blank lines are intended as paragraph breaks or simply to make the HTML more legible, so in HTML, extra spaces are always reduced to one space and blank lines are ignored.
<ul><Li>To force a line break in a document you use  <B>&ltBR&gt</B> (BR for "break")
<Li>To force a new paragraph which will be separated form the previous one by a blank line use <B>&ltP&gt</B> (P for paragraph)</ul>

Add the following to <I>your_name.html</I> then save it and reload it into Netscape:<P>

<PRE>I really need a break here &ltBR&gt I've been working so       hard  on 
   my HTML that I'm almost para-&ltP&gt-graphic(!) Sorry that was a really bad
line so perhaps I'll         try another &ltBR&gt Ahhh thats better</PRE>
<P>

.. It should look like this when you display it in Netscape...<P>

I really need a break here <BR> I've been working so       hard  on 
   my HTML that I'm almost para-<P>-graphic(!) Sorry that was a really bad
line so perhaps I'll         try another <BR> Ahhh thats better
<P>

Note that <ol><Li>Extra spaces and all line breaks are ignored
<Li>You can put a &ltBR&gt or &ltP&gt marker within an HTML line or even mid word.</ol><P>

<H3> Exercise 4: Lists </H3>
HTML supports various forms of lists and sub lists:
<UL>
<LI>Unordered Lists
<LI>Which appear  <B>Bulleted</B>
</UL>
<ol>
<Li>Ordered Lists
<Li>Which have an automatic numbering system</ol>
<DL>
<DT>Data Lists
<DT> which have a title
<DD>and definition lines, a line in any list can take up more than one line on the screen, the formatting will continue appropriately onto the next line.
<DT>for example: 
<DD>Perisher Blue
<DD>Biggest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere
<DD>Accommodation available on snow, Jindabyne and Thredbo valley
<DD>access via road and ski tube
<DT>Falls Creek
<DD>Biggest ski resort in Victoria
<DD>Accommodation available on snow and Mt Beauty
<DD>Access via road from West only
</DL>
<P>
Here is the HTML which generated the above lists

<PRE>
&ltUL&gt
&ltLI&gtUnordered Lists
&ltLI&gtWhich appear  &ltB&gtBulleted&lt/B&gt
&lt/UL&gt

&ltol&gt
&ltLi&gtOrdered Lists
&ltLi&gtWhich have an automatic numbering system
&lt/ol&gt

&ltDL&gt
&ltDT&gtData Lists
&ltDT&gt which have a title
&ltDD&gtand definition lines, a line in any list can take up more <BR> than one line on the screen, the formatting will continue appropriately<BR> onto the next line.
&ltDT&gtfor example: 
&ltDD&gtPerisher Blue
&ltDD&gtBiggest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere
&ltDD&gtAccomodation available on snow, Jindabyne and Thredbo valley
&ltDD&gtaccess via road and ski tube
&ltDT&gtFalls Creek
&ltDD&gtBiggest ski resort in Victoria
&ltDD&gtAccomodation available on snow and Mt Beauty
&ltDD&gtAccess via road from West only
&lt/DL&gt
</PRE><P>

Make a list of each kind on your <I>your_name.html</I> page: You could try to code the following or choose your own subject matter<P>


<B>My name is Bill Taylor</B> I am:<ul>
<Li>Male
<Li>Single
<Li>Incredibly attractive</ul>
<P>
My Priorities are <ol><LI>Skiing<Li>Pretending to be odd<Li>Being as romantic as a traffic accident</ol>

I have defined several acronyms:
<DL><DT>DNA<DD>The National Dyslexics Society<DD>Or Douglas Noel Adams , Author of <i>The HitchHiker's Guide the The Galaxy</I>  and others, paradigms for cynical anarchists<DT>SHIT: <DD>Super Highway Information Technology<DD>What tends to happen a lot of the time to just about everyone
</DL>

<H3> Exercise 5: Lists within Lists</H3>

Lists can support formatting inside them such as &ltB&gt, &ltBR&gt and &ltP&gt, you can define a whole list as a heading (&ltH3&gt&ltUL&gt...&lt/UL&gt&lt/H3&gt but don't switch headings on and off within lists. They can also support several levels of lists although three is probably a practical limit for display puposes: These levels can be different list types<P>

for example: Television shows<P>
<UL>
<LI>Star Trek
<OL>
<Li>New Generation Tuesday nights
<UL>
<Li>Captain Jean Luke Picard
<Li>Commander William Riker
</UL>
<Li>Old series Monday Nights
<UL><Li>Captain James T Kirk<Li>Commander Spock
</UL>
</OL>
<LI>The Simpsons
<OL>
<Li>Week nights
<UL>
<LI>Bart
<Li>Mrs Simpson
<Li>...
</UL>
</OL>
</UL>
<P>

Here is the HTML for the above list:<p>
<PRE>
Television shows
&ltUL&gt
&ltLI&gtStar Trek
&ltOL&gt
&ltLi&gtNew Generation Tuesday nights
&ltUL&gt
&ltLi&gtCaptain Jean Luke Picard
&ltLi&gtCommander William Riker
&lt/UL&gt
&ltLi&gtOld series Monday Nights
&ltUL&gt&ltLi&gtCaptain James T Kirk&ltLi&gtCommander Spock
&lt/UL&gt
&lt/OL&gt
&ltLI&gtThe Simpsons
&ltOL&gt
&ltLi&gtWeek nights
&ltUL&gt
&ltLI&gtBart 
&ltLi&gtMrs Simpson
&ltLi&gt...
&lt/UL&gt
&lt/OL&gt
&lt/UL&gt
</PRE><P>

Create a set of sublists in your <I>your_name.html</I> document. These list should detail you family's names and relationships, your hobbies, jobs, likes and dislikes, because that will make a start on your personal home page which will be published on the World Wide Web.<P>

Note:  the&lt..&gt  formatting does not have to be on  a per line basis: see the "Captain Kirk" line above and comapre it to the list. Also the formatting codes are not case sensitive, that is &ltbr&gt and &ltBR&gt mean the same thing

<H3>Exercise 6: Your Home Page</H3>

<B>Create your own home page and save it in place of  <I>your_name.html</I></B>

<H1>Session 3.2:  Linking Documents</H1>
<H3>Playing Tag: a quick review</H3>

In Session 3.1 we encountered some formatting elements of Hypertext Mark Up Language  or HTML, the method for readying documents for display on the World Wide Web. These elements are called "Tags".  Some tags such as &ltBR&gt and &ltP&gt (for line BReak and Paragraph respectively) don't require a turn off tag. Others like &ltHn&gt (for Heading level n where n is an integer from 1 to 5) and  &ltB&gt and &ltI&gt (<B>Bold</B> and <I>Italic</I>) require a tag on either side of the text which they format, in order to turn the effect on and then off. The turn off tags for Headings  Bold and Italic are &lt/Hn&gt, &lt/B&gt and &lt/I&gt. There were some more complex instances such as lists where you had to:<P> &ltUL&gt turn a list on...<BR>then use &ltLI&gt  to specify the start of each line of the list...<BR> then turn the list off with &lt/UL&gt.<P>

Some other Tags which may be of use are &ltHR&gt which is a horizontal rule (it does not need to be turned off), &ltADDRESS&gt, &ltCITE&gt (for citation) and &ltSTRONG&gt are named for their editorial function rather than a predetermined format such as &ltI&gt Italic, these all need to be turned of &lt/...&gt.
 
<H3>Getting the picture</H3>
Pictures are not integral parts of hypertext documents, <B>Images are separate files</B> often stored in CompuServe GIF format. The &ltIMG...&gt tag is used to identify the source file for an image. The Image tag, like the paragraph tag, does not need to be turned off. Here are some examples:<P>

<PRE>&ltIMG SRC="my_picture.gif"&gt<P></PRE>
This loads an "IMaGe" which is "SouRCed" from the file "my_picture.gif"<P>

<A NAME="file_ref">Since Pictures</A> are separate files you will have to know how <A HREF="#file_structure">file structure</A> is addressed from Web Browsers. 



<PRE>&ltIMG SRC="within_this_folder/is_a_folder/with_my_picture.gif"&gt</PRE>
If a picture is not in the same folder or directory as your  HTML document then you will need to specify its address, either absolutely  or relative to the current page (like this example). This means that if your current page and the image you want are in the same folder then all you need to use is the picture file name as in the first example.<P>

Relative addressing often requires reference to the "parent" folder of the current folder, that is the folder which encloses the current folder. You can reference the parent indirectly, without having to know its name, using  ".." (two full stops). In the following example the file "my_picture.gif" is in the parent directory of the current directory.

<PRE>&ltIMG SRC="../my_picture.gif"&gt</PRE>

and if it were in the parent of the parent then

<PRE>&ltIMG SRC="../../my_picture.gif"&gt</PRE>

and if it were in a directory called "parallel" within the parent directory:

<PRE>&ltIMG SRC="../parallel/my_picture.gif"&gt</PRE>

These are called <B>Relative References</B> because they locate other documents relative to the position of the current one. You can avoid the whole fuss of navigating directories with ../../ 's by putting the whole or <B>absolute reference</B> to a document or picture, this is especially necessary if the page is to be moved around relative to others that it references. Here are relative and absolute references to our school logo
<ul>
<Li>Relative Reference:  (relative to THIS page)
<PRE>"../../somelogo.gif"</PRE> 
<Li>Absolute Reference:  <PRE>"http://somerset.qld.edu.au/somelogo.gif"</PRE>
 The prefix http:// stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, when the browser reads a prefix that ends with a : and 2 or 3 slashes it knows that you are specifying an absolute reference<P>
<Li>and the absolute reference to THIS page is <PRE>"http://somerset.qld.edu.au/html_manuals/courses/creating_3.2.html"</PRE>
</ul>




<H3>Exercise 7</H3>
The somerset logo is located at "http://somerset.qld.edu.au/somelogo.gif" 
From last session you should have an HTML page <I>your_name.html</I> Your task is to add the somerset logo to your page.


<HR>
<H3>Anchors aweigh</H3>
There is a special "Tag" called an "anchor" &ltA...&gt, it is the means by which HyperText links are defined in HTML documents, The Anchor tag needs to be turned on and off, but there is a bit more to the "Turn on" tag than we have previously encountered. The basic function of a Hypertext link is to present specially formatted (coloured and underlined) text which can be clicked  to take you to another location on the World Wide Web <P>

<H3>Establishing Links within a page</H3>	
In order to define a hypertext link you have to have a place to go or a function to perform when the text is clicked. Such places within documents are defined as "NAMES". In this example a "Name anchor" is defined as "fred" and it relates to "some text". 

<PRE>&ltA NAME="fred"&gtSome text&lt/A&gt</PRE>

When the document is viewed in Netscape "some text" will appear as ordinary text, however if you click on a Hypertext REFerence (HREF), somewhere else in the document which "points to" the name fred, 

<PRE>&ltA HREF="#fred"&gtclickable text&lt/A&gt</PRE>

  Netsacpe will scroll the document so that "some text" is in the field of view. Note the use of the "hash" # sign in the HREF,  (which is not used in the NAME), this means "within the document", without the hash sign Netscape would go looking for a separate document called "fred" in the current folder.<P>

Names are useful in long documents, you can use them as a table of contents. Or to address footnotes, which is how you will find they are used in the online copy of these notes.

<H3>Exercise 8</H3> 
Look through the source code of this document and find the definition and link to the NAME "addressing_ref". Place a NAME and link to it into <i>your_name.html</i>

<H3>Links to other documents</H3>
It is actually easier to establish a Hypertext link to another document than to a location in the current one  because you don't have to define a "NAME". However the range of <A NAME= "addressing_ref" HREF="#addressing_options">external resources</A> to which you can link is greater. The form of this "anchor" is

<PRE>&ltA HREF="external_resource"&gtclickable text&lt/A&gt</PRE>
Here are some examples: Our Network home page

<PRE>&ltA HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/Welcome.html"&gtGo to our network home&lt/A&gt</PRE>

and this page
<PRE>&ltA HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/html_manuals/courses/<BR>creating3.2.html"&gtGo to this session's page&lt/A&gt</PRE>
(Note  links do not have to be on one line)


<H3>Exercise 9</H3>
Insert a link in your document <i>your_name.html</i> to Somerset's home page.<P>

 You can "view source" of any page to see how anchors are used for names and hypertext links, particularly links to the World wide web<P>
<H3>Preparing your Home page</H3>

In the next and final session of this course, you will have the opportunity to place your home pages on the World Wide Web. Take this opportunity to include useful information in your document <i>your_name.html</i>, this may include your picture, hypertext links to various other documents and perhaps name references.<P> <HR>
<H3>Notes</H3>
<A NAME="file_structure"><H4>About Files</H4></A>   <A HREF="#file_ref">go back</A><P>
Files are located within folders (if you have a Macintosh) or Directories (if you use DOS or Unix) strictly speaking Windows does not have this structure, it relies on DOS via its "File Manager" program. I will use the term folder and directory interchangeably.<P>
A word of warning on file names: If you wish to maintain a copy of your World Wide Web pages on your computer (which is a VERY good idea!) then you must use the lowest common file naming convention:
<uL><Li>on the World Wide Web (Unix) file names can be one word which can be very long, they can use just about any character except space and "/" the FORWARD slash, which is what Unix uses as it directory separator<P>
<Li>Macintosh, file names can be up to 31 characters, they can be several separate words but must not contain a colon<P>
<Li>DOS (and therefore Windows) have a very severe limitation, the file name must be one word of up to 8 characters (no punctuation) with an optional postfix of a full stop and up to 3 characters, this is why many web pages are called "something.HTM" instead of HTML. Also be careful in DOS because the directory separator is "\" a BACKSLASH<P>
</ul><P>

Netscape uses the Unix convention for addressing files no matter which computer they are on.

<A Name="addressing_options"><H4>External resource types for use in Hypertext Links</H4></A><A HREF="#addressing_ref">go back</A><P>

The external resource part of a Hypertext reference can take many forms, the most common is "HTTP" and the default, relative file address option.<ul>Here are (most) examples of most of the options which can be used in  the Hypertext reference anchor. Here is the general form

<PRE>&ltA HREF="one of those options below"&gtclickable text&lt/A&gt</PRE>

NOTE: type the quotation marks too.
<Li>a local document (on the same computer or network) for example "another_doc.html" or "../a_parallel_folder/with_a_document.html"
<Li>a name within a document, for example "#fred/another_doc.html"
<Li>a remote WWW document  for example "http://somerset.qld.edu.au/Welcome.html" (the http stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol") notice the 2 forward slashes this means the document is elsewhere on the Web.
<Li>"file:///disc/folder/folder/document", this indicates a file: three forward slashes indicates that it is on the local computer system.
<Li>an internet service which is not a world wide web document:<ul>
<Li><B>Gopher://</B> a folder like precursor to the World wide Web
<Li><B>Telnet://</B> a text only terminal emulator, the most common interface on the internet (as opposed to the 1% of the internet which is the world wide web.
<Li><B>ftp://</B> This stands for "File Transfer Protocol" it is the original and still most common way of downloading information (and uploading it too)
<Li><B>mailto:</B>Electronic mail sending form. (notice no slashes)</ul></ul><P>
There are a lot of options! but the basic form of the anchor is the same.

Assumed knowledge: that you know how to use Netscape and a Wordprocessor and particularly how to save, find and open files.

<H1>Session 3.3:  Publishing Pages</H1>

This final session gives you the opportunity to publish on the web.

<Li>First of all you need to generate some information about yourself and maybe a photo, which can be scanned in or taken with a digital camera, then converted to GIF (Graphic interchange format) using a program such as "Gif Converter"
<P>
<Li>Then you need to write it all up and format it with HTML tags and possibly put in a few Hypertext links. <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/btaylor/btaylor.html">An example</A> is useful to help give you a framework (or fame work!)
<P>
<Li>The second last step is to put your pages onto the world Wide Web, for this you need access to an internet account, and its username and password.
<P> 
We have not needed to know a username or password for viewing material on the web because it has been deliberately set up by the account owner for public viewing. Clearly the ability to change the contents of a page on the web requires some security.
<P>
<H3>FTP</H3>
The usual  method used to move files from your computer to the Web is called  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) such a program on the Macintosh is called is called "Fetch"...
<P>

Fetch should open up with the default connection scheme, you will need to enter information about the computer to which you wish to connect and the username and  password. Then press "Open Connection"
<P>
The running dog indicates that the program is fetching a list of files from the specified account on the World Wide Web.
<ul>
<LI>Files can be TEXT (html) or BINARY (pictures, programs, word documents)
<Li>You PUT files as onto the remote host
<LI>You GET  files from the remote host 
</ul>
<P>
<H3>From the Network</H3>
On some systems the web server on which pages are to be placed is also accessable via other means, such is the case with the Somerset Server. You can log onto it directly and copy pages and images across as per normal and even edit them on line.
<H3>The last step</H3>
The last step is to advertise and/or link your pages, it is unlikely that search worms or other people will come across your pages unless you advertise the fact that they are there. One way of doing this is to go to several search engine sites and follow their procedures for adding a URL to their index. This usually involves filling in a form and submitting it. Some indicies provide automatic listing some visit and inspect the site first, so their can be a delay or even a rejection of the listing. 
<P>
Once listed it is up to you to maintain your site, to keep it relevant and operational. Information ages and looses its value quickly on the internet.

<H3>Preconceptions</H3>
The World Wide Web (W3, WWW) is NOT the whole internet, only a small part of it., email, for instance, is probably the most used feature of the internet and it can and usually does occur  independent of the web.
<P>
The internet is not like the phone or broadcast system, nor do you pay for the services in the same way. The phone system is run by a telecommunications provider, your internet connection is run by an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
<ol>
<Li>You use the phone system to connect to a service provider, if you are using a modem to do this then it will cost you the same as if you rang the service provider with a normal phone, usually and hopefully this will be the price of a local call.  There is no other charge from the telecommunications provider. The methods you can use to connect to your ISP are
<ul>
<Li>modem (dial up on demand or a dedicated permanent connection)
<Li>ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network, dedicated or on demand) this cost more but is much faster, the ISDN line connects from your end to the ISP end, you cannot  "dial" other numbers with this service
<Li>Cable modems (coming soon) that use the cable TV connections
</ul>


<Li>Your ISP  then starts charging you according to an agreed scheme. The schemes can include a charge for
<ul>
<Li> connection time (normal)
<Li>bytes transmitted to or by you (unusual)
<Li>specific services used (usual with large centralised providers such as <A HREF="http://www.CompuServe.com">Compuserve</A> who provide information as well as connections, but not normally the case for local service providers who just provide connections) Other services that you connect to via your ISP may also charge or require registration (<A HREF="http://www.britannica.com">encyclopaedia Britannica</A> is an example)
<Li>storage space that you use on the ISP's server to store your own pages, mail etc.
<Li>providing a support for a special name for your organisation (called a Domain Name or DNS entry) although <A HREF="http://www.aunic.net">registering the name</A> is free the name has to have a home and if that home is your ISP's computer then they may charge you to support it.
<LI>Providing a set of Internet Protocol (IP) numbers for your computers (although these are actually freely available too but there is a <A HREF="http://www.aunic.net">procedure to follow</A>
</ul>
<Li>Most ISPs have standard monthly fees which include a certain amount of connection and storage service as well, however  <A HREF="http://www.ozemail.co.au">ozemail</A> for example, simply charge on a per use basis with no monthly fee, very useful for people who seldom use their accounts.
<LI>If you want more than one email address their is usually a charge unless you have "aliases" that is several apparent email addresses that feed to the same actual address.
<Li>
You are NOT charged when other internet users view your pages, they are using THEIR account, not yours, to do so.
<LI>Most software for browsing the internet is free and is initially supplied by your ISP when you purchase an account. Other software and upgrades can be obtained or "downloaded" from the web.
<Li>The web is not platform specific, that means that any computer that can access the web will be able to view your pages even if your computer is different from theirs.
<Li>It is possible for several people using several phone lines (or even one line)  to use the same account concurrently, a service provider can monitor this use and may charge accordingly.
</ol>
<Hr>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<ol>
<Li>Get an internet account, with it you get   software, an email address and probably some storage space. Use your account to browse the web, get used to the features on web pages and learn to use email and search facilities.
<Li>Browse the web for pages you like the look of, see how they were written by using the "View source" option in the menu of your browser, thus you can teach yourself how to write HyperText Markup Language (HTML) ... it is NOT computer programming it IS easy and there are <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/html_manuals/index.html">plenty of tutorials on the web</A>.
<Li>Find out from your ISP what the default page name is on their system it could be Welcome.html or index.htm or something else. You should plan to use this name as your key or home page name 
<Li>Create your own pages as files on your computer, you may decide to subdivide them into folders (directories), you can check that they are properly edited and linked using your web browser with the "File open" menu option.
<Li>Connect to your account and use a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program to move all your files onto your service providers computer. You can create, delete and rename directories and put (send) or get (receive), delete and rename files that are stored on your ISP's computer using an FTP program.
<Li>Test that your pages work on the internet (a common problem is that file names are not case sensitive on your computer but they are on the web, so links can work on your machine but fail to work on the web if you don't match the case of the file names)
<LI>Ask your service provider about "CGI" programs that run on their server that you can use to incorporate features into your web pages such as fill in forms and counters for the number of accesses to your page. You can also use programs that run on other servers but bear in mind that these may not always be available and may be slow to load. A lot of interactive procedures can be written using <A HREF"http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.01/javascript/index.html">javascript</A> which is now supported by many browsers so you can write your own programs within your own pages but be warned this is REAL computer programming, much like the C language and is much harder to pick up than HTML.
<Li>"Go" to several web index sites and submit your URL (universal Record Locator or Home Page address) to be included in their lists of sites. Just putting your web site up does not automatically make it known, in fact presenting and making known websites is becoming a big business in itself... and there are a lot of sharks in it because it can be portrayed as being hard and expensive but is really very easy and cheap
</ol>
<P>
Having established a web presence you can log on every so often to browse the internet, check and send mail and update your web pages from the master copy you keep on your computer and, if you have been very clever using CGI or javascript,  check how people have been interacting with your web site.
<P>
This first step is reasonable even for those with STD problems(!) but it does have several draw backs in that It all depends on manual management: for example, email that has to be sent has to be managed coordinated via one operator or one computer with the modem attached, there is a distinct lack of privacy and efficiency if several people are to use the one account and even more so if it is accessible from only one computer. However if your purpose is to "advertise" your organisation on the web or get information for all staff from groups such as <A HREF="http://owl.qut.edu.au:80/oz-teachernet/profassoc/lists.html#qld">QSITE</A> and <A HREF="http://owl.qut.edu.au:80/oz-teachernet/">OZ Teacher net (http://owl.qut.edu.au:80/oz-teachernet/)</A>  then this may be sufficient

<H3>Distributing Access Within your Organisation</H3>
When you want to have many people concurrently accessing the web or any electronically stored information you need to provide a network or maybe an intranet (an intranet is just a local version of the internet) within your organisation, a network consists of:
<ol>
<Li>wiring (twisted pair, ethernet and optical fibre) and switches (routers and hubs)...
<Li>... connected to Network cards in Computers and printers..
<Li>...which run special software which understands one or more "protocols" such as TCP/IP (for intranets and the internet) or IPX (Novell) or net BEUI (Windows) or AppleTalk (Macs) ...
<Li>...that get files and applications from each other or special computers running file, print and communication services (AppleShare,Netware,Windows NT are some).
</ol>
Having spent lots of money and time on your network, employed a manager (NO not the maths or computer studies teacher!) and  trained the users, you can now consider connecting your network to the internet via your ISP.

<H3>Connecting your net to the internet</H3>
The trick here is to have a special box (a computer or a router) that is connected to your ISP out one plug and your network out another and knows which messages need to be sent down which plug and how to package them up so they will be understood, software (or software with hardware) that does this is called a router and in this particular instance the router must send and expect  messages packaged using TCP/IP (the internet protocol) on the internet side. The router may have to change or encapsulate the packaging to suit whatever protocol your network uses... so a router does (at minimum) three things
<ol>
<Li>packages  messages
<Li>directs  messages
<Li>manages your connection 
</ol>
Some specialist router makers are <A HREF="http://www.telebit.com">Telebit</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</A> however in the first instance you may wish to use a software router which is cheaper and usually comes as part of an internet server, this is particularly low cost if you plan to use your existing modem connection,  or buy an ISDN card (instead of a router) for your computer. A great piece of Macintosh software for this is <A HREF="http://www.vicomtech.com">Vicom Internet Gateway</A>. Although you don't have to it is probably a good idea to dedicate a computer to the task and if this is the case a dedicated hardware router may be more cost effective (and will perform better)
<P>
When purchasing a router it is important to consider how you will be scaling your operation. I purchased a Telebit PN4 router (with 4 modem connections) because although I was only going to have one modem dialling our ISP on demand, I planned to move to ISDN and use the telebit for staff to dial into the school so 4 ports seemed worth stretching the budget, for remote schools there is a more entrepenurial solution and for those with a bit more money going direct to ISDN will be the best solution.
<H3>Towards a permanent link</H3>
At the moment ISDN is the way to go, especially with federal government policy that all telephone exchanges will be ISDN enabled by April 1997, in major urban centres "cable modems" that use the optical fibre cable TV network should start to become available at reasonable prices by the end of 1997. Nevertheless both are expensive and this is where remote schools can turn the situation from major disadvantage to minor advantage.
<P>
A school could set itself up (or sponsor) a local ISP, which supplies an ISDN Link for the local (phone) area an expandable bank of modems and a server (and a manager, don't forget the manager!). I have heard that this has happened in Cooma and know it has happened in  Western Queensland via <A HREF="http://www.bushnet.qld.edu.au">Bushnet (http://www.bushnet.qld.edu.au)</A>
<P>
Somerset College provides free dial up internet access for staff, some schools provide that service for students and parents as well although this is usually not free.
<P>
Another useful  aspect of a permanent link is that people can access your site from the internet at any time, there are obvious security implications here but it does mean that you can have your own mail server on site, seamlessly integrating internet and intRAnet mail. For Somerset it has meant a big improvement in our <A HREF="http://somerset.qld.edu.au/homelink.html">HomeLink</A> service whereby authorised people can remotely control computers connected to our in house information resources (another example of using the internet without using the web).
<H3>Your very own server</H3>
The reasons for having your own internet server are fairly compelling even if you only have occasional access to the internet, this is because the software is free or at least cheap, is easy to set up and acts just like the web even when it is just an internal network (intranet), many organisations are using intranets for internal presentation of information and communication. In fact you don't even need a <A HREF="http://www.starnine.com">web server</A> as such, any file server will do, web browsers will read files from them directly without the need for an intervening special server. The one piece of server software you will need though is an Internet mail server such as <A HREF="http://cybertech.apple.com/AIMS.html">AIMS (Apple Internet Mail server)</A> which is FREE and TCP/IP running on your computers. Check out <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_internet">http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_internet</A> and especially <A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu">http://web66.coled.umn.edu</A> for lots of U.S. educational links as well as "Cook books" for setting up your web.
<P>
You may also consider <A HREF="http://www.menandmice.is/">supporting your own Domain Name</A> so that you have immediate control over the names of your computers (they all have numbers but names are nicer) and having your own CGI scripts (I use Hypercard to write and run these) to allow  processing of input from users via forms, for example.
<P>
The Macintosh is not the only platform on which you can set up a web service (you don't need a special "webserver", any old Mac with system 7 or better will do, but as usual the faster it is, the more memory it has, the bigger its hard drive and the less other things you want it to do (for example acting as your workstation) the better. Another great system for the seriously competent is <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_internet/Operating_systems/Unix/Linux">Linux</A> (a version of UNIX written by a Finish school student!) and widely supported entirely for free around the world. It will run on any 386 or better intel box and  may soon be available on the MAC, once again all the server, mail, cgi etc stuff is free (and mostly comes with Linux). Linux is available in conjunction with ever thickening books at most book shops. Yet another free UNIX is <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>
<P>
Then again if it is all to hard or expensive now... just wait a year or two, or ask the kids to set it up for you!

Elements in an HTML document are delimited by the tags which include &lt; and &gt;.  Some elements have both a start and end tag:  e.g., &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt;.  Other elementsuse only a single tag:  e.g., &lt;P&gt; (the paragraph element).Some elements have <I>attributes</I>, which are qualifications of the element's meaning or optional parametersfor that element.<P>A Level 0 HTML document can include the following elements with the attributes shown.  In this document,the elements are listed in all capital letters (e.g., TITLE), and  the attributes are indicated by initial capital letters (e.g., Href).  In order to benefit from the information in this document, view both its HTML source <TT><A Href="http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/pages/level0.html">(http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/pages/level0.html)</A></TT>as well as its rendered form in a Web browser.  The elements and entities are explained in the list below as well as demonstrated here in appropriate locations (e.g, HEAD elements are demonstrated only in the HEAD of this document; and I don't demonstrate the heading (H1...H6) within the list of elements).<P>Note that the different brands of browsers vary in how they render these features.  The intent of HTML is that the browser designers have specified ateach Level of HTML a "basic set" of features that they should implement, so that their browserrenders these HTML constructs <I>some</I> satisfactory way.<H2><A Name="Structure">HTML Structure and Comment Elements</A></H2><P><UL><LI>HTML:    The HTML element identifies the file as     containing HTML elements.  Only    HEAD, BODY, and comment elements that should go inside the    HTML element start and stop tag.<LI>comment:    Comments can be included anywhere within     an HTML document; comments can cross several lines of text:<P><TT>&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;</TT><P><LI>Document Type Declaration:    A document type declaration can be placed at the start of a    an HTML document (before the opening &lt;HTML&gt; tag    which identifies it as a document conforming to    a particular version and level of HTML.    For example:<P><TT>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML Level 0//EN"&gt;</TT><P>    identifies this document as conforming to the specification     of Level 0 HTML.</UL><H2>The HEAD and Related Elements</H2><P><UL><LI>HEAD:    The HEAD element brackets a set of unordered descriptive    information about a document.   Elements within the HEAD    element include: TITLE, BASE, ISINDEX, and NEXTID.<LI>TITLE:    Every HTML must have one title element which    identifies the contents of the document.    The title may not contain anchors, paragraph elements, or    highlighting.  Choose a title which is descriptive    outside the context of the document's creation, as     the title is commonly used to identify a document    in navigation and indexing applications (e.g., hotlists     and spiders).<LI>BASE:    The BASE element can be used to record the     URL of the original version of a document when    the source file is transported elsewhere; the base element    has one attribute, Href, which is used to     define the base URL of the document.  Partial     URLs in the document are resolved by using this    base address as the start of the URL.               <LI>ISINDEX:    This element marks the document as searchable--the    server on which the document is located must have a     search engine defined that supports this searching.<LI>LINK: this element is used to define a relationship between the     document and other objects or documents.      For example, a link element can indicate    authorship or indicate the tree structure of a document.<BR>    The LINK element has the same attributes as the Anchor (A) element:     Attributes:    <UL>     <LI>Href: this identifies the document or part of         a document to which this link refers    <LI>Name: this is a way to name this LINK as a possible        destination for another hypertext document    <LI><A Name="Rel">Rel:</A> describes the relationship defined by         this LINK, according to the possible relationships as defined by the         <A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/RegistrationAuthority.html">        HTML Registration Authority</A>'s list of           <A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Relationships.html">        relationships</A>    <LI><A Name="Rev">Rev:</A> Similar to Rel, above, but the Rev attribute        indicates the <EM>reverse</EM> relationship as Rel.  For         Example, the LINK with Rel="made" indicates that the         Href attribute indicates the URL given in the Href        is the author of the current document.  Using the Rev="made"        link indicates that the <EM>current document</EM>         is the author of the URL given in the Href attribute.     <LI>Urn: This indicates the Uniform Resource Name of         the document; the specification for         <A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">URN             and other addressing</A> is still in development.    <LI>Title: This attribute is <EM>not</EM> to be used        as a substitute for the TITLE attribute of the document itself,         but as a title for the document given by the Href attribute        of the LINK element.  This attribute is rarely used or supported by        browsers, but may have value for cross referencing the         relationships the LINK element defines.    <LI>Methods: This attribute describes the HTTP methods the         object referred to by the Href of the LINK element        supports.  For example, one method is searching; a browser         could thus use this Methods attribute to give information to         the user about the document defined by the LINK element.    </UL> <LI>META:    This element is used to identify meta-information (information about     information) in the document.  This element is not meant to take the     place of elements which already have a purpose, for example the     TITLE element, but to identify other information useful for parsing.<BR>    Attributes (see the header of this document for typical examples):     <UL>    <LI>Http-equiv: This attribute connects this META element to         a particular protocol response which is generated by         the HTTP server hosting the document.    <LI>Name: This attribute is a name for the information in         the document--<EM>not</EM> the title of the document         (which should be defined in the TITLE element) but a        "meta name" classifying this information.    <LI>Content: A "meta name" for the content associated with        the given name (defined by the Name attribute) or the         response defined in Http-equiv.    </UL><LI>NEXTID:    This element is used by text generated software     in creating identifiers; its attribute, N, is    used to define the next identifier to be     allocated by the text generator program.  Normally,    human writers of HTML don't use this element; and     Web browsers ignore this element.</UL><H2>The BODY and Related Elements</H2><P><UL><LI>BODY:    The BODY element's start and stop tags mark the     content of an HTML document.<LI><A Name="Anchor">A:</A> this is the anchor element which is     used as the basis for linking documents together.<BR>    Attributes:       <UL>    <LI>Href: this attribute identifies the URL of the         hypertext reference for this anchor in the        form Href="URL", where the URL given will        be the resource which the browser retrieves        when the user clicks on the anchor's hotspot.        For example:<BR>        <A Name="W3C-reference" Href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</A><BR>        will take the user to the World Wide Web's home.    <LI>Name: this attribute creates a name for         an anchor; this name can then be used within the         document or outside of the document in anchor         to refer to  the portion of text identified by the name.        For example:<BR>        <A Name="AnchorName">Text can have a named anchor.</A><BR>        <A Href="#AnchorName">A jump can go to that anchor within            the file in which it is named...</A><BR>        <A Href="level0.html#AnchorName">            ...or from another file (perhaps on a remote host).</A><BR>    <LI>Title: This attribute is for the title of the document         given by the Href attribute of the anchor.  A browser         could use this information to display this title before        retrieving it, or to provide a title for the Href document         when it is retrieved (e.g., if the document is at a Ftp        site, it will not have a title defined).    <LI>Rel: Defines the relationship defined from         the current document to the target (Href document).        See <A Href="#Rel">the discussion of the Rel attribute</A> in         the LINK element, above.    <LI>Rev: Defines the relationship defined from the         target (Href document) to the current document.        See <A Href="#Rev">the discussion of the Rev attribute</A> in         the LINK element, above.    <LI>Urn: This indicates the Uniform Resource Name of         the target (Href) document; the specification for         <A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">        URN and other addressing</A> is still in development.    <LI>Methods: Provides information about the functions the         user can perform on the Href object.  Similar to described        above for Title, this information might be useful for the        browser to display in advance.      </UL>    Note that an anchor can have both the Name and Href     attributes:<BR>    <P>        <TT>&lt;A Name="W3C-reference" Href="http://www.w3.org/"&lt;W3C&gt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</TT>    <P><LI>character blocks: these are elements that help     "chunk" text in lists or blocks.    <UL>    <LI>PRE: this element sets up a block of text which will        be presented in a fixed-width font, with spaces as         significant.<BR>        <PRE>    PRE's one attribute, Width, can be used to specify the width of the     presentation.  <A Href="#AnchorName">Anchors</A> and     <I>character formatting</I> within PRE, but not elements that     define paragraph breaks (e.g., headings, address, the P element, etc).        </PRE>    <LI>BLOCKQUOTE: this brackets text that is an extended         quotation from another source.           <P>        A typical rendering of a BLOCKQUOTE is to provide extra        indentation on both sides, and possibly highlight        the characters in the BLOCKQUOTE.        <P>    <LI>UL (LI):  The UL element:        <UL Compact>        <LI>Brackets an unordered list of items.        <LI>Employs the LI element to mark the elements.        <LI>Is rendered using bullets to start items.        <LI>Can have the Compact attribute             to suggest to the Web browser to keep the items in             the list close together:		&lt;UL Compact&gt;        </UL>    <LI>OL (LI): The OL element:        <OL>        <LI>Brackets an ordered list of items.        <LI>Employs the LI element to mark the elements.        <LI>Is rendered using a numerical sequence.        <LI>Can have the Compact attribute as the		start of the list: &lt;OL Compact&gt;.        </OL>    <LI>MENU (LI): The MENU element:        <MENU>        <LI>Brackets an more compact unordered list of items.        <LI>Employs the LI element to mark the elements.        <LI>Is rendered using bullets to start items.        <LI>Can have the Compact attribute, as the 		start of the menu, &lt;MENU Compact&gt;.         </MENU>    <LI>DIR (LI): The DIR element:        brackets a list of items which are at most 20         characters wide. The intent is that a browser can         render this in columns of 24 characters wide.        DIR can use the Compact attribute as the 	start of the list, &lt;DIR Compact&gt;.        <DIR>        <LI>ITEM A.        <LI>ITEM B.        <LI>ITEM C.        <LI>ITEM D.        </DIR>    <LI>DL (DT, DD): A definition list, or glossary has these parts:        <DL>        <DT>A term:        <DD>a detailed explanation of a term.         <DT>Another term:        <DD>an explanation of a term, which may include several            lines of text.        <DT>Can have the Compact attribute.        <DD>Use the Compact attribute &lt;DL Compact&gt; as the             start of the list.        </DL>    <LI>ADDRESS:  this element brackets ownership or authorship        information, typically at the start or end of a         document.    </UL>   <LI>headers:     H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6:     these are elements that create an information hierarchy in a document.   <LI>separators    <UL>    <LI>HR: Horizontal rule, divides sections of text.    <LI>P: this element signals a paragraph start; optionally,	   it can have a stop tag, &lt;/P&gt;.    </UL><LI>spacing    <UL>    <LI>BR: This element forces a linebreak.<BR> Typically, this         is used to represent postal addresses or text<BR>         (like poetry) where linebreaks are significant.        For example:        <PRE>The HTML Institute&lt;BR&gt;45 General Square&lt;BR&gt;Markup, LA 70462&lt;BR&gt;        </PRE>        Is rendered as:<P>        The HTML Institute<BR>        45 General Square<BR>        Markup, LA 70462<BR><P>    </UL><LI>images (IMG):    The IMG element allows graphical browsers to place     graphic images a document at the location     of the element tag (to create an "inline image").

Non-graphical        browsers otherwise ignore the IMG element.     <LI>Align: this attribute sets the positioning relationship between        the graphic and the text that follows it; values include:         <UL>        <LI>top: the text following the graphic should be aligned with             the top of the graphic.        <LI>middle: the text following the graphic should be aligned with             the middle of the graphic.        <LI>bottom: the text following the graphic should be aligned with             the bottom of the graphic.        </UL>    <LI>Ismap: this attribute identifies the image as an image map,        where regions of the graphic are mapped to defined URLs.        Hooking up these relationships requires knowledge of         setting an image map file on the server to define these         connections.      </UL><LI>character sets    <OL>    <LI><A Href="ascii.html">ASCII</A> characters: an HTML document         can, of course, contain         all the keyboard characters such as a-z, A-Z, 0-1, 	and !@#$%^&*()_+-=|\{}[]:"~;'`<>?,./    <LI>Entities: since some characters (e.g., < > & ")        are used within HTML to create tags, so some browsers        don't render them; special entities can be used        within documents to represent these characters:        <OL>        <LI>Less than sign (&lt)code is  &amp;lt;         <LI>Greater than (&gt;) sign code is &amp;gt;        <LI>Ampersand (&amp;) code is &amp;amp;         <LI>Double quote sign (&quot;) code is &amp;quot;        </OL>   <LI>Iso-latin1: an HTML document can have the set of ISO Latin        character entities;       See <A Href="http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/pages/iso-latin1.html">       ISO Latin 1 character entities (Table)</A>.   <LI>Numeric characters: use numeric codes can be used to represent       characters; See         <A Href="http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/pages/codes.html">Numeric        code references in HTML (Table)</A>.   </OL></UL><H2>References</H2><P><UL><LI><A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML	materials from W3C</A></UL><P>Copyright &#169 1995 by John December.

The FORM element brackets an input data form; the elements INPUT, SELECT, OPTION,and TEXTAREA are used to set up areas within the Form for input.A <A Href="form.html">sample form</A> illustratesthese elements and attributes.<P>A Form sets up a set of paired variable name fields and value value fields.    The variable name is supplied in theForm.  The user filling out the Form supplies or selects the variable values (except for variables with hidden values).<P>Each Form has a method and action associated with it.  The method specifies how the data from the Form is to be handled in processing.The action identifies the executable program orscript which will process the data from the From.<UL><LI>FORM: delimits the start and end of a data input form.    Forms can not be nested although there may be several     in each document.

Possible values are         "top," "middle," and "bottom," and define the         relationship of the image to the text following it.    <LI>Checked: this attribute causes the initial state         of a checkbox or radio button to be "selected."        Without this attribute, the initial state is unselected.            <LI>Maxlength: this attribute sets a maximum number        of characters that a user can enter in a text         a field.  The default value of this is unlimited.     <LI>Name: this is the symbolic name that is used in         transferring and identifying the output from this element         of the Form.     <LI>Size: specifies the field width as displayed to         the user.  If Size is less than Maxlength, the         text field is scrollable.    <LI>Src: Used to define the source file for the         image used with the attribute Type is set to "image."     <LI>Type:         <UL>        <LI>checkbox: This is used for gathering data that            can have multiple values at a time.          <LI>hidden: This is for values that are set by the             form without input from the user.          <LI>image: An image field be used to submit the Form:            when the user clicks on the image, the Form is submitted,            and the x and y coordinates of the click location            are transmitted with the name/value pairs.        <LI>password: This is a field in which the user enters text,            but the text is not displayed (could appear as stars).         <LI>radio: Used to collect information where there            is one and only one possible value from a set of             alternatives.  The Checked attribute can set the            initial value of this element.        <LI>reset:  This is used to reset and clear the Form to             its default values.  The Value attribute sets the            string displayed to the user for this element.        <LI>submit:  This button is used to submit the Form.            The Value attribute sets the string displayed to             the user for this element.        <LI>text:  This is used for a single line of             text; this uses the Size and Maxlength             attributes.  For multiple lines, use TEXTAREA (below).    </UL>    <LI>Text: a single line text-entry area (Textarea element is used        for multi-line text input).  If the only element in the Form         has attribute Text, then the user can submit the Form by         hitting keyboard <KBD>Enter</KBD> (or <KBD>Return</KBD>).    <LI>Value: This sets the initial displayed value of the field        or the value of the field when it is selected (the radio        button type must have this attribute set).    </UL><LI>SELECT: this element allows a user to choose     one of a set of alternatives.  The OPTION element is used    to define each alternative.<BR>    Attributes:     <UL>    <LI>Name: The logical name that will be submitted and associated        with the data as a result of the user choosing select.    <LI>Multiple: By default, the user can only make one selection        from the group in the SELECT element.  By using the         Multiple attribute, the user may select one or         more of the OPTIONs.    <LI>Size: specifies the number of visible items.           If this is more than one, the visual display will be         a list.    </UL><LI>OPTION:  This element occurs only within the SELECT element (above) and     is used to represent each choice of the SELECT.<BR>    Attributes:     <UL>    <LI>Selected: indicates that this option is initially         selected.    <LI>Value: If present, this is the value that will be returned        by the SELECT if this option is chosen; otherwise,         the value returned is that set by the OPTION element.    </UL><LI>TEXTAREA: This element is used to collect multiple lines    of text from the user; the user is presented with a scrollable    pane in which text can be written.<BR>    Attributes:     <UL>    <LI>Name: The logical name that will be associated with the         returned text.    <LI>Rows: The number of rows that will be displayed (note         the user can use more rows and scroll down to them).    <LI>Cols: The number of columns that will be displayed         (the user can use the scrollbar to move through more        columns if necessary.)    </UL></UL>   <H2>References</H2><P><UL><LI><A Href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_2.html">HTML       Level 2 specification</A><LI><A Href="http://www.halsoft.com/sgml/html-2.0/DTD-HOME.html">Level 2       DTD</A>.</UL><P>Copyright &#169 1995 by John December.

Its one attribute,  Notation,    specifies an entity identifying an SGML description of the style.</UL><H2>The BODY and Related Elements</H2><P><UL><LI>Most BODY elements can use these attributes:    <UL>    <LI>Id: an SGML identifier used for naming parts of the document        in style sheets; also can be used as the target for a hypertext        link; Id values must be unique within a document.    <LI>Lang: An ISO (International Organization for Standardization)        abbreviation for the human language used in         the text (e.g., "en.uk" for English as spoken in the United        Kingdom).  The first part of the code is the language as        defined in ISO 639.  The second part of the code is the two-letter         country code from ISO 3166.  This can be used by browsers to         select from among a variety of choices for the document.    <LI>Class: This attribute defines an element as a particular         kind of text sequence that can be then used in style sheets.        The class designation can also be used in searching.    <LI>Background: This attribute can specify the image tile to         appear in the document background.     </UL><LI>BODY elements:    <UL>    <LI>DIV: used with the Class attribute to represent containers, or        sections, of a document.

The user will not see this background for non-compliant        browsers, if image loading is turned off, or if the        user has overridden the background images in their        preferences.   <LI>Bgcolor: this attribute allows the user to specify a solid        background color.          The color is specified using a        <A Href="color.html">hexidecimal color code</A>:       <P>          <TT>#RRGGBB</TT>       <P>       where RR, GG, BB are the hexidecimal digits specifying the       Red, Green, and Blue values of the color.       For example:       <P>        black = <TT>#000000</TT><BR>        blue = <TT>#0000FF</TT><BR> 	red = <TT>#FF0000</TT><BR>	orange red = <TT>#FF4500</TT><BR>	white = <TT>#FFFFFF</TT>       <P>       If a background file specified in        the Background attribute cannot be found, the color specified       by the Bgcolor tag will be used.  This Bgcolor will also       be used if the user has auto load images off.       This Bgcolor will also be used as a table border color        on Netscape for Windows.    <LI>Text: this attribute specifies the color of the document's text.   <LI>Link: this attribute specifies the color of the document's hotspots.   <LI>VLink: this attribute specifies the color of visited links.   <LI>ALink: this attribute specifies the color of the active link (the		color it appears while		the user is selecting it).</UL><H2>The HEAD and Related Elements</H2><P>Netscape adds:<UL>   <LI>ISINDEX attribute Prompt to specify the message a        user sees for a searchable index.  Example:        Prompt="Enter keyword(s)." </UL><H2>The BODY and Related Elements</H2><UL><LI>HR: attributes added:   <UL>   <LI>Size="number": how thin the line should be in pixels.         Example 1, below is 15 pixels thick and runs the whole       width of the display.   <LI>Noshade: turns off shading to create a solid bar.       Example 2, below is a 1 pixel solid bar        which runs the whole width of the display.   <LI>Width="number|percent": the width of the line, either        expressed as width in pixels (number, as in        Example 3 below which is 100 pixels wide) or a relative       with as a percent of the current display width       (not page width).        Example 4 is 33% of the display width.       These lines are by default centered (default can be       overridden with the Align attribute).   <LI>Align="left|right|center": the alignment of horizontal       lines that are less than the full width of the page.

<h1>The JavaScript Object Model</h1>

<p>JavaScript is based on a  simple object-oriented paradigm.  
An object is a construct with properties that are JavaScript variables.
Properties can be other objects.  Functions associated with an object are known as the 
object's <i>methods</i>.
<P>
In addition to objects that are built into the Navigator client and the LiveWire server,
you can define your own objects.

<UL>
<LI><a href="#objprop">Objects and Properties</a>
<LI><a href="#funcmeth">Functions and Methods</LI></a>
<LI><a href="#newobj">Creating New Objects</LI></a>
</UL>

<a name="objprop"> <h2>Objects and Properties</h2></a>

<p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. You access the properties of an 
object with a simple notation:
<pre>
objectName.propertyName
</pre>
<p>
Both the object name and property name are case sensitive. 
You define a property by assigning it a value. For example, suppose there is an object
named <i>myCar</i> (we'll discuss how to create objects later-for now, just assume the object
already exists). You can give it properties named <b>make</b>, <b>model</b>,
and <b>year</b> as follows: 
<pre>
myCar.make = "Ford"
myCar.model = "Mustang"
myCar.year = 69;
</pre>

<p>An array is an ordered set of values associated with a single variable
name. Properties and arrays in JavaScript are intimately related; in fact,
they are different interfaces to the same data structure. So, for example, you could access
the properties of the <i>myCar</i> object described above as follows: 
<pre>myCar[&quotmake&quot] = &quotFord&quot;
myCar[&quotmodel&quot] = &quotMustang&quot;
myCar[&quotyear&quot] = 67;</pre>

<p>Equivalently, each of these elements can be accessed by its index, as
follows: 
<pre>myCar[0] = &quotFord&quot;
myCar[1] = &quotMustang&quot;
myCar[2] = 67;</pre>

<p>This type of an array is known as an associative array, because each
index element is also associated with a string value. To illustrate how this works,
the following function displays the properties of the object, when you
pass the object and the object's name as arguments to the function: 
<pre>function show_props(obj, obj_name) { 
    var result = &quot&quot; 
    for (var i in obj) 
        result += obj_name + &quot.&quot + i + &quot = &quot + obj[i] + &quot\n&quot; 
    return result; 
} </pre>

<p>So, the function call <tt>show_props(myCar, &quotmyCar&quot)</tt> would
return the following: 
<pre>myCar.make = Ford
myCar.model = Mustang
myCar.year = 67</pre> 

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="funcmeth"><h2>Functions and Methods</h2></a>
<P>
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
A function is a JavaScript procedure--a set of statments that performs a specific task.  
<P>
A function definition consists of the <b>function</b> keyword, followed by
<UL>
<LI>the name of the function 
<LI>a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses, and separated by commas
<LI>the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, {...}
</UL>
<P>
In a Navigator application, you can use any functions defined in the current page. 
It is generally a good idea to define all your functions in the <code>HEAD</code> of a page.
When a user loads the page, the functions will then be loaded first.  

<P>
The statements in a function can include other function calls defined for the 
current application.

<P>
For example, here is the definition of a simple function named pretty_print:
<XMP>
function pretty_print(string) {
   document.write("<HR><P>" + string)
}
</XMP>
<P>
This function takes a string as its argument, adds some HTML tags to it using the concatenation 
operator (+), then displays the result to the current document.
<P>
Defining a function does not execute it.
You have to <i>call</i> the function for it to do its work.
For example, you could call the pretty_print function as follows:
<XMP>
<SCRIPT>
pretty_print("This is some text to display")
</SCRIPT>
</XMP>
<P>
The arguments of a function are not limited to just strings and numbers.
You can pass whole objects to a function, too.
The show_props function from the previous section is an example of a function that takes 
an object as an argument.
<P>
The arguments of a function are maintained in an array.
Within a function, you can address the parameters passed to it as follows:
<pre>
<i>functionName</i>.arguments[<i>i</i>]
</pre>
where <i>functionName</i> is the name of the function and <i>i</i> is the ordinal 
number of the argument, starting at zero.  So, the first argument passed to a function named
myfunc would be myfunc.arguments[0].  The total number of arguments is indicated by the variable
arguments.length.

<P>
A function can even be recursive, that is, it can call itself.  For example, here is a function that computes factorials:
<PRE>
function factorial(n) {
  if ((n == 0) || (n == 1))
    return 1
  else {
    result = (n * factorial(n-1) )
    return result
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
You could then display the factorials of one through five as follows:
<PRE>
for (x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
   document.write(x, " factorial is ", factorial(x))
   document.write("<BR>")
}
</PRE>
<P>
The results would be:
<BR>
0 factorial is 1
<BR>1 factorial is 1
<BR>2 factorial is 2
<BR>3 factorial is 6
<BR>4 factorial is 24
<BR>5 factorial is 120

<h3>Functions with Variable Numbers of Arguments</h3>
<P>
You can call a function with more arguments than it is formally declared to accept
using the <I>arguments</I> array.  This is often useful if you don't know beforehand 
how many arguments will be passed to the function.
You can use arguments.length to determine the number of arguments actually passed to the function,a
and then treat each argument using the arguments array.
<P>
For example, consider a function defined to create HTML lists.
The only formal argument for the function is a string that is "U" if the list is to be unordered
(bulleted) or "O" if the list is to be ordered (numbered).  The function is defined as follows:
<XMP>
function list(type) {
   document.write("<" + type + "L>")                // begin list
   for (var i = 1; i < list.arguments.length; i++)  // iterate through arguments
      document.write("<LI>" + list.arguments[i])
   document.write("</" + type + "L>")               // end list
}
</XMP>
<P>
You can pass any number of arguments to this function and it will then display each argument as
an item in the indicated type of list.  For example, the following call to the function:
<PRE>
list("o", "one", 1967, "three", "etc, etc...")
</PRE>
<P>
results in this output:
<script>
function list(type) {
   document.write("<" + type + "L>")                // begin list
   for (var i = 1; i < list.arguments.length; i++)  // iterate through arguments
      document.write("<LI>" + list.arguments[i])
   document.write("</" + type + "L>")               // end list
}
list("o", "one", 1967, "three", "etc, etc...")
</script>



<h3>Defining Methods</h3>
<P>
A <i>method</i> is a function associated with an object.  You define a method in the same way
as you define a standard function.  Then, use the following syntax to associate the function
with an existing object:
<pre>
<i>object.methodname = function_name</i>
</pre>
where <i>object</i> is an existing object, <i>methodname</i> is the name you are assigning to
the method, and <i>function_name</i> is the name of the function.
<P>
You can then call the method in the context of the object as follows:
<pre>
object.methodname(params);
</pre>

<h3>Using this for Object References</h3>
<P>
JavaScript has a special keyword, <b>this</b>, that you can
use to refer to the current object.  For example, suppose you have a function called
<i>validate</i> that validates an object's value property, given the object, and the 
high and low values:
<pre>
function validate(obj, lowval, hival) {
   if ((obj.value < lowval) || (obj.value > hival))
      alert("Invalid Value!")
}
</pre>
<P>
Then, you could call <i>validate</i> in each form element's 
onChange event handler, using <b>this</b> to pass it the form element, as in the 
following example:

<xmp>
<INPUT TYPE = "text" NAME = "age" SIZE = 3 onChange="validate(this, 18, 99)">
</xmp>

<P>
In general, in a method <b>this</b> refers to the calling object.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="newobj"> <h2>Creating New Objects</h2></a>
<P>
Both client and server JavaScript have a number of predefined objects.
In addition, you can create your own objects.
Creating your own object requires two steps:
<UL>
<LI>Define the object type by writing a function.
<LI>Create an instance of the object with <b>new</b>.
</UL>
<P>
To define an object type, create a function for the object
type that specifies its name, and its properties and methods.

For example, suppose you want to create an object type for cars.
You want this type of object to be called <i>car</i>, and you want it
to have properties for make, model, year, and color.
To do this, you would write the following function:
<PRE>
function car(make, model, year) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the use of <b>this</b> to assign values to the object's properties based 
on the values passed to the function.
<P>
Now you can create an object called <i>mycar</i> as follows:
<PRE>
mycar = new car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993);
</PRE>
<P>
This statement creates <i>mycar</i> and assigns it the specified values for its properties.
Then the value of <code>mycar.make</code> is the string "Eagle", <code>mycar.year</code>
is the integer 1993, and so on.
<P>
You can create any number of <i>car</i> objects by calls to <b>new</i>.
For example, 
<PRE>
kenscar = new car("Nissan", "300ZX", 1992)
</PRE>
<P>
An object can have a property that is itself another object.
For example, suppose I define an object called <i>person</i> as follows:
<PRE>
function person(name, age, sex) {
   this.name = name;
   this.age = age;
   this.sex = sex;
}
</PRE>
<P>
And then instantiate two new <i>person</i> objects as follows:
<PRE>
rand = new person("Rand McNally", 33, "M")
ken = new person("Ken Jones", 39, "M")
</PRE>
<P>
Then we can rewrite the definition of <i>car</i> to include an owner property
that takes a <i>person</I> object, as follows:
<PRE>
function car(make, model, year, owner) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
   this.owner = owner;
}
</PRE>
<P>
To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following:
<PRE>
car1 = new car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993, rand);
car2 = new car("Nissan", "300ZX", 1992, ken)
</PRE>
<P>
Notice that instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the
new objects, the above statements pass the objects rand and ken as the arguments for the owners.
Then if you want to find out the name of the owner of car2, 
you can access the following property:
<PRE>
car2.owner.name
</PRE>
<P>
Note that you can always add a property to a previously defined object.
For example, the statement:
<pre>
car1.color = "black"
</pre>
adds a property color to car1, and assigns it a value of "black".
However, this does not affect any other objects.
To add the new property to all objects of the same type, you have to add the property to the
definition of the <i>car</i> object type.

<h3>Defining Methods</h3>
<P>
You can define methods for an object type by including a method defnition in the 
object type definition.  For example, suppose you have a set of image GIF files,
and you want to define a method that displays the information for the cars, along with the
corresponding image.  You could define a function such as:
<pre>
function displayCar() {
   var result = "A Beautiful " + this.year 
                + " " + this.make + " " + this.model;
   pretty_print(result)
}
</pre>
where <i>pretty_print</i> is the previously defined function to display a string.
Notice the use of <b>this</b> to refer to the object to which the method belongs.
<P>
You can make this function a method of <i>car</i> by adding the statement
<pre>this.displayCar = displayCar;</pre> 
to the object definition. So, the full definition of <i>car</i> would now 
look like:

<PRE>
function car(make, model, year, owner) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
   this.owner = owner;
   this.displayCar = displayCar;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Then you can call this new method as follows:
<pre>
car1.displayCar()
car2.displayCar()
</pre>
This will produce output like this:
<P>
<HR>
A Beautiful 1993 Eagle Talon TSi
<P>
<HR>
A Beautiful 1992 Nissan 300ZX

<body><H1 Align =center>Time and Distance Measurement</H1>

The apparatus I will use is a light source, coupled with a detector, both
orientated to use a mirror <tt>d</tt> units away.  There is also a stop watch
attached to the apparatus that measures the time <tt>t</tt> taken for light to
go from the source to the receiver.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="relativity2.GIF"><p>
<p>
Suppose this device moves past you at velocity <tt>v</tt> and orientated at
<tt>A</tt> degrees to the direction of motion.<p>
<p>
The following event is timed:<p>
<p>
A ray leaves the source, is reflected by the mirror and is detected at the
receiver.<p>
<p>
The diagram shows the object at three stages in the event:<p>
<p>
1.	When the light is emitted from the source.<p>
<p>
2.	When it is reflected at the mirror.<p>
<p>
3.	When it is collected at the receiver.<p>
<p>
<i>	(see diagram above)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
The heavy line indicates the path taken by the successful light rays collected
at the receiver.<p>
<p>
Let:<p>
<p>
	<tt>t1</tt>	=	the time to reach the mirror from the source<p>
	<tt>t2</tt>	=	the time to reach the receiver from the mirror<p>
	<tt>t</tt>	=	<tt>t<sub>1</sub> + t2</tt> the time for the whole transaction<p>
	<tt>c</tt>	=	the speed of the photons<p>
<p>
The distance travelled to the mirror is <tt>ct1</tt> and from the mirror to the
receiver is <tt>ct2</tt>.  The respective horizontal motions of the device are
<tt>vt1</tt> and <tt>vt2</tt>.  Using the cosine rule:<p>
<p>
	
<IMG SRC="relativity3.GIF"><p>
rearranging the equation involving <tt>t1</tt> we have a quadratic equation
which is solved to find <tt>t1</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<IMG SRC="relativity4.GIF"><p>
Similarly<p>
<p>
<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity5.GIF"></tt><p>
<p>
Since the times taken are inherently positive we will use the positive instance
for both <tt>t1</tt> and <tt>t2</tt>, noting that<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity6.GIF"></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
the total time for the event is<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity7.GIF"></tt><p>
This result indicates that the time taken for the event depends on both its
speed and orientation.<p>
<p>
Michelson and Morley proposed to detect the motion of the Earth through space
by using a rotating configuration of two identical, perpendicular light paths
with mirrors at the ends to reflect light from a common source to a receiver at
which the interference of the rays could be observed.  The time difference for
the paths could be derived from the observations of changing interference
patterns.  No change in the interference patterns was detected.  Hence if
<tt>t</tt> is measured for my apparatus at various orientations there should be
no variation either.  Let us assume that this is the case.<p>
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="relativity8.GIF"><p>
<p>
Poincare suggested that not only the Michelson Morley experiment, but any
experiment would be unable to determine the absolute velocity or direction of
motion of an object, this is principle 2.<p>
<p>
The second principle indicates that the time <tt>t</tt>, recorded on the watch
attached to the apparatus, for the event should be the same independent of the
velocity of the apparatus, relative to a stationary observer, when the event
was recorded.  Note this does not mean that the value of <tt>t</tt>, measured
by a stationary observer with a stationary watch, is the same for any value of
<tt>v</tt>.  In fact, the theory of relativity holds that this is not the
case.<p>
<p>
If we suppose that the value of <tt>t</tt>, recorded on the watch attached to
the apparatus, does not alter with the orientation or velocity of the device
then there is an apparent contradiction with the algebra.  Suppose that we let
<tt>d</tt> change with the orientation and velocity of the apparatus so as to
allow <tt>t</tt> to be constant.  This may seem like a fairly desperate attempt
to fix the algebra but there are common sense precedents for the idea.  For
example think of a string of marbles separated by springs, turn it into the
flow of a current and the string will shorten.  Matter is made up of atoms held
by forces and perhaps it may be effected by some cosmic flow coming from a
particular direction.  Since all measuring sticks would be similarly effected
you could not directly measure this alteration of length.<p>
<p>
If <tt>d</tt> is to vary then so should <tt>t</tt> so that the speed of light
remains constant as supposed in principle 1.  What then of our measurements of
<tt>t</tt> being constant?  Recall that <tt>t</tt> is measured by  a watch
moving with the apparatus, if the passage of time is altered for the event then
so will it be for the watch in such a way that no discrepancy will be detected.
The value of <tt>t</tt> may however be different for an observer moving with
respect to the apparatus.  I will only suppose that the value of <tt>t</tt>
depends on the relative velocity of the apparatus but not on its orientation.<p>
<p>
To indicate that <tt>t </tt>depends on <tt>v</tt> we use <tt>t(v)</tt><p>
and that <tt>d</tt> depends on <tt>v</tt> and <tt>A</tt> we use
<tt>d(v,A)</tt><p>
<p>
So an hypothesis to reconcile the algebra with the experimental results is to
rewrite the equation for <tt>t </tt>as:<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity9.GIF">
<i>*EQ1</i></tt><p>
<p>
or changing the subject<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity10.GIF">
<i>*EQ2</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
NOTE:  Henceforth assume that the general concepts of time <tt>t</tt> and
distance <tt>d</tt> depending on <tt>v</tt> or <tt>A</tt> are true for any
events and not just the elements of my apparatus (as Poincare did).<p>
<p>
Consider events with the same velocity <tt>v</tt> and orientations of <tt>A =
90</tt> degrees and <tt>A = 0</tt> degrees in <tt><i>*EQ1</i></tt>.<p>
<p>
<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity11.GIF"></tt><p>
equating the two expressions and rearranging:<p>
<p>
<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity12.GIF"></tt><p>
This factor will appear often, it is called the Lorentz contraction factor.
Note that <tt>L(v) &lt; 1</tt> when <tt>v &lt; c</tt>.<p>
<p>
Hence	<tt>d(v,90).L(v)  =  d(v,0)	<i>*EQ3</i></tt><p>
<p>
Which means that an observer should see the apparatus shortened in the
direction of motion compared to its vertical dimension.<p>
<p>
Since	<tt>L(0) = 1,  d(0,90) = d(0,0)	<i>*EQ4</i></tt><p>
<p>
Which means that orientation has no effect on the distance measurement when the
apparatus is stationary with respect to the observer.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="relativity13.GIF"><p>
<p>
<p>
Suppose that <tt>d(v,90)</tt> is constant for all values of <tt>v</tt> since
the object being measured has a velocity of <tt>0</tt> at <tt>90</tt> degrees
to the direction of motion, and is therefore stationary in this aspect.<p>
<p>
	in particular	<tt>d(v,90)	=	d(0,90)</tt>	<tt><i>*EQ5</i></tt><p>
<p>
	and also	<tt>d(v,90)	=	d(0,0)</tt>	(using <tt><i>*EQ4</i></tt>)<p>
<p>
Considered with <tt><i>*EQ</i></tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	d(0,0).L(v)  =  d(v,0)	<i>*EQ6</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
For <tt>v &lt; c</tt> the distance measure of an object in the direction of
motion is less as measured by a stationary observer than the measure made by an
observer travelling with the object, or as measured afterwards when the object
is stationary relative to an observer.<p>
<p>
Using <tt><i>*EQ2</i></tt>:<p>
<IMG SRC="relativity14.GIF"><p>
since the left hand sides are equal (using <tt><i>*EQ5</i></tt>)<p>
<p>
<tt>	t(0) = L(v).t(v)	<i>*EQ7</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
For <tt>v &lt; c</tt> the time taken for an event occurring in a moving
apparatus is greater as measured by a stationary observer than the measure made
by an observer travelling with the apparatus, or as measured afterwards when
the apparatus is stationary relative to an observer.  This time dilation effect
is supported by observations that some short-lived particles which result from
cosmic collisions in the upper atmosphere live much longer than can be
accounted for without supposing that their time rate is slower than ours.  It
is rather intriguing to realise that our time rate also looks slower to them.<p>
<p>
Einstein proposed The twins "paradox" to popularise this effect, but lets use
triplets.  Two of the triple go on identical journeys in fast spacecraft in
opposite directions, eventually returning to the homebound member, each
observes the other pairs time to be going slower than their own by virtue of
their high relative velocities.  Upon returning home the two travellers are
equally aged but the homebound one is older.  The pair who journeyed,
experienced identical accelerations and would have noticed that the account of
ages was finalised while decelerating to home.  Part of the "paradox" is resolved if you take into account distance dilation as well, the distance travelled by the journeying pairs is reduced by a factor of L(v) compared to the stay at homes measurement of the distance and yet all parties would agree on their respective speeds.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Twins and Things</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1 Align=center>The Twins "Paradox"</H1>
<P>
This explanation is inspired by Paul Davies most excellent book "About Time"
<P>
Usually the first place  where common sense and the theory of relativity come into glaring conflict is the twins paradox. This is not really a paradox, but it has been given that name because it is usually oversimplified, it is mistakenly thought to be a justification of the theory and it really is contrary to common experience. 
<P>
The scenario:
<P>
Firstly suppose the special theory of relativity is correct: 
<P>
There are two twins, one goes on a journey in a fast space ship away from Earth then returns to Earth whilst the other twin stays on Earth. When the travelling twin meets up with the Earthbound one, the traveller is younger. This is because the theory says if you look at someone going fast  then their time will appear to you to run slower than yours
<P>
Now some people think that this is the paradox, but it is not, we are assuming the theory of relativity to be correct and it says if you go fast then time slows, so this is simply an example of the prediction of the theory.
<P>
The apparent paradox comes from the second principal of relativity, that there is no absolute frame of reference. This means that the space ship twin can validly say that it is the Earth that has travelled away from her and then back again and that therefore the twin on the speeding planet should be the younger when they meet again. The apparent paradox is that each twin is at the same time older and younger than her sibling. The resolution of the so called paradox has to do with the word "validly".
<P>
Albert Einstein is reported to have said "Strive to make explanations as simple as possible, but never simpler than that" and this is a classic case of not explicitly stating some fairly important information in order to make the story simpler.
<P>
The first important bit is that the situation is not symmetric, the travelling twin will have undergone acceleration and deceleration while the Earth bound one will not have. To put this more relativisticly, the Earthbound twin has been in one frame of reference all the time, whilst the space traveller has been in two (well more than two, but we will leave out the accelerating and turn around ones)
<P>
Secondly we have invoked time dilation but not distance dilation in the explanation. To put this more clearly, let us have a thought experiment on a scale which is reasonably able to be recreated and reasonably able to be observed. We must also remove any acceleration from the measurements so that they comply with the assumption that no acceleration is going on, the whole thing still works but is much harder to calculate if acceleration has to be taken into account.
<P>
Suppose we have several trillion dollars and use it to build two space buoys and a fast space probe and two really powerful magnetic rail guns to accelerate and decelerate the probe. We set the buoys up 8 light seconds (2,400,000 km) apart and stationary with respect to each other. The buoys will be called A and B, our probe is a small robot one that is  accelerated and decelerated by the two magnetic rail guns, it has no power of its own (so it can't accelerate or decelerate and therefore can't cheat), the rail gun can accelerate the probe to .8 c (240,000 km per second). The probe has a clock that can be activated or deactivated by a signal from either buoy.
<P>
The probe is loaded into one gun and accelerated to .8c it zips past A, as it does so A starts its clock and signals the probe to activate its clock too. The probe continues until it passes B,  when it is abreast of B, B starts its clock and sends a signal to the probe to de activate its clock. The probe with its clock turned off enters the second rail gun, which brings it to a stop then accelerates it to .8c back out the way it came. This time when abreast B the signal is sent to activate the probe clock, and B's clock is deactivated the probe flies past A and is signalled to deactivate its clock, A's clock is turned off too. The probe decelerates to a stop relative to A, B and the rail guns, and the whole apparatus is collected and brought together. This temporal ballet means that the probe's clock is only on when it is not accelerating and is between A and B, whilst the clocks on A and B operate in such a way that , later on when all the bits are retrieved, the time the probe took to go between them can be calculated.
<P>
The time on A's clock is the time it took for the probe to pass A twice first into the experiment zone and then out , the time on B's clock is the time it took for the probe to pass it twice too, first out of the experiment zone and then into it. The probe was travelling at a constant velocity between A and B in each direction so the difference between the times  recorded by A and B is the experimental flight time. This should be 20 seconds, because the probe was travelling at .8c and the distance between A and B (which are in the same frame of reference, stationary with respect to each other) is 8 light seconds, thus 10 seconds flight time each way. This is a simple calculation which is the same for Newtonian mechanics because the measurements are taken in the same reference frame.
<P>
The probe's clock will have been turned on as it passed A, it will not be accelerating at this point so as far as the probe is concerned, it is A that flashes by at .8c in the opposite direction, sometime later B flashes by too, the probe duly turning on and off its clock as instructed. According to relativity the distance between two objects in the direction of travel reduces with relative speed, for a speed of .8c this  factor is .6, so the probe does not measure the distance from A to B to be 8 light seconds, instead it measures 8 X .6 or 4.8 light seconds, which at .8c will take 6 seconds, similarly the reverse B to A trip will take 6 seconds, total time 12 seconds. So, after all the bits are collected into the same frame of reference the duration of the experiment for the probe probe is 12 seconds, 8 seconds less than the buoys  experienced.
<P>
The probe's observations are qualitatively different to those of the buoys. The probe sees two objects flash by it twice, the buoys each see one object flash by twice. The probe experiences two frames of reference whilst its clock is active travelling in one direction at .8c then the reverse direction at .8c (and it knows that the frame of reference has changed because of the unavoidable and absolute acceleration required to move from one frame to the other or the appearance of the background stars). The buoys experience no acceleration and remain in one frame of reference for the whole experiment. 
<P>
Note that I have not mentioned time dilation, neither the probe nor the buoys experience dilation themselves,  they see it or more accurately calculate it as occurring in a frame of reference other than their own, this factor is again .6 for a speed of .8c, and this effect is mutually calculated for the probe viewing the buoys and vice versa, however they see something different, what is seen depends on the time dilation effect and on the time it takes for light to travel from one place to another. For example suppose that when any clock in the experiment turns on or off, it broadcasts the fact in all directions. When the probe passes A heading towards B a signal is sent to B from A effectively stating that the probe is now at A. Now we are in the A and B frame here so that signal won't reach B for 8 seconds  the probe takes 10 seconds to make the distance. So B sees the probe take 2 seconds to make the journey from A to itself, the probe's clock reads  6 seconds as it reaches B, so B sees the probe time speeded up by a factor of 3. On the other hand when the probe passes B,  A will receive the information 8 seconds later, the information will say "the probe is level with B its clock reads 6 seconds", this message is sent 10 seconds after A's clock is started so A gets the information "the probe's clock reads 6 seconds" 18 seconds after the probe passes A, thus  time is seen to run 3 times slower on the probe than at A. The return journey has the reverse effect, so what is actually seen in the A,B frame is that the probe's time is 3 times faster travelling towards the observing buoy and three times slower when receding from it.
<P>
A traveller on the probe (okay so that would take many more trillions of dollars) as it passes B on the out journey would see her clock  registering 6 seconds, At this moment A's clock is 8 light seconds away (in A's reference frame), and the probe has taken 10 seconds (again according to A) to get to B. So B got the message "The probe is passing A" 10 - 8 or 2 seconds before the probe got to B, a second clock on B, started when this information was received would be showing "2 seconds since the experiment started" as the probe passes. Thus according to the probe 2 seconds of B's   time is seen to have elapsed whilst 6 seconds of probe time has passed, thus the probe sees B's time as being three time faster than its own. Recall that A does not see the probe pass B until 18 seconds of A time into the experiment.
<P>
The emphasis in the last two paragraphs is on the word SEE,  what is happening NOW depends on whose now you mean, that is the nub of it, time is different and nows are different in different frames of references, the clocks read different but the situation is still logically consistent under the assumptions of relativity. If you accept the premise of the theory then the probe travels 4.8 X 2 or 9.2 light seconds at .8c taking 12 seconds measured by itself and 8 X 2 or 16 light seconds also at .8c taking 20 seconds as measured by A or B
<P>
These hypothetical gymnastics should help explain, not the paradox, but how there is no paradox when sufficient information is taken into account, the experience of a twin on the probe and another on a buoy are qualitatively different and so it should not be so surprising that they are quantitatively different too.

Suppose there are two observers, one stationary, named <tt>Oo</tt> the other

<body><H1 Align =center>Mass and Energy</h1>
There are three assumptions that are retained from Newtonian Physics:  mass,
energy and momentum are conserved in a moving system just as they are in a
stationary one.  Lets consider the momentum of a ball as it moves in the
<tt>Y</tt> direction.  The momentum can be assessed by measuring its mass
beforehand then timing it as it moves between two points to determine velocity
which we will suppose is negligible compared to <tt>c</tt>.  For an observer
moving past in the <tt>X</tt> direction (at 90 degrees to <tt>Y</tt>) the
<tt>Y</tt> component of the momentum of the ball should appear the same as for
the observer sitting still relative to the measuring points.  Assuming that
both observers determine identical <tt>Y</tt> momentum for the ball and
considering that the moving observer sees the ball move slower due to time
dilation and yet is expected to calculate that its momentum is unaffected!
(see <tt><i>EQ11</i></tt>)  This is apparently another inconsistency.  Suppose
an object has mass <tt>m</tt> and <tt>y</tt> velocity of <tt>Uy(v)</tt> (which
is also equal to <tt>Uy(0).L(v)</tt> by <tt><i>*EQ11</i></tt>), its momentum in
the <tt>Y</tt> direction is the same for both observers.<p>
<p>
	i.e.	<tt>m.Uy(v) = m.Uy(0)</tt>	but	<tt>Uy(v) = Uy(0).L(v)</tt><p>
<p>
Hence to fix the contradiction, we follow the precedent for time and suppose
<tt>m</tt> depends on <tt>v</tt>.  That is let:<p>
<p>
<tt>	m(v) = m(0)/L(v)	<i>*EQ12</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt>For <tt>v &lt; c</tt> the mass of an object is greater as measured by
a stationary observer than the measure made by an observer travelling with the
object, or as measured afterwards when the object is stationary relative to an
observer.  Note that as speed builds towards <tt>c</tt>, the objects mass
increases without bound, hence no object with non zero mass can be given
sufficient energy to reach the speed of light.<p>
<p>
Using <tt><i>EQ12</i></tt><p>
<p>
	<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity24.GIF">
</tt>substituting for<tt> L(v)</tt><p>

	<tt>m(v)<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> = m(0)<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> +
m(v)<sup>2</sup>v<sup>2</sup></tt><p>
<p>
where <tt>m(v).v</tt> is the momentum, commonly called <tt>P</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	m(v)<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> = m(0)<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> +
p<sup>2</sup>	<i>*EQ13</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<p>
Expanding <tt>1/L(v)</tt> by Taylor series, <tt><i>EQ12</i></tt> becomes<p>
<p>
<tt>	m(v) = m(0) [1 + v<sup>2</sup>/2c<sup>2</sup> +

3m(0)v<sup>4</sup>/8c<sup>4</sup> + ...	<i>*EQ14</i></tt><p>
<p>
The units of both sides of <tt><i>EQ14</i></tt> are those of energy and the
familiar Newtonian Kinetic energy term appears second on the right hand side of
the equation.  The terms involving <tt>v</tt> can be equated to
<tt>p<sup>2</sup>/m(v)</tt> using <tt><i>EQ13</i></tt>.  Einstein proposed that
<tt><i>EQ14</i></tt> was in fact an energy equation and that the total energy
of a particle is <tt>m(v)c<sup>2</sup></tt>.<p>
<p>
<tt>	E = m(v)c<sup>2</sup>	<i>*EQ15</i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i></tt><p>
To suppose that the intrinsic energy of a mass is <tt>m(0)c<sup>2</sup></tt>
requires that an object of zero rest mass and velocity of less than <tt>c</tt>
(since <tt>1/L(c)</tt> is undefined) must have zero energy.  Perhaps more
justification for this conclusion is required.  Consider two objects
approaching each other at the same speed at an angle of <tt>A</tt> degrees to
the <tt>X</tt> direction and colliding inelastically, that is they coalesce
into one.  The total momentum before the collision is <tt>2m(v).vsin(A)</tt> in
the <tt>Y</tt> direction, hence this is the total momentum afterwards as
well.<p>
<IMG SRC="relativity25.GIF"><p>
<p>
If the angle <tt>A</tt> is small then the resultant velocity is small and so
the relativistic mass increase is negligible, the mass being close to
<tt>2m(0)</tt>.  However this is not the case if it is accepted that mass is
conserved in the collision.  The resultant mass is <tt>M=2m(v)</tt>, if
<tt>v</tt> was large then this is noticeably greater than <tt>2m(0)</tt>, the
combined rest mass.  Hence the mass of the resultant object depends on the
speed or kinetic energy of its precursors.  Moreover, should a particle of mass
<tt>M</tt> fly apart into two fast parts, as in nuclear fission, each will
dissipate its kinetic energy, hence velocity, hence relativistic mass as it
slows through interactions with neighbouring particles.  The energy released
<tt>(KE)</tt> is a function of the mass deficit of the initial particle and its
now stationary products.  Taking a clue from <tt><i>EQ15</i></tt> this function
is simply the multiplicative constant <tt>c<sup>2</sup></tt>.<p>
<p>
Change of	<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity26.GIF"></tt><p>
<p>
It would seem that energy can be stored as mass and so this is evidence to
support the claim that the intrinsic energy of a mass could be
<tt>m(0)c<sup>2</sup></tt>.  There are other implications of mass depending on
creation velocity.  The insides of a particle consist of the intrinsic masses
of Protons etc. minus energy used to stick them together plus energy left over
from the velocity of the creation of the particle, so what does a masson look
like?  Or is it that the insides of particles may emit protons etc. but that
they do not actually exist inside the particle.  As Richard Feynman put it, one
can emit the word cat without having it ready made inside you, there is no
finite supply of this word, only the energy used to make it.  So it is for the
contents of particles, the emission products do not necessarily exist
internally.<p>
<p>
A more useful and thought provoking version of <tt><i>EQ15</i></tt> is obtained
by squaring and dividing by <tt>c<sup>2</sup></tt> <tt>...</tt><p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity27.GIF"></tt><p>
then using <tt><i>*EQ13</i></tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
or<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity29.GIF">
<i>*EQ16</i></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In the preceding development, momentum was defined as a non zero mass
multiplied by velocity.  Although this is valid it does not exclude other forms
of momentum.  Consider an object with zero rest mass but with velocity
<tt>c</tt>, calculating <tt>m(c)</tt> we have an ambivalent situation, both
<tt>L(c)</tt> and <tt>m(0)</tt> are zero.  Is their quotient zero, finite or
infinite?  If the answer is finite then there may be objects which have
momentum and energy but only at the speed of light.  Photons seem to fit this
description.  For example consider the momentum transferred from one particle
to another by light, the source particle recoils on emission thus losing
momentum, there is a slight travel time for the photon between particles, then
the target particle gains momentum when hit by the photon.  So if momentum is
always conserved the photon must carry it.  Hence let <tt><i>*EQ16</i></tt>
describe these as well.

<tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity36.GIF"></tt><p>
<tt></tt>  in <tt><i>*EQ18</i></tt> and <tt><i>*EQ19</i></tt>.<p>
<p>
These equations have an intriguing interpretation.  Recall that on a number
plane the square of the distance between two points is:<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity37.GIF"></tt><p>
<tt></tt>In three dimensions the square of the distance is:<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity38.GIF"></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
where <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, <tt>z</tt> denote the differences between the
co-ordinates of the points.  In Newtonian physics the value of <tt>d</tt> is
the same no matter what the velocity of the source.<p>
<p>
The theory of relativity, which apparently better reflects reality, predicts
that such measures are not invariant but that the following is:<p>
<p>
<tt>	
<IMG SRC="relativity39.GIF"></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
This formula is expressed using four parameters or dimensions, the three
Newtonian ones (<tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, <tt>z</tt>), called the spatial
dimensions, plus time.  Note that the time dimension has a special place in the
equation and cannot be interchanged (like <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt>
can) without effecting <tt>r</tt>.  The four dimensional universe described by
the four parameters is therefore called Space-time.<p>
<p>
from <tt><i>*EQ17</i>	
<IMG SRC="relativity40.GIF"></tt><p>
<p>
where <tt>k</tt> is some constant, is also independent of changes due to
velocity in the same way as <tt>Px + Py + Pz</tt> for conservation of momentum
in Newtonian Physics.<p>
<p>
Note that these constants can be either positive or negative, unlike the
Newtonian measure which is always positive.<p>
<p>
If <tt>
<IMG SRC="relativity41.GIF"></tt>
then the measure is said to be time like, and <tt>r</tt> is a real number,
otherwise, the measure is space like and <tt>r</tt> is an imaginary number.
All events which can effect an object at a particular time have a space like
measure relative to the object at that time.<p>
<p>
Hence <tt><i>*EQ17</i></tt> is the law of conservative of momentum, improved to
meet the theoretical and experimental results.  The implication is that Energy
is a special kind of momentum in the time or fourth dimension.  As an object
increases in velocity its space and time characteristics blend together as seen
by a stationary observer.<p>
<p>
Throughout this essay assumptions have been made, where others might just as
well have been.  The justification for the accuracy of a theory does not lie in
the elegance of the mathematics, but in confirmation by experiment.  So far
relativity has proved a better approximation to reality than any other theory.
If a start is made with the concepts of conservation of momentum, mass and
energy and distance in four dimensions, the variations in time, distance in
three dimensions and mass are direct consequences.

<html><head><TITLE>Special Relativity</title></head>
<body><H1 Align =center>The age of the Universe <br>(relatively speaking)</H1>
Lets have a look at a for instance arising from relativity.  The universe is
thought to have originated some 10 to 20 billion of our years ago in a big
bang.  This theory has been modified to include an inflation stage and is more
recently subject to challenge.  Anyway, the components of the bang have been
flying apart ever since, gradually slowed by gravitational attraction.  Due to
the finite speed of light we observe objects at a distance from us as they were
in the past when they were receding faster.  Consequently, on a galactic scale,
the further away we look the faster the recession velocity we observe, the
edge, called the Hubble Limit, occurs where this velocity reaches the speed of
light.  We presume these observations to be the same for any observer anywhere
and, despite the 3 dimensional geometric discomfort, that the edge is the big
bang itself.<p>
<p>
One of the more esoteric features of such a proposal is the initial state of
the universe, theories about the nature of things down to minute fractions of a
second after the big bang have developed to account for and predict
observations.  The question of what was about before or at time zero is often
considered outside the realm of physics since less than nothing is a less than
fulfilling answer.  Perhaps Relativity can help to shed some light on the
question or at least avoid it altogether.<p>
<p>
Time actually moves slower in receding galaxies due to the time dilation
effect, in every aspect of its effect on us this slower rate is significant, it
is the real time from our viewpoint.  If we observe a galaxy receding at
<tt>0.8c</tt> then the actual passage of time as measured by us will be slowed
by a factor of <tt>0.6</tt>.  Hence if we observe an event in our galaxy that
takes <tt>9</tt> years, the same event would be seen by us to take <tt>9/0.6 =
15</tt> years in the receding galaxy.<p>
<p>
This actual slowing of time and consequent extended age increases without bound
as the recession speed approaches the speed of light.  The open ended scale
often used to represent the evolution of the universe so as to give similar
space to the first busy fractions of a second and subsequent billions of years
may therefore be a more representative model of the universe from the viewpoint
of any observer, than by encompassing all with ones own parochial time zone.
Using our common sense time on such a scale is conceptually like trying to use
a metre ruler to measure the circumference of the Earth, it is straight and so
is the Earth on a local scale, but the Earth is bent on a large scale and so
the ruler is inappropriate for the global scale.  The conclusion I draw from
the time dilation effect on a universal scale is that time is the wrong tool to
determine a limit for the universe.  In the real measure of time, which is
subject to dilation with velocity and therefore distance, the universe is of
unbounded age.<p>

<TITLE>Babylonic Libation Support Device 2</TITLE>

<H1>Babylonic Libation Support Device</H1><H2> Number the second</H2>

<H3>Nim (version 2)</H3> is an altogether less easy game for which to have a winning strategy:<ul>
<Li>There are two players
<Li>There are several stacks of coins
<Li>The players decide who is to go first
<Li>Players take alternate turns
<Li>A turn consists of removing any number of coins from any one stack
<Li>The winner is the one who take the last coin (opposite to the goal of <A HREF="nim.html">nim version 1</A>)</ul>
<P>
Suppose there is only one stack of coins and it's your turn, obviously you'll win.
<P>
If there are two stacks of coins and its your turn then what should you do... well lets make it easier still. Put the same number of coins in each stack, if there is only one coin in each stack, you'll loose but what if their are two? since the stacks are identical it doesn't matter which one you choose and no matter if you take 1 or both then you'll loose, in fact, a little thought will show that the way to win with two stacks of coins is to ensure your opponent is always left with equal size stacks.
<P>
But this game need not have 2 stacks, it can have any number, so one strategy is to ensure that all pairs of stacks are the same size when it is your opponent's go. Now that may not seem possible in most cases (e.g. if there are an odd number of stacks) but there is a little trick here:  there are lot of stacks within stacks (that is any stack of 5 has stack(s) of 4 ,3,2,and 1 in it.. (in fact 32 stacks altogether!)) Keeping all possible sub stacks in pairs would certainly work because the whole game is broken up into a series of trivial sub games of the 2 stack variety, but there are so many substacks, and removing any coins will nearly always effect the balance of many pairs of substacks, this approach seems intractable. Well there maybe a usable compromise between defining a stack as the a whole pile of coins or as any sub pile. This is where we can use the power of 2's,.
<P>
If we can pair up substacks of as big a size as possible and then discount them from further comparisons, we'll  significantly reduce reduce the number of pairings we have to do and impose some order on the proceedings.  Effectively we will be considering non overlapping trivial (i.e. two equal stack) subgames, eliminating the biggest ones first. This will work because we are reducing the entire game to a series of these trivial subgames, all we have to do is ensure that there are always pairings of equal size substacks when it is our opponents go.
<P>
One way we could break up the stacks into substacks is say base 3 arithmetic, so a stack of 8 would be 2 stacks of three and 1 stack of 2... but pairing up substacks base three would be more complex than necessary, to see why try it with a sample set of stacks of say 8,6 and 3 coins... so base 2 is the way to go because there either is (1) or is not (0) a substack of a given size in an actual pile of coins. Lets look at the structure for a 8,6,3 game

<PRE>
		8	6	3	pairs?
		-----------------
	8's	1	0	0	No	
	4's	0	1	0	No
	2's	0	1	1	Yes
	1's	0	0	1	No
</PRE>
 One way (there are often a few optimal moves) of evening up these pairs is to pick on the 8 coin  stack: get rid of the 8, find another 4 and another 1. that is a net deficit of 3. So an optimal move is to take 3 coins from the 8 stack. The resulting configuration...
<PRE>
		5	6	3	pairs?
		-----------------
	8's	0	0	0	Yes	
	4's	1	1	0	Yes
	2's	0	1	1	Yes
	1's	1	0	1	Yes
</PRE>
...consists of pairs of trivial subgames, none of which our opponent could win. Writing a program to play this game is a great project for a competition or brighter students, as it is a non trivial exercise in logic. By looking at the problem in different ways in this case playing about with the substacks and the concept of the (trivial) games within the game.

Here is another example
<PRE>
		9	6	4	10	pairs?
		---------------------------
	8's	1	0	0	1	Yes	
	4's	0	1	0	0	No
	2's	0	1	1	1	No
	1's	1	0	1	0	Yes
</PRE>
we need to knock out a 4 and a 2, i.e. 6, and we can take 6 from the 9,6, or 10 columns so there are three optimal moves we can make in this case.

<H1 Align=center>Aconcagua</H1>
<H3 align=center>January 1996</H3>

"Because it's there". George Mallory's famous response to the question "why climb mountains?" is  remembered because it is glib, brave and enigmatic. Unfortunately Mallory and his companion, Irvine disappeared whilst attempting the summit of Everest in 1924 and Mallory has not yet returned to explain his answer. No one knows if Mallory or Irvine got to the top, all subsequent expeditions failed to summit until 29 years later, when on 28 may 1953 Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa stood on the top of the world and returned to tell their tale.
<p>
I climbed Aconcagua in January, it is in the Andes, in Argentina and is the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayas which has fully 26 higher peaks than this one.  The summit of Aconcagua is a tad under 7000 m above sea level. Base camp is at 4200 m, so we only really had 2800 m to climb. It was a hard slog, not terrifying, not exciting, it was a psychological and physical challenge lasting three weeks. The route we took up Aconcagua is an easy stroll compared to any route on Everest, the summit is 1.8 km lower and the ascent requires no technical climbing, but it is a very big mountain and rising about a kilometre above its neighbours, it looks it. 
<p>
Very big mountains seem to have minds of their own, this one is no exception. Aconcagua's moods are conveyed by the weather, which it makes largely itself. There are three factors to do with the weather which change seemingly  at the mountain's whim: The temperature, the wind and the snow. Underlying these are the relatively predictable factors: the steepness, the surface and the altitude.
<p>
Also fundamental to climbing of mountains is the climber, and there are relevant factors here too: Resolve, familiarity and fitness. Although less changeable than the weather they can fluctuate wildly nonetheless.
<p>
I learnt or clarified several things on the trip: The term "climb a mountain" is more aptly put as "climbing on a mountain", it does not necessarily include getting to the summit, it means experiencing and meeting the challenges of a robust and wild environment. I learnt that it takes a lot of experience to realise how unfamiliar, and potentially dangerous the mountain environment is, and consequently how important are self discipline, self assessment and team support... and I learnt a little bit about Argentina and the Andes: Oh yes and I learnt why I climb mountains: "Because I am here": Adventures are to sought and savoured because life is short and unique.<BR> <BR>On new years' day I flew out of Sydney on the new Ansett service to Auckland. It was one of those days that the tourism industry craves. The Harbour and the Hawkesbury shimmering blue, Kuringai Chase National park and the northern beaches slowly slipping behind as we headed  out over the Tasman. I luxuriated in comfort and serenity, and perused the menu, it was like being in one of those airline commercials: as if been carted off to heaven, that thought grated a bit as it slipped past with most of the others. 
<p>
Auckland was heralded by heavy green fields with grey above, feeling, as usual, more like east oz than a different country.  A brief wait then onto the Argentinean airliner, older, more cramped, less friendly, the feeling probably heightened by the contrast with the unexpected luxury of the preceding flight... I was on the cheapest ticket I could get after all.
<p>
 Although I had met most of the group during the flight we were now all together in Buenos Aires, we started to get to know each other on the trip to our hotel. This is a standard or "brochure" trip offered by World Expeditions, it is actually run by John and Brigitte Muir under their own company "Adventure Plus", we would meet them and Rudi the trainee mountain guide later in Mendoza:  For now there were the punters: Brian from Darwin who is involved with distance education, Paul the proprietor of a martial arts store, another Paul "sparrow"  a postal clerk, Ed who teaches horticulture, Richard a channel nine jurno, Janette a newly resigned nurse beginning a two month tour in South America, Andrew a plumber, Doug a valuer from Brisbane, Sandra and accountant and myself, Bill Taylor, computer nerd.
<p>
Buenos Aires, means "good air" and it was living up to its name, a little warm but a pleasant breeze that always keeps the city of ten million free of air pollution. Our hotel was right in the centre and very noisy, the main drag, all 18 lanes of it was just outside. A group of us got some rudimentary directions and an even more rudimentary map and went exploring,  straight down the "Florida" pedestrian mall, checking out the shops and the girls, our female compatriots assured us that they found the men were worth careful study too. A diet of steak an chips and Spanish genes seem to have done wonders. The evening found us selecting one of a myriad of cafes which are half inside and half "Al fresco" on the wide footpaths, enjoying  a "chopp"  ( mug of beer) or two, watching the passing parade and passing the time with idle banter.  
<p>
Buenos Aires comes alive at night, the lights are colourful and so is the clothing, the restaurants open late and the menu is limited, like a Monty Python script you can have steak, steak or steak... well there is chicken too, but no seafood much, despite the  250 km wide mouth of the River Plate defining one boundary of the city. We didn't get back to the Hotel  till midnight, just as well, the traffic noise made sleeping hard. The Argentinean peso has been defined to equal one U.S. dollar, and in most cases the prices are numerically higher than in Australia too. Our high living was costing us dearly, just as well we were heading for a fiscally monastic time in the mountains.
<p>
A short flight but a long way west of Buenos Aires is Mendoza, amidst a major wine producing area and just short of the Andes. Here we were met by John, Brigitte and Rudi: our guides. Mendoza has wide streets all lined with overarching trees rooted near metre deep gutters between footpath and road. The trees were planted to delay the collapse of buildings in the event of an earthquake, giving people a chance to run into the wide streets. Apparently there was a catastrophic quake earlier in the century, but they don't occur very often. Nor does it seem that rain occurs often, well at least not pouring rain which flooded the city that afternoon, the deep gutters quickly overflowing to form a very temporary and shallow version of Venice. Mendoza has the same proportion of cafes and attractive girls as Buenos Aires, they also share the very civilised siesta, the shops close and the restaurants open between one and five. 
<p>
Today to the hills: We loaded up the gear from the apartment that our guides had rented. They were spending about two months or more in Mendoza, running two trips to Aconcagua of which ours was the first. Once out of Mendoza we were in flat country sparsely vegetated with light loamy, infertile soil, The Mendoza river valley was wide with  deep unstable banks the river a torrent casually and constantly carving a new course in the flat valley floor.  The Hills loomed, mountains by our standard, loose piles of rock, a wonder that the road remained clear. This road is the major link to Chile, A seemingly intact but unused rail line shares the route with the road. There is evidence of landslides and protective works. The Andes are young and still changing, there is a lot of loose rock and a lot of steep slopes,similar to the Himalayas and  most unlike the hard bare bones of mountains which constitute Australia's high country, once as high as these but eroded to their ancient roots by time and water.
<p>
Twenty Kilometres short of the Chilean border the bus put us out at "Puenta del Inca" (bridge of the Inca), a natural span over the river, with thermal springs a two star hotel and a bunkhouse attached to a rough restaurant... we got the bunkhouse. The altitude was around 3200 metres above sea level, high enough to be wary of altitude effects and to start the acclimatisation process. Fortunately acclimatisation is not hard to do, all you do is keep breathing and take it easy. Three of us decided to scamper 400 metres up the southern side of the valley, to a high point which we christened "mini Arapalis" because of its supposed similarity in appearance to this famous Victorian climbing venue. The walk was steep and the cover loose but it took only three hours for the round trip. From a little way up we could look North and see the impossibly vertical and rugged South Face of Aconcagua, it was clearly higher than anything around, and looked only a few kilometres distant although it was still between 30 and 40  kilometres away.
<p>
The trek into base camp started some 15 km back down the road where the "Vacus" river joined the main Mendoza river valley. A concrete and corrugated iron barracks for three army "muleteers" (mule herders) marked the starting point. A few of poplar trees in an irrigated patch further up were the last trees we would see and  marked the start of the 70km walk into of the Eastern base camp, there is another on the western "Horconus" side.  We had dropped the bulk of our equipment to a ski resort just up the road where the mules we had hired would be loaded. The mules carry about 60 kilos each and are shepparded by muleteers, dressed in gaucho style, riding horses and wielding Lassos.
<p>
 It was a beautiful day, around 18 degrees with no wind and a blue sky. The track was stony but well travelled, our guides insisted on a slow pace and that we use our ski poles so that we would not over exert ourselves and get used to walking with the aid of the poles. Some of us found the pace too slow for comfort, but the group soon spread out nonetheless. The first day's walk  followed the gentle V shaped valley, carved by the lower section of the river and ended at a dusty camp site inhabited by a lone ranger living in a stone hut, with a large radio antenna. The area is a national park, Aconcagua is a popular destination, so the government has established a permit system to keep tabs on usage and employs the rangers to police permits, rubbish disposal and help with the welfare of climbers and provide a means of communication between the various mule companies and their clients.
<p>
Day two started with a crossing of the Vacus river, which I was assured was dangerous, although it proved very easy to wade and not too cold despite is glacial origins... sort of like the Snowy river on valium. The others got a lift across from the muleteers. A very slow pace made it a long walk up the increasingly flattening and widening river valley. There were no trees the plants were well separated by rocks of the light coloured Earth, there were no side creeks, a desert despite the river passing through it. Dust blown by the wind detracted from the otherwise wonderful weather. Eventually we came to a side valley, framed in its sharp V was Aconcagua, a breathtaking scene after the dreary sameness of the valley we had followed all day. We camped on the only grassy bank we had or would encounter with this wonderful view changing as the sun set.
<p>
The Vacus was shallow here, only ankle deep, and flowing severally in rivulets. Its temperature responded to the ambient air, it was early in the morning and cold, the river was consequently painfully cold and the crossing well remarked upon as a result. We were travelling with an American group who had overtaken us on the first day, their pace was decidedly faster than ours, our guides maintaining that we would acclimatise far better if we took it very easy, the Americans disappeared before us towards base camp.  We climbed a steep path to a hanging valley, I had gone ahead feeling the need for exercise and getting more than I bargained for when I realised about half way up that I had left my camera on a rock at the last rest spot, so down I went to be remonstrated by John who had picked it up. Suitably mollified I reached the top of the hill in time to see our mules making their way up past the group. Mules are skittish at the best of times but the proximity of the humans proved the undoing of one mule's demeanour and the consequent undoing of its load. The ensuing mule jam lasted a good half hour, the rest of the group frozen where they stood, least they upset another of these particularly stupid animals.
<p>
The wind picked up a little as we walked along the valley, a lazy lunch was had  in the sheltered bed of a creek, we passed two people descending, they had summited two days before and were racing for the road head and a cold beer. As we plodded on at "Brigitte pace" (dead slow) the wind  picked up a little more and the mountain started to make heavy cloud which  flowed down towards us. John had gone ahead to start sorting out the gear the mules had delivered to base camp. We had met the mules returning an hour or so after lunch so base camp could not be too far off, the track was good so I decided a bit more exercise was called for headed on alone. The weather quickly became worse, the wind very strong and wet snow began to fall, by the time I got to base camp it was cold very windy and heavily snowing. I found John and we had a brew in the lee of a large boulder before setting about erecting tents. About an hour later the rest of the group arrived having endured the worst of the afternoon storm, some of them were a bit worse for wear and were immediately ensconced in the tents we had  erected. The weather cleared before nightfall so a comfortable dinner was had before an early night.
<p>
Base camp is at 4200 metres, we had ascended a fair distance the previous day so altitude effects were expected, some of our group and the faster Americans were suffering insomnia and the perpetual headache associated with increasing ones altitude, but none were suffering the pounding headache that is the first dangerous symptom of altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is edema or swelling in the brain or lungs, a rough explanation is that the pressure inside cells has not had time to equalise with  the  external pressure which decreases with altitude. The only cure is to descend, fortunately this is a quick and effective cure, but ignoring the symptoms can be just as quickly fatal. 
<p>
It is necessary to acclimatise carefully, to avoid altitude sickness, a good strategy is to go high then sleep low, and this dovetails nicely with the fact that we had too much equipment and food to take up to higher camps in one go. Now that we were in a mule free zone, we had to carry everything ourselves. The plan was to establish camp 1 by carrying a load up, then come back and rest at base camp before taking a second load up to camp 1 and staying. After we were acclimatised at camp 1 and rested We would then establish camp two in a similar fashion, using camp 1 as a transit camp for the second load which we would have to get from base camp.  Having established camp 1 and 2  would rest at base camp then go to camp 1 then 2 then then traverse to camp 3, not a lot higher than camp 2, but closer to the easiest route to the summit. We would stay at camp 3 for a few days and attempt the summit, still one vertical kilometre above if the weather and our health allowed. We would descend from camp 3 to base camp in one day. This plan would give us the maximum rest at the minimum altitude before the summit attempt, and the maximum flexibility in the event of adverse events.
<p>
The first day to camp one was very slow, a deliberate "Brigitte" pace to offset the effects of mainly the altitude, but also the heavy load we were each now carrying. The route to camp 1 skirts to the South of the English glacier, on scree and rock generated by rugged vertical cliffs on our left, it then crosses onto the glacier itself, although, except for the occasional glimpse of ice, it is entirely covered by rock and gravel. The track rises and falls, twists and turns amongst the larger rocks and hills of gravel. The ground is so malleable that an obvious track is easily and quickly formed by the passage of people, but everyone seems to have followed this same one more or less. Lunch was had near some flowing water emerging from under some "neve penatentes" (snow knives), which are  soft ice pinnacles up to a metre high arrayed in hundreds, the last vestige of glacial ice which has been exposed on a flat section and has slowly melted away. Lunch was always cheese, salami, tomatoes (until they ran out), crackers, assorted savouries from tins and a reminder to drink lots of water. Soon after lunch one of our group was having trouble, unable to find energy reserves and possibly in danger from altitude effects, Doug had to return to base camp with Rudi, our apprentice guide.
<p>
15 minutes after lunch we came to the base of the "big up" to camp one, maybe 300 metres vertical, the first section was up a spur to the base of a cliff  the rocks were smaller and the rise steeper than we had experienced on the glacier. The second part, skirted to the right of the cliff, it was a much steeper soft gravelly scree. Brigitte decide on an alternative zig zag traverse over thin snow and ice cover further to the right. The slow pace,  the ease with which one broke through the thin ice into a rivulet or slipped on the harder ice made this trying, but eventually we reached the larger looser rocks at the top of the section and traversed across a small snow field to camp one, all feeling a little worse for wear and breathing hard. There were several tents set up already, either occupied or pending the return of parties from higher up or from base camp. We  dumped our gear on a tent sized platform smoothed of  rocks, with a rock wall to help alleviate the effects of wind. Many of these had been constructed here, each takes a few hours to build, so we were hoping that there would be more free sites when we returned. The descent from camp one was fast! A run down the scree slope, the gravel was small and very loose, each wild step pushed a small wave of it in front, the only problem was the few sections where there was only a veneer over the glacial ice: bend ze knees, keep the weight forward, just like skiing... the rest of the descent through the relentless rock chicane of the glacier towards base camp which seemed to take longer to get closer than it reasonably should have, was less edifying.
<p>
 I don't recall the weather that night, but when it was fine the stars blazed with an intensity that only being above half the Earth's atmosphere can bring, in a word awesome, especially underlayed with the white of the summit and the black bastions of the rugged cliffs closer to us. Being in the Southern Hemisphere, the sky was very familiar, the milky way being much better seen from this latitude than from the northern hemisphere, the scene was far more spectacular than I recall from the Himalayas.
<p>
A rest day at base camp, luxuriating in the mess tent, being plied with food and hot drinks at regular intervals, thanks to Rudi and John, a late night card game by candlelight then off to sleep, much easier now that we were well acclimatised to base camp. The second trip to camp one was a slightly faster pace, nevertheless I joined a group of Americans who were going a bit faster, discussing environmental concerns in Alaska and the internet of course! I waited at the "regular" lunch spot for the others. Doug was having similar problems, he did not have altitude sickness, he had just simply failed to acclimatise, an unpredictable and uncommon malaise, his ascent was over, he would have to wait at base camp or  return to Mendoza, for now he chose the former. After lunch I went ahead again, this time ascending the scree slope, puffing hard but going fast I felt great and already had cleared snow from our gear and put up a tent when the first of the others arrived. We cleared some rough sites set up the other tents, collected water, cooked dinner on the shellite burning stoves and watched a spectacular sunset. The wind was strong that night and I paid for my fast assent with a strong headache all that night.
<p>
The day dawned fine with a stiff breeze, we could see well up the valley but not as far as camp two, hidden above a steep slope to the left. We started very .. very .. slowly to ascend, this time I was more aware that others in the group were finding the going tough, it took a long time to zig zag up to a pass, as we approached  the wind got stronger. We met a chap coming down the hill who was descending from camp three due to altitude sickness, apparently there was a "Gamow bag" with his party: a sealable plastic "body bag" which can be pumped up to increase the air pressure inside. I have never seen one of these but a few parties carry them,   at any rate the drop of a few hundred metres saw him in good health disappointed that his trip was over and looking forward to a beer in Mendoza. I'm sure I was not the only one a little envious of the prospect of the latter.
<p>
<BR> Very near the pass Janette had had enough, she had no more energy and had begun to shiver, this was a sign that her body core temperature had dropped, further exertion would be dangerous. She decided to descend to base camp after lunch which we had a few minutes later, in a quickly strengthening wind. Brian also started shivering, his hands very cold his fingers suffering frost nip, John advised him that he should descend too, so both of them returned to camp with John to await our return. Unfortunately we had gone too slowly to reach camp two and ascended to a nearby second pass which we christened "camp one and two thirds" where we dumped ice axes, crampons and food. There were two tents set up nearby, their occupants had also gone high enough for the day and had decided to stay. The run down the scree and snow from "camp one and two thirds" to camp one was fun and exhilarating, however Andrew was exhausted and took it slowly, he had also decided that he'd had enough and would stay at base camp.  After a short rest at camp one we ran down the scree and negotiated the interminable terminal moraine of the glacier to get "home" to the relative comfort of base camp.
<p>
A rest day, now well acclimatised, the air actually felt thick at base camp. The weather was not too good but we had our mess tent, books cards and plenty of warm clothing. Doug had decided that he was not even acclimatised at base camp, he felt he was wasting and losing strength. Brigitte used the resident ranger's radio to hire a mule to come and take him out, it would take two days to come and would cost him $350 US!, hopefully this would be classed as a medical evacuation by his insurance company. We had a visit from two guides from another group, friends of John and Brigitte, there were a lot of people on the mountain, and depending on the weather and the proximity of tents it was quite a social occasion. These two had also been to Everest, one had summited and the other not, reinforcement of the need to accept the bitter pill of coming all this way to climb only almost to the top of the mountain.
<p>
A fine day for the start of our shot at the top, only to camp one today, much faster than the previous two times the difficulties of the previous trip concentrated  our attention and helped make it seem very familiar now. Camp one was busy, maybe forty people encamped as best they could to avoid the wind. We ate heartily in expectation of the next day and watched a spectacular sunset with some Americans. On to camp two today, a much quicker assent got us to our stash at camp "one and two thirds" in under three hours. A quandary now, whether to add the stash to our gear or make a second trip back down from camp two to get it. We were fit and unsure how long it would take to get to camp two, so we committed to the former. Now heavily laden we trudged up a steep and  steepening  slope,  increasingly snow covered, puffing to a halt frequently for a rest. A lot of people were heading up today, maybe twenty, it seemed like peak hour on the peak no one had more than enough air to gasp a platitude as we passed each other.
<p>
Camp two is amidst rock pinnacles  at the base of the Polish Glacier which extends to the summit of the mountain, still more than a vertical kilometre above. The traffic of the day had vanished, hidden in the interstices of the rock to avoid the wind. We continued out onto a large relatively flat step, camping out of cover. Local knowledge reported that there would be less wind here, the pinnacles being the play thing of the air, careering around the rock like reckless children of the gods playing chasings. Fortunately the kids were tired that night and we had beautiful fine weather but very, very cold. Dinner was fast and cooled between bowl and mouth. John and I watched some people on the skyline descending from the summit, we also thought we saw someone moving down towards us stop dead in the snow and not move again. I suggested that we go up and check it out, but John said it was a lot further than it looked and it would take us five hours to get to the spot, long after darkness had fallen.
<p>
 Morning was very cold but clear, the dot in the snow we had thought was a person was still there, we would be traversing today, much lower than the dot but closer to it than we were camped. We never got close enough to identify it positively, I'm still not sure that dot was a rock. Today I felt drained of energy and I could not explain it, the trudge to camp three was through calf deep snow, not hard in itself and almost flat, we would only rise a net 100 metres today, but it was to be very hard for me. "Sparrow" found it harder, he was staggering only an hour out from camp two. John assessed his condition and decided that he should go down, Sparrow agreed. I felt particularly disappointed for him, he had become ill at camp three on Mera Peak in Nepal too, he would be turned back by health again this time. With Sparrow gone and John taking him down to base camp, we had extra gear to carry and a team of seven.
<p>
I was very tired when I finally arrived at camp three, all of us seemed to be except for Ed. Sandy was sitting in the sun, well covered but shivering, a sign that she may be becoming Hypothermic. Ed and I  erected a tent and got her into her sleeping bag as quickly as we could, although I was rather dismayed to find how slow "as quickly as we could" was. Brigitte decided that we would have a rest day tomorrow, although I was keen to take the first opportunity to try for the top I was happy to have the opportunity to shake off my lethargy and lack of energy, alas it was to stay with me until we reached base camp and I finally figured out what was wrong. That afternoon an American group we had more or less being following staggered down from their successful summit bid, they had had a perfect day for it, but they  reeled and staggered down the final few hundred metres, collapsing at their tents. After checking they were okay we let them be till the next day.
<p>
A day of waiting, the Americans rose late told tales of their ascent and slowly packed up and departed down the other side of the mountain, I was envious of their success and  that they would be back in the heat of Mendoza in three days  and devastated by the thought of the beer they would be quaffing. It was here also that I exchanged email addresses with Jim from Motorola, the internet is everywhere!
<p>
 I spent the dark hours braced against the windward side of the tent in an attempt  to stop it bending so low that it pressed on my face.  A fine spindrift filled the air inside the tent and snow pilled high in one of the tent's vestibules a less than pleasant night. I thanked Brigitte in her absence for insisting we bring a pee bottle: getting out of the tent was not an option that night. 
<p>
We were camped on a small flat clay basin lightly covered by snow when we arrived but moreso now after a blustery night. Just west of us over the edge of our clay pan was "Berlin", camp 3 for those coming up from the Horconus side of the mountain. There were many tents at Berlin, maybe twenty or more people and the highest hut in the world, now a roofless ruin but there nonetheless. We spent the day collecting snow to melt into water, preparing meals, stealing ourselves to bare bits of us for essential bodily functions and finding little nooks in the sun and out of the wind.
<p>
The plan was for Rudi and Brigitte to start making water at one a.m. and for each tent to collect and distribute it on the hour until five a.m. The purpose was to hydrate us, although it seemed like a version of Chinese water torture considering the temperature outside. At 5:55, with the first glow of morning we were due to leave. The gear was hard to get on in the confines of the tent, it was bitterly cold and we were waiting for two of our party. It was like the keystone cops Brigitte roaring at the "dorks" to get their act together as we were all freezing just standing around, an the two tardy trekkers dancing and spasaming as if at a rave party in their attempt to equip themselves. 
<p>
My feet were cold and I was rigging my toes furiously trying to maintain circulation. My hands were very cold, despite two layers of gloves. I was eager to start trudging up the hill, at least that would heat the feet. An hour up the hill we had joined  the main route coming up from camp "Berlin", we were in dangerous territory, hard snow and not wearing crampons, we were looking for a protected spot to fit them. Several events occurred in quick succession. First from around a rock in front of us a group of French climbers appeared heading down very quickly "plus tres froid", they had ascended earlier than us, it was too cold, they were suffering badly. We later heard that they  packed up camp and descended from the mountain that same day. The second thing that happened is the sun light found  us, the rays were turning selected ridges of rock gold, there was a sea of cloud below us at about 5800 metres, only a few peaks poked past it. Thirdly we found a place to fit our crampons, fourthly two other climbers caught up with us and fifthly the wind started, not bad at first but inexorably increasing.
<p>
The two independent climbers turned back, we fitted our crampons, unfortunately I had lost a bolt from one of mine, but I was able to tie it up most satisfactorily with a shoelace. Others had trouble too, one of Ed's crampons could not be adjusted sufficiently so he was forced to wear just one. We continued upwards, rugged cliffs above us, there was nothing to judge the perspective, but we knew they were huge. An American group hurtled past us managing 400 metres per hour to our 300... hoons! We crossed a snow slope then zig zagged up a steepish rock bed to "Independencia" with its "deconstructed" wood shelter, about the size of a large kennel but with a large portion of the roof missing. We rested here along with the Americans, they roped together and headed up a steep snowbank to the Southern face, we followed a little later. the weather was becoming worse, clouds descending, the wind increasing. We reached the top of the snow bank and saw heavy cloud descending towards us, the American group were pinned by the wind midway on the traverse to the "Canaleta" the final chute to the top. Brigitte made the decision to turn back. We don't know what the Americans did, it was the last we saw of them.
<p>
Bridgitte's experience and the fact that she was responsible for the group and that she  had summited several times on this peak must have helped her keep to the side of safety. I cursed and thanked her at the same time.   We would not make the top. Had I been as fit as I had been on the way to camp two I would have felt  robbed, but the fact is that I was significantly less able than that day. She made a hard but correct decision. Although she said we would try again tomorrow, I think we all knew that we would not.
<p>
We turned and found that the weather had not been changing as much as we thought, it was we who were ascending into worse and worse weather. The descent was assisted by various bouts of sliding down snow banks, it was nevertheless exhausting, I learnt for the second time that the most dangerous part of a climb is the descent, so tired, it is easy to loose concentration. We staggered to the tents where I and the others collapsed, home at last.
<p>
During the the descent we met  two rangers  they were looking for two people who had not returned to their camp the previous night. I wondered if the "rock" we had seen was one of them, I still wonder. Apparently the pair were later found but would loose their feet due to frostbite.  Two members of an Argentinean army team had slipped in the Canaleta the day before, they slid a kilometre down the slope, they had survived but had been badly injured. There was a  solo climber who needed help  too,  a little disorientated probably due to hypothermia, he was snow blind and had the dry skin shredding from his face, but then again so did we all, he had to be bedded down and sent down the hill the next day without being able to establish if he was actually solo or had been with some group.
<p>
I spent the rest of the day in my tent, all my fingers felt tingly, I had done some damage during the cold of the morning. I had frost nip, not frost bite, but it could easily lead to permanent damage if I was not careful.  Most of the others were exhausted and in pain  too. Ed's fingers had dried to the extent that they were painfully cracked, nearly everyone's lips consisted of shredding blocks separated by cracks and had dried dead skin on their faces: it is a very dry environment. The night was not good, a strong wind made sleep difficult, and the disappointment of the day filled the dark hours of consciousness. The morning dawned overcast with a strong wind evident by streaming clouds on the summit, there would be no chance of going up, I was almost relieved, but very disappointed nonetheless. John arrived having come up all the way from base camp, he was surprised we had not made the summit, I wonder if he would have made the decision to turn back as had Brigitte. It was a time of mixed emotions for me, I was still lacking in energy, as were some of the others, a consensus for descent was forming, at any rate we had run out of time unless we were to forgo our recuperation day at base camp. We decided to descend all the way to base camp the next day, as planned.
<p>
Due to lack of energy and a strong breeze, it took a while to dismantle camp. The tents were trying to blow away and had to be carefully handled in order not to  loose them. We took a high traverse back towards camp two, the snow was deep and the slope steep, so crampons were essential. Half an hour out  we came across a man obviously exhausted and disorientated, attached by a rope to another man, who we gather wanted to know if we were in contact with camp Berlin, the alternate camp 3, he was headed the wrong way. Brigitte pointed him back where we had come, Berlin was that way. There were two other people about 100 metres further down the slope, we could not ascertain if they were with the two near us but they too seemed unsure of where they were. We later found from John, who we had left finalising a stash of gear at camp three,  that the four of them were headed for camp "Berlin". 
<p>
The slog to camp two was arduous. Part way along the tent I was carrying popped out of my pack an rolled and rolled and rolled. Brigitte dropped her pack for John to pick up and went after the tent, I was not allowed to. She eventually got to it and started towards camp two, fortunately the tent had stopped at roughly the same level as camp two. I felt like such a fool and very angry with myself. We saw a group attempting a high traverse above us split and half retreat, the other half, about five people, continued on, we later found that one of them made the summit. Two figures were bravely attempting the Polish glacier route, they were specks against the lower reaches of this huge slope. The snow there was very deep, and they did not get very far before detouring towards the high traverse root to independencia. 
<p>
Camp two was very difficult for me, my reserves seemed to be fading, but it was also the beginning of the long steep slope down. The continuous descent was much less taxing, the snow actually helping maintain a steady rate down towards camp one. I was beginning to feel better mainly because of the thought of good food and thicker air at base camp. We picked up the remainder of our gear at camp one and after a short rest headed down the scree slope for the last time. The trip back down the glacial moraine seemed to take for ever, I was telling myself not to stop, that I was nearly there, then all of a sudden I was.
<p>
Brian had made some thick Lancashire broth, it was a lifesaver, after one warming bowl I realised that the major part of what had been wrong with me was a lack of nutrition, three rounds of  various hearty fare and I was feeling back to normal. The air at base camp felt luxuriously thick, I put on the fibre jacket I should have taken with me up the hill and remonstrated myself for not feeding myself properly.
<p>
While we were away Doug had gone out by mule, Janette and Andrew had also teamed up with an Irish chap and gone back to Mendoza. Brian and sparrow were holding the fort, they  had explored the valley and minor peak around base camp whilst waiting for us. The following day was a rest day we spent it siting around, attempting to wash, having the most painful shave of my life, as the whiskers and a layer of dead skin came off together. We also listened to the tales of other groups as they came back to base camp, viewing a new group as they came in, with the eye of experience as we must have been perused when we arrived. We spent the evening convincing a Russian mountaineer that <A href="#mountain">Mt Kosciusko*</A> was an afternoon stroll, and that we realised he wanted to climb it but that walk it was a better choice of words, adding that his grandmother might like the exercise.
<p>
Packing up involved collapsing the mess tent so that it would not be blown away before John and Bridgitte's next trip in two weeks time, ensuring we had not left any mess placing the gear for the mules we had organised, and heading off. We made it an easy stroll down the valley, often turning too the now very familiar view of  Aconcagua, it looked like a good summit day. We arrived a the camp site to a very strong wind, the mules were expected soon but they didn't arrive till nearly dark. We found what shelter we could. I had a marvelously slothful afternoon in the shelter of a large boulder.
<p>
The next two days to the road were uneventful, Richard and Paul went ahead so that Richard could organise a story on BHP's interests in Argentina, the remaining six of us took our time, but the last morning I turned on the turbocharger to get to the road head as fast as I could. At the road head, I struck up a conversation with three Argentinean army chaps who were members of a special artillery regiment, their job was to look after the mules used to transport parts of guns into the mountains. They were waiting for a bus too, they had been stuck in this dusty windy hole for three weeks and were due for a month's leave. Our bus arrived but as usual we had to wait hours for the mules, finally on the road I was sad to be leaving the Andes, I felt like heading back up to try for the top again.
<p>
I didn't realise how dirty we were until we got into the foyer of the hotel, to be met by the others. All save Doug were there, he had brought forward his flights and returned to Australia.  Suffice to say that the first beer was the best!  I was then pleasantly surprised by a barman's interpretation of a gin and tonic: a tall tumbler of tonic and an equal tumbler of gin. The final group dinner was a celebration of friends, we knew each other well, we had been family for three weeks. Some of the group were headed to different locations or on different flights, we said goodbye to John, Brigitte and Rudi and returned to Buenos Aires. A late night at the cafes of Buenos Aires next morning, I headed for home.
<p>

                                <centre> The Amazon

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Covering approximately 46,332 sq. miles, the major area of the Ecuadorian
Amazon supports exuberant vegetation that is typical of humid tropical
forests, its western limit is the Andes Mountain Range, Peru lies to the
south and Colombia to the north.<P>

Immense quantities of material flowing from the Andes have benn washed down
the rivers, forming strips of alluvial soils and terraces that are used for
farming.<P>

The annual average temperature falls between 76* and 78*F. Between 118 and
157 inches of rainfall are distributed more or less equally throughout the
year, although December through February are the drier months.<P>

The principal attraction of the hilly forest is, of course, the trees, some
soaring higher than 150 feet. Common species are cinnamon, silkcotton,
jacaranda and several leguminous trees. The alluvial plains, located on the
terraces of the principal rives, support great concentrations of palm trees.<P>

The principal Amazon artery for visitors is the Napo River, a major
tributary of the main Amazon River. Its basin is 870 miles long and one to
three miles wide. As a result of fluvial dynamics, the Napo's 130 islands
are covered by young forests, which provide refuge and nesting sites for a
multitude of bird species, many of them migratory.<P>

Along the length of the Napo, natives and settlers have established
communities, intersperced occasionally with small hotels and lodges. Most of
the shore is covered with tropical forest, and over thousands of years,
riverbeds have formed many attractive lakes.<P>

Historically, the indigenous communities have been able to maintain a
productive subsistence within the existing ecosystems of vast forest
preserve. The most representative are: the Siona- Secoya, Cofan, Huaorani,
Quichua, Shuar and Ashuar.<P>

The Amazonas ecosystem, particularly its tropical rain forest, is considered
to be one of the richest and most complex communities of plant and animal
life in the world. The region is characterized by huge and diverse amounts
of flora and fauna with extraordinary variations in their habitats and
micro- habitats.<P>

In the jungles of the Upper Amazon 100 species of trees per acre habe been
recorded. In Central America, only up to 40 species per acre have been
discovered. In the temperate forests of North America and Europa, rarely
more than 20 different species exist per acre.

The Amazon's rivers, lakes, streams and marshlands support over 600 species
of fish and more than 250 species of amphibians and reptiles. The lagoons of
the Napo and Aguarico River basins are home to colonies of two species of
caymans that grow to over 13 feet in length.<P>

Typical South American mammals which live in Ecuador's Amazon include
armadillos, honey bears and sloths. Amazon bats form a cosmopolitan group
numbering more than 60 species. Other mammals found in the tropical forest
include tapirs, monkeys, and ocelots (or jaguars). On a walk through the
forest, you will observe groups of monkeys, boars and large rodents; and in
the lagoons there are manatees and caymans.<P>

Birds are the richest group of Amazon vertebrates, and approximately 1.000
species live in a variety of forest habitats, lagoons and open areas. In all
Amazon ecosystems, colorful birds make themselves at home. Familiar
sightings will be parrots, macaws and tanagers on land and on water,
darters, herons and gulls flourish.<P>

Ecuador's extensive national park system, scientific station and protected
areas cover nearly a 7.5 million acres. To preserve areas, Ecuador has
created the Yasuni National Park Biosphere Reserve, the Limoncocha
Ecological Reserve, the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve and others. (However, the
Ecuadorian government has recently let oil and mineral companies start
prospecting in the parks. Also, poaching of animals and hardwood trees often
occurs. So see it while you can folks, some estimate the parks will last
another 5-10 years in their current state.)<P>

The Napo and Aguarico River basins offer multiple possibilities for you to
enjoy the ecosystem complexes, alluvial plains, swamps and flooded areas all
of which are inhabited by a variety of species. The Yuturi, Yasuni,
Tiputini, Tivacuno and Cononaco rivers are completely surrounded by virgin
forest.<P>

<B><center><H1>THE STRUCTURE OF RAINFORESTS</center></B></H1>
<P>
A forest has a number of levels or storeys that can be identified.  If a forest is dense, the upper branches join together and form a solid overhead canopy.  As trees compete for sunlight, these branches create a roof over the forest.  This effectively blocks out light to the layers below, keeping the forest dark and cool.  Forests that close off the sunlight are often called closed forests.  
<BR>Occasionally, very tall trees break through the canopy and tower above the forest.  These individual trees are known as emergents.  
<BR>The absence of sunlight means the ground layer can only support shade-tolerant ferns, palms and mosses.  Very few grasses exist on the floor of the forest, which is covered with a thick mat of dead decaying leaves.  Because these leaves and twigs are strewn about the ground, they are called litter.
<BR>Between the canopy and forest floor is an intermediate layer of saplings, shrubs and vines.  Their growth is restricted until a break in the canopy allows sunlight to penetrate.  Light-hungry saplings grow quickly and straight towards the sun.  This layer often contains epiphytes such as staghorns and crows-nests.  They grow on host trees and obtain their nutrients by catching leaves that fall from above.  Parasites like the strangler fig grow on and take over a host tree which ultimately dies.

<Font size="5">Rainforests cover less than two percent of the Earth's surface, yet they are home to some 50 to 70 percent of all life forms on our planet. Sadly, about 11 million hectares of tropical rainforest are removed each year, mainly in the developing world, which sees its rainforests as a means of solving problems of overcrowding and unemployment and as a way of earning money to pay huge international debts. It has been estimated the an area of a football field is being cleared from our planet every second. The Amazon Basin loses an area about the size of Belgium every year. The rainforests are quite simply, the richest, oldest, most productive and most complex  ecosystems on Earth. As  biologist Norman Myers notes, "Rainforests are the finest celebration of nature ever known on the planet." And never before has nature's greatest orchestration
been so threatened.</Font size="5">

<P ALIGN=CENTER>6-9 million indigenous people inhabited the Brazilian rainforest in 1500.<BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Species Extinction</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Distinguished scientists estimate an average of 137 species of life forms are
driven into extinction every day, or 50,000 each year.</P>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Projected Economic Value of One Hectare in the Peruvian Amazon</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>$6,820 per year if intact forest is sustainably harvested for fruits, latex, and
timber</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>$1,000 if clear-cut for commercial timber (not sustainably harvested)</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>or $148 if used as cattle pasture</P>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<P>While you were reading the above statistics, approximately 150 acres of
rainforest were destroyed. Within the next hour approximately six species will
become extinct. While extinction is a natural process, the alarming rate of
extinction today, comparable only to the extinction of the dinosaurs, is
specifically human-induced and unprecedented. Experts agree that the number-one
cause of extinction is habitat destruction. Quite simply, when habitat is
reduced, species disappear.  In the rainforests, logging, cattle ranching,
mining, oil extraction, hydroelectric dams and subsistence farming are the
leading causes of habitat destruction. Indirectly, the leading threats to
rainforest ecosystems are unbridled development, funded by international
aid-lending institutions such as the World Bank, and the voracious consumer
appetites of industrialized nations. If deforestation continues at current rates,
scientists estimate nearly 80-90 percent of tropical rainforest ecosystems will be destroyed
by the year 2020.

	Forests have major role to play in conserving the land surface. Their extensive root systems hold the soil together. They fertilise the soil with leaf litter and the acids their roots secrete. They aerate the soil, encouraging other plants and organisms such as earthworms which increase the soil's fertility. Forests regulate rainfall and the amount of water that passes deep into the soil. Their roots suck excess ground water to the surface and shed it into the air by transpiring it from their leaves. Forests keep water tables at a constant level, and salty deposits which could rise and kill vegetation, are left lower in the soil.<P>
Forests offer visual beauty as well as variety to the Earth's surface. As many national park visitors will no doubt agree, there is nothing more refreshing or invigorating than getting out of the city and taking a walk in the forest.<P>
Apart from protecting land, forests preserve water catchments, improve water quality, protect wildlife ecosystems and provide timber and other products for people to use. In a broader sense they purify the air we breathe by removing poisonous carbon dioxide and giving off oxygen. They are the lungs of the Earth and they play an important role in stabilising world climate. For all these reasons, forests are a resource worthy of preservation.

In addition, a large number of the world's food crops, including staple foods like rice, corn, manioc and tapioca (Cassava), originated in the world's rainforests. So too did fruits like bananas, oranges, tomatoes, mangoes, pineapples, avocados and grapefruit. Sugarcane, coffee, chocolate, vanilla as well as many nuts, spices and teas, are among a variety of other food sources which evolved from rainforests.

The Himalayas is the world's highest mountain range comprising all top ten of the world's highest peaks. In fact, the Himalayas includes 14 peaks more than 8,000 meters high and some 200 more than 6000 meters. <p>

Contrary to popular belief, the Himalayas is a non-continuous range segmented at various places, forming several subranges. Other times, the Himalayas consists of a cluster of mountains on a separate latitude. As such, clustered mountains in the Himalayas are roughly grouped together by regions, sometimes called <i>Himal</i>. <p>

<center>Himalayas</center>
<hr>


The Himalayas are a mountain system in Asia, on the northern edge of the Indian subcontinent.  It is the highest mountain range in the world and includes several of the highest peaks; Mount EVEREST (Tibetan:  Chomolungma), at 8,872 m (29,108 ft) above sea level, is the highest mountain in the world.  Precise measurement is difficult, however.  A measurement of GODWIN AUSTEN (K2) in March 1987 indicated that it might be higher than Everest, but Everest was remeasured by a similar method later that year and found to be 24 meters (80 ft) higher than previously believed--and thus still the highest mountain in the world. <p>

The range is commonly defined as the high mountain region bracketed between the bends of the INDUS RIVER (on the west) and the BRAHMAPUTRA RIVER (on the east) at the point where those streams descend to the plains.  According to this definition, the range is about 2,500 km (1,550 mi) long and 200-400 km (125-250 mi) wide and includes most of NEPAL and BHUTAN, the southern part of TIBET, and extreme northern India. Beyond the Indus to the northwest, the mountains are generally known as the Trans-Himalayas, up to their junction with the HINDU KUSH in the western part of the KARAKORAM RANGE, about 275 km (170 mi) due north of Srinagar.  From this jumbled mass of converging ranges, known as the Pamir Knot, the Himalayas radiate in a southeasterly crescent, rising from the north Indian plain and forming the southern escarpment of the Tibetan plateau. <hr>

<center> Ranges</center>
<hr>
The Himalayan system proper is divided into three roughly parallel zones, or ranges, running east and west.  The mountains of the Great, or High, Himalayas, the main range and most northerly, rise in many areas above the normal snow line and have an average elevation of over 6,100 m (20,000 ft). This zone contains all the highest peaks close to the Chinese border:  GODWIN AUSTEN (K2), KANCHENJUNGA, Everest, Nanda Devi, and others.  The Lesser Himalayas incorporate the adjacent middle ranges, with average elevations between 3,700 and 4,600 m (12,000 and 15,000 ft).  The Outer Himalayas, which skirt the Indian plains to the south, include the Siwalik ranges;  the average elevation is 900-1,200 m (3,000-4,000 ft) above sea level. <hr>

<HR>
 <center>Geology</center>
<hr>
The Himalayas were formed as a result of a violent and relatively recent crumpling of the Earth's crust.  The frequent earthquakes, sometimes of great violence, that occur along the mountain front, especially in ASSAM, indicate that this process is continuing.  These relatively young mountains rise abruptly from the near sea-level plain of northern India, which is, in effect, a trough thickly covered with alluvium.  The uplifting, folding, and faulting that formed the Himalayas appear to have spread southward in stages over time, especially since the Miocene Epoch (24-6 million years ago).  The ancient strata that constitute most of the Himalayas have been pushed forward over the younger strata of the Outer Himalayas, folding and crumpling them in the process.  A series of roughly parallel fault lines at the base of successive emerging ranges is a sign of how the Himalayas have extended southward over time. <hr>

<center> Drainage</center><hr>

Most of the Himalayan streams predate the folding and uplift and now run through the major ranges in deep gorges that they incised as the mountains slowly rose.  Both the Indus and the Brahmaputra have such a history.  The Kosi, Sutlej, and some other lesser rivers, however, seem more likely to have cut back northward from their original upper courses into the emerging Himalayas, aided by the rising gradient and the heavy monsoonal rainfall on the southern slopes. 
<hr>
 <center>Climate</center>
<hr>
The Himalayas act as a climatic barrier, preventing the southward intrusion of cold continental air into India in winter.  The climate of the Himalayas themselves varies fundamentally with altitude, but sharp local contrasts also exist, for example, between low-lying valleys and adjacent ridges in each of the three major Himalayan zones.  At elevations above 4,600 m (15,000 ft)--a zone that includes most of the High Himalayas the temperature rarely rises above freezing even in summer, but in the valleys of both the Lesser and the Outer Himalayas, summer temperatures may reach or even exceed 38 deg C (100 deg F).  Mean winter temperatures at the principal hill stations (Simla, Dehra Dun, Mussoorie, and Naini Tal), at an average height of about 2,100 m (7,000 ft), are about 7 deg C (45 deg F), and mean summer temperatures are about 18 deg C (65 deg F).  The annual temperature range is greater at lower elevations, as is the diurnal range. <p>

Rainfall is primarily of monsoonal origin and is considerably heavier in the east, where south-facing slopes receive as much as 2,000 mm (80 in) annually.  Rainfall progressively diminishes westward, and the Indus section of the Himalayas receives only about 762 mm (30 in).  From December through March, precipitation is in the form of snow, and the snow cover is permanent above about 4,900 m (16,000 ft) throughout the High Himalayas.  Snowfall is heavier in the east, but the winter snow line usually ends at about 1,800 m (6,000 ft). Farther west the winter snow line extends farther down and may occasionally lie for long winter periods below 1,200 m (4,000 ft).  Himalayan glaciers seem to be retreating rather than growing. <hr>

<center> Vegetation and Animal Life</center>
<hr>
The Outer Himalayas, which have a moist, warm climate most of the year, support a dense subtropical and temperate forest; the western third is drier, and the forest cover is more open there as a result.  Pine, fir, evergreen oak, and cedar (especially deodar) are dominant, with intermixtures of birch. Little or no vegetation grows above the permanent snow line. Below that line, shrubs (such as rhododendron), grasses, and lichen-moss communities are the most common forms until about 3,700 m (12,000 ft), where trees begin to grow.  Animal life is concentrated below 3,700 m (12,000 ft), especially below about 3,000 m (10,000 ft).  Mammals include langur, leopard, civet, bear, mongoose, bamboo rat, marten, and goral (a relative of the goat).  Also found are several species of snakes and lizards, a rich insect life, and a wide variety of bird species.<p> 

Human settlement is restricted to the valleys, although a few hill stations are used as summer resorts on ridges in the Outer Himalayas all well below 3,000 m (10,000 ft).  The High Himalayas are devoid of permanent settlements and the Lesser Himalayas nearly so.

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+3><B>PUBLIC BENEFITS OF THE FOREST</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Besides their obvious value as producers of timber and food and as sanctuaries
for wildlife, forests play a crucial role as protectors of fragile mountain
soils, controllers of rivers, and places of comfort and recreation for
humans. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Water and Wind Control</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>When land is bare, it is subject to erosion by wind and water. When
it is covered with plants, however, it is protected against erosion. </P>

<P>The canopy of trees slows the wind, lessens its severity, and becalms
the forest. It also slows the fall of raindrops. The leaves on the forest
floor and the root systems of the trees slow the movement of rainfall so
that the water soaks into the ground rather than running off. Trees also
intercept wind-driven snow, which piles up and melts slowly in the spring.
</P>

<P>Forest managers can increase water flow for various reasons (to fill
a lake, for example) by harvesting trees in the watershed. The watershed
consists of all the highland areas with sources of the water such as snow
melt and small streams. If flooding is a problem on bare ground areas,
planting trees can be part of the solution. If the water table, the level
of underground water, is too high, planting water-tolerant trees can help
to use up more water and lower the water table. Many cities own and manage
large forest tracts to protect their water supplies. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Recreational Value</B> </FONT></P>

<P>Just as people have used the forest as a resource for products, they
have also turned to it for recreation and inspiration. Hunting, hiking,
fishing, and camping are among the more popular recreational uses of the
forest. Much of the recreation takes place along the forest edge where
people can stroll or picnic without too much inconvenience. Campers often
prefer open, parklike forest settings. </P>

<P>Since the early 1970s interest in outdoor recreation has grown, especially
in those activities that take the participant far off the beaten path.
Wilderness hiking and primitive camping are two examples. This interest
has resulted in the establishment of many wilderness areas in national
forests and parks. </P>

<P>When forestry was in its infancy, it was a career for hardy men who
loved the outdoors. Most of the foresters worked for the government and
spent their time protecting the forests against fires and illegal woodcutters.
</P>

<P>In recent years foresters have become much more professional. Now a
man or woman who wants to practice forestry is expected to have a college
degree in forest sciences. Many professional foresters work for the government,
but their work is different from that of their predecessors. Professional
foresters are usually called on to be forest managers, directing other
people in the tree planting, tree improvement, and protection activities
they prescribe. </P>

<P>The United States Forest Service is a major employer of foresters. State
agencies, forest industries, and teaching in colleges or technical schools
are other career fields. Individuals who prefer to be self-employed may
become consultant foresters, selling their services to companies and private
landowners. </P>

<P>Many foresters find careers in research, working in such areas as tree
improvement or insect control. Some researchers work for government agencies,
but industry also employs forest scientists. People with less formal training
may still find careers as forest rangers, protecting the forests, or in
related activities such as harvesting and tree planting. </P>

<P>The forest types largely determine what plant and animal life will be
found in the area. The amount and types of food, water, climate, and shelter
will favor some life forms and discourage others. Within a given forest,
human activity can also have a great influence on the plant and animal
populations. </P>

<P>Many animals, especially the browsers like deer and elk use the forest
for shelter. They spend much of their time along the forest edge, eating
grasses and brush, but they retreat to the woods for safety. Other animals,
such as bears, can find the nuts and smaller animals that they feed on
deeper in the woods, though they also enjoy the berries and roots they
find along the forest edge and in clearings. </P>

<P>Squirrels prefer hardwood forests with lots of acorns and nuts, though
they eat pine seeds as well. Beavers eat the soft inner bark of trees and
use the trees for their lodges and dams. Seed-eating birds are more likely
to nest along the forest edge. </P>

<P>Insects also have very specialized habitat requirements. The southern
pine beetle, for example, feeds on only pines and their relatives. Others,
like the gypsy moth, feed on many kinds of hardwood trees. </P>

<P>Often the health of the entire community depends on the vigor of the
forest. And, as a forest changes with age or as a result of fire, insects,
diseases, or human activity, it is likely to become favorable to an entirely
new set of plants and animals. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>MANAGING THE FORESTS</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2> </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The most modern aspects of the science of forestry are collectively
called forest management. These aspects of forestry involve much more than
just using the trees nature provides. Forest management is concerned with
the complete life cycle of the trees and the forest, from getting trees
off to a better start to making sure trees are harvested in a way that
protects the future of the forest. </P>

<P>Forest management usually involves doing the same sorts of things nature
does, but in a more planned and organized fashion. Nature plants trees,
thins forest stands, and kills trees, but nature's efforts sometimes seem
haphazard. Forest managers do these same things with a plan that benefits
the forest stand and people, too. Nature lets trees burn or rot. Forest
managers prefer to use the wood. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Natural Forest Cycle</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>When a mature hardwood forest is harvested or killed by nature, it is
not long before a new forest takes its place. There are seeds in the ground
already, dropped there by the trees of the past. There are usually young
trees on the ground unless the stand was killed by fire or some other general
catastrophe. </P>

<P>When nature renews a forest, it is often quite different from the original
forest. A mature stand in the Central Hardwood Forest, for example, is
usually composed of oaks and hickories and other species referred to as
climax types. They are species that grow well in bright sunlight or in
partial shade. They have long life spans and compete well for the moisture
and the space available. </P>

<P>When these trees are removed or destroyed, however, other trees have
a chance to get started. Seeds from pines or other trees in the vicinity
blow onto the ground. Sometimes seeds sprout after being in the ground
for many years. The new forest is composed mostly of trees referred to
as early succession species. Usually some seeds of the climax types also
survive. And some trees resprout from the root systems of trees that have
been killed. But it is only after many years that the climax types will
dominate the forest once again. This same succession takes place when farms
and pastures are allowed to lie idle, allowing forests to develop. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Renewing the Forest</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Foresters and landowners often plant seeds or seedlings of a particular
kind of tree. The seedlings are usually grown in large nurseries, much
as ornamental plants are grown for landscaping, and transplanted when they
are older and better able to survive. </P>

<P>When companies first began to replant harvested forests, all of the
planting was done by hand. Since the 1940s more and more trees have been
planted by machine. The tree planter is pulled by a tractor. A plowlike
blade opens a furrow, an opening in the ground, so a worker can plant a
seedling. Packing wheels on the planter then close the furrow around the
tiny tree. A crew with a tree planter can plant thousands of seedlings
in one day. </P>

<P>In forests where the ground is too rough to allow the use of such machines,
planting is still done by hand. Sometimes seeds are spread over the ground
by airplane or helicopter. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Harvesting the Forest</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>History records many instances of harmful harvesting of the forests,
often to provide food or fuel. The once mighty forests of cedar in Lebanon
are no more. Vast forests in China were destroyed during and after World
War II. Rain forests in the Amazon Basin are today being cleared for croplands.
</P>

<P>Forests have been devastated whenever people needed open land for farming.
Most of the east coast of North America was once covered with dense forests.
The new settlers cut the trees, used what wood they needed, and burned
the rest. </P>

<P>Individuals and companies have learned to practice better harvesting
techniques. The long-accepted practice of cutting only a few trees at a
time from a particular stand is being challenged by foresters. They point
out that the practice almost always resulted in taking the best trees and
leaving inferior specimens to take over the forest. They prescribe following
nature's approach of harvesting all the trees in an area at one time and
encouraging seeds from the best trees available to reforest the land. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Improving the Forest</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Over many years nature improves forests by removing inferior trees,
an example of natural selection through the survival of the fittest. But
many natural events and human activities affect this process. Fires, floods,
wind and ice storms, and harvesting practices all affect the growth of
the forest. In general it is fair to say that nature's events generally
improve the forests over the years and the activities of human beings in
the past have harmed them. </P>

<P>Recently, through forest management, human beings have begun to do less
harm, perhaps even help forests. In controlling the composition of the
stand by planting species they prefer, human beings can improve the quality
of the trees they plant. Much has been learned about the development of
genetically improved strains of corn, wheat, and other food crops. This
improvement can be accomplished quickly because these crops produce a new
generation each year. Progress is slower with trees because they often
take many years to produce seed. </P>

<P>When forest managers think of improving trees, they want trees with
long, straight trunks that can be sawed into lumber or peeled for plywood
more economically. They want trees with small crowns, or tops, so more
trees can get sunlight and grow on each acre. They want trees that are
insect and disease resistant so their chances of maturing are better. And
they want trees that will grow to commercial size as rapidly as possible.
</P>

<P>Forest scientists have accomplished all these goals with pines and with
some hardwood species such as sycamore, cottonwood, and yellow poplar.
They have even learned to clone a superior tree, a process that produces
more trees exactly like it. This is done in the laboratory by forcing tiny
cuttings from the tree to develop roots and leaves. </P>

<P>The most commonly used method of tree improvement involves first locating
superior specimens of the species. Branches are collected from their crowns,
often by shooting them off with guns. </P>

<P>The branches are grafted, or joined, onto rootstocks in special nurseries
where they grow until they are old enough to bear seed. A great advantage
of this method is that tree branches that come from mature trees bear seed
much sooner than do trees that are grown from seed. The flowers on the
selected branches are carefully pollinated with pollen from other superior
trees. Thousands of combinations of pollen trees and branch trees are tested.
The resulting seed is then planted. Many of the trees that grow from the
seed have all the bad characteristics of their parents. But some have all
the good characteristics. Forest scientists try to produce and plant as
many seeds having the good combinations as they can. </P>

<P>An example of what can be achieved is that improved species of pines
produce much more usable wood in the same time as ordinary wild trees produce
relatively little. Such improvements mean that more wood can be grown on
less land in a shorter time. As the world population grows and requires
more land for homesites and food production, this ability to maximize wood
production on each acre will be vital to future generations.<BR>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>PROTECTING THE FORESTS</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Once the forest is started, protection is a major concern for forest
managers. Fire is one of the most dramatic enemies, especially for hardwood
species. But insects and diseases, while not so obvious as fire, destroy
far more trees each year than are lost to fire and other natural disasters.
</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Insect and Disease Problems</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Insect pests such as the gypsy moth, spruce budworm, southern pine beetle,
and Douglas fir tussock moth destroy thousands of trees each year. In the
1930s the American chestnut, once one of the most attractive and commercially
important trees in the United States, was virtually eradicated by the chestnut
blight. The American elm has suffered much the same fate because of the
Dutch elm disease. </P>

<P>As a rule, older, slower-growing trees that have lost their vigor, and
trees that have been damaged by fire or drought, are most vulnerable to
attack by insects and disease. Often, however, insect and disease infestations
grow to epidemic proportions in weak stands and then the pests attack nearby
healthier stands. </P>

<P>Forest scientists continually search for ways to control enemies of
the productive forest. They have created many special chemicals to help
control forest pests and diseases. Much ecological research is being done
to encourage natural enemies of insect pests in order to control destructive
populations. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Control of Fire</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Protection against forest fires is often a matter of education. Many
fires started by people to burn trash or leaves or dead grass get out of
control and burn forests as well. Sometimes campfires or cigarettes cause
fires. Arson is another common cause of fires in some areas. </P>

<P>Most forests are watched during the spring and fall fire seasons to
detect fires as early as possible. Fire damage can be held to a minimum
by quick action. Fire roads are cut through forests to allow firefighters
to quench blazes before they get hot enough to reach the tops of trees.
Ground fires may damage hardwood trees, but they rarely do severe damage
to mature pines. Crown fires, on the other hand, kill all trees. </P>

<P>Lightning is still a common cause of fires. If these fires are in remote
areas, they can damage large parts of a forest before they are discovered
and controlled. Firefighters sometimes have to be flown to the fire in
helicopters. Sometimes firefighters called smoke jumpers parachute into
battle against forest fires. </P>

<P>Once a stand has been damaged or killed by fire, useable wood is removed
quickly to prevent the buildup of destructive insect populations and to
prepare for the reforestation of the area. As destructive as fire can be,
foresters have learned to set fires that imitate nature to benefit the
forest. Fires set by lightning destroy climax forests and allow a new succession
of tree species, starting with softwoods, to begin. Natural fires also
serve to reduce competition in softwood forests. Forest managers sometimes
use controlled fire to control unwanted hardwood growth in pine stands.
This leaves more moisture and nutrients for the pines. It also reduces
the ground litter of leaves and branches that might fuel a hotter fire,
and it exposes the soil, allowing grasses and brush to grow and feed wildlife.

<P>In many parts of the world forestland is regulated by government agencies
as a national resource. Some famous forests, like the Black Forest in Germany,
are very thoroughly managed. </P>

<P>In the United States a large part of the forestland belongs to the federal
government. Most of this is managed by the Forest Service, a branch of
the Department of Agriculture, to perpetuate the forest and provide all
the benefits of timber supply, wildlife management, watershed management,
and recreation. The Forest Service protects the trees from natural enemies
and manages their harvests. </P>

<P>Many state governments own forests. These are managed by forestry agencies
that also help private landowners develop the forests on their lands. </P>

<P>Forest industry companies practice good forest management and encourage
their neighbors to do the same. In the United States the industry established
the American Tree Farm System in 1941 to do just that. Company and state
foresters seek landowners doing a good job of planning, protecting, and
harvesting their forests and certify them as members of the system. The
foresters also work with people who want to improve their management, helping
them with tree planting and fire and insect control. </P>

<P>These three groups of landowners, working in harmony and taking advantage
of modern forestry developments, assure that the forests of the United
States continue to provide wood products and all the other benefits of
well-managed stands. Similar groups are active in many of the developed
countries. </P>

<TITLE>Types of Forests</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY TEXT="#FFFFFF" BGCOLOR="#457807" LINK="#FFFF00" VLINK="#FFFF00" ALINK="#FFFF00" BACKGROUND="BGROUND2.JPG">

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>TYPES OF FORESTS</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+2> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Forests are found in almost every part of the world. Only the north
and south poles, the tops of some mountains, the deserts, and some prairies
are bare of forests. Forests can be grouped by location, climate, or the
types of trees common to them. Forests can also be described in terms of
the uses made of them. Commercial forests, for example, are lands used
for growing successive crops of trees for products. Wilderness preserves,
on the other hand, are areas where no harvesting is allowed. </P>

<P>Trees in the forest are of two basic kinds. Hardwoods have broad leaves
and bear their seeds in dry clusters or in fruits; examples are oak, maple,
hickory, and apple. Most of the North American hardwoods are deciduous,
which means they lose their leaves each fall. Softwoods have needle-shaped
leaves and bear their seeds in cones, for which reason they are often called
conifers; examples are pine, spruce, fir, and larch. Most softwoods are
evergreen, which means they lose only some of their needles each year,
and so remain green year-round. This description can be misleading, however,
because several hardwoods, including the American holly and the magnolia,
are also evergreen. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hardwood Forests</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>One major type of hardwood forest is the steamy, tropical rain forest
that grows in the tropics and subtropics. These forests are typically composed
of big, old evergreen hardwood trees that grow in several layers, or groups
according to height. The tallest layer may reach heights of 150 feet (45
meters) or more. Other layers, composed of shade-tolerant trees, reach
to about 100 feet (30 meters). Smaller trees and vines cover the ground
in the shade in a dense tropical rain forest. These forests are often called
jungles, though true jungles are dense thickets of brush and vines that
may not have any tall trees. </P>

<P>One of the largest and most important tropical rain forests is in South
America. It extends from the mouth of the Amazon River, in Brazil, to the
mouth of the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, and covers millions of acres.
Another great rain forest girdles the waist of Africa, and much of Southeast
Asia is covered with rain forests. In the United States, only the southern
tip of Florida and a bit of the coast of Texas have tropical forests. </P>

<P>Beautiful woods such as rosewood, mahogany, ebony, and teak are commercially
important products of these forests. They are prized for fine furniture,
cabinetry, and artistic uses. </P>

<P>Hardwood forests other than tropical ones cover much of the United States,
most of Northern Europe, areas of northern Russia, eastern China, and the
east coast of Australia. These forests include broad-leaved trees adapted
to higher elevations with more moderate climates. </P>

<P>The largest forest area in the United States is the Central Hardwood
Forest. It covers about 130 million acres (52.6 million hectares), from
the edge of the central plains, across the lower edge of the Great Lakes
states, to the coasts of New Jersey and New York. It straddles the Appalachian
Mountains as far south as northern Georgia and spreads westward and covers
large parts of eastern Texas. Because this area is blessed with rich soil
and a moderate climate, it has been cleared in many places for farming.
</P>

<P>Much of the wood for America's furniture industry comes from this forest.
Hardwoods such as black walnut, red oak, white oak, yellow poplar (also
called tulip tree), sweet gum, and sycamore are among the most valuable
trees. A few softwoods are also found, including the shortleaf and white
pines. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Softwood Forests</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The Northern Forest covers much of the Great Lakes states and the New
England states in the United States. It also extends along the ridges of
the Appalachian Mountains as far south as northern Georgia. This forest
also covers much of Canada and the interior of Alaska and stretches across
northern Asia, Russia, and the Scandinavian countries. </P>

<P>The Northern Forest is composed of softwood trees such as white pine,
hemlock, and red spruce. Several hardwood trees, such as oak, maple, birch,
and basswood, are also present. Trees in this forest tend to be smaller
and more slow-growing than those in warmer areas with longer growing seasons.
</P>

<P>The softwood forests of the southeastern United States are sources of
lumber, plywood, and paper pulp. The more important southern, or yellow,
pines are the loblolly, longleaf, shortleaf, and slash. The bald cypress
grows in southern swamps. </P>

<P>Hardwoods such as the red oak, white oak, hickory, gum, ash, pecan,
and live oak are found along southern rivers. They are a significant part
of the forest economy in the South. </P>

<P>Another important forest region in the United States is the softwood
forest of the Rocky Mountains. There are almost 90 million acres (36.4
million hectares) of lumber-producing commercial forests. Ponderosa pine,
Idaho white pine, Douglas fir, Englemann spruce, larch, lodgepole pine,
and western red cedar are among the important softwoods. </P>

<P>The rainy climate of the Pacific Northwest contributes to the growth
of one of the United States' most productive softwood forest areas. It
extends in a narrow band from the southern part of Alaska to central California.
Inland, on the western slopes of the Coast Range, it extends somewhat farther
south. These forests contain Douglas fir, California redwood, western hemlock,
western red cedar, sugar pine, lodgepole pine, and white fir. Most of America's
old-growth forests, stands which have not been harvested by humans or nature
for hundreds of years, are in this region. </P>

<Text="black"><strong><h3>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest group of coral reefs in the world. A coral reef is a limestone formation that lies under or just above the surface of the sea. The Great Barrier Reef, famous for its beauty, extends in broken chains of reefs for about 2,010 kilometres along the northeast coast of Australia. Parts of the reef are more than 160 kilometres from the coast. The closest parts lie about 16 kilometres from the coast.</h3></strong></center>

<p>
The coral that forms the Great Barrier Reef is made of the hardest skeletons of dead water animals called polyps. Billions of living coral polyps are attached to the reef. They range in diameter from much less than 2.5 centimeters to 30 centimeters. The colours of these polyps include blue, green, purple, red, and yellow. These colours, and the colours of many animals living in the Great Barrier Reef, give the reef an appearance of a lovely sea garden. Many small islands are scattered throughout the reef.
<p>
<p>
		The reef supports a facinating variety of life. About 400 species of polyps, about 1,500 species of fish, and many kinds of birds live there. Other animals that live on the reef include crabs, giant clams, and sea turtles.

  Scientists believe the Great Barrier Reef began forming about 30 million years ago. Today, large numbers of tourists visit the reef, and petroleum companies want to drill in the area for oil. Conservationists are concerned about possible damage to the reef from these and other sources. Australia has made most of the reef a national park. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an Australian gvernment agency, works to protect the reef. The government has made it illegal to collect any of the coral. Concervationists have prevented petroleum companies from drilling in the area. Since the 1960's, some parts of the reef have been invaded by crown-of-thorns starfish, which feed on living polyps. During the 1980's and early 1990's, scientists conducted studies of these periodic starfish invasion. But thay still do not know what caused the problem.
<p>
Today, however, the reef still holds its beauty and is one of the seven natural wonders of the world.

 This vast land and its surrounding seas are dominated by nature, by cold and wind, ice and snow. The continent itself is barren: Antarctic wildlife depends for its survival on food from the ocean. Humans can exist there only with outside support.
In such a place, many countries have decided to establish bases in which people live and work. Antarctic research has brought new light to great questions about the earth, about its geophysics, its geology, its ecosystems, its atmosphere and its place in the universe. It has also provided the world with an opportunity for cooperation between people of many nations in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge. Australia is one of the pioneers of scientific research in the Antarctic. It has had permanent
stations in the subantarctic since 1947 and on the continent since 1954, and remains an active
participant in international research programs.

Division scientists have closely studied changes in the numbers and diets of the enormous
numbers of Antarctic and subantarctic penguins and seals. Studies of Adelie penguins have shown
a large variation in survival of chicks from year to year, and that their survival is linked to
very significant changes in the diet of the adult birds foraging at sea to feed their chicks in the
rookeries. Similar studies of the emperor penguin have shown that adults may dive 450 metres
below the surface of the Southern Ocean while foraging, and that chick mortality may reach 60
percent in a single year without threatening the survival of the population.

<br>
The discovery that at both Heard and Macquarie Islands the population of elephant seals has
dropped by as much as 50 percent since the 1960s has provoked further research into the
feeding ecology of these animals. Antarctic Division biologists studying elephant seals' feeding
migration and behaviour have shown that these huge animals (the bulls can weigh up to 4 tonnes)
can dive 1450 metres below the surface and remain down for up to two hours. From our present
knowledge we cannot explain how they manage such a phenomenal performance. As well as diving
deeply, elephant seals can range 2000 kilometres from their breeding island in twice-yearly
migratory journeys, often feeding at the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf (males
apparently on the sea bed, females at intermediate depths). Division scientists have developed
methods of assessing body fat of seals hauling ashore to pup and moult, and this has provided
insights into the intensity of feeding at sea required to provide energy for these life-cycle
activities.

<H1>Plants of Antarctica</H1>
<H3>
The flora of Antarctica is mostly made up of between 200 and 300 lichen species, about 80
species of moss (most found only on the Antarctic Peninsula), several hundred species of
non-marine algae, and a larger number of fungi and bacteria. Growing in rudimentary soils,
these provide a habitat for several tiny invertebrate animals, mainly mites, nematodes,
tardigrades and rotifers. In the snow and surface ice, particularly in coastal regions, snow algae
may be found colouring the snow red, green, yellow or grey in summer.

Only about two percent of Antarctica is free of ice, which severely limits the places where plants
may grow. Three things- soil quality, biota (animals, especially birds, and other plants), and
climate (temperature, incident radiation, moisture, wind, exposure)- determine how plants
are distributed in these ice-free places.

The Antarctic Division's plant studies have sought mainly to determine what plants grow where,
and how variable these plants are. It has concentrated its effort in the region of the Windmill
Islands, near Casey station. Biologists study the ecology of the mosses and lichens, including
effects of environmental pollution (for example, from alkaline cement dust) on the growth and
physiology of the flora (mosses, lichens, algae, soil bacteria and fungi).

Summers around the coast of Antarctica feature intense light but low temperatures; winter
months are dark and much colder. The atmosphere is dry and the soils are low in nutrients.
Antarctic Division botanists have found that in these extreme conditions both mosses and algae
exhibit photoinhibition. This means that their capacity to grow through photosynthesis is
reduced by temporary damage to their photosystem, through a combination of intense light,
extreme cold and lack of water. This effect may be reversed when cloudiness or snow cover
lowers light intensity. Division scientists have also shown that the rate of photosynthesis
increases when the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher. These results have
considerable significance in considering likely global implications of increasing levels of
atmospheric carbon dioxide.

<h5><blockquote>The Sahara Desert
	Sahara, great desert area of Northern Africa, the Westerly portion of the broad belt of
arid land that extends from Atlantic Ocean eastward past the red sea to Iraq. The entire desert,
the largest in the world, is about 1610 km wide and about 5150 km long from east to west. The 
total area of the Sahara is more than 9,065,000 sq km, of which some 207,200 sq km consist of 
partially fertile oases. 

<p>The boundaries of the Sahara are the Atlantic Ocean on the west, the Atlas Mts. and the Mediterranean 
Sea on the north, the Red Sea and Egypt on the east, and the Sudan and the vally of the Niger R. on 
the south. The boundaries, however, are not clearly defined.

<p>Geographically distinct are the west Sahara, which is sometimes called the Sahara proper; the
central Ahaggar Mts. and the Tibesti Massif, a plateau region; and the Libyan Desert in the 
east. The west Sahara is an area of rock-strewn plains and sand deserts of varying elevation. 
The land is almost without rainall or surface water but possesses a number of underground rivers
that flow from Atlas and other mountains. Occasionally the waters of these rivers find their way
to the surface; in these naturally irrigated oases, plants grow freely.

<p>Deserts is virtually devoid of any form of animal or vegetalbe life. The north Sahara has
assumed economic importance with the discovery of extensive petroleum deposits in Algeria and Libya.

<center><h2><i>The Sahara</h2></i></center>
<hr>
<br>


The Sahara desert is situated North of the equator on the African continent. It streches from the Atlantic ocean to the Red Sea near Iraq. The Sahara, which is the largest desert in the world, has and area of 9,065,000 square kilometers, of which some 207,200 square kilometers consist of partially fertile oases.
<br>
<br>
The Sahara was once a fertile region. Approximately 8000 years ago, crops were harvested there, but as desertification set in, the farmers moved away.
<br>
<br>
The desert has little or no rainfall, but there is a large system of underground rivers which strech from the Atlas mountain range and other mountains.
<br>
<br>
Oases have sprung up, taking advantage of the underground water to produce fertile desert plants. The soil of the Sahara is quite fertile and irrigation can produce excellent crops.

<center><h2><i>The Gobi Desert</h2></i></center>
<hr>
<br>


The Gobi desert is an extensive desert area situated in central Asia, in the Mongolian region. The general form of the Gobi desert is a plateau between higher mountains.
<br>
<br>
The surface consists of rolling gravel plains, flat topped hills and isolated mountains and the southeastern region of the desert is completley waterless. 
<br>
<br>
The three remaining quarters has a thin growth of grass, scrub and plants which feed the flocks of Nomadic herders that live there. Water is available in wells or shallow lakes.
<br>
<br>
The northwestern region is quite fertile and the southeast has steppes or praries. 
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center><h2><i>Arabian/Eastern desert</h2></i></center>
<hr>
<br>
This is a desert region lying between the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez on the east, the Nubian desert on the south and the Nile River to the west. The Great Sandy Desert, as it is known is one of the hottest and most sparsely inhabited sand dune deserts of the world.
<br>
<br>
As with other deserts, the landforms and terrain differs from region to region. To the east, is a series of plateaus, rising up to jagged mountains which meet the Red Sea.
<br>
<br>
The aridity of the desert makes human habitation difficult, but some small communities exist at the feet of the plateaus and mountains.
<br>
<br>
There is a wide range of mineral deposits, but not enough minerals to have any economic significance.

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center><h2><i>The Kalahari Desert</h2></i></center>
<hr>
<br>
This desert is situated in southern Africa in southern Botswana and northern South Africa. It is generally covered in red soil, with patches of sand found in the east.
<br>
<br>
When heavy rain occurs, the water forms extensive mud flats. The Kalahari is inhabited by the Khoikhoi and San people.

<TITLE>Climate and Conditions</TITLE>

<H1><Center><Blink><Text color="Red">Climate and Conditions</Center></H1></Blink></Text color="Red">

<Hr>

<H2>Antarctica, surrounded by oceans, is the world's most remote, highest and only treeless continent. Forming a rough circle around the Pole, the size of the United States plus Mexico, it lies buried beneath 90% of all the world's snow and ice- to an average depth of 2134 metres. Yet Antarctica's climate is as dry as the Sahara's. Huge winds race clockwise round the continent topping 160 kilometres per hour. The coldest temperature known on Earth, -88.3 degrees celcius, was recorded in the Antarctic.
<p>	
Global warming may not cause the changes you would expect in Antarctica.
 
Remember that Antarctica is very cold. Warming the temperature

a few degrees will still, for the most part, leave Antarctica very cold! Add

to this that the Antarctica Ice Sheet is very large; the ice sheet will not

"feel" changes in temperature very quickly. It would take the West Antarctic

Ice Sheet approximately 50,000 years to change because of a temperature

change.
<p>
	
		Global warming IS important in other ways, however. Changes will take place

more quickly in smaller ice shelves and outlet glaciers, particularly those

that exist in the warmer parts of Antarctica, such as the Antarctic

Peninsula. Wordie Ice Shelf has disappeared in the last few decades in

response to a 2 degrees celcius temperature rise. Studies of Larsen Ice Shelf, in western

Weddell Sea, show that the ice shelf could disappear in 300 years.


	These changes will change Earth's oceans and climate. The Antarctic

continent, while isolated at the bottom of the world, plays a very important

role on Earth. Any changes in Antarctic ice volume and sea ice

could change the Antarctic water masses. The water masses are very important

in the world's oceans, and influence Earth's climate and fisheries.

 <TITLE>Past Ice Sheet Changes</TITLE>

<BODY background="clouds2.gif">

<H1><Center><Blink>Past Ice Sheet Changes</Center></H1></Blink>

<Hr>
                    
<H2>The Antarctic Ice Sheet has changed in the past. The ice sheet

once extended almost 900 kilometers (about 560 miles) farther in Ross Sea.

It began to retreat, or get smaller about 20,000 years ago.

<p>
		A current debate in Antarctic geology is how much ice covered the continent

during the Pliocene, about three million years ago. Some scientists believe

that little ice covered Antarctica, and some scientists think that the ice

sheet was as large as it is today. Future work will help decide.
<p>

		These changes in extent of the ice sheet through time are being explored by

many scientists. Research also suggests that the ice sheet, particularly the

West Antarctic Ice Sheet, may change in the future. Changes in the Antarctic

Ice Sheet could trigger changes across the rest of Earth.

<TITLE>The Ice Sheet and Sea Level</TITLE>

<HTML>

<BODY background="clouds2.gif">

<H1><Center><Blink>The Ice Sheet and Sea Level</Center></H1></Blink>

<hr>

 <h2>   What happens when an ice sheet retreats or breaks apart? Where

does the ice go? The ice is made of frozen water that is sitting on land.

When the ice sheet breaks apart the ice eventually melts and the water is

added to the ocean. This causes the global sea level to rise. A rise in

ocean level means that along coastlines around the world, the shoreline will

be a little higher on the beach.
<p>

	If the entire present Antarctic ice sheet were to break apart, that ice

would go into the world's oceans and melt and raise the ocean level about 66

meters (about 220 feet). If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to break

apart, world ocean level would rise by 6 meters (about 20 feet).

<p>
	So, does the movie "Water World" offer a look at life in the future? Not

likely! Even if ALL the ice on Earth melted, sea-level would rise only about

72 meters (235 feet). That still leaves much of the land above water. Even a

small change in the ocean level, however, will cause big changes. Millions

of people live near the coast today; these populations will have to move if

a sea-level rise occurs.

Tornadoes are characterised by a black, funnelshaped cloud hanging from heavy cumulonimbus and travelling at speeds of up to 60km/hr.  They vary in diameter from less than a meter to a kilometer.

the canopy. Because many prefer one certain type of vegetation, they are especially susceptible to fragmentation of the forest.

<h1>Rainforest Information</H1>
Tropical rainforests are by far the richest habitat on Earth. As many as 30
million species of plants and animals - more than half of all life forms - live
in tropical rainforests. At least two-thirds of the world's plant species,
including many exotic and beautiful flowers, as well as plants with medicinal
value, occur in the tropics and subtropics.</P>

<P>Rainforests are part of the global weather system. Destroying them alters the 
hydrological cycle - causing drought, flooding, and soil erosion in areas where 
such events were previously rare. The cutting of forests also changes the 
albedo or reflectivity of the earth's surface, which in turn alters wind and 
ocean current patterns, and changes rainfall distribution.<BR CLEAR=ALL></P>

<H2>Human influence on the marine ecosystem</H2>

<P>The short and simple marine food chain in the Antarctic, diatoms-krill-whales,
is well known. The simplicity of the system makes it more vulnerable to
outside disturbances than the more complex and stable ecosytems encountered
in tropical and subtropical waters. Its vulnerability is now being tested
under the strain of two man-made factors: the commercial exploitation of
the mammalian populations, and the influence of toxic chemicals introduced
from the industrial regions to the north. </P>

<P>There can be no doubt that the Antarctic marine ecosystem has been significantly
influenced by man's exploitation of baleen whales. The disastrous decline
in these stocks is well documented and has had profound effects on other
parts of the ecosystem. The detection of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides in Antarctic organisms furnished the first evidence of the global
dispersal of this class of persistent pollutants. </P>

<P>Pollutants recognize no national boundaries or territorial seas, and
are transported from their place of origin to the marine environment via
the atmosphere, water movements and migrating organisms. Pesticides have
not been found in Emperor Penguins, which may suggest that birds and seals
that are more or less confined to higher latitudes are likely to be less
contaminated than those spending part of their life away from the continent.
</P>

<P>The existence of large amounts of krill in the Antarctic has been known
for many years, but interest in commercial exploitation arose only in the
mid 1960s, at a time when the baleen whale stocks had greatly declined
due to over-harvesting. Pressure to exploit krill is increasing, since
in recent years the stocks of fish taken in traditional waters have declined
or become less accessible to many nations. This has sharpened peoples'
focus on the virtually untouched krill stocks. </P>

<P>Because of the reduction of Antarctic whale populations, the consumption
of krill has fallen from an estimated 190 million tonnes per year to only
40 million tonnes per year. However, this decline in whales has been matched
to some extent by increases in other krill consumers, for example, seals
and penguins. If a substantial fishery for krill develops, as seems likely,
humans will be another major consumer in the system, and the effects on
the other components of the system are unknown, and could be undesired.
</P>

<P>So there is a need for careful control of krill exploitation, which
will involve not only the collection of statistics about krill catches
but also observations on the biology of krill and its consumers. A start
has already been made: SCAR, in association with other international scientific
bodies, has launched a major international long-term scientific study of
the marine ecosystem, entitled Biological Investigations of Marine Antarctic
Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS); the Antarctic Treaty governments have also
recently concluded the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Antarctica, the last continent to be explored and exploited - the continent
about which still least is known - has many unusual, interesting and beautiful
features. This booklet has been prepared as an introduction to Antarctica,
its environment, and the various forms of life which have found ways to
survive the hostile conditions of the continent, its associated islands
and surrounding oceans. </P>

<H3>Geographic and physical features</H3>

<P>The continent of Antarctica lies almost entirely within the Antarctic
Circle (at 66 33 S). It is covered by 90 per cent of the world's ice which
has an average thickness of about 2,000 metres. Scarcely five per cent
of this land mass is without permanent ice or snow, and only the coastal
rock outcrops and highest mountain peaks project through the ice sheet.
</P>

<P>The climate for most of Antarctica is that of a cold desert. In the
region of the South Pole about seven centimetres of snow accumulates annually
and it has an annual mean temperature of -49C. As the ice sheet reflects
most of the sun's heat back into the atmosphere, it collects almost no
heat and significantly influences world weather patterns. </P>

<H3>From a supercontinent, Gondwanaland</H3>

<P>Two hundred million years ago Antarctica was joined to Africa, Australia,
India, New Zealand and South America forming the supercontinent, Gondwanaland.
Forces within the Earth affecting the crust caused these continents to
separate and drift apart. Thirty million years ago the continents, as we
know them today, reached their approximate present positions. </P>

<P>Antarctica, having drifted into the area of the Earth's southern pole,
then experienced four or more months of winter darkness, was surrounded
by an ocean, and was almost totally ice-covered. Those processes which
produced the early and gradual separation of the continents, with concurrent
climatic changes, were responsible for the extinction of a number of plants
and animals. </P>

<P>Today, for example, ferns, freshwater fishes, amphibians and reptiles
are found in Antarctica only as fossils. The geographical separation, and
cold-dry climate which developed, prevented many groups of plants and animals
on other continents from invading and colonizing Antarctica: for example,
trees, flowering plants, land-based reptiles and mammals. Indeed, Antarctica
is the only continent where man is not indigenous and where civilizations
have never developed. </P>

<H3>Antarctic forms of life today</H3>

<P>The forms of life found on and around this frozen continent today possess
unusual adaptations for surviving the rigours of cold temperatures, low
humidity, ice sheets or salty soils characteristic of the region. Birds
and seals in Antarctica (and to a lesser extent in the sub-Antarctic) breed
and raise their young on ice or land, but depend on the rich resources
of the ocean for their food. The marine ecosystem is rich with life. Whales,
fishes, cephalopods and krill have provided, and will continue to provide,
resources for mankind. </P>

<P>The terrestrial life in Antarctica is simpler than that of the ocean.
The appearance and the roles played by the organisms within their ecosystems,
and the adaptations they show to the rigourous conditions are, however,
of interest. Also on land, there are a variety of freshwater and saline
lakes and ponds which contain a limited selection of aquatic forms. </P>

<P>The world must learn to use Antarctica's living resources wisely, to
respect the delicate balance which these organisms occupy in Antarctic
eco-systems, and to preserve or protect them from irreversible harm or
damage. Unfortunately, there were periods in our history when respect for
the balance of ecosystems was lacking, and costly lessons were learned
through trial and error. </P>

<P>Antarctica's role in human history has been recent, so that, apart from
the marine ecosystem, it remains relatively pristine. Today we are facing
a challenge to manage resources, living and non-living, and to keep Antarctica
unspoiled. Success in this undertaking will benefit both present and future
generations. </P>

<H3>Science in the Antarctic</H3>

<P>Exploration of Antarctica dates from 200 years ago when in 1773 Captain
James Cook first crossed the Antarctic Circle. Early voyages combined exploration
with exploitation, or the hope of it. Many valuable cargoes of seal skins
and blubber oil were obtained, mostly from the sub-Antarctic islands. Later
expeditions had a stronger scientific element in them, but science often
had to take second place to national or personal interests. Antarctic science
therefore suffered from a lack of continuity and coordination. </P>

<P>It was clear to many scientists that a thorough investigation of the
Antarctic could only be accomplished by planned international cooperation.
This was first achieved during the International Geophysical Year (IGY)
of 1957-58, a world-wide programme based on research into the earth sciences.
Antarctica occupied a key position in the programme and 12 nations set
up research stations on and around the Antarctic continent, including for
the first time ever, a research station at one of the Earth's poles. The
IGY was successful, both in the quality of its scientific results, and
in the extent and nature of the cooperation between nations, largely brought
about by the scientific community. <!Divers, taking part in the New Zealand Antarctic Programme, prepare to><!dive through a hole in the annual sea ice near Scott Base.></P>

<P>Encouraged by this, and to ensure that the valuable activities initiated
during the IGY did not cease at the end of the set period, the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in September 1958, set up a body known
as the Special (now Scientific) Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR),
which was to organize and coordinate future international scientific research.
SCAR membership originally consisted of the 12 nations actively pursuing
scientific research in Antarctica at the time of IGY, but in 1978 two other
nations were added. </P>

<P>The present SCAR membership is: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile,
Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
South Africa, UK, USA and USSR. </P>

<P>SCAR has established a number of permanent working groups which coordinate
scientific and logistic programmes, organize symposia, and plan Antarctic
contributions to global research programmes. There are also groups of specialists
which deal with topics of particular importance or immediate interest.
Scientific results are freely exchanged between the SCAR nations, and the
committee ensures that details of future scientific programmes are made
available to its members. </P>

<H3>The Antarctic Treaty</H3>

<P>In order to facilitate the pursuit of research in the Antarctic, and
to ensure that it remained open to all nations to conduct scientific or
peaceful activities there, the governments of the 12 nations who were then
active in the Antarctic signed the Antarctic Treaty in Washington on 1
December 1959. It has since been acceded to by many other nations. The
14 Articles of the Treaty may be summarized as follows: </P>

<PRE>
I -     Antarctica shall be used for peaceful purposes only; any
        military measures are prohibited.

II -    Freedom of scientific investigation in Antarctica and
        cooperation as applied during IGY shall continue.

III -   Plans for scientific programmes and the observations and
        results thereof shall be freely exchanged; scientists may be
        exchanged between expeditions.

IV -    All national claims are frozen from the date of signature. No
        future activity of any country during the life of the Treaty
        can affect the status quo on any rights or claims to
        territorial sovereignty.

V -     Nuclear explosions and disposal of radioactive waste are
        prohibited in Antarctica.

VI -    The provisions of the Treaty apply to the area south of 600S.

VII-VIII -      Any contracting party may appoint observers.  They
        shall have complete freedom of access at any time to any area
        of Antarctica, with the right to inspect any other nation's
        buildings, installations, equipment, ships or aircraft or to
        carry out aerial observations.

IX -    Regular consultative meetings of the active signatory nations
        shall be held.

X -     Contracting parties shall ensure that no activity contrary to
        the Treaty is carried out.

XI -    Any disputes between contracting parties shall be resolved by
        peaceful negotiation, in the last resort by the International
        Court of Justice.
        
XII -   The Treaty shall remain in force for a minimum of 30 years.

XIII-XIV -      Provides the legal details of ratification and deposit.
</PRE>

<P>In the years since the signing of the Treaty, consultative meetings
have reached agreement on more detailed measures, including the protection
of wildlife and special areas of biological interest. Other subjects on
which unanimous agreement can be reached are constantly under review. The
inspections by national observers have been carried out in a spirit of
friendly cooperation, and the flow of data and publications between all
nations has been continuous and unrestricted. </P>

<P>The Treaty does not apply to the high seas, nor to the sub-Antarctic
islands north of 600S, though the latter are subject to national legislation
which, amongst other things, lays down regulations for the conservation
of wildlife. This booklet deals with the flora and fauna, and their ecosystems,
from a biological, rather than a strictly geographical, basis. All visitors
to the Antarctic can play an important role by being advocators of the
Treaty's purposes, and by spreading the words, concepts and ideas contained
in this guide. <A NAME="marine"></A></P>

<H2>The Antarctic marine ecosystem</H2>

<P>In contrast to the sparsely vegetated, barren and ice-covered continent,
the nutrient-rich waters surrounding Antarctica support a wealth of plant
and invertebrate animal life on which large populations of fishes, penguins,
sea birds, seals and whales feed. These Antarctic organisms have a number
of features that set them apart from those of tropical and temperate waters,
such as large body size, slow growth and few species. They are also remarkably
well adapted to the severe environmental conditions in which they live.
Some of the fish, for example, have special blood proteins which act as
anti-freeze. <!Antarctic Cod - its blood has anti-freeze properties.></P>

<P>The marked seasonal changes in these high latitudes accompanied by the
shortened period of light for plant growth, have brought about species
acclimated not only to low temperatures but also to seasonal feeding and
overwinter energy storage in fats and related substances. These are among
the environmental factors which have helped shape the character of Antarctic
life with its high degree of specialisation. </P>

<P>The Southern Ocean isolates the Antarctic continent from the rest of
the world. Surrounding the continent are two concentric water masses. The
more northerly tends to move in a westerly direction under the influence
of the prevailing winds (the West Wind Drift), while the water nearest
the continent circulates in the opposite direction (the East Wind Drift).
Superimposed on these circumpolar movements is a tendency for the surface
water to drift to the north. </P>

<P>At its northern limit, the cold Antarctic surface water sinks beneath
the less dense sub-Antarctic surface water. The region where this sinking
occurs is referred to as the Antarctic Convergence, or Polar Front. At
the Convergence there is a sudden change in temperature. An increase in
nutrient salts occurs south of the Convergence, contributing to the richer,
more productive marine ecosystem there compared with the sub-Antarctic
surface waters north of the Convergence. </P>

<P>The Antarctic Convergence influences the distribution of phytoplankton,
zooplankton, fish and birds. </P>

<P>At the edge of the Antarctic continent cold water sinks, forming the
bottom water, which moves northwards over the sea floor and fans out into
the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. Above the bottom water lies the
relatively warmer, more saline, and nutrient-rich south-flowing circumpolar
deep water. </P>

<P>The upward movement of this water creates a zone of upwelling, supplying
to the surface water large amounts of nutrients that contribute to the
luxuriant growth of phytoplankton and other marine life close to the coasts
of Antarctica. </P>

<P>The development of fast ice close to the continent and pack ice south
of the Antarctic Convergence also profoundly influences the Antarctic marine
ecosystem. The area covered with pack ice undergoes seasonal fluctuations.
It is reduced from 24 million km2 in September to 18 million km2 in February.
</P>

<P>Throughout its cycle of waxing and waning, the circum-Antarctic ice
belt moves from east to west, and with it follow the multitudes of marine
organisms that inhibit the pack ice zone. On the basis of ice distribution,
we can recognize three concentric zonations: the fast ice zone, the pack
ice zone, and the open waters. </P>

<H3>Phytoplankton</H3>

<P>Phytoplankton are free-floating and drifting plants and comprise the
first link in the food chain. Diatoms are an important component of Antarctic
marine phytoplankton and number about 100 species; other groups, the dino-flagellates
with about 70 species, and the silico-flagellates are present also. </P>

<P>These phytoplankton, usually single-celled and microscopic, play the
key photosynthetic role by converting solar energy into chemical energy.
Concentrations of diatoms are seen as a greenish discolouration of surface
waters. Phytoplankton-laden waters provide food for krill and countless
other tiny floating animals (the zooplankton), themselves consumed by carnivores.
</P>

<P>Seasonal and geographical variations in the amount of phytoplankton
are conspicuous in the Southern Ocean. Large standing crops are found in
the Scotia Sea, west of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Ross Sea. Small
standing crops are more typical of the oceanic regions, i.e. away from
the coast. </P>

<H3>Zooplankton</H3>

<P>Zooplankton are those animals which are unable to swim effectively against
the horizontal currents of the ocean; they drift in the ocean, some species
browsing phytoplankton, others consuming the browsers. Although most zooplankton
species are circumpolar in distribution, they frequently show centres of
concentration at different depths or in different latitudes. </P>

<P>The circumpolar distribution of many plankton species seems to be lop-sided,
with large populations in the Scotia/Weddell Sea region and thinner bands
around the rest of the continent. As with the phytoplankton stocks, waters
south of the Antarctic Convergence are richer in zooplankton than sub-Antarctic
waters to the north. </P>

<P>Antarctic zooplankton also exhibit seasonal variations. In summer, they
are more plentiful in coastal than in open ocean waters, while in winter
they are found at greater depths. The dominant organisms in Antarctic zooplankton
are the copepods and the euphausiids such as krill. In the past krill supported
enormous stocks of whales. <!Antarctic krill></P>

<P>The swarming habit of the krill greatly assist the baleen whales which
feed on them, Blue Whales preferring adolescent krill and Fin Whales favouring
the adults. These swarms often extend over some hundreds of square metres;
the maximum dimension recorded for a swarm is several kilometres. Krill
can be dense enough to discolour sea water, and therefore at times can
be easily spotted from the deck of a ship. </P>

<P>In recent years, Antarctic krill has been the focus of much international
attention and is already the object of commercial exploitation by many
countries. Over-exploitation of such a living resource, upon which so much
of the Antarctic marine ecosystem depends, could bring about a major ecological
disaster. </P>

<H3>Fish</H3>

<P>Nearly 75 of the 80-100 species of Antarctic benthic fish belong to
the group Nototheniiformes, most of which are sluggish bottom dwellers,
with large heads and tapering bodies. As a group, they are highly diversified
in structure, habit and distribution. Although Antarctic bottom fish can
be locally important in coastal regions, such as Iles Kerguelen and South
Georgia they are usually insignificant in the Southern Ocean as a whole,
because the narrow continental shelf surrounding the continent limits the
abundance of spawning sites of these bottom dwellers. </P>

<P>There are no reliable estimates of the stocks, biomass or productivity
of Antarctic fish. Although the USSR is now marketing Notothenia rossi
in Moscow and other cities, it is difficult even to guess the magnitude
of this or any other fish stock in the Antarctic. Their remarkable adaptation
to temperatures below the natural freezing points of their body fluids
has recently begun to attract considerable attention. </P>

<P>The anti-freeze (a glyco-protein) isolated from an Antarctic fish may
be useful as a refrigerant for red blood cells, sperm and tissue. The ice
fish of the Antarctic are the only vertebrates which entirely lack the
red oxygen-carrying pigment, haemoglobin, in their blood. This condition
is another adaptation to cold conditions - by reducing the number of red
blood cells the viscosity of the blood at low temperatures is decreased
and the energy expenditure of circulating the blood reduced. </P>

<P>The study of adaptation to extreme polar conditions in fish and other
animals is among the most fascinating and promising in Antarctic biology.
</P>

<H3>Cephalopods (squid and octopus)</H3>

<P>Squid and octopus are known to be extremely important organisms in the
Antarctic ecosystem. They are prey for sperm whales, seals, penguins, sea
birds and fishes. The Southern Hemisphere population of sperm whales consumes,
for example, about 50 million tonnes of squid each year, an amount approximating
to 75 per cent of the world's current annual fisheries catch. </P>

<P>As predators, the cephalopods could perhaps consume about 100 million
tonnes of Antarctic krill per year. It is difficult to assess the resource
potential of cephalopods, which are strong swimmers with net-avoidance
capabilities that have prevented adequate sampling for biological study.
Special sampling efforts will be required to fill in the gap of knowledge
that exists for these organisms. </P>

<P>At present no commercial fishery for cephalopods exists in the Southern
Ocean, but an active Japanese fishery has harvested about 20,000 tonnes
per year in New Zealand waters. </P>

<P>Birds, seals and whales are discussed in another section. It is important
here to mention that they derive their food either directly from the sea
or at one step removed from it. Hence, they are an important part of the
marine ecosystem. </P>

<H3>Human influence on the marine ecosystem</H3>

<P>The short and simple marine food chain in the Antarctic, diatoms-krill-whales,
is well known. The simplicity of the system makes it more vulnerable to
outside disturbances than the more complex and stable ecosytems encountered
in tropical and subtropical waters. Its vulnerability is now being tested
under the strain of two man-made factors: the commercial exploitation of
the mammalian populations, and the influence of toxic chemicals introduced
from the industrial regions to the north. </P>

<P>There can be no doubt that the Antarctic marine ecosystem has been significantly
influenced by man's exploitation of baleen whales. The disastrous decline
in these stocks is well documented and has had profound effects on other
parts of the ecosystem. The detection of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides in Antarctic organisms furnished the first evidence of the global
dispersal of this class of persistent pollutants. </P>

<P>Pollutants recognize no national boundaries or territorial seas, and
are transported from their place of origin to the marine environment via
the atmosphere, water movements and migrating organisms. Pesticides have
not been found in Emperor Penguins, which may suggest that birds and seals
that are more or less confined to higher latitudes are likely to be less
contaminated than those spending part of their life away from the continent.
</P>

<P>The existence of large amounts of krill in the Antarctic has been known
for many years, but interest in commercial exploitation arose only in the
mid 1960s, at a time when the baleen whale stocks had greatly declined
due to over-harvesting. Pressure to exploit krill is increasing, since
in recent years the stocks of fish taken in traditional waters have declined
or become less accessible to many nations. This has sharpened peoples'
focus on the virtually untouched krill stocks. </P>

<P>Because of the reduction of Antarctic whale populations, the consumption
of krill has fallen from an estimated 190 million tonnes per year to only
40 million tonnes per year. However, this decline in whales has been matched
to some extent by increases in other krill consumers, for example, seals
and penguins. If a substantial fishery for krill develops, as seems likely,
humans will be another major consumer in the system, and the effects on
the other components of the system are unknown, and could be undesired.
</P>

<P>So there is a need for careful control of krill exploitation, which
will involve not only the collection of statistics about krill catches
but also observations on the biology of krill and its consumers. A start
has already been made: SCAR, in association with other international scientific
bodies, has launched a major international long-term scientific study of
the marine ecosystem, entitled <I>Biological Investigations of Marine Antarctic
Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS)</I>; the Antarctic Treaty governments have
also recently concluded the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources. <A NAME="mammals"></A></P>

<H2>Marine mammals</H2>

<H3>Seals</H3>

<P>Together with penguins, seals are probably the most characteristic,
and certainly the most engaging, animals that a visitor to the Antarctic
will encounter. Seals are mammals which have adopted an aquatic mode of
life but which, unlike the whales, retain the need to return to land (or
in the case of most polar seals, to ice) to breed. <!Weddell seal pup.></P>

<P>The Antarctic supports a much larger number of seals than does the Arctic;
indeed, one species alone, the Crabeater Seal, accounts for about half
the world's seals. The greater abundance of Antarctic seals is due to much
larger, often more productive feeding areas within the vast expanses of
the Southern Oceans; the seals have also exploited the drifting pack ice
as a breeding ground, and there are no native terrestrial predators, such
as polar bears or man. </P>

<P>Antarctic seals therefore behave very differently from the northern
seals and show little fear of man. Often seals in the Antarctic can be
approached closely without their apparently showing obvious signs of disturbance.
However, careful observation of this behaviour will reveal that groups
of breeding seals, or females accompanied by pups, can exhibit signs of
stress, which may lead to the abandonment of young, when confronted by
a human visitor. Therefore, it is best not to approach seals too closely,
and to endeavour to observe or photograph from a distance. </P>

<P>Seals, including pups, should never be handled. Not only can this molestation
of seals be harmful to them but, as Antarctic seals are capable of surprisingly
swift responses, severe injuries to the molester can also result. </P>

<P>The Antarctic seals have developed different ways of exploiting their
marine food supply. These involve differences in both feeding habits and
geo-graphical distribution. </P>

<P>The most abundant of the true Antarctic seals is the <B>Crabeater Seal</B>,
<I>Lobodon carcinophagus</I>, which has an estimated population of about
15 million. As soon as a ship enters a belt of loose pack ice, one can
expect to see these seals lying on the floes. Crabeater Seals feed directly
on krill, and have specially modified teeth and palates for straining them.
</P>

<P>The seals are most abundant on the fringes on the pack ice and are generally
solitary, though in the spring during the breeding season they are found
in family groups of a cow and her pup together with an attendant male.
</P>

<P>The bodies of Crabeater Seals often bear patterns of parallel scars.
In adult seals these are usually healed, fresh scars being found more often
in juveniles. It was once believed that these scars were caused by Killer
Whales, but it now appears more likely that they are inflicted by Leopard
Seals. </P>

<P>The <B>Leopard Seal</B>, <I>Hydrurga leptonyx</I>, is another familiar
seal of the pack ice. However, it may be most conspicuous when hunting
penguins near a rookery. It is the largest of the true Antarctic seals.
The females measure up to 3.4m with an easily recognizable outline - a
somewhat reptilian head, a sinuous neck and a highly-arched thorax. Its
very long fore-flippers are also characteristic. </P>

<P>The Leopard Seal, like the Crabeater, has very complicated teeth, equally
well adapted to straining krill or catching active prey such as fish or
penguins. However, about two-fifths of their diet consists of the flesh
of warm-blooded animals, birds (mostly penguins), other seals (usually
young Crabeaters), and occasional carrion; about the same proportion is
krill. Smaller quantities of fish, squid, and other invertebrates are also
taken. </P>

<P>The remaining pack ice seal of the Antarctic is the <B>Ross Seal</B>,
<I>Ommatophoca rossii</I>. This is much less often seen by the ordinary
visitor as not only is it far less abundant than Crabeater or Leopard seals,
but it is characteristically a seal of heavy consolidated pack ice, where
few ships can penetrate. The Ross Seal is another large seal, females measuring
up to 3.3m and averaging 2.1m in nose to tail length. As in other true
Antarctic seals, the female is a little larger than the male. </P>

<P>The Ross Seal is easily recognized by its short head, large eyes and
its tendency to lift its head, inflate its throat, and adopt a characteristic
&quot;singing position&quot;. Often there are dark stripes running from
the chin to the chest and along the sides of the neck. These feed mainly
on squid, but take significant quantities of fish and other invertebrates.
</P>

<P>Because of its remote habitat, its biology is little known; there seems
to be some evidence of a clumped distribution, for it is much more frequently
seen in some areas than in others. The comparative rarity and lack of scientific
information on the Ross Seal has led to its protection under the Antarctic
Treaty. </P>

<P><!An adult Weddell Seal with a large Antarctic cod in its mouth.></P>

<P>The <B>Weddell Seal</B>, <I>Leptonychotes weddellii</I>, inhabits the
fast ice and the area near the shore around the whole of Antarctica. It
is the seal most likely to be encountered at close quarters by a visitor.
Weddell Seals are usually found in groups, sometimes up to many hundreds
in size, though breeding and non-breeding groups are usually distinct.
These seals show a distinct preference for lying on snow or ice, even when
rock or shingle beaches are available. Birth and rearing of young occurs
from September to November, depending on latitude, and at this season there
is considerable territorial fighting between the males. </P>

<P>The food of the Weddell Seal consists mainly of fish, though some squid
and other invertebrates are taken. These seals are capable of deep diving
to seek their food, and have specially adapted eyes for seeing underwater
in low levels of light intensity. </P>

<P>The remaining two species of seals likely to be encountered in the Antarctica
are not strictly Antarctic species, although they overlap from the sub-Antarctic
zone. The most impressive is the <B>Southern Elephant Seal</B>, <I>Mirounga
leonina</I>. It is the largest of all seals, adult males reaching a length
of up to 4.5m and a maximum weight of about 4 tonnes. The males are much
larger than the females, and during the breeding season in September to
November they maintain harems of up to 70 females. </P>

<P>Elephant Seals breed mostly on the sub-Antarctic islands, particularly
South Georgia, Iles Kerguelen, Heard Island and Macquarie Island, but during
the moulting season, in December to March, they appear on land farther
south. Large numbers are now to be seen in the South Orkney and South Shetland
islands. Elephant seals feed mainly on squid and fish and probably catch
some of their food in deep water. </P>

<P>The <B>Antarctic Fur Seal</B>, <I>Arctocephalus gazella</I>, is the
remaining seal species to be found in the Antarctic. Unlike the species
described earlier, this is not a true seal, but a member of the group of
eared seals, which includes sea lions. </P>

<P>The Antarctic Fur Seal was very heavily exploited by fur hunters in
the 19th century; the total population was reduced to a few thousand, and
in some places such as the South Shetland Islands, probably totally exterminated.
With protection since the early years of this century, it has shown a remarkable
recovery from a population centre at South Georgia. Here the seals have
been increasing at approximately 17 per cent per year, so that the whole
population doubles in about five breeding seasons. </P>

<P>As a result of this population explosion, <B>Fur Seals</B> are now commonly
encountered on many islands groups in western Antarctica, including the
South Sandwich, South Orkney and South Shetland islands. Away from the
breeding grounds, the animals most likely to be seen are young male or
non-breeding adults. </P>

<P>Fur Seals produce their pups in December in dense colonies. The male
holds a territory and actively defends a group of females. Their food consists
mainly of krill, although smaller quantities of fish and squid may also
be taken. </P>

<H3>Whales</H3>

<P>The former abundance of the great whales in the Antarctic is now a feature
of the past. Although most are greatly reduced in numbers, no species has
become extinct, and the chance still exists to see occasionally the greatest
whales of all, the <B>Blue Whale</B> (<I>Balaenoptera musculus</I>) and
the <B>Fin Whale</B> (<I>B. physalus</I>). It is not easy to distinguish
the various members of the genus Balaenoptera from each other when seen
from a ship. </P>

<P>The smallest of them, the <B>Minke Whale</B> (<I>B. acutorostrata</I>)
is usually unmistakable on account of its small size (less than 7.6m long)
and its habit of approaching ships), but the <B>Sei Whale</B> (<I>B. borealis</I>)
is readily taken for a Fin or even a Blue Whale by an unskilled observer.
</P>

<P>The slow-moving <B>Humpback Whale</B> (<I>Megaptera novaengliae</I>),
with its long knobbed flippers and hunched back, is occasionally to be
seen close in to shore around the coasts, while the <B>Southern Right Whale</B>
(<I>Eubalaena glacialis</I>) is occasionally sighted around South Georgia,
though it rarely enters polar waters. </P>

<P>All of these whales feed by filtering out plankton from the surface
waters of the sea, using horny plates - baleen - hanging from the upper
jaws as a filter bed, and by far the most important organism in their diet
is krill. </P>

<P>However, they do not all feed indiscriminately: Sei Whales, which have
very fine baleen, take significant quantities of copepods, particularly
in the more northerly part of their Antarctic distribution; Blue Whales
concentrate <!A Minke whale surfaces in front of Scott Base, Ross Island.></P>

<P>on first year krill with a length of 20-30mm; Fin Whales take mostly
second year krill 30-40mm long; Right Whales have very long baleen plates
and tend not to gulp at concentrations of plankton, as do the others, but
feed continuously, skimming the surface waters and catching the dispersed
organisms such as copepods. </P>

<P>None of the large whales breed in the Antarctic. Instead they use the
productive waters of the Southern Oceans as a feeding ground, where they
lay down vast reserves of blubber to sustain them during their stay in
the less productive but warmer waters where they produce their young. </P>

<P>The toothed whales of the Antarctic, with one exception, are much less
well known. The exception is the <B>Sperm Whale</B> (<I>Physeter catodon</I>).
Sperm Whales seen in the Antarctic are invariably adult males. Because
of their polygamous nature, there is a surplus of males in the breeding
areas and some move to Antarctic waters where they feed on squid. </P>

<P>Probably the most conspicuous of the toothed whales in the Southern
Ocean is the <B>Killer Whale</B> (<I>Orcinus orca</I>). It is generally
seen in small groups, where the adult males can be recognized by their
very tall dorsal fins. Killer Whales are generalized carnivores, taking
a variety of food organisms; they are important predators of seals. </P>

<P>Two species of <B>Beaked Whales</B>, <I>Hyperoodon planifrons</I> and
<I>Beradius arnuxii</I>, are also commonly seen, but almost nothing is
known of their biology. Several other species of small toothed whales have
been seen in Antarctic waters, and one or two specimens have been collected,
but there is a great gap in our knowledge here. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.aloha.com/~bdh/1divnew4.htm">Beaked Whale Onshore
</A></P>

<P><A NAME="birds"></A></P>

<H2>Birds</H2>

<P>Each spring the coast of Antarctica awakens with the return of millions
of seabirds to breed. Their arrival is a dramatic end to the long dark
polar winter. First to arrive are the Adelie Penguins, who have walked,
often up to 50km, across the sea ice to reach their nesting grounds. The
petrels and skuas arrive soon after, flying in from the open sea. Most
of the established breeding birds return to the same nest site and to the
same mate. When necessary, the site is cleared of snow and the pair bond
re-established before the new breeding season begins. </P>

<P>The numbers of birds breeding around the rocky coastline and the offshore
islands are enormous, 100 million or more individuals. Most of these are
Adelie Penguins. Other birds include three more species of penguins, several
species of petrels, a skua, a gull and a tern. </P>

<P><!A pair of Adelie penguins prepare a nest site for the breeding season><!at Cape Bird, Ross Island.></P>

<P>The sub-Antarctic islands to the north also are invaded in spring by
seabirds. Although the species are generally different from those breeding
on the Antarctic continent, they are very closely related and include penguins,
petrels and skuas. These islands are also the home of the albatrosses,
the largest, most spectacular and perhaps the most beautiful of all sea
birds. </P>

<P>While large congregations of birds are found ashore in the summer, large
numbers of young, adolescent and non-breeding birds may also be observed
throughout the Southern Ocean at any time, ranging widely in their search
for food. Watching these birds at sea is one of the genuine pleasures of
long sea voyages under strong winds and rough seas. </P>

<P>Compared with other continents, Antarctica has very few species of breeding
birds. Even when the sub-Antarctic species are included, the total is just
over 40 as compared with several thousand found collectively in Africa,
South America and Australia. Although few species breed in the Antarctic
region, the numbers of individuals are very large. </P>

<P>True terrestrial birds are not found on the Antarctic continent and
only a few, including two species of duck, two sheathbills and a pipit,
have successfully colonized some of the southern sub-Antarctic islands.
</P>

<P>Sea-birds have been more successful than land birds in colonizing the
Antarctic region because they have evolved over long periods of time adaptations
for life bound to a marine environment. Particular features such as those
which help conserve body heat (e.g. special waterproof plumage, an insulating
layer of subcutaneous fat, large body size, compact form and a lack of
bare skin), have enabled them to extend their range south to exploit the
Southern Ocean and establish breeding colonies on the sub-Antarctic islands
and the Antarctic continent. </P>

<P>Food in the form of marine zooplankton, cephalopods and fish is readily
available to them. Little, if any, food is available on the Antarctic continent
to support terrestrial species, even if they were physiologically equipped
to withstand the rigours of an Antarctic winter. Thus, most of these birds
depend entirely on the sea for food and spend most of their life at sea
in search of it. Some, notably the albatrosses and petrels, spend the first
few years without ever visiting land, while others visit occasionally.
</P>

<P>Because of the very large numbers of sea birds and the amount of food
they eat, they are important components of the marine ecosystem, like seals
and whales. </P>

<P>Antarctic species can be divided into four major groups or orders. Of
these the <B>Petrels (order Procellariformes)</B> comprise the greatest
number of species and include the albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, prions,
storm petrels and the diving petrels. Petrels are a diverse group of birds
linked by the common characteristics of tube-like nostrils on the upper
beak. They range in size from the <B>Wandering Albatross</B>, which has
a wing span of about 3m, down to the tiny <B>Wilson's Storm Petrel</B>,
which weighs 35g and has a wing span of 40cm. </P>

<P>All are marine species adapted for a life at sea. On land most have
difficulty in walking and generally visit it only in the breeding season.
All species feed at sea. The smaller birds feed on zooplankton including
krill, and the larger species (albatrosses and some petrels) consume large
squid, fish and crustaceans. The <B>Giant Petrels</B> also feed ashore
on carrion, and these and many other species (<B>Albatrosses, Cape Petrels,
Storm Petrels</B>) feed at sea on the organic wastes discharged by ships.
</P>

<P>Most Antarctic bird species breed annually and lay a single egg which
is very much larger in relation to their body weight than most other birds.
King Penguins and some albatrosses breed less frequently and have the lowest
reproductive rate of any birds. </P>

<P><!Emperor penguins, often found at the edge of the annual sea ice.>The
<B>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes)</B> are the best known, and most numerous
of all Antarctica's birds. Their combined biomass accounts for about 85
per cent of the biomass of all the Antarctic birds, of which over half
is <B>Adelie Penguins</B>. Penguins are stocky, flightless birds with wings
reduced to flippers with which they propel themselves through the water.
On land they walk upright with a waddling gait or in short hops. </P>

<P>Most penguins stand 60 to 70cm high but the largest, the <B>Emperor
Penguin</B>, stands waist high (about 1m) and weighs up to 41kg. They nest
in large dense colonies with some containing 80,000 or more birds. The
sight, smell and noise of any colony is unforgettable. Most build nests
of stones and in them incubate one or two eggs. </P>

<P>The Emperor Penguin is unique among Antarctica's birds. It breeds in
winter, on the ice along the coast of the continent and at one colony at
the base of the Antarctic Peninsula, when weather conditions are at their
worst and in almost continuous darkness. These penguins do not build a
nest or defend a fixed territory. Instead the male incubates the egg on
its feet and can shuffle around as required. During very cold periods the
incubating birds form dense huddles to conserve heat. The chicks leave
the colonies in spring, while still moulting their down, and are rafted
out to sea on broken pieces of pack ice. Like the larger petrels, penguins
do not breed until several years old and may live 30 to 40 years. </P>

<P>The remaining groups of birds feed close to land or on marine organisms
scavenged along the shore. Two species of <B>Cormorants (order Pelecaniformes),
Blue-eyed Shag</B> and <B>Kerguelen Shag</B>, are fish-eating birds that
pursue their prey underwater. They are not strong flyers and mostly stay
close to shore. The chicks, usually 2-4 in number, are naked when newly
hatched and are carefully brooded until the dark down appears. </P>

<P>The <B>Gulls, Terns, Skuas</B> and <B>Sheathbills</B> all belong to
the (<B>order Charadriiformes</B>). <!The South Polar Skua, commonly found around Adelie penguin rookeries.></P>

<P>The <B>South Polar Skua</B> breeds all around the Antarctic continent
and its more northern counterpart, the <B>Brown Skua</B>, on sub-Antarctic
islands. Both feed on marine life and also on carrion, when available.
The <B>Dominican Gull</B> and the <B>Antarctic Tern</B> breed along the
coast or on the offshore islands at the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula,
and the sub-Antarctic islands. All these species feed around the shores
in summer, but most range widely during the winter. The Arctic Tern migrates
annually to the Antarctic. </P>

<P>The <B>Sheathbills</B>, however, remain mostly on land during the austral
winter. These curious all-white birds, although, unrelated, bear a superficial
resemblance to pigeons, both walking and when in flight. Their feet, unlike
other Antarctic sea birds, have only rudimentary webs. They are mostly
scavengers along the shore line feeding on marine organisms and carrion.
They also prey on penguins by taking eggs and small chicks. </P>

<H3>Conservation and Antarctica's Birds</H3>

<P>Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands have been isolated for a long
time, and those birds which colonised the areas have done so in the absence
of terrestrial predators. Most exhibit a remarkable tameness which permits
close observation and study. Communal nesting habits, and in the case of
penguins and petrels, extreme adaptation to a pelagic life have left the
birds highly vulnerable to the activities of man. </P>

<P>Nesting birds, even penguins in the dense rookeries, are easily disturbed
and will desert their nest. This causes a disruption in the orderliness
of the colony, fighting and exposing the eggs and chicks to increased predation
from skuas and other natural enemies. Giant Petrels, gulls and terns are
birds that are easily disturbed. </P>

<P>Already man has caused considerable damage to populations of birds on
the sub-Antarctic islands. At about the turn of the century penguins were
slaughtered in millions for their oil and other birds exploited for their
feathers. At the same time alien animals were introduced, some of which
became feral. </P>

<P>Although the harvest of penguins has ceased, feral cats and rats remain
and prey on these ground nesting birds. Grazing animals destroy or modify
the vegetation, allowing soil erosion and the loss of cover for the burrowing
birds. Fortunately, no introduced predators have become established on
the Antarctic continent. </P>

<P><A NAME="terrestrial"></A></P>

<H2>Terrestrial life</H2>

<P>Terrestrial life in the Antarctica is unlike that in all other major
regions of the world: the vegetation is composed almost entirely of low
lying mosses and lichens, and there are no vertebrate animals (besides
birds and seals which depend on the marine environment for food). Even
the climatically less severe sub-Antarctic islands possess a very limited
tundra-like vegetation of short flowering plants and ferns with very few
shrubby species and no trees; apart from a few land birds, only invertebrate
animals are native to the region. <!Bryum antarcticum, an Antarctic moss growing on Ross Island.></P>

<H3>The terrestrial environment</H3>

<P>Two principal factors have brought about the impoverished flora and
fauna. The isolation of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions from other
continental land masses has created a sea barrier to immigration by plants
and animals, and only ten thousand years ago the region was even more heavily
ice-capped and inhospitable. </P>

<P>The second factor is the harsh weather, particularly the cold summer,
which prevents the establishment and growth of all but the hardiest plants.
If vertebrate animals could find their way here, the short slow-growing
vegetation would be insufficient to support most herbivores, and consequently
no carnivores could survive; seabirds and seals would be available as food
for only part of the year, because of their patterns of migration. </P>

<P>Antarctic terrestrial life, excluding a few species of snow dwelling
bacteria and algae, is restricted to areas which become snow-free for a
few months in summer. Such land is mostly in coastal areas and offshore
islands where the warming influence of the adjacent ocean creates a slightly
more hospitable environment; this applies also to the more alpine sub-Antarctic
islands. In many potentially suitable areas vegetation is excluded by dense
colonies of penguins or seals. </P>

<P>Vegetation requires a regular supply of water during the summer. This,
together with the nutrients dissolved in it, permits limited growth for
a few months, rarely longer even in the more northerly regions. Because
of warming by the sun's radiation, temperatures at plant level often exceed
20C even when the air temperature is well below the freezing point, thereby
creating a relatively favourable environment for plants and invertebrate
animals. </P>

<P>While both plants and invertebrates can often tolerate long periods
of drought and snow cover, many plants are capable of carrying out respiration
and photosynthesis below 0C as long as solid freezing has not occurred.
Unstable ground, due to the frost heaving and down-hill movement of soil
over the permafrost, limits the distribution and continuity of plant communities,
while ground exposed to wind and dessication is also sparsely colonized.
</P>

<P>Wherever there is vegetation, there is usually invertebrate life, albeit
inconspicuous, with the wetter habitats having the greatest diversity and
highest numbers. High densities of some invertebrates also occur in the
relative warmth and shelter beneath stones and rock crevices. </P>

<H3>Terrestrial plants</H3>

<P>Despite their wide separation, the sub-Antarctic islands have vegetation
that is broadly similar in appearance. Typically there is a coastal fringe
of tall <B>Tussock grass</B> (<I>Poa spp.</I>) which is often frequented
by birds and seals; on South Georgia these plants reach 2m in height. Wet
marshes and bogs are dominated by short rushes, mosses and liverworts which
have accumulated deposits of peat several metres in depth over the past
10,000 years. Drier, shallower soils are often covered by short grassland
which, in the more exposed situations, has a high proportion of mosses
and lichens. </P>

<P>Sheltered hillsides have swards of burnet, a woody shrub-like plant,
whose ripe fruits are covered by barbed burrs which readily attach to clothing.
Windswept ridges, plateaux and high altitude areas have sparse &quot;fellfield&quot;
vegetation of mosses, lichens and scattered tufts of wind-dwarfed grasses
and compact ground-hugging cushion-like plants. Ledges, crevices and wet
rock support a variety of mosses, liverworts, lichens and occasional ferns.
On the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean islands the large-leafed <B>Kerguelen
cabbage</B> (<I>Pringlea antiscorbutica</I>) grows amongst small plants
on sheltered &quot;herbfield&quot; slopes, and other unusually large-leaved
herbs, including the <B>MacQuarie Island cabbage</B> (<I>Stilbocarpa polaris</I>)
occur in similar communities on MacQuarie Island. </P>

<P>Farther south, in the maritime Antarctic region of the South Sandwich,
South Orkney and South Shetland islands, and west coast of the Antarctic
Peninsula to 680S, only two flowering plants occur in a few scattered localities,
the <B>Antarctic hair grass</B> (<I>Deschampsia antarctica</I>) and <B>Antarctic
pearlwort</B> (<I>Colobanthus quitensis</I>). They often grow together
on moist sunny, sheltered slopes near the shore. </P>

<P>However, the predominant Antarctic vegetation consists of mosses and
lichens. Wetter areas are dominated by shallow mats and carpets of moss,
while well drained hillsides may have tall turf-forming mosses which accumulate
banks of frozen peat up to 2m in depth. A few species of liverworts and
toadstools also inhabit the wetter moss communities. </P>

<P>Drier habitats have a discontinuous colourful mosaic of small cushion-like
mosses and bushy and encrusting lichens, the latter predominating wherever
exposure to wind is high. </P>

<P>In and near penguin rookeries where the ground is continually trampled,
and concentrations of phosphate and nitrogenous matter reach high levels
that little exists but a <B>leafy green alga</B> (<I>Prasiola crispa</I>)
forming extensive sheets. </P>

<P>Coastal rocks receiving constant deluges of sea spray or the excrement
of cliff-breeding sea birds, are typically covered by expanses of vivid
red, orange and yellow lichens which contrast with the drab colours of
other species on rocks away from such enrichment. </P>

<P>Coastal areas of continental Antarctica are more sparsely vegetated
due to the much drier atmosphere, infrequent availability of melt water
or rain, and strong winds. However, wherever shelter is afforded, small
aggregations of moss cushions and turfs or encrustations of lichen may
be found. A few species are found several hundred kilometres inland, particularly
near breeding colonies of Snow Petrels and Antarctic Petrels. </P>

<H3>Terrestrial animals</H3>

<P>In regions of extreme living conditions, the fauna comprises few species
although these often occur in vast numbers. On the sub-Antarctic islands
there are a few native land birds - <B>two duck species and a small pipit</B>
at South Georgia and one duck on Iles Kerguelen. The mammals, such as reindeer,
rabbits, cats, rats and mice have all been introduced by man. </P>

<P>A variety of large invertebrates are conspicuous on these islands, especially
amongst the vegetation which provides a source of food, moisture, shelter
and warmth. Flies and midges are commonly seen in the air, and some islands
also have small moths. Beetles, the largest of all indigenous southern
polar land invertebrates, spiders, mites and springtails also occur commonly.
</P>

<P>In the soil, earthworms are sometimes seen and there are a few snail
species. Many forms of microscopic animals live in the film of water adhering
to plants, especially mosses, and in the damper soils. </P>

<P>At more southerly latitudes the terrestrial fauna is much less diverse.
Springtails, no more than 2mm in length, and mites occur in great quantities
amongst mosses, lichens and beneath stones, especially near penguin and
petrel colonies. </P>

<P>One species of mite has been found only a few hundred kilometres from
the South Pole. A very few species of wingless midge occur on the Antarctic
Peninsula and one winged species inhabits some of the South Shetland Islands.
</P>

<P>The remaining animal populations comprise microscopic protozoa and slightly
larger groups, such as nematode worms, rotifers and tardigrades, which
occupy the moister mosses and soils. </P>

<P>The three species of duck which inhabit some of the sub-Antarctic islands
feed mainly on freshwater algae; they also graze mosses and flowering plants
at pool margins and take small freshwater and marine crustaceans. The diet
of the South Georgia Pipit is mainly insects, spiders and seeds, although
in winter they feed in small flocks along the shoreline, presumably on
marine invertebrates. In sub-Antarctic and Antarctic coastal areas, the
omnivorous sheathbill scavenges the shoreline and penguin colonies. </P>

<H3>Human influence on the terrestrial environment</H3>

<P>For over 200 years the sub-Antarctic islands have been important commercially.
Land-based sealing and whaling activities, which ceased by 1965, resulted
in settlements and processing stations on several islands. Such human impact
led to widespread destruction of the vegetation around these areas, while
the introduction of domestic animals (sheep, goats, cattle, horses, pigs,
poultry, cats, dogs) and the accidentally introduced rats and mice have
caused significant changes to both the vegetation and the native wildlife.
</P>

<P>Many of the domestic animals were fed on imported fodder containing
seeds of temperate climate plants. Thus, on most islands numerous introduced
weed species occur around the existing and ruined settlements. However,
few of those have adapted to their new environment and encroached into
the native vegetation or spread any distance from their source. </P>

<P>The most destructive introduced animals are the reindeer of South Georgia
and Iles Kerguelen, and the rabbits of MacQuarie Island and Iles Kerguelen,
both of which have devastated large areas of vegetation, causing the virtual
extermination of some species and erosion of soil on hillsides. </P>

<P>In Antarctica, the building of several large research stations and the
use of vehicles and aircraft have produced a serious local effect on the
meagre flora and fauna, while unknown damage may have been done by exhaust
fumes, chemicals and oil waste disposal, etc. </P>

<P>Most of the problems relating to the human invasion of these southern
lands took place before any consideration was given to the need for careful
control of the environment. The Antarctic and sub-Antarctic tundra, whether
richly vegetated or apparently barren, is a very fragile system. </P>

<P>Establishment and growth of plants and their associated fauna is extremely
slow, and once an area of vegetation or soil is destroyed or disturbed,
it will take many years for it to recover and return to its original state;
even boot marks in a moss bank may persist at least 10 years. Decay is
very slow and much litter remains for decades defiling the landscape. </P>

<P>The inter-relationship between plants, animals and their environment
in these simple systems are being monitored and studied in detail. Scientific
investigations over many years may help us to understand the more complex
systems elsewhere in the world. Because it is one of the few remaining
regions in the world relatively uninfluenced by man, except in the immediate
vicinity of the research stations, the current generation has become fully
aware of the need to respect and care for its fauna and flora. </P>

<P><A NAME="lakes"></A></P>

<H2>Lakes, ponds and pools</H2>

<P>Antarctica contains a surprising number and variety of lakes, ponds
and pools. However, even the warmest lakes are frozen to depths of one
or two metres for 8 to 12 months of the year, and some are always covered
with ice. The ice cover limits the amount of light that can enter the lakes,
thus restricting plant growth; where floating algae (phytoplankton) do
occur, they are adapted to low light levels and have a peak of activity
in early spring when the lakes are still ice-covered. <!A scientist studies algal mats.></P>

<P>Nearly all Antarctic lakes have arisen as a result of glacial retreat,
though a few have been formed by earth movements. The most recent freshwater
bodies are found as short-lived pools in depressions on glaciers and ice
fields. They contain no life. </P>

<P>As deglaciation uncovers bedrock, more conventional lakes can form.
These contain pure water, with the addition of only small amounts of mineral
salts from sea spray and leaching from the surrounding rock. There may
be a sparse vegetation of blue-green algae and diatoms forming a felt on
the bottom, and occasionally small water-fleas (for example, the <B>Copepod</B>
(<I>Pseudoboeckella poppei</I>) are present. </P>

<P>Lakes that have been established longer are characterized by increased
levels of nutrient salts in their water, though these are still very low.
These oligotropihic lakes can support a crop of plants and hence animals,
which feed on the plants or on detritus. When not kept clean by ice scour,
the bottoms of such lakes are often partially or totally covered with a
dense felt of blue-green algae and diatoms, and there may be rich growths
of aquatic mosses. </P>

<P>Around the edges of the lake one may see the <B>Fairy shrimp</B> (<I>Branchinecta
gaini</I>), the largest of the freshwater invertebrates in the Antarctic.
Tiny rotifers, tardigrades and nematode worms are also to be found. Bacteria
are important, particularly in the lake sediments, where they are involved
in decomposition and recycling of nutrients. </P>

<P>Lakes and pools near penguin rookeries or the hauling out grounds of
Elephant or Fur Seals rapidly become enriched by the excreta of these animals
and are then termed eutrophic. The activities of the animals make the water
turbid, and the bottom vegetation is reduced or absent though there may
be a rich growth of phytoplankton. </P>

<P>When the amount of organic material in the pool is very high, the available
oxygen is used during decomposition for oxidising the organic compounds;
the deep waters and sediment may then become anoxic, producing conditions
toxic to plant life. The smell of hydrogen sulphide when the water or mud
is disturbed indicates the presence of rotting organic material. </P>

<P>Few animals can live in these pools, and none at all in the worst of
the seal wallows which support a population of bacteria and flagellates
only. </P>

<P>Interesting lakes are found in continental inland ice-free areas, often
called &quot;dry valleys&quot; or &quot;oases&quot;. Because of the general
aridity of the Antarctic, these lakes are often drying up and completely
dry lake beds may be found. Dry valley lakes often receive small amounts
of melt water carrying salts leached from the rocks, but if the annual
input of water only equals or is less than the loss by evaporation or sublimation
of ice, the lake will gradually become more saline. Some lakes have water
over 13 times more saline than sea water, and freezing points as low as
-48C. </P>

<P>Saline lakes may also arise by the evaporation of sea water, trapped
in arms of the sea cut off by the rising of the land, as the deglaciation
reduced the load of the ice sheet. Even in very salty water there may be
some life in the form of algae, flagellates and bacteria. In some saline
lakes a layer of freshwater floats on top of the denser saline layer beneath.
If there is a thick ice cover on top, this will insulate the liquid layers
from the cold air above and some of these lakes are warmed by solar radiation
or geothermal heat to reach temperatures near the bottom as high as 35C.
</P>

<P>In a lake of this type, for example Lake Bonney in south Victoria Land,
extensive algal mats occur attached to the gravel bottom. These mats grow
and produce gases which render them buoyant. They detach in pieces and
rise through the water to positions underneath the ice. Here the algal
mats slowly collect solar heat and melt their way upwards through the ice
which is 3-4 metres thick on Lake Bonney. When they reach the surface the
mat pieces dry and blow away, sometimes colonizing other locations. </P>

<P>Lake Bonney was among the first lakes discovered on the Antarctic continent.
Scott in 1903 first observed this lake and described two nearly separate
small basins. In 1912, Scott's second expedition discovered that the two
lobes had joined more completely and the lake had apparently enlarged.
Today, Lake Bonney continues to grow, as do other lakes in this dry valley
region. </P>

<P>A strange type of lake occurs on land adjacent to ice shelves. In these
lakes the outflow has been dammed by the ice of the shelf, so that the
lower layers of the lake on the seaward side are in contact with the sea
under the ice shelf and the lake surface rises and falls with the tide.
Permanent ice cover prevents wind-generated turbulence from mixing the
layers. In such a lake a freshwater community in the upper layer may overlie
a marine community beneath. </P>

<P>Kroner Lake, on Deception Island, was a well known volcanic lake in
the Antarctic, but it disappeared in the 1969 eruption, though new lakes
have been formed since. Kroner Lake was heated by volcanic activity and
never froze completely in winter, maximum temperatures of 10C being recorded.
It contained a community of bacteria, fungi and algae. </P>

<P>Lakes and pools in sub-Antarctic regions freeze over only for a few
weeks each year. Ice scour is minimal and the water is fringed by an emergent
vegetation of reeds, grasses and the Antarctic buttercup. Fully aquatic
vascular plants, such as starworts, colonize shallow water, and mosses
and algae extend into deep water. Algae form a phytoplankton. </P>

<P>The freshwater fauna of the sub-Antarctic is richer in species and contains,
in addition to the Antarctic forms, beetles and fly larvae. There are,
however, no native freshwater fish or amphibia. <A NAME="conservation"></A></P>

<H2>Conservation in the Antarctic</H2>

<P>The need for conservation is probably be better understood today than
ever before. The pressure of increasing human populations on the environment
has produced a general awareness of the value of unspoilt nature or wilderness.
The last remaining extensive wilderness is the Antarctic. </P>

<P>The continent used to be protected by its remoteness and inaccessibility
but now, technological advances have enabled increasing numbers of visitors
to penetrate it. Some come as members of scientific expeditions, some as
tourists wishing to visit an area unique both in its scenery and wildlife.
Most, if not all, will value their stay in the Antarctic for the way in
which it brought them in contact with nature at its simplest and most imposing.
</P>

<P>But life in the Antarctic has to contend with some of the world's harshest
environments, and is pressed to its limits without the added stress that
can be imposed by man. If those who seek the wilderness are not to destroy
what they search for, some controls based on an understanding of the system
and a respect for its components are essential. </P>

<P>The Antarctic is not totally unspoiled and pristine, though it is more
nearly so than any other equivalent area of the world's surface. Man's
influence is most apparent at the scattered scientific stations and sites
of intensive research. The construction and operation of stations, with
the associated problems of waste disposal, energy generation, transport
and resupply, present an obvious threat to the nature and the aesthetic
value of the environment. </P>

<P>The influence is localized and small in proportion to the Antarctic
continent as a whole. However, it is of greater significance than might
be expected by comparing it with the entire area, because most stations
are established on rocky sites in coastal areas where conditions are most
favourable for the wildlife and vegetation. </P>

<P>Less obvious are the changes caused by past exploitation. The search
for Fur Seals in the 19th century stripped the beaches of the South Shetland
Islands, and a century later the whaling industry devastated the stocks
of the larger whales. </P>

<P>There are other hidden or, as yet, only suspected changes which cannot
be appreciated by simple inspection or comparison with earlier accounts.
The change in the age of sexual maturity of the Crabeater Seal may affect
the population dynamics, and hence the total numbers, of this most abundant
of all the world's seals. The change may be associated with a complex readjustment
of the many food chains based on krill, as a consequence of the reduction
of the Antarctic baleen whales. </P>

<P>Pollution of the environment is another scarcely detectable and recent
change which may have far-reaching consequences. The snow that falls over
Antarctica and its oceans now contains minute traces of man-made chemicals
which become concentrated in the bodies of marine organisms such as penguins
and seals. </P>

<P>Many visitors are surprised to find vegetation on areas of land around
the Antarctic coasts. The deep luxuriant moss banks and the bright orange
and yellow rock lichens stand out in a land of rock and snow. What is often
not appreciated is that these plants grow extremely slowly and the scars
of human footprints or the collection of souvenirs can endure for decades.
<!Emperor penguins - may desert chicks if disturbed.></P>

<P>The tameness of penguins and other sea birds is another great attraction
of the region. But not all individuals will tolerate close approach. In
any colony some desert their eggs or chicks, and the skuas which prey upon
them are quick to pounce. Excited penguins often step on their own eggs
as well. Even apparently impassive members of a colony may be subtly disturbed,
resulting in an unnecessary drain on their energy reserves which can be
restored only by long feeding trips at sea. Too much disturbance can mean
reproductive failure and shrinking populations. </P>

<P>Although this booklet is concerned mainly with living organisms and
systems, there are other features of the Antarctic that are potentially
subject to disturbance. In some parts of the Antarctic, in that tiny fraction
of the land which is free of snow and ice at some time of the year, there
are rocks which contain fossils, agates, geodes or other attractive specimens.
</P>

<P>A visitor may feel tempted to collect such material and take it home
as a momento of their trip to the Antarctic. However, this sort of collecting
can have very serious consequences for scientific research. The supply
of these specimens is always limited, and even where they appear abundant,
once those that are present have been taken, there can be no replacement.
</P>

<P>Fossils in particular can be of great importance in interpreting the
history of the Antarctic and the other southern continents and the evolution
of plants and animals. A fossil taken home is lost forever to the scientific
community. </P>

<P>Similar considerations apply to the strangely-shaped rocks sculpted
by the Antarctic winds for many thousands of years, and known as ventifacts,
and the patterned ground that is the result of freeze-thaw activity. When
a ventifact is removed, or patterned ground disturbed, many thousands of
years may need to elapse before the feature is restored, if indeed this
ever happens. </P>

<P>The first organized attempt to provide a coordinated system for conservation
in the Antarctic was the Antarctic Treaty's Agreed Measures for the Conservation
of Antarctic Fauna and Flora. These measures provide, in conservationist
terms, a management plan for the Antarctic. They lay down rules for conduct
that will help to preserve Antarctic ecosystems, and provide for the designation
of specially protected species and areas where activities are specifically
limited. The Agreed Measures also prohibit the importation of non-indigenous
animals and plants, except under special licence. </P>

<P>Citizens of governments which have ratified the Antarctic Treaty may
be legally bound by the Agreed Measures, while others are free to ignore
them. The information and advice in this booklet is intended for all groups.
By using common sense, visitors to Antarctica can make an important contribution
to its conservation, and thus avoid damaging the environment and its wildlife
and vegetation. </P>

<P>The following points may be helpful: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Remember that the vegetation is fragile and very slow growing. Avoid
walking over moss-banks or lichen-covered scree slopes. </LI>

<LI>Do not collect conspicuous lichens or moss-tufts. The best souvenirs
to bring back from the Antarctic are memories and photographs. </LI>

<LI>Do not collect fossils, other interesting mineral specimens,or disturb
patterned ground. Remember these features are irreplaceable on a human
time scale. <!A marine fossil from the Ohio Range.></LI>

<LI>Do not disturb nesting bird colonies. Stay outside the margins of a
colony and observe from a distance. </LI>

<LI>Do not disturb sleeping seals and never attempt to handle seal pups.
</LI>

<LI>Avoid marked sites where scientific experiments are going on. A close
examination of a microclimate recorder for example could result in some
very misleading data. Remember that these experiments represent somebody's
professional work - and have cost some government (perhaps yours) a great
deal of money. Respect the scientists' interests and careers. </LI>

<LI>Take all litter back with you. It takes decades for it to break down
in the Antarctic environment. </LI>

<LI>Encourage your associates and comrades to follow your efforts at keeping
Antarctica's wilderness conserved and unspoiled for future generations.
</LI>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>History of Antartica</H2>

<P>Antarctica existed from at least 500 million years ago as part of the
Gondwana supercontinent, and from about 60 million years ago occupied a
near-polar position. From about 35 million years ago it become an isolated
continent covered by forests. At about 25 million years ago major climatic
cooling began, and glaciers developed through the continent.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="img0035.jpg" HEIGHT=219 WIDTH=338 ALIGN=LEFT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>By 10 million years ago, Antarctica was covered with an ice
cap, partly sinking under the weight of the ice. Antarctica evolved to
be an ice-covered high altitude plateau, a cold, windy desert with few
island-like nunataks, which drops abruptly to a stormy ocean that freezes
over in winter to double Antarctica's size. </P></CENTER>

<P>The Southern Ocean, and in particular the contact of the ocean with
sea ice, ice shelves or land, supports a diverse marine life and land-based
marine predators. Marine phytoplankton is the base of the short food chain,
in which benthos, squid, fish, birds, seals and whales are at the top;
in the middle there is only krill, a shrimp-like crustacean. On land, the
ice-free areas (nunataks, a few rare snow-free valleys, some islands and
coastal locations) support two types of vascular plants, mosses, lichens,
algae, invertebrate fauna, and microscopic biota, as well as freshwater
fauna.</P>

</P>

<H2>Background To links that follow</H2>

<P>Antarctica is the battle which we thought we had won. </P>

<P>In the late 80's, the 26* nations which jointly run the Antarctica were
set to agree a mining regime. A convention had been negotiated -- and even
signed -- which would have virtually legitimised mineral exploitation across
the entire continent. But environmental groups worldwide mounted a global
campaign against the convention and such were the success of their efforts
that eventually the convention was abandoned. </P>

<P>As a result of on-going pressure from the international environmental
movement, in the place of the proposed mining convention ** a Protocol
to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection was successfully negotiated.
Known as the Madrid Protocol, the central provision of this agreement remains
a moratorium on all commercial mineral exploitation for at least 50 years.
The agreement also institutes strengthened and legally binding measures
governing waste disposal, marine pollution and the conservation of flora
and fauna. Also under the terms of the Protocol, Environmental Impact Assessments
must be prepared for all visits to Antarctica, regardless of purpose. </P>

<P>Environmentalists were well pleased; the continent would be saved for
future generations and by virtue of the Protocol, Antarctica's vital importance
to the planet had been acknowledged. <BR clear=all>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="rat14.jpg" HEIGHT=232 WIDTH=163><B> <BR>

before the Protocol). </B></P>

<P>Antarctica has 70% of the world's fresh water supplies and is the vital
engine which drives much of our global climate. As a pure outdoor laboratory,
the continent has immense scientific importance. It is the best place on
earth to measure global trends in pollution it was in Antarctica that the
ozone hole was first discovered. </P>

<P>A tight legally-binding international agreement is particularly important
in the case of Antarctica, because there is no indigenous population there
to blow the whistle on degradation to the environment. A continent of extremes,
Antarctica is the coldest, driest, windiest and remote spot on the globe.
In many ways it is also the most fragile place on earth. The terrestrial
and freshwater ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to environmental damage.
In such incredibly harsh climatic conditions, growth is very slow and recovery
from disturbances can take years. A footprint on a moss bed may remain
unchanged for a decade. </P>

<P>So as a result of what was probably the environment movement's most
successful campaign, the Madrid Protocol was signed by representatives
of all 26 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties at a grandiose ceremony
in Madrid in the October of 1991. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="rat12.jpg" HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=240><B> <BR>
May the machinery of the Antarctic Treaty System thaw to ensure permanent
protection of the Antarctic wilderness. </B></P>

<P>However, for the Protocol to be legally binding internationally, all
twenty six nations have to ratify the Protocol through their respective
national procedures. And that has not yet happened. Under the terms of
the Antarctic Treaty, decision-making is made entirely by consensus.At
the time of signature, member States entered a voluntary agreement to abide
by the terms of the Protocol until that wider ratification process be completed.
It is now almost five years since the Protocol was signed and that voluntary
agreement remains the only surety of environmental protection in Antarctica.
</P>

<P>Four nations have still not ratified and the voluntary agreement to
proceed as though the Protocol had been ratified is already under strain.
Innovations to implement specific aspects of the Protocol are already being
delayed by national delegations to Antarctic meetings on the grounds that
it would be unwise to proceed until the Protocol is in force. </P>

</B></P>

<P>We know from recent expeditions to Antarctica, notably by Greenpeace,
which have inspected scientific and quasi-scientific bases, that pollution
and destruction which the Protocol was instituted to prevent continues
today. Large amounts of raw sewage are discharged into otherwise pristine
coastal waters, a variety of rubbish and fossil fuels are openly burned
and whilst some stations continue to spread inexorably over the landscape,
other stations have been abandoned to their fate. </P>

<P>In addition, burgeoning tourism and especially the increase in private
adventure tourism also add to environmental risk. At the 1994 Antarctic
Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), Guidelines on Antarctic Tourism were
agreed to, but these voluntary guidelines assume a Protocol in force. </P>

<H2>FINLAND </H2>

<P>The Finnish Foreign Affairs Ministry has attempted to excuse its inaction
by pointing to the increased workload created by Finland's accession last
year to the Treaty of Rome. It would appear that the knock-on effect of
European Union Membership in terms of both major legislation and also the
harmonisation of statutory regulations meant that neither the necessary
legislative time nor the peoplepower was available to complete the ratification
process. The situation was not helped by what can only be described as
a power struggle between the Foreign Affairs &amp; Environment Ministries
as to which should the lead Ministry on the Antarctic legislation. Similarly
alleged protestations from the competing interest of the Finnish Arctic
lobby is also believed to have contributed to slowing the process down.
</P>

<P>The Environment Ministry eventually took over as lead ministry and recently
agreed draft legislation looks likely to pass through the Finnish legislature
later this year. </P>

<H2>JAPAN </H2>

<P>A bureaucratic logjam is the official reason for the delay in Japanese
legislation. Ministry officials argue that it is taking longer than expected
to interpret the original English-language text of the Protocol because
of its sheer length and the complexity of the issues involved. It would
seem that in fact the problem is that the Japanese Government has simply
failed to make ratification a priority. A full scale campaign is being
mounted in Japan by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World Wide
Fund for Nature under the auspices of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean
Coalition (ASOC) to ensure that Japan does make ratification a priority.
However it seems unlikely that full Japanese ratification will happen before
next year. </P>

<H2>RUSSIA </H2>

<P>The situation in Russia is even less straightforward. The political
and economic changes in recent years have had a near crippling effect on
the administration and there are over one hundred International Treaties
and Protocols awaiting ratification. </P>

<P>There are also specific technical difficulties with drafting of the
Antarctic legislation which have further slowed things down. It would appear
that Russian ratification legislation would be the first domestic law ever
to have jurisdiction over Russians outside Russia. This precedent has created
a certain consternation in Russian legal circles and the implications of
the precedent are still being examined by constitutional lawyers. </P>

<P>However, this could always be a convenient smoke screen for the Russian
Government to hide behind. Owing to the poor state of Russian Antarctic
science bases, inevitable expenditure commitment would be necessary for
the clean-up costs which would be needed to conform to the conditions of
the Protocol. It is accepted across the Treaty system that a phased clean
up of Russian bases over the next few years would be acceptable. It is
also not inconceivable that help from other Antarctic nations might be
forthcoming. The hope is that members of other delegations to the forthcoming
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in Utrecht next month will
find ways of encouraging Russian progress. </P>

<H2>THE USA </H2>

<P>There is little doubt, however, that as an old hand and major player
of the Antarctic Treaty System, and currently the sole remaining superpower,
it is the ratification of the US which will provide the momentum to finally
secure complete international ratification of the Protocol. In the US,
slow progress towards ratification has been described as &quot;embarrassing&quot;.
For other countries which have yet to ratify, failure of the US to complete
the process has always been cited as though it somehow legitimised the
failure of other their nations to do it themselves. </P>

<P>It has taken literally years of negotiation for the US Administration
and environmental groups to agree on legislation. Nevertheless in March
this year unanimous agreement on implementing legislation was finally reached
between the Clinton Administration, the scientific community and environmental
groups. </P>

<P>Legislation has now been introduced to both the US Senate and also to
the House of Representatives. The major Hearing in the House Science Committee
was successfully completed in early April. And whilst it is still uncertain
as to whether any further Congressional committee hearings will be deemed
necessary by the authorities, there is a possibility that the Bill could
progress quietly though the House and Senate and become law before the
summer recess. Whilst organisations and officials working on the Bill are
very aware of the inordinately fickle mood of the current Congress, they
are nevertheless cautiously optimistic that barring major disaster, legislation
will be signed by the President before the November Elections. </P>

<B>The dawn of an era of disregard for the environment.</B> </P>

<H2>Round-up</H2>

<P>But anxieties remain - and how could it be otherwise? The protection
of the last great wilderness on earth is precariously balanced between
four random political systems . And the progress of implementation legislation
in those four national legislatures depends on factors which have nothing
whatsoever to do with Antarctica or with Antarctic conservation. </P>

<P>Fortunately, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a large coalition
of local &amp; national environmental organisations, is fighting to the
end to make absolutely sure that the final victory belongs to Antarctica
and is not marred by political apathy. </P>

<P>That battle is not yet over although a successful conclusion is considerably
nearer than seemed even remotely possible a few years ago. In spite of
all the politicking and the behind the scenes deals, public opinion and
its mobilisation have played and continue to play a pivotal role. </P>

<P>The story of the battle to save Antarctica has been the story of ordinary
people doing extraordinary things - which may possibly yet prove a strangely
fitting testament to a fifteen year long struggle as it enters the final
phase to ensure that there remains just one place on earth which humanity
cannot plunder. </P>

</UL>
<P>
1971: <A HREF="#SMTP">SMTP</A> standard implemented for e-mail.
<P>
1972: First public demonstration of ARPANET.
<P>
1975: DoD (Defense Communication Agency)
assumes administrative control of ARPANET.
<P>
1978: U.S. Government declares TCP/IP as its
networking standard. OSI (Open System
Interconnection) standards committees formed
in Europe about this same time to counter
U.S. dominance of networking technology.
<P>
Early 1980s: DoD funds the creation of
Berkeley UNIX which incorporated TCP/IP into
AT&T UNIX to create a ARPANET compatible
"open" operating system.
<P>
01/01/83:  TCP/IP became the standard
protocol for ARPANET. About 1,000 hosts
on-line.
<P>
Mid 1980s: DoD creates its own separate
network (MILNET) but continues to fund
ARPANET. ARPANET still used primarily by
computer scientists working on military and
other govt. contracts.
<P>
1985-86: NSF becomes involved with ARPANET and expands access to a many Universities. NSF starts construction of NSFNET linking
super computer centers with high speed
circuits.  10,000 hosts on line (1987)
<P>
1990: DoD disbands ARPANET and it is
incorporated into NSFNET (i.e. Internet)
100,000 hosts on line.
<P>
Early 1990s: The number of Internet hosts
(primary nodes) increases by 10-15% per
month. 720,000 hosts on line in 1992, between
1-2 million today. 
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Internet Network and Transport Protocols:<A HREF="#top"> <I> - go back - </I></A></H4>
 
A TCP/IP analogy is mailing a book by cutting
it apart and inserting the leaves in separate
envelopes. The address on the envelope is IP.
The pages in the envelopes are TCP segments.
<P>
<A NAME=IP>IP</A> (Internet Protocol): Creates standardized,
addressed "datagrams" that can be routed
according to a predetermined path, or
dynamically by interactive routing devices on
the Internet, without the need for a
established point-to-point connection. An IP
datagram header has an address field of 32
binary bit (1's and 0's) which are expressed
as four 8-bit decimal equivalents: 0.0.0.0 to
255.255.255.255. This 32 bit address is
capable of identifying 4.2 billion (2 to the 32nd)
separate Internet hosts. The actual number of
possible addresses is considerably smaller
because some address bits are reserved for
special management functions.
 <P>
<A NAME=SLIP>Serial Line Internet Protocal (SLIP)</A> and
Point to Point Protocol (PPP)  allow Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams which are needed to route the data over the Internet to be carried over a telephone / modem connection.  A PC, Macintosh, or Unix workstation connecting via SLIP or PPP is assigned an Internet address.  The user can then function as a full peer on the Internet and use GUI-based applications which require IP and TCP.
<P>
<A NAME=TCP>TCP</A> (Transmission Control Protocol):
Segments data into manageable units on the
sending computer, numbers the segments, and
controls the sending of the segments in the
proper sequence. TCP on the receiving
computer acknowledges receipt of the first
and last segments, reassembles the segments
in the correct order, and sends error
messages to sender (via return address in IP
header) if segments are missing.
<P>
<A NAME=UDP>UDP</A> (User Datagram Protocol): Like TCP, UDP
segments data into manageable units on the
sending computer, numbers the segments, and
controls the sending of the segments in the
proper sequence. But, UDP does not attempt to
recover lost segments. UDP/IP is used for
applications such a digitized voice
(telephone), or live video. A dropped
datagram will simply cause static or noise.
<P>
<A NAME=DNS>DNS</A> (Domain Name System):  Mnemonic
identification and addressing system for
Internet host computers and users.  Name
server databases are used to match DNS names
(e.g., jsmith@netcom.com) with the
decimal address [123.45.67.8] of the user's
Internet host.  
<HR>
<H4>Internet Application Protocols:</A><A HREF="#top"> <I> - go back - </I></A></H4>
 
<A NAME=TELNET>TELNET</A>:  Allows a remote user to access and
operate a UNIX host computer. What the user
can do depends on the account privileges
established by the system administrator. Many
Internet hosts allow "anonymous" or guest
log-ons which allow any Internet user access
to programs and resources.
<P>
<A NAME=FTP>FTP</A> (File Transfer Protocol): Allows a remote
user to copy files from a UNIX host computer
to the user's computer (PC, Macintosh, UNIX
workstation, remote UNIX host). What the user
can copy depends on the account privileges
established by the system administrator. Many
Internet hosts allow "anonymous" guest FTP
which allows any Internet user to copy
programs and resources stored in public
access directories.
<P>
<A NAME=SMTP>SMTP</A> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): A
standard format for sending electronic mail
message between computer systems. A user can
send E-Mail from any computer, but must have
an account (post office box) on a host system
in order to receive mail from others. Many
non-Internet commercial services and
government agencies have SMTP "gateways" that
allow users to send and receive E-Mail over
the Internet. 
<HR>
<H4><A NAME=Programs>Internet Application Programs</A>:<A HREF="#top"> <I> - go back - </I></A></H4>
 
There are numerous application programs that
operate on top of TELNET, FTP, and SMTP (just
as Word Perfect operates on top of Windows
and MS-DOS) to create user friendly tools for
finding and retrieving information on UNIX
host computers. The latest and most popular
is World Wide Web (WWW) and Mosaic which
allow the user to jump from computer to
computer by clicking a mouse on highlighted
"Hypertext."  Internet hosts must run UNIX,
but user application programs can run on
non-UNIX platforms. TCP/IP, not UNIX, is the
common denominator. When Internet
applications such as Mosaic are run on PCs or
Macintoshes they are linked to other programs
such as PC/TCP and Mac/TCP which create the
TCP segments and IP datagrams expected by the
routers and the UNIX host.
 
<HR>
<H4><A NAME=Access>Internet Access Options:</A><A HREF="#top"> <I> - go back - </I></A></H4>
 
CheapNet (Dial-in connections): TELNET
and FTP can be done on an as-needed basis
over an inexpensive dial-up connection as a
secondary node (user account) on a host
computer or terminal server, although many
dial-in service providers limit access to
SMTP e-mail. With a dial-in account the a
host computer provides the mailbox and your
Internet address falls under the host
computers domain name. In some cases a local
dial-in connection may just be a entrance
point and your mailbox could be on another
server on the  other side of the world. Once you
are on the Internet the physical location of
your E-Mail storage is largely irrelevant.
<P>
If e-mail is your only requirement,
commercial services such as MCI Mail,
CompuServe, and AppleLink may be more viable
E-Mail alternatives if the other commercial
services they provide are needed (Internet is
non-commercial). Most are accessible from
local numbers and have SMTP Internet
gateways, but, you usually will not have
TELNET and FTP access (or will pay a high
premium for it).
<P>
<EM>The Big Show: Running an Internet Node</EM>
<P>
A  node is an Internet host that serves local users
and may allow guest access from the Internet
community at large. There is a big difference
between having an account on someone else's host
and running one yourself.  It is expensive (equipment 
and support costs) and carries a great deal of
responsibility to the Internet community at
large; the Internet is a cooperative network
not a commercial service provider. Here are 
just the basic requirements for operating an 
Internet node site:
<P>
1)  Must purchase, configure, and
maintain an Internet router on a 24-hour
basis. This requires a knowledgeable staff
and a back-up strategy in case of equipment
failures. A single malfunctioning router can
affect the entire Internet.
<P>
2) Must have a UNIX host computer with
adequate disk storage capacity and a back-up
strategy in case of equipment failures.
<P>
3) Must provide in-depth security of
data resources due to public access.
Knowledgeable Internet users can exploit
known UNIX operating system weaknesses and
"back doors" to gain unauthorized access.
Trojan Horses are a real risk (malicious
programs named to resemble system software
and utilities). Best strategy may be a fire
wall, placing secure assets behind a
router/gateway that denies access to
outsiders.
<P>
4) Must administer a name server and
user accounts. Must administer e-Mail system.
<P>
5) Must develop and maintain user services
(Mosaic interface, WAIS databases, etc.) and
administer "anonymous" access area.
<P>
6) Must lease one or more high-speed circuit
to other Internet routers.
<P>
7) Must pay connection charges to provider of
Internet gateway.
<P>
8) Must stay current with Internet
administrative management issues, educate the
user community and enforce Internet
standards.

<H4><A NAME=OSI>Internet vs. OSI, GOSIP, POSIX, et. al.</A><A HREF="#top"> <I> - go back - </I></A></H4>
 
Most acknowledge UNIX as the best "open"
computer operating system, but in the 1980s
when the OSI / GOSIP standards process
started many in the computer industry saw OSI
protocols (X.400 , X.500) as the ideal model
for networking and predicted the decline of
TCP/IP.
<P>
TCP/IP, TELNET, and FTP are an integral part
of  both UNIX and the Internet. Although
these protocols date from the 1970s, and the
OSI model is now the "official" USG standard,
new user friendly GUI application tools such
as Mosaic have been built on top of TCP/IP,
TELNET, and FTP and their ease of use has
fueled the the rapid expansion of the
Internet since 1990.  This and the lack of
clearly defined OSI protocols for message
handling (X.400) and directory services
(X.500) has driven the marketplace towards
RISC and  486 /Pentium workstations and servers of ever decreasing
cost. This trend will will further
entrench UNIX and TCP/IP as universal
standards. Nowadays many industry pundits are
predicting the merging of OSI services such
as X.400 and X.500 with redefined Internet
protocols. Few are predicting the demise of
TCP/IP or wholesale conversion of the
Internet to OSI protocols these days.
<P>
In fact, on April 22, 1994 U.S. Vice President Al
Gore appeared on Worldnet, announcing a new
Internet based environmental program for K-12
schools. School kids all around the work will
take environmental measurements (temperature,
air pressure, rainfall, etc.) and feed the
information into a central database over the
Internet. The data will be displayed back to
the schools, on-line, in a graphic format
(maps, charts, etc.).

<PRE>
1956   USSR launches Sputnik, first artifial earth satellite.  In response,
       US forms the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) within the
       Department of Defense (DoD) to establish US lead in science and
       technology applicable to the military (:amk:)

1962   Paul Baran, RAND: "On Distributed Communications Networks"

        - use of Information Message Processors (IMP) [Honeywell 516 mini
          computer with 12K of memory] developed by Bolt Beranek and Newman,
          Inc. (BBN)

        First Request for Comment (RFC): "Host Software" by Steve Crocker

1970    ALOHAnet developed by Norman Abrahamson, U of Hawaii (:sk2:)

        ARPANET hosts start using Network Control Protocol (NCP).

1971    15 nodes (23 hosts): UCLA, SRI, UCSB, U of Utah, BBN, MIT, RAND, SDC,
        Harvard, Lincoln Lab, Stanford, UIU(C), CWRU, CMU, NASA/Ames

1972    International Conference on Computer Communications with
        demonstration of ARPANET between 40 machines organized by Bob Kahn.

        InterNetworking Working Group (INWG) created to address need
        for establishing agreed upon protocols.  Chairman: Vinton Cerf.

        Ray Tomlinson of BBN invents email program to send messages across a
        distributed network. (:amk:)

1975    Operational management of Internet transferred to DCA (now DISA)

        "Jargon File", by Raphael Finkel at SAIL, first released (:esr:)

1970s   Store and Forward Networks
        - Used electronic mail technology and extended it to conferencing

        HM Elizabeth, Queen of the United Kingdom sends out an e-mail
        (anyone know the exact year?)

1976    UUCP (Unix-to-Unix CoPy) developed at AT&T Bell Labs and distributed
        with UNIX one year later.

1977    THEORYNET created at U of Wisconsin providing electronic mail to
        over 100 researchers in computer science (using uucp).

1979    Meeting between U of Wisconsin, DARPA, NSF, and computer scientists
        from many universities to establish a Computer Science Department
        research computer network.

        USENET established using uucp between Duke and UNC by Tom Truscott
        and Steve Bellovin.

1981    BITNET, the "Because Its Time NETwork"
        - Started as a cooperative network at the City University of New York.
        - Provides electronic mail and listserv servers to distribute
          information.
        - Unlike USENET, where client s/w is needed, electronic mail is the
          only tool necessary.

        CSNET (Computer Science NETwork) built by UCAR and BBN through seed
        money granted by NSF to provide networking services (specially
        email) to university scientists with no access to ARPANET.  CSNET
        later becomes known as the Computer and Science Network. (:amk:)

        Minitel (Teletel) is deployed across France by French Telecom.

1982    INWG establishes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet
        Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, for
        ARPANET.
        - This leads to one of the first definition of an "internet"
          as a connected set of networks, specifically those using TCP/IP,
          and "Internet" as connected TCP/IP internets.
        - DoD declares TCP/IP suite to be standard for DoD (:vgc:)

        EUnet (European UNIX Network) is created by EUUG to provide email and
        USENET services. (:glg:)

        to know the exact path to other systems.

        Cutover from NCP to TCP/IP (1 January)

        CSNET / ARPANET gateway put in place

        ARPANET split into ARPANET and MILNET; the latter became integrated
        with the Defense Data Network created the previous year.

        Desktop workstations come into being, many with Berkeley UNIX which
        includes IP networking software.

        Need switches from having a single, large time sharing computer
        connected to Internet per site, to connection of an entire local
        network.

        Berkeley releases 4.2BSD incorporating TCP/IP (:mpc:)

        EARN (European Academic and Research Network) established.  Very
        similar to the way BITNET works.

        FidoNet developed by Tom Jennings.

1984    Domain Name Server (DNS) introduced.

        # of hosts breaks 1,000

        JUNET (Japan Unix Network) established using UUCP.

        JANET (Joint Academic Network) established in the UK using the
        Coloured Book protocols.

1986    NSFNET created (backbone speed of 56Kbps)
        - NSF establishes 5 super-computing centers to provide high-computing
          power for all (JVNC@Princeton, PSC@Pittsburgh, SDSC@UCSD, NCSA@UIUC,
          Theory Center@Cornell).
        - ARPANET bureaucracy keeps it from being used to interconnect
          centers and NSFNET comes into being with the aid of NASA and DOE.
        - This allows an explosion of connections, especially from
          universities.

        Cleveland Freenet (start of NPTN) comes on-line (:sk2:)

        Network News Transfer Protocl (NNTP) designed to enhance Usenet news
        performance over TCP/IP.

        Mail Exchanger (MX) records developed by Craig Partridge allowing
        non-IP network hosts to have domain addresses.

1987    NSF signs a cooperative agreement to manage the NSFNET backbone with
        Merit Network, Inc. (IBM and MCI involvement was through an agreement
        with Merit).  Merit, IBM, and MCI later founded ANS.

        UUNET is founded with Usenix funds to provide commercial UUCP and
        Usenet access.

        1000th RFC: "Request For Comments reference guide"

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Short History of the Internet by Bruce Sterling </H2> <Hr> <A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.sf.ca.us" >bruces@well.sf.ca.us</A> Literary Freeware: Not for Commercial Use  From THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION, February 1993.

<Hr>
<p>
 Some thirty years ago, the RAND Corporation, America's foremost Cold War think-tank, faced a strange strategic problem. How could the US authorities successfully communicate after a nuclear war? 
<p>
 Postnuclear America would need a command-and-control network, linked from city to city, state to state, base to base. But no matter how thoroughly that network was armored or protected, its switches and wiring would always be vulnerable to the impact of atomic bombs. A nuclear attack would reduce any conceivable network to tatters. 
<p>
 And how would the network itself be commanded and controlled? Any central authority, any network central citadel, would be an obvious and immediate target for an enemy missile. The center of the network would be the very first place to go. RAND mulled over this grim puzzle in deep military secrecy, and arrived at a daring solution. The RAND proposal (the brainchild of RAND staffer Paul Baran) was made public in 1964. In the first place, the network would *have no central authority.* Furthermore, it would be *designed from the beginning to operate while in tatters.* 
<p>
 The principles were simple. The network itself would be assumed to be unreliable at all times. It would be designed from the get-go to transcend its own unreliability. All the nodes in the network would be equal in status to all other nodes, each node with its own authority to originate, pass, and receive messages. The messages themselves would be divided into packets, each packet separately addressed. Each packet would begin at some specified source node, and end at some other specified destination node. Each packet would wind its way through the network on an individual basis. 
<p>
 The particular route that the packet took would be unimportant. Only final results would count. Basically, the packet would be tossed like a hot potato from node to node to node, more or less in the direction of its destination, until it ended up in the proper place. If big pieces of the network had been blown away, that simply wouldn't matter; the packets would still stay airborne, lateralled wildly across the field by whatever nodes happened to survive. This rather haphazard delivery system might be "inefficient" in the usual sense (especially compared to, say, the telephone system) -- but it would be extremely rugged. 
<p>
 During the 60s, this intriguing concept of a decentralized, blastproof, packet-switching network was kicked around by RAND, MIT and UCLA. The National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain set up the first test network on these principles in 1968.  Shortly afterward, the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency decided to fund a larger, more ambitious project in the USA. The nodes of the network were to be high-speed supercomputers (or what passed for supercomputers at the time). These were rare and valuable machines which were in real need of good solid networking, for the sake of national research-and-development projects. 
<p>
 In fall 1969, the first such node was installed in UCLA. By December 1969, there were four nodes on the infant network, which was named ARPANET, after its Pentagon sponsor. The four computers could transfer data on dedicated high-speed transmission lines. They could even be programmed remotely from the other nodes. Thanks to ARPANET, scientists and researchers could share one another's computer facilities by long-distance. This was a very handy service, for computer-time was precious in the early '70s. In 1971 there were fifteen nodes in ARPANET; by 1972, thirty-seven nodes. And it was good. 
<p>
 By the second year of operation, however, an odd fact became clear. ARPANET's users had warped the computer-sharing network into a dedicated, high-speed, federally subsidized electronic post- office. The main traffic on ARPANET was not long-distance computing. Instead, it was news and personal messages. Researchers were using ARPANET to collaborate on projects, to trade notes on work, and eventually, to downright gossip and schmooze. People had their own personal user accounts on the ARPANET computers, and their own personal addresses for electronic mail. Not only were they using ARPANET for person-to-person communication, but they were very enthusiastic about this particular service -- far more enthusiastic than they were about long-distance computation. 
<p>
 It wasn't long before the invention of the mailing-list, an ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could be sent automatically to large numbers of network subscribers. Interestingly, one of the first really big mailing-lists was "SF- LOVERS," for science fiction fans. Discussing science fiction on the network was not work-related and was frowned upon by many ARPANET computer administrators, but this didn't stop it from happening. 
<p>
 Throughout the '70s, ARPA's network grew. Its decentralized structure made expansion easy. Unlike standard corporate computer networks, the ARPA network could accommodate many different kinds of machine. As long as individual machines could speak the packet-switching lingua franca of the new, anarchic network, their brand-names, and their content, and even their ownership, were irrelevant. 
<p>
 The ARPA's original standard for communication was known as NCP, "Network Control Protocol," but as time passed and the technique advanced, NCP was superceded by a higher-level, more sophisticated standard known as TCP/IP. TCP, or "Transmission Control Protocol," converts messages into streams of packets at the source, then reassembles them back into messages at the destination. IP, or "Internet Protocol," handles the addressing, seeing to it that packets are routed across multiple nodes and even across multiple networks with multiple standards -- not only ARPA's pioneering NCP standard, but others like Ethernet, FDDI, and X.25. 
<p>
 As early as 1977, TCP/IP was being used by other networks to link to ARPANET. ARPANET itself remained fairly tightly controlled, at least until 1983, when its military segment broke off and became MILNET. But TCP/IP linked them all. And ARPANET itself, though it was growing, became a smaller and smaller neighborhood amid the vastly growing galaxy of other linked machines. 
<p>
 As the '70s and '80s advanced, many very different social groups found themselves in possession of powerful computers. It was fairly easy to link these computers to the growing network-of- networks. As the use of TCP/IP became more common, entire other networks fell into the digital embrace of the Internet, and messily adhered. Since the software called TCP/IP was public-domain, and the basic technology was decentralized and rather anarchic by its very nature, it was difficult to stop people from barging in and linking up somewhere-or-other. In point of fact, nobody *wanted* to stop them from joining this branching complex of networks, which came to be known as the "Internet." 
<p>
 Connecting to the Internet cost the taxpayer little or nothing, since each node was independent, and had to handle its own financing and its own technical requirements. The more, the merrier. Like the phone network, the computer network became steadily more valuable as it embraced larger and larger territories of people and resources. 
<p>
 A fax machine is only valuable if *everybody else* has a fax machine. Until they do, a fax machine is just a curiosity. ARPANET, too, was a curiosity for a while. Then computer-networking became an utter necessity. 
<p>
 In 1984 the National Science Foundation got into the act, through its Office of Advanced Scientific Computing. The new NSFNET set a blistering pace for technical advancement, linking newer, faster, shinier supercomputers, through thicker, faster links, upgraded and expanded, again and again, in 1986, 1988, 1990. And other government agencies leapt in: NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, each of them maintaining a digital satrapy in the Internet confederation. 
<p>
 The nodes in this growing network-of-networks were divvied up into basic varieties. Foreign computers, and a few American ones, chose to be denoted by their geographical locations. The others were grouped by the six basic Internet "domains": gov, mil, edu, com, org and net. (Graceless abbreviations such as this are a standard feature of the TCP/IP protocols.) Gov, Mil, and Edu denoted governmental, military and educational institutions, which were, of course, the pioneers, since ARPANET had begun as a high-tech research exercise in national security. Com, however, stood for "commercial" institutions, which were soon bursting into the network like rodeo bulls, surrounded by a dust-cloud of eager nonprofit "orgs." (The "net" computers served as gateways between networks.) 
<p>
 ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its own overwhelming success. Its users scarcely noticed, for ARPANET's functions not only continued but steadily improved. The use of TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now global. In 1971, a mere twenty-one years ago, there were only four nodes in the ARPANET network. Today there are tens of thousands of nodes in the Internet, scattered over forty-two countries, with more coming on-line every day. Three million, possibly four million people use this gigantic mother-of-all-computer-networks. 
<p>
 The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is probably the most important scientific instrument of the late twentieth century. The powerful, sophisticated access that it provides to specialized data and personal communication has sped up the pace of scientific research enormously. 
<p>
 The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is spectacular, almost ferocious. It is spreading faster than cellular phones, faster than fax machines. Last year the Internet was growing at a rate of twenty percent a *month.* The number of "host" machines with direct connection to TCP/IP has been doubling every year since 1988. The Internet is moving out of its original base in military and research institutions, into elementary and high schools, as well as into public libraries and the commercial sector. 
<p>
 Why do people want to be "on the Internet?" One of the main reasons is simple freedom. The Internet is a rare example of a true, modern, functional anarchy. There is no "Internet Inc." There are no official censors, no bosses, no board of directors, no stockholders. In principle, any node can speak as a peer to any other node, as long as it obeys the rules of the TCP/IP protocols, which are strictly technical, not social or political. (There has been some struggle over commercial use of the Internet, but that situation is changing as businesses supply their own links). 
<p>
 The Internet is also a bargain. The Internet as a whole, unlike the phone system, doesn't charge for long-distance service. And unlike most commercial computer networks, it doesn't charge for access time, either. In fact the "Internet" itself, which doesn't even officially exist as an entity, never "charges" for anything. Each group of people accessing the Internet is responsible for their own machine and their own section of line. 
<p>
 The Internet's "anarchy" may seem strange or even unnatural, but it makes a certain deep and basic sense. It's rather like the "anarchy" of the English language. Nobody rents English, and nobody owns English. As an English-speaking person, it's up to you to learn how to speak English properly and make whatever use you please of it (though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit). Otherwise, everybody just sort of pitches in, and somehow the thing evolves on its own, and somehow turns out workable. And interesting. Fascinating, even. Though a lot of people earn their living from using and exploiting and teaching English, "English" as an institution is public property, a public good. Much the same goes for the Internet. Would English be improved if the "The English Language, Inc." had a board of directors and a chief executive officer, or a President and a Congress? There'd probably be a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot fewer new ideas. 
<p>
 People on the Internet feel much the same way about their own institution. It's an institution that resists institutionalization. The Internet belongs to everyone and no one. 
<p>
 Still, its various interest groups all have a claim. Business people want the Internet put on a sounder financial footing. Government people want the Internet more fully regulated. Academics want it dedicated exclusively to scholarly research. Military people want it spy-proof and secure. And so on and so on. 
<p>
 All these sources of conflict remain in a stumbling balance today, and the Internet, so far, remains in a thrivingly anarchical condition. Once upon a time, the NSFnet's high-speed, high-capacity lines were known as the "Internet Backbone," and their owners could rather lord it over the rest of the Internet; but today there are "backbones" in Canada, Japan, and Europe, and even privately owned commercial Internet backbones specially created for carrying business traffic. Today, even privately owned desktop computers can become Internet nodes. You can carry one under your arm. Soon, perhaps, on your wrist. 
<p>
 But what does one *do* with the Internet? Four things, basically: mail, discussion groups, long-distance computing, and file transfers. 
<p>
 Internet mail is "e-mail," electronic mail, faster by several orders of magnitude than the US Mail, which is scornfully known by Internet regulars as "snailmail." Internet mail is somewhat like fax. It's electronic text. But you don't have to pay for it (at least not directly), and it's global in scope. E-mail can also send software and certain forms of compressed digital imagery. New forms of mail are in the works. 
<p>
 The discussion groups, or "newsgroups," are a world of their own. This world of news, debate and argument is generally known as "USENET. " USENET is, in point of fact, quite different from the Internet. USENET is rather like an enormous billowing crowd of gossipy, news-hungry people, wandering in and through the Internet on their way to various private backyard barbecues. USENET is not so much a physical network as a set of social conventions. In any case, at the moment there are some 2,500 separate newsgroups on USENET, and their discussions generate about 7 million words of typed commentary every single day. Naturally there is a vast amount of talk about computers on USENET, but the variety of subjects discussed is enormous, and it's growing larger all the time. USENET also distributes various free electronic journals and publications. 
<p>
 Both netnews and e-mail are very widely available, even outside the high-speed core of the Internet itself. News and e-mail are easily available over common phone-lines, from Internet fringe- realms like BITnet, UUCP and Fidonet. The last two Internet services, long-distance computing and file transfer, require what is known as "direct Internet access" -- using TCP/IP. 
<p>
 Long-distance computing was an original inspiration for ARPANET and is still a very useful service, at least for some. Programmers can maintain accounts on distant, powerful computers, run programs there or write their own. Scientists can make use of powerful supercomputers a continent away. Libraries offer their electronic card catalogs for free search. Enormous CD-ROM catalogs are increasingly available through this service. And there are fantastic amounts of free software available. 
<p>
 File transfers allow Internet users to access remote machines and retrieve programs or text. Many Internet computers -- some two thousand of them, so far -- allow any person to access them anonymously, and to simply copy their public files, free of charge. This is no small deal, since entire books can be transferred through direct Internet access in a matter of minutes. Today, in 1992, there are over a million such public files available to anyone who asks for them (and many more millions of files are available to people with accounts). Internet file-transfers are becoming a new form of publishing, in which the reader simply electronically copies the work on demand, in any quantity he or she wants, for free. New Internet programs, such as "archie," "gopher," and "WAIS," have been developed to catalog and explore these enormous archives of material. 
<p>
 The headless, anarchic, million-limbed Internet is spreading like bread-mold. Any computer of sufficient power is a potential spore for the Internet, and today such computers sell for less than $2,000 and are in the hands of people all over the world. ARPA's network, designed to assure control of a ravaged society after a nuclear holocaust, has been superceded by its mutant child the Internet, which is thoroughly out of control, and spreading exponentially through the post-Cold War electronic global village. The spread of the Internet in the 90s resembles the spread of personal computing in the 1970s, though it is even faster and perhaps more important. More important, perhaps, because it may give those personal computers a means of cheap, easy storage and access that is truly planetary in scale. 
<p>
 The future of the Internet bids fair to be bigger and exponentially faster. Commercialization of the Internet is a very hot topic today, with every manner of wild new commercial information- service promised. The federal government, pleased with an unsought success, is also still very much in the act. NREN, the National Research and Education Network, was approved by the US Congress in fall 1991, as a five-year, $2 billion project to upgrade the Internet "backbone." NREN will be some fifty times faster than the fastest network available today, allowing the electronic transfer of the entire Encyclopedia Britannica in one hot second. Computer networks worldwide will feature 3-D animated graphics, radio and cellular phone-links to portable computers, as well as fax, voice, and high- definition television. A multimedia global circus! 
<p>
 Or so it's hoped -- and planned. The real Internet of the future may bear very little resemblance to today's plans. Planning has never seemed to have much to do with the seething, fungal development of the Internet. After all, today's Internet bears little resemblance to those original grim plans for RAND's post- holocaust command grid. It's a fine and happy irony. 
<p>
 How does one get access to the Internet? Well -- if you don't have a computer and a modem, get one. Your computer can act as a terminal, and you can use an ordinary telephone line to connect to an Internet-linked machine. These slower and simpler adjuncts to the Internet can provide you with the netnews discussion groups and your own e-mail address. These are services worth having -- though if you only have mail and news, you're not actually "on the Internet" proper. 
<p>
 If you're on a campus, your university may have direct "dedicated access" to high-speed Internet TCP/IP lines. Apply for an Internet account on a dedicated campus machine, and you may be able to get those hot-dog long-distance computing and file-transfer functions. Some cities, such as Cleveland, supply "freenet" community access. Businesses increasingly have Internet access, and are willing to sell it to subscribers. The standard fee is about $40 a month -- about the same as TV cable service. 
<p>
 As the Nineties proceed, finding a link to the Internet will become much cheaper and easier. Its ease of use will also improve, which is fine news, for the savage UNIX interface of TCP/IP leaves plenty of room for advancements in user-friendliness. Learning the Internet now, or at least learning about it, is wise. By the turn of the century, "network literacy," like "computer literacy" before it, will be forcing itself into the very texture of your life.

Cerf<br>Senior Vice President, Data Services Division<br><a href="http://www.mci.com">MCI Telecommunications Corporation</a></h3><hr><h3>The Internet Phenomenon</h3><p>The Internet has gone from near-invisibility to near-ubiquityin little more than a year.  (Near-ubiquity may be a bit of anover-statement, but Valvoline's promotion of its InternetWorld Wide Web home page in its Indianapolis 500 televisionadvertisements speaks worlds about the phenomenon that weare witnessing!)  In fact, though, today's multi-billiondollar industry in Internet hardware and software is thedirect descendant of strategically-motivated fundamentalresearch begun in the 1960s with federal sponsorship.  Afertile mixture of high-risk ideas, stable research funding,visionary leadership, extraordinary grass-roots cooperation,and vigorous entrepreneurship has led to an emerging GlobalInformation Infrastructure unlike anything that has ever existed.<p>Although not easy to estimate with accuracy, the 1994 datacommunications market approached roughly $15 billion/yearif one includes private line data services ($9 billion/year),local area network and bridge/router equipment ($3 billion/year),wide area network services ($1 billion/year), electronicmessaging and online services ($1 billion/year), and proprietarynetworking software and hardware ($1 billion/year).  Some ofthese markets show annual growth rates in the 35-50% range,and the Internet itself has doubled in size each year since 1988.<p>The Internet now encompasses an estimated 50,000 networks worldwide,about half of which are in the United States.  There are over5 million computers permanently attached to the Internet, plusat least that many portable and desktop systems which are onlyintermittently online.  (There were only 4 computers on theARPANET in 1969, and only 200 on the Internet in 1983!)  Trafficrates measured in the recently"retired" NSFNET backbone approached 20 trillion bytes permonth and were growing at a 100% annual rate.<p>What triggered this phenomenon?  What sustainsit?  How is its evolution managed?  The answers to these questionshave their roots in ARPA-sponsored research in the 1960sinto a then-risky new approach to datacommunication:  <i>packet switching</i>.  TheU.S. government has played a critical role in the evolution andapplication of advanced computer networking technology anddeserves credit for stimulating wide-rangingexploration and experimentation over the course of severaldecades.<h3>Evolutionary Stages</h3><p><b>Packet Switching</b><p>Today's computer communication networks are based on a technologycalled <i>packet switching</i>.  This technology, which arosefrom ARPA-sponsored researchin the 1960s, is fundamentally different from thetechnology that was then employed bythe telephone system (which was based on "circuit switching") orby the military messaging system (which was based on "messageswitching").<p>In a packet switching system, data to be communicated is brokeninto small chunks that are labeled to show where they come from and wherethey are to go, rather like postcards in the postal system.  Likepostcards, packets have a maximumlength and are not necessarily reliable.  Packets are forwardedfrom one computer to another until they arrive at theirdestination.  If any are lost, they are re-sent by theoriginator.  The recipient acknowledges receipt of packetsto eliminate unnecessary re-transmissions.<p>The earliestpacket switching research was sponsored by the Information ProcessingTechniques Office of the Department of Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency, which acted as a visionary force shaping theevolution of computer networking as a tool for coherentharnessing of far-flung computing resources.  Thefirst experiments were conducted around 1966.  Shortly thereafter,similar workbegan at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK.  In1968 ARPA developed and released a Request for Quotation fora communication systembased on a set of small, interconnected computers it called "InterfaceMessage Processors" or "IMPs."  The competitionwas won by Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), a research firmin Cambridge, MA, and by September 1969 BBN had developed anddelivered the first IMP to the Network Measurement Center locatedat UCLA.  The "ARPANET" was to touch offan explosion of networking research that continues to the present.<p>Apart from exercising leadership by issuing its RFQ for a system that manythought was simply not feasible (AT&T was particularly pessimistic),ARPA also set a crucial tone by making the research entirelyunclassified and by engaging some of the most creative members ofthe computer science community who tackled this communication problemwithout the benefit of the experience (and hence bias) oftraditional telephony groups.  Even within the computerscience community, though, the technicalapproach was not uniformly well-received, and it isto ARPA's credit that it persevered despite much advice to the contrary.<p><b>ARPANET</b><p>The ARPANET grew from four nodes in 1969 to roughlyone hundred by 1975.  In the course of this growth, a crucial publicdemonstration was heldduring the first International Conference on Computer Communicationin October 1972.  Many skeptics were converted by witnessingthe responsiveness and robustness of the system.  Out ofthat pivotal meeting came anInternational Network Working Group (INWG) composed of researcherswho had begun to explore packet switching conceptsin earnest.  Several INWG participants went on todevelop an international standard for packet communicationknown as X.25, and to lead the development ofcommercial packet switching in the U.S., Canada, France, and the UK,specifically for systems such as Telenet, Datapac, Experimental PacketSwitching System,Transpac, and Reseau Communication par Paquet (RCP).<p>By mid-1975, ARPA had concluded that the ARPANET was stable andshould be turned over to a separate agency for operationalmanagement.  Responsibilitywas therefore transferred to the DefenseCommunications Agency (now known as the Defense InformationSystems Agency). <p><b>New Packet Technologies</b><p>ARPANET was a single terrestrial network.  Having seenthat ARPANET was not only feasible but powerfully useful, ARPAbegan a series of research programs intended to extend the utility ofpacket switching to ships at sea and ground mobile units through theuse of synchronous satellites (SATNET) and ground mobile packet radio(PRNET).  These programs were begun in 1973, as was a propheticeffort known as "Internetting" which was intended to solve the problemof linking different kinds of packet networks together without requiringthe users or their computers to know much about how packets moved fromone network to another. <p>Also in the early 1970s, ARPA provided follow-on fundingfor a research project originated in the late 1960s by theAir Force Office of Scientific Research to explore the useof radio for a packet switched network.  This effort, atthe University of Hawaii, led to new mobile packet radioideas and also to the design of the now-famousEthernet.  The Ethernet concept arose whena researcher from Xerox PARC spent a sabbaticalperiod at the University of Hawaii and had the insight thatthe random access radio system could be operated on a coaxial cable,but at data rates thousands of times faster than could thenbe supported over the air.  Ethernethas become a cornerstone of the multi-billiondollar local area network industry.<p>These efforts came together in1977 when a four-network demonstration was conductedlinking ARPANET, SATNET, Ethernet and the PRNET.  Thesatellite effort, inparticular, drew international involvement from participantsin the UK, Norway, and later Italy and Germany.<p><b>The Internet Protocols</b><p>A third ARPA effort of the early 1970s involved researchat Stanford to design a new set of computer communication protocolsthat would allow multiple packet networks to beinterconnected in a flexible anddynamic way.  In defense settings, circumstances oftenprevented detailed planning for communication systemdeployment, and a dynamic, packet-oriented, multiple-networkdesign provided the basis for a highly robust and flexiblenetwork to support command-and-control applications.<p>The first phase of this work culminated in a demonstrationin July 1977, the success of which led to a sustained effort toimplement robust versions of the basic Internet protocols(called TCP/IP for the two main protocols:  Transmission ControlProtocol and Internet Protocol).  The roles of ARPA and the DefenseCommunications Agency were critical both in supplying sustained fundingfor implementing the protocols on variouscomputers and operating systems and for thepersistent and determined application of the new protocolsto real needs.<p>By 1980, sufficient experience had been gainedthat the design of the protocolscould be frozen and a serious effortmounted to require all computers on the ARPANET toadopt TCP/IP.  This effort culminated in a switch tothe new protocols in January 1983.  ARPANET hadgraduated to production use, but it was still anevolving experimental testbed under the leadershipof ARPA and DCA.<p><b>ARPANET -> NSFNET -> Internet</b><p>As ARPA and DCA were preparing to convert the organizationsthey supported to TCP/IP, the National Science Foundationstarted an effort called CSNET (for Computer Science Network)to interconnect the nation's computer science departments, many ofwhich did not have access to ARPANET.  CSNET adoptedTCP/IP, but developed a dial-up "Phone-mail" capability forelectronic mail exchange among computers that were not onARPANET, and pioneeredthe use of TCP/IP over the X.25 protocol standardthat emerged from commercial packet switching efforts.  Thus,the beginning of the 1980s marked the expansion of U.S. governmentagency interest in networking, and bythe mid-1980s the Department ofEnergy and NASA also had becomeinvolved.<p>NSF's interest in high-bandwidth attachmentwas ignited in 1986 after the start of theSupercomputer Centers program.  NSF paved the wayto link researchers to the Centers through itssponsorship of NSFNET, which augmented ARPANETas a major network backbone and eventually replacedARPANET when ARPANET was retired in 1990.  Then-SenatorGore's 1986 legislation calling for theinterconnection of the Centers using fiberoptic technology ultimatelyled the administration to respond with the HighPerformance Computing and Communications (HPCC)Initiative.<p>Among the most critical decisions that NSF made was to supportthe creation of "regional" or "intermediate-level"networks that would aggregate demand from the nation's universitiesand feed it to the NSFNET backbone.  The backbone itselfwas initially implemented using gateways (systemsused to route traffic) developed at the University ofDelaware and links operating at the ARPANET speed of56K bps.  Because of rapidly increasing demand, though,NSF in 1988 selected MERIT (at the University of Michigan)to lead a cooperative agreement with MCI and IBM todevelop a 1.5M bps backbone.  IBM developed new routers and MCIsupplied 1.5M bps circuits,and NSFNET was reborn roughly 30 times faster than its predecessor.<p>The regional networks quicklybecame the primary means by which universities and other researchinstitutions linked to the NSFNET backbone.  NSFwisely advised these networks that their seed funding would have limitedduration and they would have to become self-sustaining.  Althoughthis took longer than originally expected, most of theregional networks (such as BARNET, SURANET, JVNCNET, CICNET,NYSERNET, and so on) now have eithergone into for-profit mode or have spun offfor-profit operations.<p>Because of continued increases in demand,NSF recently re-visited the cooperative agreementwith MCI, IBM and MERIT.  Anon-profit organization, Advanced Networksand Services (ANS), was born, and has satisfiedthe current demand for Internet capacity using45M bps circuits.  The name "Internet" refers to theglobal seamless interconnection of networks madepossible by the protocols devised in the 1970sthrough ARPA-sponsored research -- the Internetprotocols, still in use today.<p><b>A Commercial Market Emerges</b><p>By the mid-1980sthere was sufficient interest in the use of Internet in theresearch, educational, and defense communities that it waspossible to establish businesses making equipment for Internetimplementation.  Companies such as Cisco Systems,Proteon, and later Wellfleet (now Bay Networks)and 3Com became interestedin manufacturing and selling "routers," the commercialequivalents of the "gateways" that had beenbuilt by BBN in the early ARPANET experiments.  Ciscoalone is already a $1 billion business, and others seem headedrapidly toward that level.<p>The previous subsection noted the "privatization" ofthe NSF regional networks.  NYSERNET (the New York Stateregional network)was the first to spin out a for-profit company, Performance SystemsInternational, which now is one of the more successful Internet serviceproviders.  Other Internet providers actually began as independententities; one of these is UUNET, which started as a privatenon-profit but turned for-profit and began offeringan Internet service it calls ALTERNET; another isCERFNet, a for-profit operation initiatedby General Atomic in 1989; a third is NEARNet,started in the Boston area and recently absorbed into acluster of for-profitservices operated as BBN Planet (recall that BBN was the originaldeveloper of the ARPANET IMP; BBN also created theTelenet service, which it sold to GTE and which subsequentlybecame Sprintnet).<p>In 1988, in a conscious effort to test Federal policy on commercialuse of Internet, the Corporation for National Research Initiativesapproached the Federal Networking Council (actually its predecessor,the Federal Research Internet Coordinating Committee) for permission toexperiment with the interconnection of MCI Mail with the Internet.  Anexperimental electronicmail relay was built and put into operation in 1989, andshortly thereafter Compuserve, ATTMail and Sprintmail (Telemail) followedsuit.  Once again, a far-sighted experimental effort coupled witha wise policy choice stimulated investment by industry and expansion ofthe nation's infrastructure.  In the past year, commercial use ofthe Internet has exploded.<h3>The Roaring '90s:  Privatization, and the World Wide Web</h3>The Internet is experiencing exponential growth inthe number of networks, number of hosts, and volume of traffic.  NSFNETbackbone traffic more than doubled annually from aterabyte per month in March 1991 to eighteen terabytes a month in November1994.  (A terabyte is a thousandbillion bytes!)  The number of host computersincreased from 200 to 5,000,000in the 12 years between 1983 and 1995 -- a factor of 25,000!<p>As 1995 unfolds, many Internet service providers have gonepublic and others have merged or grown by acquisition.  Market valuationsof these companies are impressive.  America Onlinepurchased Advanced Networks and Services for $35 million.  Microsoftsupplied more than $20 million in capital to UUNET for expansion.  UUNETand PSI have gone public.  MCI has unveiled a major internationalInternet service, as well as an information and electroniccommerce service called marketplaceMCI.  AT&Tis expected to announce a major new service later inthe year.  Other major carriers such as British Telecom, FranceTelecom, Deutsche Telekom, Swedish Telecom, Norwegian Telecom, andFinnish Telecom, among many others,have announced Internet services.  An estimated 300 serviceproviders are in operation, ranging from very small resellers tolarge telecom carriers.<p>In an extraordinary development, the NSFNET backbone was retiredat the end of April 1995, withalmost no visible effects from the point of view of users (itwas <i>hard work</i> for the Internetservice providers!).  A fully commercial systemof backbones has been erected where a government sponsored system onceexisted.  Indeed, the key networks that made the Internet possible(ARPANET, SATNET, PRNET and NSFNET) are now gone -- butthe Internet thrives!<p>One of the major forces behind the exponential growth ofthe Internet is a variety of new capabilities in thenetwork -- particularly directory, indexing, and searchingservices that help users discover information in the vastsea of the Internet.  Many of these services have startedas university research efforts and evolved intobusinesses.  Examples include the Wide Area InformationService, Archie (which spawned a company called Bunyipin Canada), LYCOS from Carnegie Mellon, YAHOO fromStanford, and INFOSEEK.  Aiding and stimulating theseservices is the recent arrival of a "killer ap" for theInternet:  the World Wide Web.<p>Developed at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN),the World Wide Web was first used in experimental form in 1989.  Around1992 it came to the attention of a young programming teamat the National Center for SupercomputingApplications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois.  This teamdeveloped a graphical browser for the Web, calledMosaic.  In accordancewith NCSA policies, this software was made widely available onthe Internet for free.  Ittook the world by storm.  The excitement of being able to provideimages, sound, video clips and multifont text in a hypertext system wasirresistible.  Between 1992 and 1995 a number of commercial versions of Webbrowsers and servers emerged, among them Netscape Communications, whichwas founded by the former chairman of Silicon Graphics, Inc.,who instantly realized that the Web woulddramatically magnify the utility of the Internet by replacingits rather arcane interface withsomething anyone could do ("point and click").<p>Today (May 1995) there are over 30,000 Web sites on theInternet and the number is doubling every two months.  Companiesthat were formerly unsure about the utility of the Internethave rushed to use the Web as a means of presenting products andservices.  The rest of the1990s belongs to the content providers,who will use the rapidly evolvinginfrastructure to bring increasingly sophisticatedmaterial to consumers.<h3>The Future</h3>It's risky to predict the future of something asdynamic as the Internet.  It seems safe to say thatwe will see a continuing explosion of new services.  Today,at least a dozen companies are engaged in providing electronicfunds transfers on the Internet in support of electroniccommerce.  Other companies are exploringthe provision of packetized video, videoconferencing, packetizedvoice (packet telephone!), and increasingly sophisticated toolsfor securing Internet operation for intra- and inter-corporate use.<p>Projections of Internet-related business range to $50 billion atthe end of the decade.  While this is still small compared to thetotal telecommunications business (estimated at about $300billion today), its rapid growth and the rich evolution ofnew products and services suggest thatthe modest research investments of the federal government havepaid off in myriad ways, not all of them merelymonetary.  There is every reason to believe thatthe Internet will transform education, business, government,and personal activities in ways we cannot fully fathom.  Virtuallynone of this would have happened as rapidly, or in thesame open and inclusive fashion, had not the federalgovernment consciously provided sustained research funding andencouragement of open involvement and open standards, andthen wisely stepped out of the picture as theresulting systems became self-sustaining.<p>The Internet is truly a global infrastructure forthe 21st century -- the first really new infrastructureto develop in nearly a century.<p><hr><h3>The Author</h3><p>Dr. Vinton G.

<H3>DICING WITH DEATH </H3> 
  
<P>
By KAY DIBBEN Sunday Mail 11/6/95    
<P>
 Schoolchildren and adults are still dicing with death by running across railway lines In front of trains, seconds before they move off.    
<P>
 Frustrated Queensland Rail staff feel powerless to control the problem, which is happening at many of Brisbane's 140 suburban stations.    
<P>
 Last week The Sunday Mail photographed a young woman jumping from a platform at Grovely station on the Ferny Grove line directly In front of a stationary train, and running across the line.    
<P>
 She took the short cut without even going through ticket barriers. It is doubtful the train driver would have seen her because she jumped below the driver's field of vision.    
<P>
 At the same station, a few days earlier, a man dressed in shirt and tie, and carrying a briefcase, was seen running past boom gates and across the track In front of a train to get to a waiting car.    
<P>
 Near Mitchelton Station, at the Osborne Road road level crossing last week. schoolchildren dawdled across the line after the boom gates were down, and    
<P>
 In March last year, The Sunday Mall photographed children ignoring a foot bridge and running cross a    
<P>
 line in front of a train at Burpengary station.    
<P>
 Five months later, another Sunday Mall investigation revealed the problem was still prevalent with schoolchildren, particularly, ignoring warning at Burpengary and other stations    
<P>
 "They're dicing with death. They're taking their own lives In their own hands." City Train general manager, Mr Chris Warnock, said.    
<P>
 "When they run across a line on a double track they can't even see If another train Is coming."    
<P>
 Mr.Warnock said on-the-   spot fine of up to $120 could be imposed by ticket Inspectors under state legislation. 


<P>
<HR><H3>THE JOLLY ROGER COOKBOOK</H3> Sunday Mail 11/6/95    
<P>
 A FORMULA detailing now to make Oklahoma-style bombs from household products is being passed around Brisbane schoolyards on computer discs.    
<P>
 The how-to-do-it recipe for terrorism was obtained over the telephone from the worldwide Internet computer system.    
<P>
 Several students at one Brisbane school were caught last week with computer discs containing a file called the Jolly Roger Cookbook, detailing 170 ways to make bombs and narcotics and start a life of crime    
<P>
 The instructions on making a fertiliser bomb (similar to the Oklahoma device which killed 167 people on April 19) say: "Run like you have never run before this blows up 500 square feet so don't do it in an alley!!"    
<P>
 Students also were found with hard core pornographic video clips taken from the Internet    
<P>
 Australian Federal Police said they could do little about the "cookbook" unless it could be proved that it was being used to incite people to break the law.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Computer porn hard to police </H2>
<P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>By PAUL CONROY Conroy, Paul<br> 
 The Age: Monday, 18 July 1994</H4>
 

Obscene and offensive computer pornography should be regulated so that teenagers can no longer gain access to it using home computers, according to a Federal Government taskforce.  
<P>
A spokesman for the federal Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, said yesterday that the problem of computer pornography would be discussed at a meeting of state and federal attorneys-general in Brisbane this week.  
<P>
The spokesman said tougher sanctions would require the cooperation of state governments. He said a voluntary code of practice might be introduced to encourage computer users to report and remove obscene computer images from bulletin boards.  
<P>
The taskforce has recommended an amendment to the Commonwealth Crimes Act that would ban the transmission of offensive material on computers. Offensive material would include sexually explicit images that did not meet the classification standards of the Office of Film and Literature Classification.  
<P>
The taskforce, due to complete its report soon, has included police, representatives from Mr Lavarchs office and the Department of Communications, and the classification office.  
<P>
Computer experts and police yesterday predicted that laws to restrict computer pornography on bulletin boards would fail because the use of computers could not be monitored.  
<P>
It will just drive it underground, a computer expert said.  
<P>
A home computer user can dial an access telephone number - obtained from other users or computer magazine advertisements - and be connected to a computer bulletin board through a modem. Pictures, animations, videos or explicit stories can then be copied or downloaded, and messages sent and received.  
<P>
Computer users, including teenagers, have been able to gain access to hard-core pornography - including sado-masochism, child-sex pornography and bestiality - on home computers, using fake identification or by hacking into telephone subscriber services.  
<P>
Pornographers and paedophiles have also used computer bulletin boards to bypass laws that restrict the sale and promotion of pornography publications. Computer images, deemed unsuitable for children as magazines, are available on global networks such as the Internet.  
<P>
Senior Sergeant Chris OConnor, of the Victoria Police child- exploitation unit, said police were aware of the growing trend in computer pornography and federal laws might be useful.  
<P>
An 18-year-old youth appeared in Perth Childrens Court earlier this month charged with attempting to procure child pornography by using a computer. It was the first time in Western Australia that anyone was charged with child pornography via computers.  
<P>
The associate director of the RMIT-based Australian Computer Abuse Research Bureau, Mr Vic Kamay, said hard-core pornography was accessible through the Internet, which reached millions of people and was difficult to regulate.  
<P>
It is an old crime that had found a new expression through information technology, he said.  
<P>
A former president of the Law Institute of Victoria and a computer law expert, Dr Gordon Hughes, said the law had not kept pace with changes in technology.  
<P>
But it is one thing to have regulation in place and another to enforce it. Policing may be next to impossible, he said.  
<P>
The chief censor, Mr John Dickie, said there was no legislation that covered the use of bulletin boards, and that there would be enormous problems in enforcing the proposed legislation.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Responsibility for censorship</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Prodigy's defence of on-line family values lands it in court</H2> 
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Australian 7 June 1995</H3>

By a correspondent in New York 
<P>
FOR Prodigy Services, it seems, no good deed goes unpunished. 
<P>
The Sears Roebuck-IBM joint venture has long staked out a position as the family oriented on-line service where computers and humans try to strip obscene and offensive messages from its network. 
<P>
That policy returned to haunt White Plains, New York-based Prodigy late last month, when a New York State Court judge found the company exercised editorial control and therefore must defend itself against a $300 million libel suit by Stratton Oakmont over comments posted by a Prodigy subscriber on a bulletin board. 
<P>
Industry experts claimed services such as America Online and CompuServe could find themselves in a similar pickle because a pending Bill in the United States Senate would require them to exercise "good faith and ,reasonable efforts" to filter obscene and objectionable material from the thousands of messages coursing through their networks every day. 
<P>
Should this lawsuit continue, many services would be reluctant to provide discussion groups or would monitor speech so closely that subscribers would be reluctant to use those services," the assistant vice-president of government relations at the Information Industry Association, Mr Dan Duncan. said. 
<P>
The association is a trade group that includes Prodigy and America online. 
<P>
If this case comes down against 'Prodigy, I would expect on-line service providers to seek legislation to exempt hem from such liability," he said. Not everyone is as concerned. 
<P>
A Los Angeles lawyer and expert on electronic libel, Mr Rex Heinke, said that although Stratton Oakmont prevailed in a State court, Prodigy might win on appeal. 
<P>
"Although it's an important ruling, because there's virtually no law here, it's just a trial-court decision," he said. 
<P>
"If Prodigy lost it could probably defend itself by citing Supreme Court rulings that could force Stratton Oakmont to prove Prodigy knew what it was publishing was false. 
<P>
"That might well be an impossible task, because Prodigy prints more than 60,000 messages a day and couldn't possibly read each one to determine whether it was true or false.  "If you get something that says 'Joe Blow is a bank robber', what do you do? 'If it's true, you're safe, but if it's false, it's defamatory. "So do you go to the courthouse in Texas to find out? No way." 
<P>
Stratton Oakmont argued that Prodigy set itself up for a libel suit because that was, in fact, its policy. 
<P>
Burned by criticism over anti Semitic messages in 1991, Prodigy imposed one of the industry's strictest monitoring systems, with editors reading each message before allowing it on the network. 
<P>
Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy last November after a subscriber accused it of fraud on Prodigy's Money Talks discussion group. 
<P>
Prodigy pays an independent contractor, Mr Charles Epstein, to run the discussion group. He has authority to remove messages from the system. 
<P>
"Part of his job  and Prodigy requires him to do thisis to make sure nothing violates Prodigy's content guidelines," Stratton Oakmont's attorney, Mr Jacob Zamansky, said. 
<P>
Prodigy argues that it abandoned its monitoring program in 1992 after the volume of messages became too great. 
<P>
A Prodigy spokesman, Mr Brian Ek, said the service now could only run the messages through a computer to check for obvious obscenities. 
<P>
Subscribers who were offended by a specific message were expected to call a moderator to have it removed  And in this case that didn't happen". 
<P>
Mr Zamansky said he called several people at Prodigy in an unsuccessful attempt to have the message removed. 
<P>
The New York ruling could affect other on-line services, which also employ freelance moderators to monitor discussion groups. 
<P>
They tried to distance themselves from Prodigy last week, saying they did not screen content. 
<P>
'CompuServe merely acts as a conduit for information," said Ms Daphne Kent, a spokeswoman for CompuServe. a unit of Kansas City, Missouri based H & R Block. "We don't censor." 
<P>
CompuServe paid people to moderate its discussion groups.
"But they're autonomous and run those forums as they see fit". 
<P>
CompuServe won a key ruling in 1991 when a federal court in New York determined it was more like a bookstore or a newsstand than a publisher and thus was not responsible for the information it carried. Other court cases have not been so clear-cut. 
<P>
Rather than fight the case through the courts, computer columnist Peter Brock last year settled a libel suit by Suarez Industries over comments he made on the Internet. 
<P>
Electronic media experts said online services would be in a particularly tight bind if the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by Nebraska Democrat Senator James Exon, was passed as part of telecommunications deregulation next month. 
<P>
That law would impose a $US150,000 ($210,000) fine on anyone transmitting obscene materials on an electronic network. 
<P>
While on-line services managed to insert language that prevents them being found liable for the information they transmit, many believe the law also would require services to monitor their networks. 
<P>
If the reasoning of New York State Judge Stuart Ain holds, the on-line services would be liable again. 
<P>
"Our hope is that we can find solutions that allow a service provider to act responsibly but still be able to have a certain amount of leeway and not be held liable for anyone who wants to put anything on a network," Mr Duncan said. 
<P>
Others say the very concept of controlling the sprawling information highway is unworkable. 
<P>
"Everybody's so over-extended that to have to hire a ratings board would have a chilling effect on the industry," an analyst with Arlen Communications, Mr Peter Krasilovsky, said. "I don't think it's going to happen".

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>DATA RAPE<br>A TALE OF TORTURE & TERRORISM ON-LINE </H2>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>
By JULIAN DIBBELL Source: First published in the Village Voice.<br>The Good Weekend 19 February 1994</H4>
<HR>
A VIRTUAL REALITY VIOLATION CAUSES REAL-LIFE OUTRAGE AND FORCES AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN CYBERSPACE. 
<HR>
 
Call me Dr Bombay. Some months ago - lets say about halfway between the first time you heard the words information superhighway and the first time you wished you never had - I found myself tripping with compulsive regularity down the well-travelled information lane that leads to LambdaMOO, a very large and very busy rustic chateau built entirely of words. Nightly, I typed the commands that called those words on to my computer screen, dropping me with what seemed a warm, electric thud inside the mansions darkened coat closet, where I checked my quotidian identity, stepped into the persona and appearance of a minor character from a long-gone television sitcom, and stepped out into the glaring chatter of the crowded living room. Sometimes, when the mood struck me, I emerged as a dolphin instead. 
<P>
I wont say why I chose to masquerade as Samanthas cousin from Bewitched, or as the dolphin, or what exactly led to my mild but so-far incurable addiction to the semi-fictional digital otherworlds known around the Internet as multi-user dimensions, or MUDs. This isnt my story, after all. 
<P>
Its the story of a man named Mr Bungle, and of the ghostly sexual violence he committed in the halls of LambdaMOO, and most importantly of the ways his violence and his victims challenged the 1,500 and more residents of that surreal, magic-infested mansion to become, finally, the community so many of them already believed they were. 
<P>
The Bungle Affair raises questions that - here on the brink of a future in which human life may find itself as tightly enveloped in digital environments as it is today in the architectural kind - demand a clear-eyed, sober and unmystified consideration. It asks us to shut our ears momentarily to the techno-utopian ecstasies of cyber-hippies and look without illusion upon the present possibilities for building, in the on-line spaces of this world, societies more decent and free than those mapped on to dirt and concrete and capital. 
<P>
It asks us to behold the new bodies awaiting us in virtual space undazzled by their phantom powers, and to get to the crucial work of sorting out the socially meaningful differences between those bodies and our physical ones. And most forthrightly, it asks us to wrap our late-modern ontologies, epistemologies, sexual ethics and commonsense around the curious notion of rape by voodoo doll - and to try not to warp them beyond recognition in the process. 
<P>
The facts begin (as the often do) with a time a place. The time was a Monday night in March, and the place was the living room - which, due to the inviting warmth of its decor, is so invariably packed with chitchatters as to be roughly synonymous among LanbdaMOOers with a party. So strong, indeed, is the sense of convivial common ground invested in the living room that a cruel mind could hardly imagine a better place in which to stage a violaton of LambdaMOOs communal spirit. 
<P>
And there was cruelty enough lurking in the appearance Mr Bungle presented to the virtual world at the time - he was a fat, oleaginous, biscuit-faced clown dressed in semen-stained harlequin garb and girdled with a mistletoe-and-hemlock belt whose buckle bore the inscription, Kiss me under this, bitch ! But whether cruelty motivated his choice of crime scene is not among the established facts of the case. It is a fact only that he did choose the living room. 
<P>
The remaining facts tell us a bit more about the inner world of Mr Bungle, though only perhaps that it couldnt have been a very comfortable place. They tell us that he commenced his assault entirely unprovoked, at or about 10 pm Pacific Standard Time. That he began by using his voodoo doll to force one of the rooms occupants to service him sexually in a variety of more or less conventional ways. 
<P>
That this victim was legba, a Haitian trickster spirit of indeterminate gender, brown-skinned and wearing an expensive pearl-grey suit, top hat and dark glasses. That legba heaped vicious imprecations of him all the while and that he was soom ejected bodily from the room. That he hid himself away then in his private chambers somewhere on the mansion ground and continued that attacks without interruption, since the voodoo doll worked just as well at a distance as in proximity. 
<P>
That he turned his attention now to Starsinger, a rather nondescript female character, tall, stout and brown-haired, forcing her into unwanted liaisons with other individuals present in the room, among them legba, Bakunin (the well-known radical) and Juniper (the squirrel). 
<P>
That his actions grew progressively violent. That he made legba eat his/her own pubic hair. That he caused Starsinger to violate herself with a piece of kitchen cutlery. That his distant laughter echoed evilly in the living room with every successive outrage. That he could not be stopped until at last someone summoned Zippy, a wise old-timer who brought with him a gun of near-wizardly powers, a gun that didnt kill but enveloped its targets in a cage impermeable even to a voodoo dolls powers. That Zippy fired this gun at Mr Bungle, silencing the evil, distant laughter. 
<P>
These particulars are unambiguous. But they are far from simple, for the simple reason that every set of facts in virtual reality (or VR, as the locals abbreviate it) is shadowed by a second, complicating set: the real-life facts. And while a certain tension invariably buzzes in the gap between the hard, prosaic RL facts and their more fluid, dreamy VR counterparts, the dissonance in the Bungle case is striking. 
<P>
No hideous clowns or trickster spirits appear in the RL version of the incident, no voodoo dolls or wizard guns, indeed no rape at all as any RL court of law has yet defined it. The actors in the drama were university students for the most part, and they sat undramatically before computer screens the entire time, their only actions a spidery flitting of fingers across standard QWERTY keyboards. No bodies touched. Whatever physical interaction occurred consisted of a mingling of electronic signals sent from sites spread out between New York City and Sydney. 
<P>
Those signals met in LambdaMOO, certainly, just as the hideous clown and the living room party did, but what was LambdaMOO after all? Not an enchanted mansion or anything of the sort - just a middlingly complex database, maintained for experimental purpose inside a Xerox Corporation research computer in Palo Alto and open to public access via the Internet. 
<P>
To be more precise about it, LambdaMOO was a MUD (Multi-User Dimension). To be yet more precise, it was a subspecies of MUD known as a MOO, which is short for MUD, Object-Oriented. All of which means it was a kind of database designed to give users the vivid impression of moving through a physical space that in reality exists only as descriptive data filed away on a hard drive. 
<P>
When users dial into LambdaMOO, for instance, the program presents them with a brief textual description of one of the rooms of the databases fictional mansion (the coat room, say). If the user wants to leave this room, she can enter a command to move in a particular direction and the database will replace the original description with a new one corresponding to the room located in the direction she has chosen. When the new description scrolls across the users screen it lists not only fixed features of the room but its contents at that moment - including things (tools, toys, weapons) and other users (each represented as a character over which he or she has sole control). 
<P>
As far as the database program is concerned, all of these entities - rooms, things, characters - are just different subprograms that the program allows to interact according to rules very roughly mimicking the laws of the physical world 
<P>
Characters may not leave a room in a given direction, for instance, unless the room subprogram contains an exit at that compass point. And if a character says or does something (as directed by its user-owner), then only the users whose characters are also located in that room will see the output describing the statement or action. 
<P>
Aside from such basic constraints, however, LambdaMOOers are allowed a broad freedom to create: they can describe their characters any way they like, make rooms of their own and decorate them to taste, and build new objects almost at will. The combination of all this user activity with the hard physics of the database can certainly induce a lucid illusion of presence - but the only thing you really see when you visit LambdaMOO is a kind of slow-crawling script, lines of dialogue and stage direction creeping steadily up your computer screen. 
<P>
WHICH IS all just to say that, to the extent that Mr Bungles assault happened in real life at all, it happened as a sort of Punch and Judy show, in which the puppets and the scenery were made of nothing more substantial than digital code and snippets of creative writing. The puppeteer behind Bungle, as it happened, was a young man logging into the MOO from a New York University computer. 
<P>
He could have written Bungles script that night any way he chose. He could have sent a command to print the message, Mr Bungle, smiling a saintly smile, floats angelic near the ceiling of the living room, showering joy and kisses upon the heads of all below - and everyone then receiving output from the databases subprogram #17 (a/k/a the living room") would have seen that sentence on their screens. 
<P>
Instead, he entered sadistic fantasies into the voodoo doll, a subprogram that served the not-exactly kosher purpose of attributing actions to other characters that their users did not actually write. And thus a woman in Haverford, Pennsylvania, whose account on the MOO attached her to a character she called Starsinger, was given the unasked-for opportunity to read the words, As if against her will, Starsinger jabs a steak knife up her ass, causing immense joy. You hear 
<P>
Mr Bungle laughing evilly in the distance. 
<P>
And thus the woman in Seattle who had written herself the character called legba, with a view perhaps to tasting in imagination a deitys freedom from the burdens of the gendered flesh, got to read similarly constructed sentences in which legba, messenger of the gods, lord of crossroads and communications, suffered a brand of degradation all-too-customarily reserved for the embodied female. 
<P>
Mostly voodoo dolls are amusing, wrote legba on the evening after Bungles rampage, posting a public statement to the widely read in-MOO mailing list called * social-issues, a forum for debate on matters of import to the entire populace. And mostly I tend to think that restrictive measures around here cause more trouble than they prevent. But I also think that Mr Bungle was being a vicious, vile f...head, and I want his sorry ass scattered from #17 to the Cinder Pile. Im not calling for policies, trials, or better jails. Im not sure what Im calling for. Virtual castration, if I could manage it. Mostly, (this type of thing) doesnt happen here. Mostly, perhaps, I thought it wouldnt happen to me. Mostly, I trust people to conduct themselves with some veneer of civility. Mostly, I want his ass. 
<P>
Months later, the woman in Seattle would confide to me that as she wrote those words, post-traumatic tears were streaming down her face - a real-life fact that should suffice to prove that the words emotional content was no mere play-acting. The precise tenor of that content, however, its mingling of murderous rage and eyeball-rolling annoyance, was a curious amalgam that neither the RL nor the VR facts alone can quite account for. 
<P>
Where virtual reality and its conventions would have us believe legba and Starsinger were brutally raped in their own living room, here was the victim legba scolding Mr Bungle for a breach of civility. Where real life, on the other hand, insists the incident was only an episode in a free-form version of Dungeons and Dragons, confined to the realm of the symbolic and at no point threatening any players life, limb or material wellbeing, here now was the player legba issuing aggrieved and heartfelt calls for Mr Bungles dismemberment. 
<P>
Ludicrously excessive by RLs lights, woefully understated by VRs, the tone of legbas response made sense only in the buzzing, dissonant gap between them. 
<P>
Which is to say it made the only kind of sense that can be made of MUDly phenomena. For while the facts attached to any event born of a MUDs strange, ethereal universe may march in straight, tandem lines separated neatly into the virtual and the real, its meaning lies always in that gap. You learn this axiom early in your life as a player, and its of no small relevance to the Bungle case that you usually learn it between the sheets, so to speak. 
<P>
Netsex, tinysex, virtual sex - however you name it, in real-life reality its nothing more than a 900-line encounter stripped of the physicality even of the voice. And yet, as any but the most inhibited of newbies can tell you, its possibly the headiest experience the heady world of MUDs has to offer. Amid flurries of even the most cursorily described caresses, sighs and penetrations, the glands do engage, and often as throbbingly as they would in a real-life assignation - sometimes more so, given the combined power of anonymity and textual suggestiveness to unshackle deep-seated fantasies. And if the virtual setting and the interplayer vibes are right, who knows? The heart may engage as well, stirring up passions as strong as many that bind lovers who observe the formality of trysting in the flesh. 
<P>
To participate, therefore, in this disembodied enactment of lifes most body-centred activity is to risk the realisation that when it comes to sex, perhaps the body in question is not the physical one at all, but its psychic double, the body-like self-representation we carry around in our heads. I know, I know, youve read Foucault and your mind is not quite blown by the notion that sex is never so much an exchange of fluids as it is an exchange of signs. 
<P>
But trust your friend Dr Bombay; its one thing to grasp the notion intellectually and quite another to feel it coursing through your veins amid the virtual steam of hot net-nookie. And its a whole other mind-blowing trip to encounter it new to the net and still in the grip of hormonal hurricanes and high-school sexual mythologies. The shock can easily reverberate throughout an entire young world view. 
<P>
Small wonder, then, that a newbies first taste of MUD sex is often also the first time she or he surrenders wholly to the slippery terms of MUDish ontology, recognising in a full-bodied way that what happens inside a MUD-made world is neither exactly real nor exactly make-believe, but profoundly, compellingly, and emotionally meaningful. 
<P>
And small wonder indeed that the sexual nature of Mr Bungles crime provoked such powerful feelings, and not just in legba (who, be it noted, was in real life a theory-savvy doctoral candidate and a longtime MOOer, but just as baffled and overwhelmed by the force of her own reaction, she later would attest, as any panting undergrad might have been). Even players who had never experienced MUD rape immediately appreciated its gravity and were moved to condemnation of the perpetrator. 
<P>
Legbas missive to * social-issues followed a strongly worded one from Zippy (Well, well, it began, no matter what else happens on Lambda, I can always be sure some jerk is going to reinforce my low opinion of humanity") and others from Moriah, Raccoon, Crawfish and evangeline. Starsinger also let her feelings be known. Even Jander, the clueless Samaritan who had responded to Bungles cries for help and uncaged him shortly after the incident, expressed his regret once apprised of Bungles deeds, which he allowed to be despicable. 
<P>
A sense was brewing that something needed to be done about Mr Bungle, in particular, and about MUD rape, in general. Regarding the general problem, evangeline, who identified herself as a survivor of both virtual rape and real-life sexual assault, floated a cautious proposal for a MOO-wide powwow on the subject of virtual sex offences and what mechanisms if any might be put in place to deal with their future occurrence. As for the specific problem, the answer no doubt seemed obvious to many. But it wasnt until the evening of the second day after the incident that legba gave it voice: 
<P>
I am requesting that Mr Bungle be toaded for raping Starsinger and I. I have never done this before, and have thought about it for days. He hurt us both. 
<P>
That was all. Three simple sentences posted to * social. Reading them, an outsider might never guess they were an application for a death warrant. Even an outsider familiar with other MUDs might not guess it, since in many of them, toading still refers to a command that, true to MUDdings origins in the world of sword-and-sorcery role-playing games, simply turns a player into a toad, wiping the players description and attributes and replacing them with those of the slimy amphibian. Bad luck for sure, but not as bad as what happens when the same command is invoked in the MOOish strains of MUD: not only are the description and attributes of the toaded player erased, but the account itself goes too. The annihilation of the character, thus, is total. 
<P>
And nothing less than total annihilation, it seemed, would do to settle LambdaMOOs accounts with Mr Bungle. Within minutes of the posting of legbas appeal, SamIAm, the Australian who had witnessed much of the attack from the back room of his suburban Sydney home, seconded the motion with a brief message crisply entitled Toad the f...er. SamIAms posting was seconded almost as quickly by that of Bakunin, co-victim of Mr Bungle and well-known radical, who in real life happened also to be married to the real-life legba. And over the course of the next 24 hours as many as 50 players made it known, on * social and in a variety of other forms and forums, that they would be pleased to see Mr Bungle erased from the face of the MOO. With dissent so far confined to a dozen or so anti-toading hardliners, the numbers suggested the citizenry was indeed moving towards a resolve to have Bungles virtual head. 
<P>
There was one small but stubborn obstacle in the way of this resolve, however, and that was a curious state of social affairs known as the New Direction. It was all very fine, you see, for the LambdaMOO rabble to get it in their heads to liquidate one of their peers, but when the time came to do the deed it would require the services of a nobler class of character. It would require a wizard. Master-programmers of the MOO, explorers of the databa ses deepest code-structures and custodians of its day-to-day administrative trivia, wizards are also the only players empowered to issue the toad command, a feature maintained on nearly all MUDs as a quick-and-dirty means of social control. 
<P>
But the wizards of LambdaMOO, after years of adjudicating all manner of interplayer disputes with little to show for it but their own weariness and the smouldering resentment of the general populace, had decided theyd had enough of the social sphere. And so, four months before the Bungle incident, the archwizard Haakon (known in RL as Pavel Curtis, Xerox researcher and LambdaMOOs principal architect) formalised this decision in a document called LambdaMOO Takes a New Direction, which was placed in the living room for all to see. 
<P>
In it, Haakon announced that the wizards from that day forth were pure technicians. From then on, they would make no decisions affecting the social life of the MOO, but only implement whatever decisions the community as a whole directed them to. From then on, it was decreed, LambdaMOO would just have to grow up and solve its problems on its own. 
<P>
Faced with the task of inventing its own self-governance from scratch, the LambdaMOO population had so far done what any other loose, amorphous agglomeration of individuals would have done: theyd let it slide. But now the task took on new urgency. Since getting the wizards to toad Mr Bungle (or to toad the likes of him in the future) required a convincing case that the cry for his head came from the community at large, then the community itself would have to be defined; and if the community was to be convincingly defined, then some form of social organisation, no matter how rudimentary, would have to be settled on. And thus, as if against its will, the question of what to do about Mr Bungle began to shape itself into a sort of referendum on the political future of the MOO. 
<P>
Arguments broke out on * social and elsewhere that had only superficially to do with Bungle (since everyone agreed he was a cad) and everything to do with where the participants stood on LambdaMOOs crazy-quilt political map. Parliamentarian legalist types argued that Bungle could not legitimately be toaded at all, since there were no explicit MOO rules against rape, or against just about anything else - and the sooner such rules were established, they added, and maybe even a full-blown judiciary system complete with elected officials and prisons to enforce those rules, the better. Others with a royalist streak seemed to feel that Bungles as-yet-unpunished outrage only proved this New Direction silliness had gone on long enough, and that it was high time the wizardocracy returned to the position of leadership their player class was born to. 
<P>
And then there were what Ill call the technolibertarians. For them, MUD rapists were of course assholes, but the presence of assholes on the system was a technical inevitability, like noise on a phone line, and best dealt with not through repressive social disciplinary mechanisms but through the timely deployment of defensive software tools. Some asshole blasting violent, graphic language at you? Dont whine to the authorities about it - hit the @gag command and the assholes statements will be blocked from your screen (and only yours). Its simple, its effective, and it censors no one. 
<P>
But the Bungle case was rather hard on such arguments. For one thing, the public nature of the living room meant gagging would spare the victims only from witnessing their own violation, but not from having others witness it. You might want to argue that what those victims didnt directly experience couldnt hurt them, but consider how that would sound to a woman whod been, say, fondled by strangers while passed-out drunk and you have a rough idea how it might go over with a crowd of MOOers. Consider, for another thing, that many of the biologically female participants in the debate had been around long enough to grow lethally weary of the gag-and-get-over-it school of virtual-rape counselling, with its fine line between empowering victims and holding them responsible for their own suffering, and its shrugging indifference to the window of pain between the moment the rape-text starts flowing and the moment a gag shuts it off. It was clear the technolibertarians were going to have to tiptoe through this issue with care, and for the most part they did. 
<P>
Yet no position was trickier to maintain than that of the MOOs resident anarchists. Like the technolibbers, the anarchists didnt much care for punishments or policies or power elites. Like them, they hoped the MOO could be a place where people interacted fulfillingly without the need for such things. But their high hopes were complicated, in general, by a less thoroughgoing faith in technology, and in this case, by the fact that the most vocal anarchists in the discussion were none other than legba, Bakunin, and SamIAm, who wanted to see Mr Bungle toaded as badly as anyone did. 
<P>
A PRO-DEATH penalty platform is not an especially comfortable one for an anarchist to sit on, so these particular anarchists were now at great pains to sever the conceptual ties between toading and capital punishment. Toading, they insisted, was much more closely analogous to banishment; it was a kind of turning of the communal back on the offending party, a collective action that, if carried out properly, was entirely consistent with anarchist models of community. And carrying it out properly meant first and foremost building a consensus around it - a messy process for which there were no easy technocratic substitutes. It was going to take plenty of good old-fashioned, jawbone-intensive grassroots organising. 
<P>
So that when the time came, at 7 pm on the evening of the third day after the occurrence in the living room, to gather in evangelines room for her proposed real-time open conclave, Bakunin and legba were among the first to arrive. But this was hardly to be an anarchist-dominated affair, for the room was crowding rapidly with representatives of all the MOOs political stripes, and even a few wizards. Hagbard showed up, and Autumn and Quastro, Puff, JoeFeedback, L-dopa and Bloaf, HerkieCosmo, Silver Rocket, Karl Porcupine, Matchstick - the names piled up and the discussion gathered momentum under their weight. Arguments multiplied and mingled, players talked past and through each other, the textual clutter of utterances and gestures filled up the screen like thick cigar smoke. 
<P>
Peaking in number at around 30, this was one of the largest crowds gathered in a single LambdaMOO chamber. You could almost feel the claustrophobic air of the place, dank and overheated by virtual bodies, pressing against your skin. 
<P>
The discussion that raged around me was of an almost unrelieved earnestness, bent, it seemed, on examining every aspect and implication of Mr Bungles crime. There were the central questions: thumbs up or thumbs down on Bungles virtual existence? And if down, how then to ensure that his toading was not just some isolated lynching but a first step towards shaping LambdaMOO into a legitimate community? Surrounding these, however, a tangle of weighty side-issues proliferated. 
<P>
What, some wondered, was the real-life legal status of the offence? Could Bungles university administrators punish him for sexual harassment? Could he be prosecuted under California State laws against obscene phone calls? Many were the casual references to Bungles deed as rape, but these in no way implied that the players had lost sight of distinctions between the virtual and physical versions, or that they believed Bungle should be dealt with in the same way a real-life criminal would. He had committed a MOO crime, and his punishment, if any, would be meted out via the MOO. 
<P>
But little patience was shown with any attempts to downplay the seriousness of what Mr Bungle had done. When the affable HerkieCosmo proposed, more in the way of a hypothesis than an assertion, that perhaps its better to release ... violent tendencies in a virtual environment rather than in real life, he was tut-tutted so swiftly and relentlessly that he withdrew the hypothesis altogether, apologising humbly as he did so. Not that the assembly was averse to putting matters into a more philosophical perspective. Where does the body end and the mind begin? young Quastro asked, amid recurring attempts to fine-tune the differences between real and virtual violence. Is not the mind a part of the body? 
<P>
On all these and other matters the anarchists, the libertarians, the legalists, the wizardists - and the wizards - had their thoughtful say. But as the evening wore on and the talk grew more heated and heady, it seemed increasingly clear the vigorous intelligence being brought to bear on this swarm of issues wasnt going to result in anything like resolution. 
<P>
It was almost a relief, therefore, when midway through the evening Mr Bungle himself teleported into the room. Not that it was much of a surprise. Oddly enough, in the three days since his release from Zippys cage, Bungle had returned more than once to LambdaMOO, walking willingly into one of the fiercest storms of ill will and invective ever to rain down on a player. Hed been taking it all with a curious passivity, and when challenged face to virtual face by both legba and the genderless elder statescharacter PatGently to defend himself on * social, hed demurred, mumbling something about Christ and expiation. He was equally quiet now, and his reception was still uniformly cool, but the harshest of the MOOs hostility towards him had been vented, and the attention he drew now was motivated more by the opportunity to probe the rapists mind, to find out what made it tick and if possible, how to get it to tick differently. In short, they wanted to know why hed done it. So they asked him. 
<P>
Mr Bungle thought about it, and then he said this: I engaged in a bit of a psychological device that is called thought-polarisation; the fact that this is not RL simply added to heighten the effect of the device. It was purely a sequence of events with no consequence on my RL existence. 
<P>
They might have known. Stilted though its diction was, the gist of the answer was simple: Mr Bungle was a psycho. Not, perhaps, in real life - but then in real life its possible for reasonable people to assume, as Bungle clearly did, that what transpires between word-costumed characters within the boundaries of a make-believe world is, if not mere play, then at most some kind of emotional laboratory experiment. 
<P>
Inside the MOO, however, such thinking marked a person as one of two basically sub-competent types. The first was the newbie, in which case the confusion was understandable, since there were few MOOers who had not, upon their first visits as anonymous guest characters, mistaken the place for a vast playpen in which they might act out their wildest fantasies without fear of censure. Only with time and the acquisition of a fixed character do players tend to make the critical passage from anonymity to pseudonymity, developing the concern for their characters reputation that marks the attainment of virtual adulthood. But while Mr Bungle hadnt been around as long as most MOOers, hed been around long enough to leave his newbie status behind, and his delusional statement therefore placed him among the second type: the sociopath. 
<P>
And as there is but small gain in arguing with a head case, the rooms attention gradually abandoned Mr Bungle and returned to the discussions that had previously occupied it. But if the debate had been edging toward ineffectuality before, Bungles anticlimactic appearance had evidently robbed it of any forward motion. Whats more, from his lonely corner of the room Mr Bungle kept issuing periodic expressions of a prickly sort of remorse, interlaced with sarcasm and belligerence, and though it was hard to tell if he wasnt just still conducting his experiments, some thought his regret genuine enough that maybe he didnt deserve to be toaded after all. 
<P>
People started drifting away. Mr Bungle left first, then others followed. By 9.45 pm only a handful remained, and the great debate had wound down into casual conversation, the melancholy remains of another fruitless good idea. Evangelines meeting had died, at last, and without any practical results to mark its passing. 
<P>
It was at this point, most likely, that JoeFeedback reached his decision. JoeFeedback was a wizard, a taciturn sort of fellow whod sat brooding on the sidelines all evening. He hadnt said a lot, but what he had said indicated that he took the crime committed against legba and Starsinger very seriously, and felt no particular compassion towards the character who had committed it. But on the other hand he had made it equally plain that he took the elimination of a fellow player just as seriously, and moreover that he had no desire to return to the days of wizardly fiat. It must have been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the conflicting impulses within him at that moment. For as much as he would have liked to make himself an instrument of LambdaMOOs collective will, he surely realised that under the present order of things he must in the final analysis act alone or not act at all. 
<P>
So JoeFeedback acted alone. He told the few lingering players in the room that he had to go, and then he went. It was a minute or two before 10. He did it quietly and privately, but all anyone had to do to know hed done it was to type the @who command, which was normally what you typed if you wanted to know a players present location and the time he last logged in. But if you had run @who on Mr Bungle not too long after JoeFeedback left evangelines room, the database would have told you something different. 
<P>
Mr Bungle, it would have said, is not the name of any player. 
<P>
The date, as it happened, was April Fools Day, and it would still be April Fools Day for another two hours. But this was no joke: Mr Bungle was truly dead and truly gone. 
<P>
They say LambdaMOO has never been the same since Mr Bungles toading. They also say that nothing has really changed. And even though it skirts the fuzziest of dream-logics to say that both these statements are true, the MOO is just the sort of fuzzy, dreamlike place in which such contradictions thrive. 
<P>
Certainly whatever civil society now informs LambdaMOO owes its existence to the Bungle Affair. The archwizard Haakon made sure of that. Away on business for the duration of the episode, Haakon returned to find its wreckage strewn across the tiny universe hed set in motion. For the better part of a day he brooded over the record of events and arguments left in * social, then he sat pondering the chaotically evolving shape of his creation, and at the days end he descended once again into the social arena of the MOO with another history-altering proclamation. 
<P>
It was probably his last, for what he now decreed was the final, missing piece of the New Direction. In a few days, Haakon announced, he would build into the database a system of petitions and ballots whereby anyone could put to popular vote any social scheme requiring wizardly powers for its implementation, with the results of the vote to be binding on the wizards. 
<P>
AT LAST and for good, the awkward gap between the will of the players and the efficacy of the technicians would be closed. And though some anarchists grumbled about the irony of Haakons dictatorially imposing universal suffrage on an unconsulted populace, in general the citizens of LambdaMOO seemed to find it hard to fault a system more purely democratic than any that could exist in real life. Eight months and 11 ballot measures later, widespread participation in the new regime has produced a small arsenal of mechanisms for dealing with the types of violence that called the system into being. 
<P>
Yet the continued dependence on death as the ultimate keeper of the peace suggests that this new MOO order may not be built on the most solid of foundations. For if life on LambdaMOO began to acquire more coherence in the wake of the toading, death retained all the fuzziness of pre-Bungle days. 
<P>
This truth was rather dramatically borne out, not too many days after Bungle departed, by the arrival of a strange new character named Dr Jest. There was a forceful eccentricity to the newcomers manner, but the oddest thing about his style was its striking yet unnameable familiarity. And when he developed the annoying habit of stuffing fellow players into a jar containing a tiny simulacrum of a certain deceased rapist, the source of this familiarity became obvious: Mr Bungle had risen from the grave. In itself, Bungles reincarnation as Dr Jest was a remarkable turn of events, but even more remarkable was the utter lack of amazement with which the LambdaMOO public took note of it. To be sure, many residents were appalled by the brazenness of Bungles return. In fact, one of the first petitions circulated under the new voting system was a request for Dr Jests toading that almost immediately gathered 52 signatures (but has failed so far to reach ballot status). 
<P>
Yet few were unaware of the ease with which the toad proscription could be circumvented: all the person who had been toaded had to do was go to the minor hassle of acquiring a new Internet account, and LambdaMOOs character registration program would treat the known felon as a new and innocent person. 
<P>
I, too, was undergoing a transformation in the aftermath of that night in evangelines. As I pursued my runaway fascination with the discussion I had heard there, as I pored over the * social debate and got to know legba and some of the other victims and witnesses, I could feel my newbie consciousness falling away from me. 
<P>
Where before Id found it hard to take virtual rape seriously, I now was finding it difficult to remember how I could ever not have taken it seriously. I was proud to have arrived at this perspective - it felt like an exotic sort of achievement, and it definitely made my ongoing experience of the MOO a richer one. 
<P>
But it was also having some unsettling effects on the way I looked at the rest of the world. Sometimes, for instance, it was hard for me to understand why RL society classifies RL rape alongside crimes against person or property. Since rape can occur without any physical pain or damage, I found myself reasoning, then it must be classed as a crime against the mind - more intimately and deeply hurtful, to be sure, than cross burnings, wolf whistles and virtual rape, but undeniably located on the same conceptual continuum. 
<P>
Let me assure you, though, that I am not presenting these thoughts as arguments. I offer them, rather, as a picture of the sort of mind-set that deep immersion in a virtual world has inspired in me. I offer them also, therefore, as a kind of prophecy. I have come to believe they announce the final stages of our decades-long passage into the Information Age, a paradigm shift that the classic liberal firewall between word and deed is not likely to survive intact. After all, anyone the least bit familiar with the workings of the new eras definitive technology, the computer, knows that it operates on a principle which is impracticably difficult to distinguish from the pre-Enlightenment principle of the magic word: the commands you type into a computer are a kind of speech that doesnt so much communicate as make things happen, directly and ineluctably, the same way pulling a trigger does. 
<P>
They are incantations, in other words, and anyone at all attuned to the technosocial megatrends of the moment - from the growing dependence of economies on the global flow of intensely fetishised words and numbers to the growing ability of bio-engineers to speak the spells written in the text of DNA - knows that the logic of the incantation is rapidly permeating the fabric of our lives. 
<P>
And its precisely this logic that provides the real magic in a place like LambdaMOO - the conflation of speech and act thats inevitable in any computer-mediated world, be it Lambda or the increasingly wired world at large. 
<P>
This is dangerous magic, to be sure, a potential threat to our always precarious freedoms of expression, and as someone who lives by his words I do not take the threat lightly. And yet, on the other hand, I can no longer convince myself that our wishful insulation of language from the realm of action has ever been anything but a valuable kludge, a philosophically damaged stopgap against oppression that would just have to do until something truer and more elegant came along. 
<P>
SAM THE MAN 
<P>
IF you were to log on to LambdaMOO and try to find the Australian character SamIam, you might receive the following message: The Conversation Pit. You see a bare office, with a cluttered desk facing a window and a filing cabinet against the northern wall. SamIam (asleep) is here. 
<P>
Darn. Asleep means the person whose character is SamIam has not logged on. 
<P>
When SamIam is not asleep, its because 32-year-old Colin McCormack, the real-life player behind the character, has logged on to LambdaMOO from the computer in his Sydney home. When he does, he enters a virtual house with hundreds of rooms where distance collapses and people from across the world gather to socialise and discuss books or philosophical problems. Some even have netsex. In short, they do (through words stored in a database) whatever real people do. 
<P>
McCormack has been programming computers since he was 13. For him, the interactive text-based community that he visits is a perfect medium. I live through language, he explains. Just imagine how you could express yourself if you could grab a quote from a piece of poetry, juxtapose it with a real object, a snatch of conversation, a little dance step, a discussion. MOOs are a different form of literature. 
<P>
But how did a game, or new literary medium, end with a player crying real-life tears when her character legba was raped? McCormack responds, Have you ever cried at a novel? 
<P>
So LambdaMOO is like Wuthering Heights, or any other fiction that requires a certain suspension of disbelief. But in a MOO, I could be Heathcliff in Sydney, someone in Texas could be Cathy and we, not Emily Bronte, would decide who lives, who dies and who wanders the moors. 
<P>
But McCormack admits that had Mr Bungle attacked anyone but Starsinger and legba, with whom he was very close, he might not have organised his toading. In the end he decided, Mr Bungle was a psychopath. For me, the single greatest insight was when I realised that although the characters are bits on a machine, nonetheless, the conversations and the qualities of the interactions are all real. 
<P>
For all of those who insisted Its only a game McCormack wrote a rule allowing other players to cage them so they could no longer play. Suddenly, he says rather proudly. "(those) people found it very difficult to maintain that view. - CHIP ROLLEY

 <H3 Align=center>CompuServe's own rules on marketing</H3>

How can you legitimately use CompuServe to market your business online? CompuServe's rules of operation prohibit you from posting public messages or sending unsolicited electronic-mail messages that contain any advertising or solicitation to use goods or services. (GO RULES for details.) However, you can still obey the rules and market effectively. 
<P>
Marcia Yudkin, Entrepreneur's Forum member and author of 6 Steps to Free Publicity and Dozens of Other Ways to Win Free Media Attention for You or Your Business (Plume, 1994), offers these suggestions: 
<P><ol>
<Li>Do respect the rules against solicitation, but learn how you can legitimately market online within these limits. When you respond to forum messages in your area of expertise or ask questions of your own, be sure to mention your name and business in the text of the message or at the end. H you're asked for more information about your business, including prices, it's legitimate to provide it either in a public forum message or private CompuServe Mail messagebut only if you're asked first. 
<P>
<Li>Do offer constructive and substantive information in forum messages, and you'll soon be known as the forum's expert on that topic. Other forum members are likely to refer inquiries and questions to you. 
<P>
Do develop a friendly and outgoing forum personality. Be polite and pleasant. 
<P>
<Li>Do remember there are many people in forums who are "lurking" just reading messages and not responding. You could receive private CompuServe Mail messages from some of these folks asking for information on your business. 
<P>
<Li>Do know that marketing experts say people need to hear about a name or business seven times before they feel comfortable taking action. Developing a strong forum presence is a good way to make the seventh time arrive sooner. 
<P>
<Li>Do create a useful information file based on your area of expertise that you upload to a pertinent forum library. Such files give you an opportunity to demonstrate your experience or special approach to a subject. 
<P>
<Li>Don't blatantly solicit or advertise in a forum message. 
<P>
<Li>Don't send an unsolicited advertisement through CompuServe Mail. 
<P>
<Li>Don't use library files for advertising. However, you are permitted to mention in a library file contact information or pricebut not both. 
<P></ol>
<Hr>
<H3>Advertise</H3> 
<P>
The most direct way to promote your business is by advertising. CompuServe Classifieds is the only place on CompuServe where you can legitimately advertise, since the Information Service's rules of operation prohibit posting forum messages that contain advertising or sending unsolicited electronic mail that advertises goods or services. 
<P>
Like Bhasin, other small business owners have found CompuServe Classifieds is effective, and the response can easily be measured. Mike Holman Sr. is an authorised discount reseller of software, including Novell networking products, WordPerfect, Lotus spreadsheets, and more, and his primary advertising vehicle for Holman's World is CompuServe Classifieds. "This is by far one of the best marketing tools," he says, noting he typically receives three inquiries daily from his ad. He thinks CompuServe Classifieds is so effective because of the way it's organised, making it easy for potential customers to find his ad. (See "Using CompuServe Classifieds," on p. 32.) 
<P>
"CompuServe Classifieds is ideal for product-oriented businesses," says Laura Clampitt Douglas, co-author with Paul and Sarah Edwards of Getting Businesses.s to Come to You (Tarcher 1991) and a section leader in the Working From Home Forum. "Offer samples or a free trial, and be sure to mention guarantees. When writing your ad, use power action words that arouse readers to respond right away." 
<P>
<H3>Strut Your Stuff</H3>
<P>
"One of the most successful ways to develop credibility and get business is to demonstrate what you can do," says Douglas. The best way to do this is in the forums. For instance, if you're a caterer. offer party tips 
<P>
in Cooks Online; if you're a speech writer, post your words of wisdom in the Issues Forum; if you're a computer consultant, offer advice to those in need. "Use examples from your business to illustrate points and demonstrate your expertise," advises Douglas. 
<P>
Katie Lachance of Clearwater, Florida, is a scopist, someone who uses specialised software to edit a court reporter's notes. Along with CompuServe member Maureen Robinson, Lachance is co-owner of Legal Services Institute, a comprehensive scopist training course offered primarily in 
<P>
cyberspace. Lachance has become an active participant in the Court Reporters Forum, participating in discussions on a variety of topics. She's become particularly expert at helping other court reporters with computer and software problems. In her messages, Lachance identifies herself and her business, which not only adds credibility to the information she is providing but also promotes her company. 
<P>
"I demonstrate my expertise by sharing information," says Lachance. She and Robinson, along with scopist Diane Koriath, offered a special Court Reporters Forum-based training course on e-mail file exchange in January, teaching other scopists how to compress files and exchange them via CompuServe Mail. 
<P>
Lachance advises others to change their concept of marketing. "You need to learn to demonstrate your skills in a written format without direct solicitation," she says. "By being active in forums we get to know our potential clients and they get to know us." 
<P>
<H3>Share Your Knowledge</H3>
<P>
You can also promote your expertise through library files, 
<P>
CC sharing your knowledge on a specific subject through an informative text file you write and posting it in a related forum. Solberg says files that offer bulleted points are often the easiest both to create and to read online. For instance, if you're a graphic artist, write an article on 10 ways to use graphic elements to establish or enhance corporate image. Samples can even be appended to the file in GIF format. 
<P>
Travel consultant Mireille Petit, owner of Petit Travel Consultants, has done this in the Travel Forum. Through her business Petit primarily assists those who want to travel independently in Europe. In addition to booking all travel arrangements, she sells 
<P>
 
<P>
European rail passes. Operating from her home in Worcester. Massachusetts. Petit helps promote her business by sharing her in-depth knowledge on European travel. For instance there are various types of European rail passes. all offering different features and selling for widely different prices. She has cut through the complexity . offering two informative files in Travel Forum librariesa comprehensive listing of European rail passes that can be purchased in the United States. as well as tips on European car rental, including the kind of car to rent, costs, insurance, safety, and more. She subtly promotes her business by indicating in the text that she is a travel agent and signs the articles with her name and CompuServe User ID. 
<P>
Petit believes these two library files have had a positive impact on her business. although she admits it's impossible to measure. 'The files are a good way to call attention to my business." she says. and insists the most professional and effective way to market online is by helpfully answering others' questions and not making wild. unfounded claims about your own expertise. 
<P>
<H3>Expose Your Cyber-Business</H3> 
<P>
Often, meeting just one or two key individuals in your industry or the media via the information superhighway can be a powerful marketing tool. 
<P>
Donna and Mike DeVaudreuil, co-owners of T-Shirts Online. an electronic bulletin 
<P>
board-based T-shirt shop in Freeport, Maine, watched their cyber-business take off due to  their online accessibility. Customers log onto         the T-Shirts Online BBS, upload a graphic , complete an automated order form, and  pay by credit card; the DeVaudreuils create a custom  T-shirt that is shipped within a few days of the order . Most  of the T-shirts they create are original graphics, and kids' artwork is especially popular. Their business expanded when Jaclyn Easton, host of the Los Angeles, California, radio show Log On LA, saw a magazine ad for T-Shirts Online. Since the company's CompuServe Mail address was published in the ad, Easton e-mailed the DeVaudreuils, ordered a T-shirt with the show's logo, and then interviewed the couple on her radio show. Easton spread the word further by alerting CompuServe member and syndicated computer columnist Lawrence Magid, who also ordered a T-shirt and then wrote a column about the business. "All this exposure helped our business get off the ground," say the DeVaudreuils, who are members of the Entrepreneur's Forum.

 <H3> Continue Contact</H3>
 Holman, the discount software reseller, views customer support as a critical part of his marketing effort, because he knows that satisfied customers return. CompuServe Mail is how he offers such support. Because 
<P>
he competes with large chains and superstores, Holman tries to offer a level of  customer support his competition doesn't. Customers are encouraged to e-mail Holman with questions on everything from installation to power features. Depending on the complexity of the question and Holman's own knowledge of the product, he may simply 
refer the individual to the appropriate support forum on CompuServe. But many times he visits the forum himself, tracks down the answer, and writes a personalised response to his customer. 'This way they get the product and the service support," he says. 
<P>
Holman has found that more than wanting the software or the discountboth of which are available many other placeshis customers want the individual brand of support he has come to provide. And he says the only way he can offer this support is through CompuServe. Not only is Holman accessible to his customers through CompuServe Mail, but the information he needs to give them is also accessible to him through various software support forums. 
<P>
"Marketing electronically can be a valuable tool and should figure prominently in a comprehensive marketing campaign," says Douglas. "But always remember your success in business depends not on what you market or sell but rather on what your customers buy."

<TITLE>Internet Futures</TITLE>

This is a somewhat radical article I discovered, suitable as a seed for conversation over a moderately adequate red.

<H2>One billion users on Internet by 2000 "conservative estimate".</H2>

 THE founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology media laboratory, Professor Nicholas Negroponte, says his prediction that there would be I billion users on the Internet by 2000 is likely to prove too conservative."I believe there will be more on the net by then than are watching network television," he told an industry conference in San Francisco."On the Richter Scale of change what we have is a 10.5. It is way beyond most people's understanding," he said at the Networked MultiMedia conference.The Internet was a system without borders and the biggest loser would be the nation State which "might evaporate within several years".
<P>
Professor Negroponte said the average age of users on the net was 23."The digital homeless are the very educated, the very affluent who still read books and are 30 years old or older. They arrived on the planet too soon," he said.What we were now seeing was not the traditional economic division between the rich and the poor, but a generational divide.Professor Negroponte described the existing media world as based on a centralist model pushing information outwards."The networks, however, are anything but this," he said. "And people don't want to know about it."Lawyers, economists and politicians were not just falling behind, they were "clueless" in the face of the massive change taking place.And while people sat around debating issues such as local content, others worldwide were surfing the net at will.
<P>
On the issue of digital cash, he said internal revenue departments would suffer from dyspepsia as electronic commerce took hold in its different forms, in some instances possibly to leading to systems of bartering.Global cottage industries would spring up and the biggest employer would be "self". "Being digital is globalising, empowering and flattening," he said.The dark side, however, was privacy."This is a very, very big issue," he said. "But in the US, our government has don everything to slow down encryption and security which we've treated as if they were nuclear weapons and should not be exported."

<P>Besides their obvious value as producers of timber and food and as sanctuaries
for wildlife, forests play a crucial role as protectors of fragile mountain
soils, controllers of rivers, and places of comfort and recreation for
humans. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Water and Wind Control</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>When land is bare, it is subject to erosion by wind and water. When
it is covered with plants, however, it is protected against erosion. </P>

<P>The canopy of trees slows the wind, lessens its severity, and becalms
the forest. It also slows the fall of raindrops. The leaves on the forest
floor and the root systems of the trees slow the movement of rainfall so
that the water soaks into the ground rather than running off. Trees also
intercept wind-driven snow, which piles up and melts slowly in the spring.
</P>

<P>Forest managers can increase water flow for various reasons (to fill
a lake, for example) by harvesting trees in the watershed. The watershed
consists of all the highland areas with sources of the water such as snow
melt and small streams. If flooding is a problem on bare ground areas,
planting trees can be part of the solution. If the water table, the level
of underground water, is too high, planting water-tolerant trees can help
to use up more water and lower the water table. Many cities own and manage
large forest tracts to protect their water supplies. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Recreational Value</B> </FONT></P>

<P>Just as people have used the forest as a resource for products, they
have also turned to it for recreation and inspiration. Hunting, hiking,
fishing, and camping are among the more popular recreational uses of the
forest. Much of the recreation takes place along the forest edge where
people can stroll or picnic without too much inconvenience. Campers often
prefer open, parklike forest settings. </P>

<P>Since the early 1970s interest in outdoor recreation has grown, especially
in those activities that take the participant far off the beaten path.
Wilderness hiking and primitive camping are two examples. This interest
has resulted in the establishment of many wilderness areas in national
forests and parks. </P>

<P>When forestry was in its infancy, it was a career for hardy men who
loved the outdoors. Most of the foresters worked for the government and
spent their time protecting the forests against fires and illegal woodcutters.
</P>

<P>In recent years foresters have become much more professional. Now a
man or woman who wants to practice forestry is expected to have a college
degree in forest sciences. Many professional foresters work for the government,
but their work is different from that of their predecessors. Professional
foresters are usually called on to be forest managers, directing other
people in the tree planting, tree improvement, and protection activities
they prescribe. </P>

<P>The United States Forest Service is a major employer of foresters. State
agencies, forest industries, and teaching in colleges or technical schools
are other career fields. Individuals who prefer to be self-employed may
become consultant foresters, selling their services to companies and private
landowners. </P>

<P>Many foresters find careers in research, working in such areas as tree
improvement or insect control. Some researchers work for government agencies,
but industry also employs forest scientists. People with less formal training
may still find careers as forest rangers, protecting the forests, or in
related activities such as harvesting and tree planting. </P>

<P>The forest types largely determine what plant and animal life will be
found in the area. The amount and types of food, water, climate, and shelter
will favor some life forms and discourage others. Within a given forest,
human activity can also have a great influence on the plant and animal
populations. </P>

<P>Many animals, especially the browsers like deer and elk use the forest
for shelter. They spend much of their time along the forest edge, eating
grasses and brush, but they retreat to the woods for safety. Other animals,
such as bears, can find the nuts and smaller animals that they feed on
deeper in the woods, though they also enjoy the berries and roots they
find along the forest edge and in clearings. </P>

<P>Squirrels prefer hardwood forests with lots of acorns and nuts, though
they eat pine seeds as well. Beavers eat the soft inner bark of trees and
use the trees for their lodges and dams. Seed-eating birds are more likely
to nest along the forest edge. </P>

<P>Insects also have very specialized habitat requirements. The southern
pine beetle, for example, feeds on only pines and their relatives. Others,
like the gypsy moth, feed on many kinds of hardwood trees. </P>

<P>Often the health of the entire community depends on the vigor of the
forest. And, as a forest changes with age or as a result of fire, insects,
diseases, or human activity, it is likely to become favorable to an entirely
new set of plants and animals. </P>

<P>The most modern aspects of the science of forestry are collectively
called forest management. These aspects of forestry involve much more than
just using the trees nature provides. Forest management is concerned with
the complete life cycle of the trees and the forest, from getting trees
off to a better start to making sure trees are harvested in a way that
protects the future of the forest. </P>

<P>Forest management usually involves doing the same sorts of things nature
does, but in a more planned and organized fashion. Nature plants trees,
thins forest stands, and kills trees, but nature's efforts sometimes seem
haphazard. Forest managers do these same things with a plan that benefits
the forest stand and people, too. Nature lets trees burn or rot. Forest
managers prefer to use the wood. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Natural Forest Cycle</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>When a mature hardwood forest is harvested or killed by nature, it is
not long before a new forest takes its place. There are seeds in the ground
already, dropped there by the trees of the past. There are usually young
trees on the ground unless the stand was killed by fire or some other general
catastrophe. </P>

<P>When nature renews a forest, it is often quite different from the original
forest. A mature stand in the Central Hardwood Forest, for example, is
usually composed of oaks and hickories and other species referred to as
climax types. They are species that grow well in bright sunlight or in
partial shade. They have long life spans and compete well for the moisture
and the space available. </P>

<P>When these trees are removed or destroyed, however, other trees have
a chance to get started. Seeds from pines or other trees in the vicinity
blow onto the ground. Sometimes seeds sprout after being in the ground
for many years. The new forest is composed mostly of trees referred to
as early succession species. Usually some seeds of the climax types also
survive. And some trees resprout from the root systems of trees that have
been killed. But it is only after many years that the climax types will
dominate the forest once again. This same succession takes place when farms
and pastures are allowed to lie idle, allowing forests to develop. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Renewing the Forest</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Foresters and landowners often plant seeds or seedlings of a particular
kind of tree. The seedlings are usually grown in large nurseries, much
as ornamental plants are grown for landscaping, and transplanted when they
are older and better able to survive. </P>

<P>When companies first began to replant harvested forests, all of the
planting was done by hand. Since the 1940s more and more trees have been
planted by machine. The tree planter is pulled by a tractor. A plowlike
blade opens a furrow, an opening in the ground, so a worker can plant a
seedling. Packing wheels on the planter then close the furrow around the
tiny tree. A crew with a tree planter can plant thousands of seedlings
in one day. </P>

<P>In forests where the ground is too rough to allow the use of such machines,
planting is still done by hand. Sometimes seeds are spread over the ground
by airplane or helicopter. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Harvesting the Forest</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>History records many instances of harmful harvesting of the forests,
often to provide food or fuel. The once mighty forests of cedar in Lebanon
are no more. Vast forests in China were destroyed during and after World
War II. Rain forests in the Amazon Basin are today being cleared for croplands.
</P>

<P>Forests have been devastated whenever people needed open land for farming.
Most of the east coast of North America was once covered with dense forests.
The new settlers cut the trees, used what wood they needed, and burned
the rest. </P>

<P>Individuals and companies have learned to practice better harvesting
techniques. The long-accepted practice of cutting only a few trees at a
time from a particular stand is being challenged by foresters. They point
out that the practice almost always resulted in taking the best trees and
leaving inferior specimens to take over the forest. They prescribe following
nature's approach of harvesting all the trees in an area at one time and
encouraging seeds from the best trees available to reforest the land. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Improving the Forest</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Over many years nature improves forests by removing inferior trees,
an example of natural selection through the survival of the fittest. But
many natural events and human activities affect this process. Fires, floods,
wind and ice storms, and harvesting practices all affect the growth of
the forest. In general it is fair to say that nature's events generally
improve the forests over the years and the activities of human beings in
the past have harmed them. </P>

<P>Recently, through forest management, human beings have begun to do less
harm, perhaps even help forests. In controlling the composition of the
stand by planting species they prefer, human beings can improve the quality
of the trees they plant. Much has been learned about the development of
genetically improved strains of corn, wheat, and other food crops. This
improvement can be accomplished quickly because these crops produce a new
generation each year. Progress is slower with trees because they often
take many years to produce seed. </P>

<P>When forest managers think of improving trees, they want trees with
long, straight trunks that can be sawed into lumber or peeled for plywood
more economically. They want trees with small crowns, or tops, so more
trees can get sunlight and grow on each acre. They want trees that are
insect and disease resistant so their chances of maturing are better. And
they want trees that will grow to commercial size as rapidly as possible.
</P>

<P>Forest scientists have accomplished all these goals with pines and with
some hardwood species such as sycamore, cottonwood, and yellow poplar.
They have even learned to clone a superior tree, a process that produces
more trees exactly like it. This is done in the laboratory by forcing tiny
cuttings from the tree to develop roots and leaves. </P>

<P>The most commonly used method of tree improvement involves first locating
superior specimens of the species. Branches are collected from their crowns,
often by shooting them off with guns. </P>

<P>The branches are grafted, or joined, onto rootstocks in special nurseries
where they grow until they are old enough to bear seed. A great advantage
of this method is that tree branches that come from mature trees bear seed
much sooner than do trees that are grown from seed. The flowers on the
selected branches are carefully pollinated with pollen from other superior
trees. Thousands of combinations of pollen trees and branch trees are tested.
The resulting seed is then planted. Many of the trees that grow from the
seed have all the bad characteristics of their parents. But some have all
the good characteristics. Forest scientists try to produce and plant as
many seeds having the good combinations as they can. </P>

<P>An example of what can be achieved is that improved species of pines
produce much more usable wood in the same time as ordinary wild trees produce
relatively little. Such improvements mean that more wood can be grown on
less land in a shorter time. As the world population grows and requires
more land for homesites and food production, this ability to maximize wood
production on each acre will be vital to future generations.<BR>

<P>Once the forest is started, protection is a major concern for forest
managers. Fire is one of the most dramatic enemies, especially for hardwood
species. But insects and diseases, while not so obvious as fire, destroy
far more trees each year than are lost to fire and other natural disasters.
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Insect and Disease Problems</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Insect pests such as the gypsy moth, spruce budworm, southern pine beetle,
and Douglas fir tussock moth destroy thousands of trees each year. In the
1930s the American chestnut, once one of the most attractive and commercially
important trees in the United States, was virtually eradicated by the chestnut
blight. The American elm has suffered much the same fate because of the
Dutch elm disease. </P>

<P>As a rule, older, slower-growing trees that have lost their vigor, and
trees that have been damaged by fire or drought, are most vulnerable to
attack by insects and disease. Often, however, insect and disease infestations
grow to epidemic proportions in weak stands and then the pests attack nearby
healthier stands. </P>

<P>Forest scientists continually search for ways to control enemies of
the productive forest. They have created many special chemicals to help
control forest pests and diseases. Much ecological research is being done
to encourage natural enemies of insect pests in order to control destructive
populations. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Control of Fire</B> </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Protection against forest fires is often a matter of education. Many
fires started by people to burn trash or leaves or dead grass get out of
control and burn forests as well. Sometimes campfires or cigarettes cause
fires. Arson is another common cause of fires in some areas. </P>

<P>Most forests are watched during the spring and fall fire seasons to
detect fires as early as possible. Fire damage can be held to a minimum
by quick action. Fire roads are cut through forests to allow firefighters
to quench blazes before they get hot enough to reach the tops of trees.
Ground fires may damage hardwood trees, but they rarely do severe damage
to mature pines. Crown fires, on the other hand, kill all trees. </P>

<P>Lightning is still a common cause of fires. If these fires are in remote
areas, they can damage large parts of a forest before they are discovered
and controlled. Firefighters sometimes have to be flown to the fire in
helicopters. Sometimes firefighters called smoke jumpers parachute into
battle against forest fires. </P>

<P>Once a stand has been damaged or killed by fire, useable wood is removed
quickly to prevent the buildup of destructive insect populations and to
prepare for the reforestation of the area. As destructive as fire can be,
foresters have learned to set fires that imitate nature to benefit the
forest. Fires set by lightning destroy climax forests and allow a new succession
of tree species, starting with softwoods, to begin. Natural fires also
serve to reduce competition in softwood forests. Forest managers sometimes
use controlled fire to control unwanted hardwood growth in pine stands.
This leaves more moisture and nutrients for the pines. It also reduces
the ground litter of leaves and branches that might fuel a hotter fire,
and it exposes the soil, allowing grasses and brush to grow and feed wildlife.

<P>In many parts of the world forestland is regulated by government agencies
as a national resource. Some famous forests, like the Black Forest in Germany,
are very thoroughly managed. </P>

<P>In the United States a large part of the forestland belongs to the federal
government. Most of this is managed by the Forest Service, a branch of
the Department of Agriculture, to perpetuate the forest and provide all
the benefits of timber supply, wildlife management, watershed management,
and recreation. The Forest Service protects the trees from natural enemies
and manages their harvests. </P>

<P>Many state governments own forests. These are managed by forestry agencies
that also help private landowners develop the forests on their lands. </P>

<P>Forest industry companies practice good forest management and encourage
their neighbors to do the same. In the United States the industry established
the American Tree Farm System in 1941 to do just that. Company and state
foresters seek landowners doing a good job of planning, protecting, and
harvesting their forests and certify them as members of the system. The
foresters also work with people who want to improve their management, helping
them with tree planting and fire and insect control. </P>

<P>These three groups of landowners, working in harmony and taking advantage
of modern forestry developments, assure that the forests of the United
States continue to provide wood products and all the other benefits of
well-managed stands. Similar groups are active in many of the developed
countries. </P>

<CENTER><P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P></CENTER>

<P>Forests are found in almost every part of the world. Only the north
and south poles, the tops of some mountains, the deserts, and some prairies
are bare of forests. Forests can be grouped by location, climate, or the
types of trees common to them. Forests can also be described in terms of
the uses made of them. Commercial forests, for example, are lands used
for growing successive crops of trees for products. Wilderness preserves,
on the other hand, are areas where no harvesting is allowed. </P>

<P>Trees in the forest are of two basic kinds. Hardwoods have broad leaves
and bear their seeds in dry clusters or in fruits; examples are oak, maple,
hickory, and apple. Most of the North American hardwoods are deciduous,
which means they lose their leaves each fall. Softwoods have needle-shaped
leaves and bear their seeds in cones, for which reason they are often called
conifers; examples are pine, spruce, fir, and larch. Most softwoods are
evergreen, which means they lose only some of their needles each year,
and so remain green year-round. This description can be misleading, however,
because several hardwoods, including the American holly and the magnolia,
are also evergreen. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hardwood Forests</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>One major type of hardwood forest is the steamy, tropical rain forest
that grows in the tropics and subtropics. These forests are typically composed
of big, old evergreen hardwood trees that grow in several layers, or groups
according to height. The tallest layer may reach heights of 150 feet (45
meters) or more. Other layers, composed of shade-tolerant trees, reach
to about 100 feet (30 meters). Smaller trees and vines cover the ground
in the shade in a dense tropical rain forest. These forests are often called
jungles, though true jungles are dense thickets of brush and vines that
may not have any tall trees. </P>

<P>One of the largest and most important tropical rain forests is in South
America. It extends from the mouth of the Amazon River, in Brazil, to the
mouth of the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, and covers millions of acres.
Another great rain forest girdles the waist of Africa, and much of Southeast
Asia is covered with rain forests. In the United States, only the southern
tip of Florida and a bit of the coast of Texas have tropical forests. </P>

<P>Beautiful woods such as rosewood, mahogany, ebony, and teak are commercially
important products of these forests. They are prized for fine furniture,
cabinetry, and artistic uses. </P>

<P>Hardwood forests other than tropical ones cover much of the United States,
most of Northern Europe, areas of northern Russia, eastern China, and the
east coast of Australia. These forests include broad-leaved trees adapted
to higher elevations with more moderate climates. </P>

<P>The largest forest area in the United States is the Central Hardwood
Forest. It covers about 130 million acres (52.6 million hectares), from
the edge of the central plains, across the lower edge of the Great Lakes
states, to the coasts of New Jersey and New York. It straddles the Appalachian
Mountains as far south as northern Georgia and spreads westward and covers
large parts of eastern Texas. Because this area is blessed with rich soil
and a moderate climate, it has been cleared in many places for farming.
</P>

<P>Much of the wood for America's furniture industry comes from this forest.
Hardwoods such as black walnut, red oak, white oak, yellow poplar (also
called tulip tree), sweet gum, and sycamore are among the most valuable
trees. A few softwoods are also found, including the shortleaf and white
pines. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Softwood Forests</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The Northern Forest covers much of the Great Lakes states and the New
England states in the United States. It also extends along the ridges of
the Appalachian Mountains as far south as northern Georgia. This forest
also covers much of Canada and the interior of Alaska and stretches across
northern Asia, Russia, and the Scandinavian countries. </P>

<P>The Northern Forest is composed of softwood trees such as white pine,
hemlock, and red spruce. Several hardwood trees, such as oak, maple, birch,
and basswood, are also present. Trees in this forest tend to be smaller
and more slow-growing than those in warmer areas with longer growing seasons.
</P>

<P>The softwood forests of the southeastern United States are sources of
lumber, plywood, and paper pulp. The more important southern, or yellow,
pines are the loblolly, longleaf, shortleaf, and slash. The bald cypress
grows in southern swamps. </P>

<P>Hardwoods such as the red oak, white oak, hickory, gum, ash, pecan,
and live oak are found along southern rivers. They are a significant part
of the forest economy in the South. </P>

<P>Another important forest region in the United States is the softwood
forest of the Rocky Mountains. There are almost 90 million acres (36.4
million hectares) of lumber-producing commercial forests. Ponderosa pine,
Idaho white pine, Douglas fir, Englemann spruce, larch, lodgepole pine,
and western red cedar are among the important softwoods. </P>

<P>The rainy climate of the Pacific Northwest contributes to the growth
of one of the United States' most productive softwood forest areas. It
extends in a narrow band from the southern part of Alaska to central California.
Inland, on the western slopes of the Coast Range, it extends somewhat farther
south. These forests contain Douglas fir, California redwood, western hemlock,
western red cedar, sugar pine, lodgepole pine, and white fir. Most of America's
old-growth forests, stands which have not been harvested by humans or nature
for hundreds of years, are in this region. </P>

			The Great Barrier Reef region embraces that section of the continental shelf of eastern Queensland which lies between the mainland coast and the hundred-fathom line to the north of Fraser Island. The northern limit is usually placed at Bramble Cay, just south of Papua New Guinea. The western boundary in Torres Strait lies between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. On a whole, the region occupies an area of about 250,000 square kilometres. To the north the shelf is bounded by Papua New Guinea and by the deep l'aPan Trough. To the east in the northern part of this region the continental shelf drops steeply to the Queensland Trough, which is over two thousand metres in depth. In the central part the extensive (approximately 177,400 square kilometres) Coral Sea Platform, much of which is less than a thousand metres in depth, lies almost immediately to the east of the shelf. This platform also carries reefs but has a different geological history from the Great Barrier Reef reregion. In the south a tongue of deep water, the Capricom Channel, intrudes into the region. The shelf is narrowest (about 36 kilometres wide) off Cape Melville. Both to the north and to the south of this point its eastern boundary diverges seaward from the Queensland coastline, attaining a maximum width in the north of about 350 kilometres in the Torres Strait regioll, and a maximum width in the south of about 412 kilometres near Broad Sound . The mean depth of the shelf increases proressively from north to south. North of latitude 16S the shelf is generally less than 40 metres deep. Between latitudes 16S and 20S, depths usually range from about 40 to 70 metres. South of Iatitude 20S, depths on the shelf usually range from about 60 to 130 metres .

Coral reefs have had a long evolutionary history. Calcareous structures formed by 
living organisms and which could be termed reefs egan to appear in the earth's tropical seas at least two billion (2,000 million) years ago. However, the calcareous deposits formed, called tromatolites, were the work of plants known as blue-green algae.- It was not until the Cambrian period, some 600 million years ago, that animals became associated with the algae. These primitive animals .esembled sponges and were called archaeocyathids. After 60 million years they became extinct. Then, some 480 million years ago, two ther groups of animals, the bryozoans and the first corals (the tabulate corals) became associated with algae on reefs in a major way. tromatolites persisted on these reefs, but other calcareous algae, began to flourish there about the same time as the abulate corals. The latter were later joined by another group of primiive corals called ruxos orals. These coral reef communities persisted or about 100 million years, then they suffered a catastrophic collapse. uring the next 100 million years, tabulate and rugose corals played minor role as reef builders and, indeed, they became extinct about 15 million years ago.

About 200 million years ago the first representatives of the modern group of corals, the slratinian orals, appeared and became associated ith coralline algae on reefs. They flourished for the next 130 million years, and at one stage the group contained more genera than it does day. Other animals became associated with them on reefs; somemes, as was the case with a group of molluscs called rudists, they layed a greater part in reef formation than the corals. Then about 70 million years ago coral reefs disappeared abruptly from the fossil cord for a period of about 20 million years. Subsequently coral reefs gradually reappeared and coral reef communities similar to those existing today were formed. The dominant features of these communities was the association between scleractinian corals and coralline algae, a feature that has persisted to the present day.

<H2><TT>Crossing Antarctica: The Historical Context</TT></H2>

<b>

In January 1914, two years after the death of Captain Scott, 

Sir Ernest Shackleton made the first attempt to cross Antarctica. 

Shackleton never began his march.  Nearing Antarctica his ship 

Endurance was caught and crushed by pack ice. Thus began the 

epic tale of survival that culminated with his remarkable 

navigation of the tiny rowing boat, the James Caird, across 

the Southern Ocean to South Georgia.

<P>

Antarctica was not crossed until 1958 when Sir Vivian Fuchs 

completed the most arduous journey the world has ever known. 

Fuchs nine man party covered 2200 miles, in 99 days, setting 

off with 20 tons of supplies pulled by six tracked vehicles - 

three Snocats, two Weasels and a Muskeg. En route to the South 

Pole they were re-supplied from the air with provisions and 

spare parts. At the Pole they were met by Sir Edmund Hillary 

who, coming from the opposite side of the continent, had laid 

depots for the last stage of their journey.

<H3>ANTARCTIC WILDLIFE AS SEEN FROM A POLAR ICEBREAKER</H3>
<P>
For many people, the first thoughts of Antarctica are of a barren wasteland.  Antarctica is one of the harshest environments on earth to human beings but it is not barren, and to the animals that live here it is no wasteland.  While the South Polar regions can be dominated by cold winds, freezing seas, and perpetual winter darkness, the long days of summer and  nutrient rich cold waters create a system of biological productivity unmatched anywhere in the world.  The diatom, a type of algae, is at the bottom of the food chain and is consumed by krill, the keystone species of the Southern Ocean food chain.  Krill are described as "keystone" because they are the direct food source for the majority of life in the Antarctic and by tonnage are the most common animal on the earth.  Krill are small shrimp like crustaceans ranging in size from about  .5" to 3"   (1 to 5 cm) .  All life in the Antarctic is dependent on krill, from the few species of cold tolerant fish to the blue whale, the largest animal on earth.  
<P>
POLAR STAR usually crosses into the Southern Ocean after a stop in Hobart, Australia  to pick up the last of the supplies and scientific gear necessary for a deployment to the Antarctic.  After the relative calm of Hobart and the South Pacific, POLAR STAR enters the "screaming 50's", a geographic region of the world characterized by its high winds and large seas.  The westward moving storms that typically develop in this band of latitude are unimpeded by land  and often develop hurricane strength winds. Even in this tempestuous part of the world life abounds.  The wandering albatross frequently crosses the ship's path.  This great bird, according to lore, brings good luck to sailors and with a wing span of up 11 feet (3.3m) , it's seemingly effortless flight  is a sharp comparison to the ship's struggle through the high winds and heavy seas.    There are many other seabird visitors to the ship during this portion of our voyage.  The  sheerwaters, petrels, fulmars, and albatross are very common in this region.  These expert flyers depend on the wind to maintain their flight and will  usually disappear as the wind and waves die. 
<P>  
<Img Src="http://www.polarstar.org/grafix/penguin1.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>   Usually the ship starts running into the loose drift ice around 63 - 64 degrees South latitude.  The waves and wind  decrease and the types of animals we see changes as well.   While there are several types of penguins in the Antarctic region,  the majority seen on Deep Freeze missions are the Adelie penguins (up to 28" tall) and the Emperor penguins (up to 40" tall) .  The Adelie penguins breed and raise their  young  along the Antarctic shore in huge colonies.  The Emperor penguin is a year round resident of Antarctica and actually raises it's young during the cold, dark Antarctic winter.   Penguins are preyed upon by the leopard seal and Killer whale and in turn depend on krill and squid  for their food.  They are unafraid of humans and at times will come right up to people if encountered on the ice.  However, they tend to shy away from the huge, red icebreaker when it is moving.  The crabeater seal, the most numerous marine mammal in the world, is very fond of resting on the ice floes that the ship transits near.  Occasionally a leopard seal is also seen.  The leopard seal is an aggressive predator characterized by a large delta shaped head and if they were to open their mouths, their sharp teeth.  Some leopard seal jaws have been measured at nine inches (23cm) across.  They have a penchant for eating penguins and occasionally other seal's young.
<P>
<Img Src="http://www.polarstar.org/grafix/seal1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Weddell seals are very common around and on the fast ice.  In order to access the water through the thick ice, these seals keep breathing holes open  year round by constantly chewing away any new ice that develops.  Often several seals will share the same 3 foot diameter hole.  These animals are mostly oblivious to humans and seem to just want some quality nap time while hauled out on the ice.  The weddell, crabeater, and leopard seals are all true seals.  True seals lack the large fore flippers that sea lions have, have no external ears and depend on their hind flippers for propulsion in the water.  True seals are very awkward on land in comparison to sea lions and fur seals.  
<P>
POLAR STAR often grants "ice liberty" to it's crew when operations permit.  This usually occurs when the ship is hove-to (stopped) in fast ice any number of reasons.  Fast ice is a solid sheet of ice that is attached to the shore.  Ice football games, cross country skiing, photography, and wildlife watching are some common crew activities during ice liberty.  Often these planned activities are interrupted by curious groups of Adelie penguins walking through.   Once the ship is hove to and the propellers are no longer turning, the Adelie penguins, Minke whales, and sometimes Orcas (Killer Whales) take advantage of the open water behind the ship to prey upon the krill under the ice.  Orcas of course try to prey on the penguins and seals.  They use the open water as a huge breathing hole before making deeper forays under the ice for food.
<P>
Minke whales are very common in the Antarctic.  Minkes are a rorqual whale, other rorquals are the fast moving Blue whales, Fin whales, and  Sei whales.  The rorquals  feed on  krill by filtering them from the water with their baleen.   Baleen is plate like sieves that the rorquals and other filter feeding whales have instead of teeth.  The Minkes are the smallest of the rorquals at about 25 - 30 feet (7 -  9m) and because of their small size were one of the last whale species targeted by commercial whaling.  Their population has probably actually increased  because of the decline of the larger whales from hunting.   The Orcas are toothed whales and are of the same family as the common dolphin.   They are highly social animals and are known for their strong social bonds as well as their intelligence.  The ship has probably seen the same group of 15 - 20 Orcas in the McMurdo/Ross Sea area for the last two years.  Scientists can use the distinctive marks and shapes of the whales dorsal fin for identification of individuals from one year to the next.  This pod of Orcas has probably been summer residents of the Ross Sea/McMurdo Sound waters for many years.   
<P>
The Southern Ocean and coastal regions of Antarctica  are anything but  barren.    The number of different species is small but the number of individuals of each species is large, with the exception of the large baleen whales whose population was decimated by whaling.  The food chain is a relatively simple one, beginning with the diatoms, then the krill, then the krill eaters, (penguins, crabeater seals,  Minke whales, Humpback whales, Blue whales, Fin Whales, Sei whales, Right Whales) and finally those that eat the krill eaters (Leopard seals, Killer whales) .  There are also squid present in the food chain.  The squid  feed on the krill and are in turn fed upon by some seals, emperor penguins, and the Sperm whale.
<P>
POLAR STAR commonly encounters the following types of animals on a Deep Freeze:
<P>
Birds:  Skua, Antarctic Petrels, Snow Petrels, Sheerwaters, Albatross, Adelie penguins, Fulmars, and Emperor Penguins.
<P>
Whales:  Killer whales and  Minke whales, mainly.  A Blue whale was sighted once in open water along with occasional glimpses of the Fin and Sei whales.
<P>
Seals:  Crabeater, Leopard, and Weddell seals are commonly seen.  Elephant seals and  Southern Fur Seals are infrequently seen.
<P>
There are several species of fish which thrive in the Antarctic waters and numerous limpets, amphipods, anemones, sponges, jellyfish, and the krill.
